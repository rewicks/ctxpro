Good night.<eos> Sure.<eos> Good night. Good night.<eos> Brooks vs. Scoville illustrates the distinctions... between the general demerit and the special demerit.<eos> That is, a general statement... that a complaint is insufficient... and a demerit which argues that the specific allegations... of a plaintiff are without foundation.<eos> I think the concept is rather clear.<eos> We always seem to hear from the same people.<eos> Would anyone who has not contributed lately... care to speak?<eos> Very well, I shall have to ferret you out.<eos> Mr. Brooks, we haven't heard from you in a long time.
He won't leave your side.<eos> - A"zabana"?<eos> - A bodyguard.<eos> If a gun is too conspicuous, a bodyguard will be like putting it on the 6:00 news.<eos> Once you leave Ethiopia, you'll be in a territory where everybody has zabanas.<eos> Even the zabanas have zabanas.<eos> Yours is named Kopo.<eos> He will join you along the way.<eos> Study this.<eos> It's a route we've laid out which should bring you into contact with the recruiters.
One of your men threw a knife.<eos> She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Then why wasn't her body still onboard ship?<eos> I promised her a boat ride.<eos> Well, she would have liked that.<eos> All right, throw out your iron.<eos> There's only one way out of here.<eos> I've wired this place for demolition.<eos> I've got 40 hostages down below.<eos> Unless you drop your gun and step out where I can see you I'll set off the charges.
- Couldn't you get anything else?<eos> Do you think it's easy to run when you're holding a banana the size of a canoe?<eos> You didn't get any dessert. There's no seasoning, no wine.<eos> I still can't believe the size of these. I'd hate to see the fertiliser.<eos> What was that? - What?<eos> - That noise.<eos> Didn't you hear anything?<eos> Are there any strange animals that I should know about here?<eos> Anything futuristic, like with the body of a crab and the head of a social worker?<eos> How do you know I won't trick you and turn you in to the hands of the police?
Are you going on the space shuttle?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I am. And he forgot his.<eos> Reagan.<eos> Bring out my hydrovac suit.<eos> Right this minute.<eos> Here's your silly old hydrovac suit.<eos> Jesus, I could hardly find it. It's such a mess in that bedroom.<eos> What am I gonna do with a hydrovac suit?<eos> If you don't want the police to recognise you, take off that robot uniform.
Hey, you there!<eos> Stop that man!<eos> Stop him!<eos> He's got my wallet!<eos> Stop that man!<eos> He's got all my money!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Goddamn nigger lover!<eos> I'll get you some day for this, sucker-egg!
This has gone far enough.<eos> Hirse, let's leave.<eos> Headache.<eos> It pounds and pounds and pounds.<eos> Do you know what's pounding in my head?<eos> I know.<eos> Lause...<eos> Please come in.<eos> Why don't you lie down?<eos> Lause will take you to your office.

"Sometimes the victim would be drowned in the sea "or burnt to death in a huge sacrificial bonfire.<eos> "Sometimes the six swordsmen ritually beheaded the virgin."<eos> Dear God in Heaven, even these people can't be that mad.<eos> "The chief priest then skinned the child,<eos> "and wearing the still-warmed skin like a mantle, "led the rejoicing crowds through the streets.<eos> "The priest thus represented the goddess reborn<eos> "and guaranteed another successful harvest next year."<eos> Good morning, Sergeant!<eos> I need to get to my plane.<eos> Oh, well, on May Day, I'd better take you out myself.
- What is it?<eos> - An ear.<eos> Look, an ear!<eos> Can I come in?<eos> - I'm closed.<eos> - Can I come in, miss?<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> One cigarette.<eos> - Can I help you?
If you keep acting up, he'll call the cops.<eos> So I'd advise you to pipe down.<eos> As for me, I can't hold your hand all day long.<eos> - Call her.<eos> - What?<eos> Call my wife.<eos> Tell her I killed myself for her.<eos> If you call her, she'll have to come.<eos> Call her, please.<eos> I'll go with her and leave you alone.
- You go home.<eos> - Leave me alone!<eos> That's right, leave her alone!<eos> I can't keep my attention focused because after... a few seconds, everything blurs and I can't see.<eos> It's not serious.<eos> Really?<eos> It's problematic for precision work, but you're a salesman...<eos> Right.<eos> I'll get you 2 amphetamines.<eos> They'll soon wake you up.
The cops will be here if they see you at the window.<eos> The people I work for are ruthless.<eos> If I don't do the job, they'll get me sooner or later.<eos> Come to Prissy.<eos> Hide out in Prissy.<eos> We have a sofa in the living room.<eos> Pinon, what have I done to you?<eos> Why do you persecute me like this?<eos> I don't want to persecute you.<eos> I want to help you.
Do you want me to lend you my cards?<eos> Sorry, I'm sure.<eos> You're as bitter as a lemon.<eos> I can't play like this. Joann, please come into my office.<eos> Now, she has class.<eos> Not like you.<eos> What do you know about women, you queer? Shall we continue or what?<eos> Here I am.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Leave your photos with me. I'll call you as soon as there's an opening.
What are you talking about?<eos> Does this seem the right time to discuss villas?<eos> Neither is it the moment to get overheated.<eos> - I'll go mad here all by myself. - I'll be back in no time.<eos> Here he is now.<eos> He'd be late for his own funeral.<eos> He's not the problem at the moment. What I'd like to know is what's happened in New York.<eos> Why haven't they called back?<eos> Where were you?<eos> I've been looking for you all day.
Right, in there.<eos> Well, Miss Grant, welcome to my humble abode.<eos> I think you were better off in prison.<eos> Oh, temporary quarters, my dear.<eos> I shall soon be changing them for something better.<eos> Oh, you'll soon be back in jail.<eos> When the truth gets out, Earth and Draconia will combine their forces to attack you.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> There's too much distrust between them.<eos> The Doctor will find you, eventually.
There's too much distrust between them.<eos> The Doctor will find you, eventually.<eos> Ah, there I agree with you.<eos> He must find me.<eos> Not only to rescue you, but also to be reunited with his beloved TARDIS.<eos> You know, Miss Grant, I'm going to set a trap for the Doctor.<eos> And you are going to help me.<eos> What?<eos> No noble speeches to the effect that you'd rather die than betray the Doctor?<eos> You know I'm not going to help you.
I'm the one who deserted.<eos> Togashi-san died nobly in battle<eos> I'm sure with his instincts, he charged the enemy brilliantly.<eos> Charge!<eos> Would you mind telling the Ministry of Welfare the story you just told me?<eos> You mean, me?<eos> Yes, I'd be grateful.<eos> But... it's not like I saw him die in combat<eos> I doubt they'd take it as proof.<eos> But you're a living witness. Nobody's going to accuse you of lying.
I'm your superior officer!<eos> Cut it out.<eos> Then, what happened?<eos> Sergeant, sir, you've...<eos> The 2nd Lieutenant...<eos> The 2nd Lt. Killed himself. Went mad when he heard of our defeat.<eos> Got that?<eos> The 2nd Lt. Killed himself.<eos> And then, Togashi-san and the other3 left for Division Headquarters.<eos> They left you to die.
Slain?<eos> Danger here?<eos> Then the conference must be cancelled.<eos> This is not a matter to trouble the delegates.<eos> Torbis, my former chancellor, died earlier tonight in mysterious circumstances.<eos> But the truth will be brought to light.<eos> Meanwhile, there is no danger to you or to your fellow delegates.<eos> I accept Your Majesty's assurances.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Lord Hepesh will take you to your fellow delegates.
And I heaped all malediction on this satyr capable of making such cruel sport of my misery.<eos> Alas, my imprecations.<eos> Instead of calling down God's wrath on that villain, only gave him further blessings.<eos> I was then received as a servant in the house of an old usurer, Monsieur Du Harpin.<eos> After having delivered a long speech upon the indifference of robbery, upon, indeed, its usefulness in the world, since it re-establishes a sort of equilibrium which totally confounds the inequalities of property, he enjoined me to go and steal a gold box<eos> in the lodgings of the man above him.<eos> You will bring me that gold box, and for a service as simple as that, I will give you, for the next two years, one ecru a year more as wages.<eos> Oh, Monsieur, how is it possible that a master dare corrupt an innocent domestic?<eos> Who'd stop me if I were to turn on you the very weapons that you place in my hands?<eos> And, what if someday. my actions convert you into a victim of your very own principles?
Listen to me, Thérése;<eos> I have things of the utmost consequence to tell you.<eos> Swear to me that you'll never tell a soul about them.<eos> Oh, Monsieur!<eos> How could you believe that I could possibly abuse your trust in me?<eos> Come here.<eos> I have decided to do away with my aunt.<eos> And it is by your hand that I shall carry it out.<eos> By my hand!<eos> Madame, there's something of the utmost importance I must reveal, but though it's a matter that touches you closely, I will not reveal it unless you give me your solemn word of honor that you won't bear the slightest resentment toward your nephew for what he has dared to plan.
Your heaven?<eos> Your justice?<eos> Your hell?<eos> When he will be shown to be sick in every fibre of his body. in his very blood.<eos> Do not make of this kind of man the object of your labor.<eos> You have said too well.<eos> I would never accept this destructive sensuality.<eos> Because you fear to become its object!<eos> Now that's egoism.<eos> If you are stronger by some atrociously cruel principle, and if you only like to please yourself through pain, you will only produce an effect on the object or person who serves you, a degree of violence that may
We did that the day of the dedication.<eos> You were here, I saw you coming in.<eos> What happens?<eos> You dig a hole and you just plop the stuff in?<eos> - We usually dig 'em the day before.<eos> - I see. Then you have this big hole sitting there all night?<eos> It's not a safety hazard, don't worry.<eos> I see, uh-huh.<eos> Hey, it's Mr Markham.<eos> - The lieutenant was looking for you.
I didn't realise they were gonna be here. I had nothing to do with it.<eos> - Must've been a leak.<eos> - No, I invited them.<eos> I intend to make a statement when you're finished.<eos> You do? Well, maybe I'll have a statement of my own.<eos> Well, you're clutching at straws.<eos> Carl, you're keeping a record of the delay, aren't you?<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> - All right.<eos> Lieutenant, I want you to know I admire you.
Later came Luna 2 and 3 and the bases in the first and second rings.<eos> It just wasn't the right time to decipher the legends.<eos> And you believe the time has come?<eos> Don't try to trick me with your questions.<eos> We are playing "hot and cold."<eos> You have to reveal the hidden object.<eos> No, professor. Eight hidden objects.<eos> Eight tiny ships, the T-S model.<eos> I don't understand one thing.<eos> Lost ships will get you to Eolomea as well as a bicycle to the moon.
Orion launches tomorrow at 9 a.m.<eos> Have a nice trip without Dan.<eos> Here, so you won't get lonely.<eos> I found him yesterday.<eos> What is it?<eos> A lion.<eos> Prof. Scholl, I hereby submit an official statement:<eos> I do not feel like obeying your order.<eos> Captain Lagny, I am officially reminding you: you've had 3 disciplinay actions.<eos> The fourth would send you back to your mother's bees.
Mr Milos...<eos> Forgive me if I... seemed at all shocked.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Doctor, Mrs Gallbladder's on the phone about her rupture.<eos> Later.<eos> Later...<eos> Mr Milos...<eos> Of course, I'm happy for the two of you.<eos> But I do have other patients.<eos> And unless there's some specific way that I could help you...
Afternoon.<eos> You're new here, aren't you?<eos> I've been here for over a year now.<eos> What can I do for you, sir?<eos> You can inform Mrs. Blaney that one of her less successful exercises in matrimony has come to see her.<eos> And who shall I say is calling?<eos> Mr. Blaney.<eos> Or if you preferred it, ex-Squadron Leader Blaney, late of the RAF and Mrs. Blaney's matrimonial bed.<eos> I see.<eos> Is Mrs. Blaney expecting you?
- No.<eos> What does Nathalie like?<eos> I think she likes music.<eos> Give me 24 in Lignon...<eos> About my daugther's piano lessons...<eos> I phoned once.<eos> The teacher told us...<eos> We're sorry, our principle is to leave the child free to learn or not to learn.<eos> Only Nathalie will choose piano or not.<eos> I can't hear you anymore.
- Engine room, chief still there?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - It's the captain, put him on.<eos> - Aye, aye, sir.<eos> - Are you making contact?<eos> - Yeah, I'm making contact.<eos> Chief, the captain wants you on the phone.
- Of course.<eos> Do not rely so much on appearances. I would be disappointed.<eos> Any passion passes quickly.<eos> And, even before to leave ... she and her boyfriend took fun of the situation.<eos> The Vanina has its faults, is sometimes cantankerous ... but I know my daughter.<eos> It is a great problem to freedom for her.<eos> You know that Gerardo Pavan no plans to marry her?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> If the Vanina is smart, do whatever you want the boyfriend.<eos> But that does not interests you.
I had a couple of my boys outside.<eos> They saw him take a shopping bag and something out of the safe and go into the funeral home.<eos> The money must've been in that bag.<eos> Has it occurred to you, Mr. Kelly, that when you blew up your partner that you may have also blown up my money?<eos> Yeah, I had nightmares about that, too.<eos> But then I've got a Photostat copy of the bomb squad report.<eos> There was no money in the debris, so it's got to be somewhere in that funeral home.<eos> - Nice.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'd invite you to dinner, but I suggest you have more pressing engagements.
I'll close my eyes and count up to 20 slowly.<eos> That should give you a reasonable chance. Come on, Milo.<eos> Off you go.<eos> One--<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen and twenty.<eos> You left them in that beautiful coat.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Let's have you out of that car, shall we?<eos> Those lovely boots back on again, please.<eos> Now, of course, the only question left to be decided is where the Police shall find you.
Do try to control your--<eos> What?<eos> The Police... asked--<eos> Oh, my...<eos> God.<eos> You should've believed me.<eos> Now, we're gonna play the game.<eos> In a little over 30 minutes, the law will arrive.<eos> It's going to be your giant brain... against their plodding ones.<eos> Concealed about this room... are four clues incriminating you... as Tea's murderer, including, as a final expression of your contempt for the Police, the murder weapon itself.
He thought that what was happening, was happening only to him.<eos> All that heart-breaking moaning is just second-rate Dostoyevsky.<eos> Who do you think you are to judge us?<eos> At least I know why I'm here.<eos> Nature created man so that he might gain knowledge.<eos> In his march toward the truth, man is condemned to knowledge.<eos> The rest is of no consequence.<eos> If you will permit me to inquire, what exactly are you doing on Solaris?<eos> What a question!<eos> Except for your tryst with your ex, nothing here seems to interest you.
She ripped my jacket and when Eunice came along...<eos> - Who's Eunice?<eos> - Eunice is my fiancée.<eos> You have a wife and a fiancée?<eos> No, sir.<eos> But, she kept calling me "Steve."<eos> Your own fiancée calls you Steve?<eos> No, sir, my wife.<eos> Or rather the one who isn't my wife.<eos> What does the one who isn't your fiancée call you?
That's just what I was thinking, so perhaps it would be as well if I arranged to have a reserve standing by.<eos> Yes, why don't you do that, Colonel!<eos> Captain Hart is likely to be very busy from now on.<eos> Yes, life is rather full at the moment, George.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So as I was passing, I just thought, old John's going to pretty tied up with all these ships sinking.<eos> Is it fair to ask him to play golf in the middle of something like this?<eos> So, I said to myself, "What I'll do is, I'll just drop by and sound him out. "<eos> You see, time's getting short, and I've got to get cracking.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but should I know you?
(DOCTOR WHO THEME)<eos> Doctor, do you think you're doing the right thing?<eos> I'm doing the only thing possible, Captain Hart, if we're to avoid a major conflict.<eos> Suppose they won't listen to you?
Oh, this whole matter is a shock but...<eos> What did you want?<eos> I'd like this whole place evacuated of all but essential personnel at once, please.<eos> I can't think, Brigadier, you have the slightest idea what you're asking.<eos> There are projects in train...<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but it's absolutely necessary.<eos> Now, Sergeant Benton will keep an eye on this machine of yours until the troops arrive.<eos> But I cannot be held responsible for the consequences unless you do as I ask.<eos> Brigadier, you may enjoy playing at soldiers... By 3:00, please, Dr Percival.<eos> And if the Master contacts you, don't try to hold onto him.
Move! Go on!<eos> Some more grapes, Miss Grant?<eos> No thanks, really I couldn't.<eos> That was a fabulous meal.<eos> Oh, it was just a light snack, I assure you.<eos> Now later on, I have a real treat in store for you - a banquet of genuine twentieth century food.<eos> Because I'm afraid most people don't eat like this nowadays.<eos> We've managed to get down the main food elements to pills and tablets.<eos> Look, I don't want to seem ungrateful...<eos> Something's worrying you?
Then how do we get through?<eos> The disused underground railway of the old city.<eos> There's an exit right by this wall.<eos> Even as a ruin it has its uses.<eos> Come, time is short.<eos> My dear man, how can I tell you what I don't know myself?<eos> But you were in contact with the guerillas?<eos> But not through choice.<eos> Look, they were going to kill him.<eos> I know the Doctor would help you if he could.
I don't doubt it.<eos> Do you value life so little?<eos> On that contrary, I value it enormously.<eos> The Daleks will kill us whatever we tell you.<eos> Not if you co-operate with them.<eos> As you c-operate with them?<eos> Do you really think that makes any difference?<eos> They can be reasonable!<eos> Reasonable!<eos> They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.
One day, I will pass it on to somebody who deserves it.<eos> Maybe I can be of assistance?<eos> Yes, that's quite possible...<eos> Perhaps even sooner than you think.<eos> I love this red wine.<eos> -What's the matter.<eos> -I have a terrible headache.<eos> Why don't you lie down?<eos> I'll show you the room.<eos> Nobody will disturb you.
But I want a new job, something exciting that will let me live.<eos> But accountancy is quite exciting.<eos> Exciting?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's dull, dull, dull!<eos> My God, it's dull.<eos> It's so deadly dull and tedious... and stuffy and boring and desperately dull! I can't stand it any longer.<eos> I want to live.<eos> Well, yes, Mr. Anchovy, but, you see, in your report here... it says that you are an extremely dull person.<eos> Our experts describe you as...
I think that's out of order.<eos> The trouble with these buildings is the fountains never work. Then you have to use the coffee machine. And then you lose your dime and the coffee's lousy.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm just another cop. My name's Columbo. I'm a lieutenant.<eos> - Were you in there...<eos> You didn't see me in there because I left before you got in there.<eos> And you know why?<eos> - I'd better get back. - Wait a minute.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> You look very tired to me and I think you had a terrible experience in there. And I think I ought to drive you home.
You look like you're troubled.<eos> Is there some reason for your question?<eos> - It's your mail.<eos> - My mail?<eos> Isn't it funny how people are different? Now, me, if I found my partner dead, I'd never think of opening my letters.<eos> But I... I just did it to distract myself.<eos> I mean, you got to remember one thing, that's a great shock. Yeah.<eos> Oh, that's understandable.<eos> And bills are distracting.<eos> Listen, if anything comes up, I'll call you right away.
Or maybe we can do the next best thing.<eos> Who did you say it is?<eos> The cops said it was a local woman. Some kind of drowning.<eos> Mornin'!<eos> Lieutenant Columbo, you turn up at the oddest times.<eos> Listen, I hope you don't mind my coming' in that way, but the door was open and I let myself in. No.<eos> Did you get here by magic carpet?<eos> I didn't see your car.<eos> I pulled around back and I put it in the shade. - The sun raises hell with the paint.<eos> - Sensible. What brings you up here to the wilds?
I've written that so many times, I know it by heart.<eos> What is this nonsense, you're going to arrest me?<eos> Why don't you make a statement and save us both a lot of trouble?<eos> You know, I've really got you.<eos> All right, Lieutenant. You got me. I'm your prisoner.<eos> Give me a dime, so I can phone my attorney. I promise you, I'm gonna sue your department for false arrest and defamation of character.<eos> I knew it right from the start. It was nothing definite.<eos> It was a lot of little things.<eos> Driving back from San Diego on the day of the murder instead of taking a plane, the open mail, never showing emotion for a man you worked with for ten years.<eos> With that, they're gonna laugh you right out of court.
But he was in Grosseto, we sent it there.<eos> You heard?<eos> It's in Grosseto.<eos> We'll inquire.<eos> Can we have this a little louder?<eos> Guardascione Saverio and Di Noi Giuseppe.<eos> Ah, Di Noi!<eos> Di Noi Giuseppe!<eos> You've made it at last!<eos> We've been waiting you for some time.
Please, don't gesticulate so much!<eos> It's not me that's gesticulating.<eos> Judge, sir, it's like a nervous spasm a nervous spasm I can't control, it has never happened to me.<eos> But here they treat me as if I were a criminal!<eos> - I'll decied if you're one.<eos> - As you wish, Judge, sir.<eos> - Sit down!<eos> - Thank you!<eos> I had forgotten how a chair was llike.<eos> I've been waiting for you for some time.
- If I did what, beg your pardon?<eos> - Have you done your military service?<eos> - Yes, Albania and Greece.<eos> - You haven't yet chosen a a lawyer.<eos> - I don't need a lawyer.<eos> - I'd only want to know...<eos> - You don't have to know anything!<eos> According to the new law, I can't proceed if your lawyer is not present.<eos> - Excuse me, but I'm sure you'll agree with me when you'll have listened to me.<eos> I don't have to listen to what you're saying, I only have to interrogate you.
Perfect for a bachelor.<eos> - In one of the buildings, a garret flat was free.<eos> He decided to move in.<eos> An article about women painters brought CIaude a thank-you note. He visited the sender.<eos> Her studio was unusual.<eos> - You know we almost met before... at MassouIier's on Friday.<eos> - Yes, I was there.<eos> - I came at midnight.<eos> You'd just left... like cinderella.<eos> Doesn't that bowl you over?
Don't let your degree get you killed.<eos> I'm liable to get killed with you.<eos> I'll remember that.<eos> - Hero!<eos> Nice work yesterday.<eos> - Fatso!<eos> Bressler wants to see you.<eos> You're a sweet man, Harry.<eos> There is one question, Inspector Callahan.<eos> Why do they call you Dirty Harry?
It's going to be all right.<eos> You sure you want the rest of it?<eos> Every penny's worth!<eos> You black son of a bitch!<eos> This one's on the house.<eos> That's got to be him.<eos> Are you claiming that the San Francisco Police did this to you?<eos> I swear it.<eos> As God is my judge.<eos> Why are they harassing you?
Hold it!<eos> Let's get outta here!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Shake your ass.<eos> Can't seem to find the damn ticket.<eos> - Where's the guy?<eos> - He's gettin' my car.<eos> He's in the back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Can I help you, sir? - Yeah.
Now who killed him?<eos> I don't know nothing.<eos> The only reason I came back to this crap house was to find out who did it.<eos> I'm not leaving till I do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hello, Jack.<eos> You bitch!<eos> It was you who told them I was here, wasn't it?<eos> Peter's very upset about his car.<eos> He's going to shit all over you.
I don't care.<eos> Damn it, man!<eos> You never change.<eos> Fine. Go ahead. Run off again.<eos> Things will catch up to you one day, and then you'll come crying!<eos> What can I do?<eos> It's just how I am.<eos> You know the one about the Scotsman whose kilt was too short?<eos> Antoine, come here, please.<eos> I'll tell you later.
Well, you'll find some claw marks over there and some more over there.<eos> And you say these same marks were found on the two colonists?<eos> That's right. Oh yes, it was all very efficiently done.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I think the whole thing was faked by somebody who wanted to frighten the colonists away.<eos> These claw marks, I mean, something made them.<eos> Yes, they could have been faked by some sort of mechanical device.<eos> You mean with something like this?<eos> Yes, yes - exactly like this!<eos> By the time they've found you, the monster will have claimed another victim.
The Master.<eos> Right, not a sound.<eos> Benton, get some more men. Yates, with me.<eos> Sir George, you stay here.<eos> - Who is...?<eos> - Please.<eos> Stay right where you are.<eos> Brigadier, a massive power surge on the main reactor.<eos> Stop.<eos> Touch that thing just once and we'll blast you into pieces.
You go to Paris for holidays Parisians come here.<eos> That's logical. It's logical.<eos> I'd liked to see you do that.<eos> I would have liked it.<eos> There were good times, but...<eos> The rice was good?<eos> The rice is okay, but when the river is mud... it's less fun.<eos> You smoke in the streets?<eos> Yes!<eos> It shocks you?
You've lived to a ripe old age...<eos> Where have you been wandering so long this year?<eos> Me?<eos> Busy working.<eos> Bye then.<eos> May I swing with you?<eos> May I also have a little swing?<eos> May I?<eos> Sorry, I didn't want to trouble you.<eos> You come to places, where no one would find you.
- Miss Gabriela. - Thank you.<eos> It's our national dance, Mr Gulliver.<eos> How dare you? !<eos> - Just where do you think you are?<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - Forgive me.<eos> - It's no use.<eos> - My deepest apologies.<eos> - Don't be ridiculous, Professor!<eos> I took you for a civilized person, Mr Gulliver.
I die gladly!<eos> Because...<eos> Will you be proclaiming some more?<eos> No, no more.<eos> I don't know who you are, Mr Gulliver, or why you came to us.<eos> I don't wish to ask you about that.<eos> But do you realize that you could have been dead by now?<eos> Yes, Governor.<eos> You have been invited to Laputa, Mr Gulliver.<eos> His Majesty King Matous is expecting you this very day.
- Shall I accompany you?<eos> No.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To bed.<eos> Really, now!<eos> I heard a racket.<eos> Well, look who's here.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Bye!<eos> Something troubling you, Mr Gulliver?
eggs?<eos> no.<eos> you're quite clearly suffering from a repressive libido complex probably the result of a product of an unhappy childhood coupled with acute insecurity in adolescence which has resulted in an attenuation of the libido complex.<eos> you are a bloody milkman!<eos> don't you shout at me, madam.<eos> don't come that tone.<eos> now then, i must ask you to accompany me down to the dairy and do some aptitude tests.<eos> i've got better things to do than come down to the dairy.<eos> mrs. ratbag, if you don't mind me saying so you are badly in need of an expensive course of psychiatric treatment.<eos> now, i'm not going to say a trip to our dairy will cure you but it will give hundreds of lower-paid workers a good laugh.
My god, he's coming back!<eos> Well, they seem to be in another tight spot.<eos> Could you... could you, could you keep it down a little, please?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Could you keep it down please...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well and now we move on to our, main course.<eos> Prawn salad...<eos> Prawn salad?<eos> Well, if you'll just wait in here, sir, I'm sure Mr Thompson won't keep you waiting long.
- Right, sir.<eos> Hello, officer.<eos> There seems to have been an accident.<eos> Well, several accidents actually.<eos> That's right, sir.<eos> Would you come this way, please.<eos> Ahh!<eos> It's me... me heart, sir.<eos> You swine.<eos> I'll get you for that.
Now then!<eos> Now then! - Your turn.<eos> - Aren't you going to say 'What's all this then?<eos> '? Oh!<eos> Right, what's all this, then?<eos> - This man has been shoplifting, officer.<eos> - Oh, he has? Yes?<eos> - Are you trying to tell me my job?<eos> - No, but he's been shoplifting.<eos> I must warn you that anything you may say will be ignored and furthermore, given half a chance I'll put my fist through your teeth.
It would've been some walk!<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Get out ofhere, the man's crazy.<eos> You neverknow what'll happen next.<eos> - Thanks forthe advice. - Follow it!<eos> If you wanna carry on, you don't need to go looking forthe door.<eos> He'd been walled up, the whole building, doors, windows.<eos> - There's got a way to get in it.<eos> - It doesn't mean he'll let you in.<eos> If yourface ain't right, he'd tell you what you can do with it!
Their population was large and, in those days, the people worked a lot.<eos> Then people left.<eos> All the young people are leaving and they keep on leaving.<eos> The villages will be deserted if this migration doesn't stop.<eos> Nowadays, it's just us old people that are left in the villages.<eos> We're old and we'll start dying, and the villages will be empty.<eos> And when the villages are empty, that won't be too good for the cities either.<eos> - Someone saw Giorgos, her brother, coming!<eos> - Over here, Giannis!<eos> There's someone here to see you, sir!
- How was that, Mama?<eos> - Very good, darling. That was very nice.<eos> Come along, Duchess. Kittens. Come along.<eos> Oh, and Edgar, I'm expecting my attorney, Georges Hautecourt.<eos> - You remember him, of course.<eos> - Of course, Madame.<eos> How could anyone forget him?<eos> Not as spry as I was when I was 80, eh?<eos> Ah, good day, sir.<eos> Madame is expecting you, sir.
Johanna's corpse from another world.<eos> I'm throwing you out.<eos> Get out! This is out of order.<eos> It's spring anmay.<eos> What did the young fellow do to you?<eos> Let me go.<eos> Downstairs you must turn right.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> A man followed us when you spoke to me outside.<eos> No one will find you here.
- No, me.<eos> To get that image out of my head. Of him, hanging up there, like a beast. In our house.<eos> You've gone through this thousands of times, why can't you understand me?<eos> A funeral like this, today, in a city still a mess... what's the use?<eos> Give me one logical reason and I swear that I'll grant you this funeral.<eos> There are no logical reasons. There are just the hours when I gaze at him where he is and it seems like ages.<eos> I came to ask God to save the soul of a man.<eos> That man is a suicide and the Church can't do it.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> I don't want to get you into trouble. I'll turn to God directly.
If you mean I've lost a few billions by re-opening that factory, you're right.<eos> It was an utterly unproductive operation.<eos> - But humanitarian.<eos> So humanitarian that no incident took place in the factories controlled by you lately while in ours... and how!<eos> You chose the wrong system.<eos> - We don't have your ability for scheming.<eos> Can you repeat that, please?<eos> Scheming.<eos> You know what? I'll tell you...<eos> - I'm begging you.
- That's sheer what-do-you-call-it.<eos> - Sophistry.<eos> Like hell it is.<eos> They're trying to kill me!<eos> No one's trying to kill you.<eos> Eat your dessert like a good boy.<eos> - Then why are they shooting at me?<eos> - They're shooting at everyone.<eos> - What difference does that make?<eos> - Suppose everyone thought like you?
In Major Major's office.<eos> - When?<eos> - When you go to see him.<eos> What I mean is you can't see him when he's there, when he's in his office.<eos> I've tried.<eos> Several times.<eos> When can you see him?<eos> Ever?<eos> Yes, indeed, you can see him, when he isn't there.<eos> That is, he'll see you, all right, but only in his office, and only when he's not there.
Jump, Doc...<eos> Please, jump.<eos> Jump.<eos> Jump!<eos> Poor Hungry Joe.<eos> - Poor McWatt.<eos> - Poor Doc.<eos> Poor Doc.<eos> I'll need a full report on this, Captain Yossarian.<eos> I haven't seen you in some time.
- Looks like an Indian to me.<eos> - He's a prince of the Comanche nation.<eos> - I don't care if he's the king of Romania.<eos> The Colonel said, "Straightaway." Let's move it.<eos> Hold on, Sergeant.<eos> Have a cigar.<eos> - Have a cigar.<eos> - Don't mind.<eos> One other thing you ought to know.<eos> You touch White Buffalo again and I'll kill you.
- I'm sorry.<eos> I apologize.<eos> It's just that she's rough and selfish.<eos> Don't apologize.<eos> I'm not blaming you.<eos> You're a good person.<eos> That's why I'm outraged by her.<eos> Who is she? How can she call herself a wife?<eos> I'm not mad about how rude she was to us. But what a way to treat her husband!<eos> She doesn't greet you when you come home.
Makes the peasants drive him or comes in his own carriage.<eos> Didn't I tell you? He broke our wheel off.<eos> We must hide there.<eos> I'll go to the village blacksmith.<eos> You wait here father.<eos> Sweet Jesus!<eos> The Evil one!<eos> Wait, my good man!<eos> The count has personally instructed us on your rooms, Professor.<eos> We hoped the horses'd reach you before the nightfall.
- Major Burns is far from satisfied.<eos> - That doesn't surprise me.<eos> Frank Burns does not know his way around an operating theatre.<eos> He does not know his way around a body.<eos> And if you'll have observed anything, you'll have observed that Frank Burns is an idiot.<eos> He has flipped his wig, he is out of his head, he's a lousy surgeon.<eos> On the contraty, I have observed that Major Burns is not only a good technical surgeon,<eos> - he is a good militaty surgeon.<eos> - You finished?<eos> I have also noticed that nurses as well as enlisted men address you as "Hawkeye".
Piece in his heart.<eos> - That the X-rays?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Apparently some big heart surgeon in Boston told the congressman the only man to take care of his son is Captain John Mclntyre.<eos> Of course, I suppose there could be two Captain John Mclntyres.<eos> No, no, I'm the only John Mclntyre.<eos> Look, Hammond says I can take someone to assist me.<eos> Wanna come?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Lieutenant, I think I can save you.
This way, please.<eos> - No calls, Mrs Hatch.<eos> - I'll go to work on your address.<eos> Did you lose another one?<eos> No.<eos> Follow me.<eos> - Now, Miss Gamble...<eos> - I'll make it quick.<eos> Do you know the name of a good hypnotist I can go and talk to and see if he could help me lay off these cigarettes before tomorrow night, or else Warren won't get that job, see?<eos> Then I won't bother you any more. Do you understand?
Yesterday, the office told me that my Italian prisoners... ... didn'thaveenoughlatrine.<eos> They didn't know what a latrine was till I showed them.<eos> If I've said anything too critical of my British colleague... ... let'sforgetaboutit.<eos> I will tell you one thing, though.<eos> Off the record.<eos> I'm gonna beat that... ... gentlemantoMessina.<eos> Ah, Freddie.<eos> Do you realize what this madman Patton is saying?<eos> He's going to save our skins by taking Messina.<eos> This report might interest you.
We've taken Sicily. I'm ready for a new assignment.<eos> Maybe you've got it.<eos> Here's a radio message, just came in.<eos> Cod.<eos> I've been relieved.<eos> They've relieved me from command of the 7th Army.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Happy New Year.<eos> Just a minute, sir.<eos> Since they're sure to give you another command... ... isn'titlogicalthey'd relieve you here first?
- That'll be Whitey from downstairs.<eos> - Whitey worked for a rich Yankee.<eos> Tuscarora hasn't seen this Yankee.<eos> But you didn't come all the way to Blackthorne to tell me that.<eos> Tuscarora's in trouble.<eos> They're trying to take his old man's land.<eos> - And you thought I'd join in?<eos> - Two guns are better than one.<eos> Maybe we're after the same thing.<eos> Maybe I can help you.
She's a friend of mine.<eos> - Well, she helped me.<eos> - I hope you had fun.<eos> Stop it.<eos> What are we gonna do now?<eos> We'll stay here tonight.<eos> In the morning I'll go into town to see what I can find out.<eos> Why don't we go into Phillip's ranch...<eos> If they're watching this town, they're certainly watching the ranch.<eos> - The Sheriff knows you, doesn't he?
There's still somebody in that jail, Ketcham.<eos> Tom, don't try it.<eos> Get whoever's in there out.<eos> All right, Barney, come on out.<eos> Drop your gun and get over with the rest of 'em.<eos> You wanna step down, Mr Phillips?<eos> Hope this thing don't go off while I'm climbing down.<eos> Step off, Sergeant Major.<eos> Let's go to jail.<eos> Don't worry, Mr Ketcham, we'll get you outta there.
Come on back here.<eos> - Where're you going?<eos> - After Hendricks.<eos> - They're running, Colonel.<eos> - Well, Hendricks can't run far.<eos> Glad you brung me?<eos> Spread out.<eos> This thing isn't over yet.<eos> Turn around, Sheriff.<eos> I want you to see who's gonna kill you.
There are other fire extinguishers in Central Control.<eos> If we can get to them.<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> I'm a fool.<eos> Of course! The coolant reserve.<eos> I've rigged up an emergency hose!<eos> That's it!<eos> Well, the coolant's under pressure.<eos> It's just as cold as the CO2 in the fire extinguishers.<eos> Doctor, you've got a monster sized fire extinguisher just waiting for you in there.
-Once that thing's working, we can take it over.<eos> -We don't know how to operate it.<eos> Dr Williams can learn how to operate it.<eos> She's a scientist!<eos> That device is beyond all our comprehension.<eos> Then I shall have to persuade him to operate it for us.<eos> And if he tries to go by himself?<eos> And leaves us to die?<eos> I shall make sure that he dies first.<eos> If we get you back, Doctor, you better make darn sure they stop their drilling.
Will you keep an eye on him, Brigadier?<eos> I think Central Control ought to know about this.<eos> Keep calm!<eos> This is only a minor emergency.<eos> It can be contained.<eos> -Professor, stop the drill!<eos> -No, positively not.<eos> You'd better do something and quick otherwise you'll bust this place wide open!<eos> -Have those riggers arrived yet?<eos> -An army of riggers won't get you out of this one!
It seems awfully deserted.<eos> We're turning over to automation, General.<eos> It means we can keep staff down to a minimum.<eos> Splendid.<eos> Don't get machines going on strike, eh?<eos> Your car is waiting for you, General.
A flower!<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> It's divided.<eos> One part over here and another there. Dear Bianca...<eos> Bianca love?<eos> Bring me the... the...<eos> - Pig!<eos> - The 'flower of Youth'<eos> Raffaello!<eos> How are you! I didn't recognize you, you look so young!
This time he's wrong.<eos> They're on their knees. They're finished. We'll never have a chance like this again.<eos> It's ridiculous!<eos> Ridiculous? It's a catastrophe.<eos> Baron von Richter. The Fuehrer will see you now, sir.<eos> BRITISH EMBASSY - SWITZERLAND<eos> My dear Max!<eos> How lovely to see you back in Switzerland so soon.<eos> I came straight from Berlin an hour ago.<eos> - The ambassador will see you now, sir. - Thank you.
- It was obvious.<eos> Thinking about all of those terrible things you said to me.<eos> I was determined to make up for the time I'd lost.<eos> And I intend to keep on doing it.<eos> And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take an Alka-Seltzer.<eos> I don't mind saying I'm disappointed in you, Miss Dickinson.<eos> Doctor, you're the one who said I was discouraging men.<eos> Stifling my femininity.<eos> For the first time, an attractive young man pays attention to me, you go to pieces.<eos> If I didn't know you so well, I'd almost swear you're jealous.
Another drink, corporal?<eos> Be my guest!<eos> - And from God.<eos> - The Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost!<eos> - How many gods are there?<eos> - There's only One!<eos> - And where is He?<eos> - In heaven, on earth and everywhere!<eos> Come in, Campos.<eos> What brings you here, corporal?
Three months later, when you were tracked down by the police, you refused to surrender and fired on the police, killing officers Ponthier and Sorel.<eos> You consistently denied being responsible for this last hold-up, but ballistic evidence has conclusively established that the bullets shot in the Caron jewelry store came from the weapon with which you killed the two officers.<eos> These are the charges submitted against you.<eos> As prescribed by law, I now ask you, have you anything to add?<eos> - l maintain my statements, Your Honor.<eos> - Very well, Sartet.<eos> "Having read a transcript of the charges against me, "l adhere to my previous declarations." Sign there, please.<eos> - Checking my neck, inspector?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> You'll forgive me if I get you out of bed at dawn one of these days.
It's just a bug...<eos> It's harmless...<eos> I thought that you....<eos> I'm sorry lady.<eos> They're harmless... they come with light.<eos> Excuse me Mr. Fernandez<eos> They're harmless... they come with light...<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I just thought....<eos> About that stuff about people and gossip... I can tell you, I feel the same way...
All right.<eos> You've probably got a better idea.<eos> No. I have no better idea.<eos> - Only this one better work.<eos> - It'll work.<eos> - I'll tell her.<eos> - Sure, you tell her.<eos> - I can tell her.<eos> - I know.<eos> You're free to go over there and join the soldiers. They'll get you home.
He'd have saved a lot of money Stayin' drunk and horny<eos> Oh, Susannah He's happy as can be<eos> For he's got him somethin' better Than a banjo on his knee<eos> Rumson, he got married today Married today, married today<eos> Rumson, he got married today What'll he do tomorrow?<eos> Ben! I'll be glad to help you work your claim!<eos> I'll be bedding down by the fire if you need me.<eos> You'll not regret taking me in, I'll make you a good wife.<eos> You sure as hell will.<eos> I don't fault you for taking me for an easy woman.
Let go of me!<eos> They've got the whole world snared in their cobweb.<eos> What's the matter, Vano?<eos> Did anybody hurt you?<eos> Leave me alone, for God's sake!<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you Niko Pirosmanashvili?<eos> Yes, it's me.<eos> We've been looking for you, we've gone through the whole town.
It's fresh and cool.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't have any lemonade.<eos> Thank you, I don't want anything.<eos> Remember I visited you, the artists?<eos> I still don't understand whether you praised me or criticized.<eos> You must have criticized me, as long as you laughed at me in the newspaper.<eos> Don't think I bear a grudge.<eos> Frankly, I forgot about it long ago.<eos> And we haven't forgotten about you.<eos> I've been looking for you, and, thank God, I've found you at last.
- What will you do?<eos> As I informed Miss Mackay, I will resort to public petition.<eos> I have no doubt that many supporters will rally to my defense.<eos> My students are loyal.<eos> My girls.<eos> Someone betrayed me, Sandy.<eos> Someone spoke against me to the board.<eos> Who could it have been?<eos> Who?<eos> Are you thinking that maybe one of your girls betrayed you?
I want a new job.<eos> Something exciting that will let me live.<eos> Chartered accountancy is rather exciting, isn't it?<eos> Exciting?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's dull.<eos> Dull, dull.<eos> My God, it's dull, it's so desperately dull and tedious and stuffy and boring and desperately dull.<eos> Well, yes, Mr. Anchovy, but you see, your report here says that you are an extremely dull person.<eos> You see, our experts describe you as an appallingly dull fellow.
I think your idea of making the transition to lion-taming via easy stages, say via insurance or...<eos> - Or banking.<eos> - Or banking.<eos> Banking, yes.<eos> Yes, banking.<eos> That's a man's life, isn't it?<eos> Banking.<eos> Travel, excitement, adventure, thrills.<eos> - Decisions affecting people's lives.<eos> - Jolly good, well... -...shall I put you in touch with a bank?
He will have his dinner and he will enjoy my company for as long as he pleases. And when he's ready to go back into Havana, he will phone the residence for a car to come and get him.<eos> You're being a damned fool.<eos> You've made up this story because it's what you want to believe, because of me.<eos> I don't believe he had any contact with your man Uribe, and I don't think anyone else would. If you're doing him any harm, I will raise such hell, and you know I can.<eos> And next time you decide to drop in on me like this, please telephone first.<eos> Tomorrow morning.<eos> Come in.<eos> I have brought the typewriter. It is done.<eos> Good, Tomas.<eos> And the car is waiting for you.
What discrepancy? Well, you see, sir, it is our information that a head of the Russian NATO desk, Boris Kusenov, has defected and is now in Washington.<eos> But we are also informed that you claim Boris Kusenov is dead.<eos> Could you clear up this discrepancy?<eos> This is not a newspaper interview?<eos> No, but I wouldn't mind publishing it.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> My father-in-law.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Andre Devereaux.<eos> He sent you because I don't know you.
Pull them over!<eos> You bring the guns?<eos> Don't worry, we've got them.<eos> Hidden.<eos> When I get my share of the gold, $2,500 worth... I'll tell you where four cases are.<eos> The others are waiting for me back at the wagon.<eos> If I don't show up pretty quick, they'll blow it.<eos> You fix it goddamn good, no?<eos> You fooled me.<eos> Our accountant will pay you immediately.
No shame.<eos> - A Jew, naturally.<eos> - A half-Jew.<eos> Worst kind.<eos> They feel superior even to other Jews.<eos> - The prosecutor is here.<eos> - Send him in.<eos> Follow him night and day.<eos> Come in.<eos> We were expecting you.
I favor the accident theory.<eos> Premeditated by two fanatics.<eos> Drunk, to boot.<eos> Right, you don't smoke.<eos> You must settle this quickly.<eos> The city, the country, even the world are watching and waiting.<eos> Our country's honor is at stake.<eos> Forget about these lowlifes.<eos> Your future lies before you.<eos> This case can take you very far or break your career.
I barely recognize you.<eos> Serve your Lord with body and soul.<eos> Forget yourself and give yourself to him.<eos> I'm desperate.<eos> I've lost our Lord's love forever.<eos> He picked that common servant girl to have his fun with.<eos> My dear...<eos> Don't put yourself down.<eos> After all, you're a princess.<eos> The Shogun won't leave you for someone like that.
Please have mercy on me.<eos> Welcome her once more.<eos> Tokiwai...<eos> You beg for her even though you claim to still love me?<eos> Is this another attempt to get power over me?<eos> No.<eos> But you're possessed.<eos> The only one you always loved was yourself.<eos> All you demanded was love.<eos> And yet you sent away everybody who ever genuinely loved you.
Which wicked demon has taken hold of you?<eos> You don't reply because you know that i'm justly condemning you.<eos> Or are you so far gone that you can't even hear me?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Makino...<eos> Don't say anymore.<eos> I wanted your advice and you aim to break my face!<eos> Let me warn you!<eos> You will push it so far that people will cry tears of joy when you die!<eos> Everybody who ever loved you will despise you because you caused them only pain.
Forgive me!<eos> Mizu.<eos> Is that you, Lord?<eos> Yes, i've been looking for you.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Oh, my Lord.<eos> Forgive me!<eos> It's really you?<eos> You've come to me.<eos> My blind eyes can see you.
Mizu.<eos> Mizu.<eos> I've always longed for real love.<eos> And now that i've finally found it, i've already lost it again.<eos> Is what i heard true?<eos> You intend to acknowldge Zome's child as your own?<eos> That's right.<eos> How stupid of you.<eos> Why do you get naive now?<eos> I no longer understand you.
Mm-hmm Well, let's make that "sooner," right, Lieutenant?<eos> Try my best Yeah I'm sure you will<eos> I don't think I have to remind you that this could be quite the little feather in your cap<eos> Wrap it up, and everybody's happy<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> Um, yeah, I'm sorry I was, uh...<eos> I was just thinking about something What was that?<eos> No It's nothing important It's, uh...<eos> Dr Flemming, he didn't call to his wife when he came back to his apartment<eos> I don't follow you Oh Well, I was in the bedroom I was checking some things, and I heard him open the front door, and he didn't say anything
There's only a few days left to the big fight...<eos> It's good to see you in shape!<eos> Hey, young man! Why the hurry? Where are you going?<eos> Congratulations on the next bout...<eos> But it's the Joe Louis-Walcott match?<eos> You can tell me next time.<eos> But young man, it was a very interesting match. What is wrong with you?<eos> Follow that car!<eos> When you upset your wife, it's pays to know how to make it up to her.<eos> I understand you well, Sir, I have three wives!
- I know.<eos> We met last night.<eos> No, that wasn't the first time either.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Stay a while longer.<eos> We know each other.<eos> You saw me once.<eos> Several years ago.<eos> But I wasn't wearing black, then. I was wearing white.<eos> Yes, now I recognize you.
- Over at Doc's house.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> I talked to Mr Evers before he went home.<eos> He'd like you at his son's funeral.<eos> - I'll see him at the graveyard.<eos> - The burial's gonna be at the ranch.<eos> I'm taking the casket out there now, the family asked me to.<eos> If you'd like to ride along with me, you're welcome.<eos> I'll go by myself later on.<eos> Catch up with you, maybe.
I know I'm no stranger to you.<eos> I've been watching you in secret for some time, but these last few days, I've made no effort to hide, and I know now that the moment has come.<eos> Before I saw you, I never loved anyone.<eos> I hate temporary things.<eos> I know life well, that everyone betrays everyone else.<eos> But it will be different with you and me.<eos> We'll never be apart, not even for a single hour.<eos> I don't work, and I have no obligations in life.<eos> You will be my sole preoccupation.<eos> I understand this is all too sudden for you to say yes right away, and that you need time to sever the temporary ties that bind you to temporary people.
- How are you?<eos> And very impressed.<eos> Excuse us, we have a date with a gunnery sergeant.<eos> Why didn't you answer my calls?<eos> I didn't know who you were until just now.<eos> I never answer calls unless I know the people.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I'm too vulnerable.<eos> If you're rich and gay people continually harass and blackmail you.<eos> Have you any idea why I want to talk to you?
- I was picking some chicory and cabbages.<eos> And with so much land around why right here?<eos> Why come and look for chicory and cabbages right here?<eos> And why not?<eos> Am I doing something wrong?<eos> The chicory doesn't belong to anyone, it's just chicory.<eos> Everything belongs to someone, even the chicory.<eos> Come on, get on.<eos> We'll take you to your house.<eos> Don't be afraid, we're not taking you to the barracks!
Your letter will remain anonymous, I don't want you living in fear.<eos> You can go.<eos> - Our respects Captain.<eos> - Good day.<eos> Rosa Nicolosi<eos> Captain, it's Rosa Nicolosi.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> Come on in, Rosa.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Don't worry, nobody can see you.
Lowlife!<eos> - Bastard! Informer!<eos> You're a cop!<eos> You're the bloody spy!<eos> Good day Captain.<eos> Pizzuco has confessed but it took all night to get him to sign!<eos> Naturally, not a single word about Don Mariano though.<eos> The saints are untouchable!<eos> If you'll allow me Captain, I'm going to get some sleep.<eos> There's something urgent that needs doing. After that I'll leave you to sleep even for 24 hours.
And lastly, the blabbermouths...<eos> A flock of geese.<eos> But, even if you nailed me, you're a man!<eos> And why do you consider me to be a man?<eos> Because someone in your place can trample over people easily.<eos> And I received insults far worse than death from your predecessors.<eos> They slapped me.<eos> Another put his cigarette out on my hand and how he laughed!<eos> Can you sleep when you've been ridiculed like that?<eos> - So, I don't offend you then?
What else could happen to me?<eos> And what about something extraordinary?<eos> Like in fairy tales?<eos> You were right, it's not picturesque.<eos> But it's interesting.<eos> - Is this Crespel?<eos> - Yes, this is it.<eos> I thought Crespel was a town.<eos> There is one three miles away, but it's not part of Crespel.<eos> The boss will see you now.
Everything's going to be OK now, Andy or Jenny.<eos> We're going to be in a nice, clean hospital with no visitors.<eos> Monsters.<eos> Monsters.<eos> Unspeakable.<eos> Unspeakable.<eos> I was sleeping.<eos> Come with us quietly, Rosemary.<eos> Don't argue or make a scene.<eos> If you say anything more about witches we'll take you to a mental hospital.
You busy?<eos> - No.<eos> Hired.<eos> You live in the same place?<eos> - Yes, but...<eos> - I'll pick you up at 7.<eos> - You're putting me on.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> A babysitter!<eos> Ellen and Aggie would have a fit if they heard you.
- I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens next.<eos> Well, as someone very wisely once said, "That's how it is with cars sometimes. "<eos> - I just said that.<eos> I wonder if your reputation is altogether true.<eos> What's my reputation?<eos> Oh, I've heard that Jim Douglas is only interested in fast cars and easy money.<eos> Not true.<eos> - Oh? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You know something else? - What?<eos> When the light hits you just right, you're as beautiful as General Grant on a $50 bill.
I'm certain the American Embassy will insist on one of their men accompanying me.<eos> Yes, yes, I quite understand that.<eos> No, that's perfectly all right.<eos> - You bring him along.<eos> - Fine, fine.<eos> Then I'll see you within the hour.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> How do you do?<eos> I'm Charles Langley.<eos> Oh, yes, Mr. Shipherd is expecting you.
Laso.<eos> My assistant here will be very happy to accommodate you.<eos> This is Mr. Stoner, Laso.<eos> All right, professor, I'll wait here.<eos> I see you have a trans-world newswire.<eos> - It's in English.<eos> - Mr. Shipherd prefers it.<eos> - Would you like to see a magazine?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> Now, in this room, we have something I think is going to interest you.
- I know where you can get it.<eos> I have a friend who'd pay twice that to know what the new Dilatrin's gonna look like.<eos> - I'll advance you the money.<eos> - You can't mean that.<eos> Look, you're in trouble.<eos> Big trouble.<eos> You could get up to five years for possession of those pills.<eos> Look, I didn't put them in there.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> Okay, even if you were able to convince the jury of that, the publicity would ruin you.
I see now that you could win a great deal of money from him.<eos> As it happens, there is something I want from Tomar too.<eos> Not money, a jewel.<eos> A fine emerald that has been in my family for nearly 200 years.<eos> I have been trying to buy it back.<eos> - But Tomar won't sell?<eos> - Precisely.<eos> What do you have in mind?<eos> That's enough about me.<eos> I think I'm keeping you from capitalizing on your newfound luck.
Think.<eos> Can't think.<eos> Can't remember.<eos> Do you mind if I take my coat off?<eos> No. Put it in there.<eos> Now that you have me here, what do you propose to do?<eos> You're in no danger.<eos> - All I need is...<eos> - All you need is a place to hide.<eos> Because every policeman, every soldier in the country, is looking for you.
Take the rope and the explosives to your room... and bring them with you when you come.<eos> - How's it looking?<eos> - Is quiet enough.<eos> The first thing we must do is cripple that helicopter.<eos> They might try to fly Carnaby out in it.<eos> I think we can handle that.<eos> Hello?<eos> - You the pilot?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Kommandant wants you on the phone.
Dump his body in Loch Ness, I never want to see him again.<eos> All right.<eos> "Last warning before execution:<eos> 1 billion."<eos> - Does he think I'm AI Capone?<eos> - I got a late payment notice.<eos> "Although you have received previous notice,<eos> "your right-to-live tax remains unpaid."<eos> It goes on...<eos> "It is my duty to inform you that if payment is not made in 3 days, "a 10% surtax will be added."
Terrific!<eos> - Only the best.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hello, Mr. Hippolyte.<eos> - Buen ganao.<eos> - What's that mean?<eos> How are things?<eos> - Fine, and you?<eos> - Getting by.<eos> We haven't seen you in months.
We're not playing at all!<eos> - He'll come back.<eos> - You could have let him speak.<eos> - It's a high-level matter.<eos> - Who gives a damn!<eos> - And also written fine.<eos> Moreover, before making such a proposal you have to be informed if the people listening have the same problems as you.<eos> My God, my God.<eos> Why have you forsaken me?<eos> - Professor, two persons are waiting for you.
Usually the speaker here holds the microphone and talks.<eos> The meeting takes place, but it's not what brings the votes.<eos> - But it's worthless without the public.<eos> - Begin, the public will arrive.<eos> I'll begin when at least fifty people are gathered here.<eos> - Should they gather around the stones?<eos> - Don't teach me the way of life!<eos> I'm not the kamikaze of the party and I don't want to be ridiculous.<eos> - Be ridiculous?<eos> Mostly, they'll ignore you.
I'm leaving, I'll talk to her later.<eos> - Meanwhile, you try to calm her down.<eos> - And you pray for her.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Professor, I have something to say to you.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> Careful with what you are doing.<eos> I don't believe your bullshit.<eos> I'm not interested in your professional future.<eos> But whatever happens to Elena, I'll put you under charge.
I feel in shape.<eos> I took all the possible precautions to not put her in this situation.<eos> Ok, the examinations prove her right.<eos> Anyway, she wants to keep the child.<eos> I feel affection towards Giovanna, but I'm surrendered.<eos> Get it?<eos> I'm becoming a public person.<eos> It's not time for marriage.<eos> Why should you get married?<eos> Who obliges you?
What are you trying to do?<eos> Ruin my career, destroy me?<eos> I was beginning to believe in you, trust you.<eos> I thought there was something decent, something worthwhile.<eos> But you're just a common harlot.<eos> Dragging me into your sordid intrigues.<eos> Leering into the face of that stupid paramour of yours.<eos> Why don't you go hide in his cabin?<eos> - Why don't you torment him?<eos> - I won't torment you any longer.
It might do no harm if we had a few words, Mr. Drayton.<eos> Yes, sure.<eos> We can go into my study.<eos> Will you excuse us, please?<eos> Doc, you'll excuse us, please?<eos> I'll have another drink, if you will.<eos> - Another?<eos> - No.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I'll go up and throw a few things together like for the next 10 years.<eos> Mr. Drayton I don't know you, and wouldn't wanna offend you but are you nuts?
As the agent, I see the problems the Interior Department is faced with.<eos> The natural distrust and resentment of the Indians.<eos> - Their reluctance to cultivate the soil.<eos> - They live where they don't want to live.<eos> That, too, which can't be helped for the time being.<eos> - Do you know anyone at San Carlos?<eos> - Most of them.<eos> FAVOR: You've visited the agency?<eos> RUSSELL: I lived there.<eos> I don't recognize you.
- Uh, no, sir.<eos> It's not.<eos> - No. The, uh, the watch... now you've had it checked, of course.<eos> That's very interesting.<eos> Would you like me to look into this?<eos> That's what I was hoping.<eos> I can take care of it in about a week, sir.<eos> - A week? - Well, why? Is it urgent?<eos> - Well, no, I guess... - Oh, fine then, sir.<eos> I'll contact you as soon as I get back from Death Valley.
What's that make him?<eos> Innocent.<eos> Mrs. Colbert... there's just one more thing.<eos> I picked it up, I tell you.<eos> He was already lying' there, it was lyin' there next to him!<eos> I just picked it up, ma'am, that's all I did.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Get him outta here.<eos> - Okay, c'mon, Harvey, let's go.<eos> I wonder if you'd mind if I have somebody drive you over so you could, uh...
Whisper two little words, Mama, and I'm on my way.<eos> Maybe... I don't want to sever a beautiful child like you right out.<eos> A man's name.<eos> First name, last name. The man who's paying you for Delores Purdy's abortion.<eos> You're the boy who works for Mr. Charlie.<eos> I thought that's who you was.<eos> Why you wanna do that?<eos> Why you wanna help the police like that?<eos> They stealing' your soul.<eos> They chew you up and spit you out.
I want a word with you.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I used the inspector's name.<eos> - He'll be here shortly.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Because he spent a lot of time with me last night asking questions about you.<eos> And I'm sure he spoke to Ellen too.<eos> So?<eos> Look, I won't waste any time.<eos> I saw you last night leaving the museum with that following you.
- I'll show you!<eos> This is a relay, you see!<eos> By damaging just a small detail in this relay, the whole machine is put out of function!<eos> NON-COOPERATION<eos> - Is it hard to find the fault?<eos> - Very! And I also delay the repair!<eos> Is it part of a big sabotage plan?<eos> Yes!<eos> There are many possibilities!<eos> Wouldn't an enemy kick you out?
You must hurry. I'll do it soon.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Fool! Don't be so extravagant!<eos> Take it back!<eos> Who's she?<eos> You've been spending money on women, haven't you?<eos> You sex maniac!<eos> Crazy.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Your wife suits you.
Leave me alone!<eos> Why don't we admit it, why do we act like idiots?<eos> ! Leave me alone.<eos> You shouldn't want me.<eos> It would be a huge mistake...<eos> - Here, sew it on.<eos> - Can't you hear me...?<eos> You almost killed me.<eos> That's not what we were talking about.<eos> Mr. Pelnar mentioned it but I don't know you.
He wants to know what's your work.<eos> Tell him your father is one of the greatest unknown poets living.<eos> MR. KOSAK'S GROCERY STORE.<eos> Mr. Kosak, what if you were in China with no friends and no money?<eos> Where is the money?<eos> Forget about money. I'm talking about China.<eos> How would you feel in China?<eos> You ain't in China, neither is your Pa.<eos> I ain't gonna give you more credits.<eos> I'm talking about heathens around you, and you hungry and dying.
That's why he couldn't meet you.<eos> Well, how are things in the fatherland?<eos> Any cities left after all the bombing?<eos> A few, yes, here and there.<eos> There's one good thing about Paris.<eos> It's an open city, no bombs.<eos> I hate bombs.<eos> This way, Fraulein Gabler.<eos> I have a car for you just outside.<eos> I'll take you to your father's hotel.
No, sir.<eos> Nothing, sir.<eos> All is well, then?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I insist on absolute frankness, corporal.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Well?<eos> Well, I hope the general had a good time last night.<eos> After all, we're in Paris, and the general is on leave.<eos> That has nothing to do with you! No, sir.
It's all right, thank you.<eos> We shall be in a position to break through here, to Avranches, and to cut off the American 3rd Army from their 1st Army and from the British.<eos> Two of our panzer elite divisions, The 12th SS Panzer Divisions, and the 21st Panzer Division, as well as the 346th Infantry Division are moving west to reinforce our positions here.<eos> As per your orders, my Fuhrer, the 5th Parachute Division...<eos> I'm expecting a telephone call from Berlin, urgent.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Now, according to dispatches just received from the Eastern front our troops had to retreat from their positions.<eos> The enemy is attacking on the whole front here between Lublin and Brest-Litovsk.<eos> Further south, the Romanian 3rd Army is facing 90 enemy infantry divisions.<eos> As soon as I know anything, I'll call you.
Right.<eos> General, last night, there was another murder.<eos> You and your damn murders. Can't you understand there are more important things in the world than murdered whores?<eos> Yes, of course, sir, but one of your men, Lance Corporal Hartmann, is missing.<eos> Do you know anything about him?<eos> Yes?<eos> Oh, yes, sir.<eos> No, I've heard nothing, sir.<eos> Of course.<eos> As soon as I hear, I'll call you.
You're very kind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> The booth New Moon.<eos> - Can I help you, ma'am?<eos> - The booth New Moon.<eos> Allow me to help you.<eos> Your coat, sir... and my apologies...<eos> I must count you, one, two...<eos> Sir, someone's calling you.
Over here.<eos> Don't monopolize him.<eos> - Let me tell you about Reese.<eos> - Reese is dead.<eos> They're scraping his body up off the sidewalk in front of the Huntley.<eos> - Then his debt died with him, I'm afraid.<eos> - Wrong.<eos> It passed on to you.<eos> No business corporation would acknowledge that debt.<eos> If you don't, I'll kill you.
- All photographed.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Are the Japanese equipped to launch such a rocket?<eos> - We don't think so.<eos> - Then who else is?<eos> That's what you've got to find out, and fast.<eos> Before the real shooting starts.<eos> This damn thing could blow up into a full-scale war.<eos> When you get to Tokyo, go to that name and address.<eos> Our man Henderson will contact you there.
This time, you shall finish it.<eos> Aki.<eos> No one will disturb you tonight.<eos> I think I will enjoy very much serving under you.<eos> - Mr Fisher?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - This way, please.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Please come in, Mr Fisher.<eos> - Mr Osato is expecting you.
You're shaking...<eos> I take it you got stiff shoulders, sir!<eos> All right, sir.<eos> Allow me to give you a massage treatment.<eos> Some bad blood is circulating...<eos> Ow... Ow!<eos> Ichi!<eos> People out there seem to be spreading some silly rumors. My, oh, my!<eos> What do you mean... by "rumors? !"<eos> Don't let this get to you, sir.
The light was soft.<eos> A girl was sewing, with her back to me, as if waiting for me to wake up.<eos> I slept again.<eos> I swore that next time I would get up.<eos> Will you let me come back one day to this beautiful place?<eos> I will expect you.<eos> We are children.<eos> We have been foolish.<eos> We must not go back in the same boat.<eos> I don't know you but I'm pleased to see you.
Of course.<eos> You rest the cue on the rail like that, then you slide it between your fingers like this.<eos> Now, aim at the cue ball.<eos> Five ball in the top pocket.<eos> - I'm terribly sorry.<eos> - Oh, it's perfectly all right.<eos> I'll go and change.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You look as if you've just lost your last friend.<eos> I was just wondering whether I'd ever see you again after this weekend.

For attempting to smuggle platinum out of the country.<eos> Platinum?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't understand this.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - They're arresting him.<eos> You can't arrest me.<eos> I have rights in this country.<eos> Let me go.<eos> I'll get you for this.
He'll be back in the city on Monday.<eos> Good.<eos> Oh, my office is right here.<eos> Stay with him and don't let him out of sight until those papers are signed.<eos> - I understand, colonel.<eos> - Good.<eos> Karl, I feel like a bit of fresh air.<eos> The usual place, please.<eos> Major Richard Dunhill, American-Nazi Corps, at your service.<eos> Welcome, major, I've been expecting you.
- That's all he has to do.<eos> Good afternoon, Your Excellency.<eos> Won't you be seated?<eos> Will you find out how long it will be before the deputy chancellor will be able to board his plane?<eos> Certainly.<eos> It was quite an opportunity for Stahl, picking up Kurzon and that microfilm.<eos> He'll take credit for saving the government.<eos> Stahl has been trying to undermine me for the last two years.<eos> He would stop at nothing to become deputy chancellor.<eos> The chancellor would never replace you with Stahl.
Twelve thousand.<eos> Thirteen thousand feet.<eos> Fourteen thousand.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Fresh air never smelled so sweet.<eos> The plane will be landing soon to pick up Kurzon.<eos> You have an enemy.<eos> - A most powerful one.<eos> - I have dozens of them.<eos> This enemy will destroy you unless you destroy him first.
How should I call it?<eos> - Lovely twist of fate in that.<eos> Yes. I see what you mean.<eos> Ready, Herr Belzig.<eos> Good.<eos> Right this way.<eos> - On the way.<eos> - They just started Rollin.<eos> Remember, a few dozen feet along the way, the tunnel divides.<eos> Only the left passageway will take you to the Western Zone.

But you stay here.<eos> Maybe you'd like to pass the time telling me about the money you ship to Switzerland.<eos> You're boring me, Daly.<eos> Am I still boring you, Frank?<eos> You're not gonna get away with this, Daly.<eos> You can't keep me locked in this lousy hotel room.<eos> - I've got a right to see my attorney.<eos> - Don't you talk to me about rights.<eos> They're for decent people, not jerks like you.<eos> I'm gonna fight you with your own methods.
Precisely why I insist you go immediately.<eos> The Kommandant and I work very closely together.<eos> I never know when he will need me.<eos> He depends on me for everything.<eos> - How proud you must be.<eos> - I am.<eos> There must be some way that I, too, can serve?<eos> That will come in time, fräulein.<eos> I have discussed you with the Kommandant.<eos> - He has plans for you in the future.
You blind fool.<eos> - You make me sick.<eos> Open up your eyes.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Look around you.<eos> People like Jankowski, see what they do every day.<eos> Open up your blind eyes.<eos> The whole routine was an act.<eos> A well-rehearsed plea for understanding.<eos> Then, after you are disarmed, he will use you for his real purpose.
I can only tell you that if you do not return the jade within the next 22 minutes, you will be dead.<eos> Go to maximum security.<eos> Post two men down in the foyer.<eos> No one's allowed on this floor.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> Tell your men that if I see anyone in this building without authorisation, my orders are to shoot.<eos> Right.<eos> Guns will not protect you, Mr. Taggart.
Robe, mister?<eos> Whisky.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, this is a Muslim city.<eos> Only coffee is available.<eos> Sure, and I suppose those girls are your sisters, huh?<eos> Now, I want whisky, let's have it.<eos> You Jara?<eos> Proprietor of this unworthy establishment.<eos> Then you can give me some information.<eos> How can I help you?
It will soon be dinner.<eos> - You wanted to see me?<eos> - I finished the cover of the third folio. I wanted your opinion on it.<eos> Is it exquisite or merely magnificent?<eos> - Exquisite, eh, Mr Kent?<eos> - Beautiful.<eos> Good.<eos> You may go now!<eos> - Goodbye, Ludwig.<eos> - Yes, I'll send for you when I want you again.
What are you doing?<eos> You can't obliterate a man just like that.<eos> Are you mad? Are you mad? Obliterate him... forever?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's hard to accept we'll never see such a dear face again.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't know you loved Daddy so much.<eos> Perhaps we should move into the other room.<eos> Sandro...<eos> Can I call you Sandro? - Of course, madam.
Let there be no misunderstanding.<eos> I mean women, females!<eos> The subjects of our fairytales, songs, dreams...<eos> Beatrice... Silvia... Laura...<eos> True woman.<eos> Women...<eos> who seem to have descended from heaven to prove the existence of miracles on earth.<eos> Right.<eos> And they say men have one-track minds. Yes, men...<eos> Can I call you Sandro?
- Marvellous.<eos> - Yes, quite.<eos> I'm private secretary to Mr Nejim Beshraavi of the shipping lines.<eos> - The Nejim Beshraavi.<eos> - I didn't think there could be two.<eos> Mr Beshraavi would like to see you in London, so if you'll follow me, please, the car is waiting.<eos> Mr Sloane, this is Wednesday.<eos> Shall I tell you about my Wednesdays?<eos> Right now: A healthy jog and a couple of tutorials, an indescribable lunch with the faculty at 12:45...<eos> Mr Beshraavi will pay you well for your time.
How?<eos> All we know is that Beshraavi is opposed to our programmes and plans some violent exercise of that opposition in the near future.<eos> We have to find out what he intends doing and when.<eos> You want me to re-establish contact, accept his offer and see what I can find out?<eos> We want that very much.<eos> But you must not accept until you know all the possibilities.<eos> The assignment carries a certain amount of risk.<eos> Is that a statesmanlike way of saying that I could get killed?<eos> Mr Beshraavi respects no one's life but his own.<eos> If you wish, I will stop the car and let you out with nothing further being said.
What are your first impressions?<eos> We could use some of your English rain in our dry country.<eos> In our country, there's a great deal of oil and very little water.<eos> A highly inflammable situation.<eos> All right, Hemsley.<eos> Water remains our most serious problem.<eos> To paraphrase Marie Antoinette: I can hardly say of my people, "Let them drink oil."<eos> May I see your press card, please, sir?<eos> Diners Club?<eos> I'm afraid I don't recognise you.
The usual machine, Herr Hauptmann. An out-of-date Pfalz.<eos> That's what you'll fly here, too.<eos> - But at flying school they told us...<eos> - Flying school.<eos> At flying school they'll tell you anything.<eos> Up-to-date machines go to experienced pilots.<eos> Both are in short supply.<eos> - It's a cruel world, Stachel. - Yes, Herr Hauptmann.<eos> Welcome to the squadron.<eos> The truck will take you to the mess with the others.
Why don't you come down to the club and have a drink.<eos> You look tired.<eos> -No, thank you.<eos> Another time.<eos> -Hello, Mr. Rogers.<eos> Do you believe in the sexual revolution?<eos> My husband does.<eos> You keep it up, kid.<eos> You just keep it up.<eos> You remember when we invited you to our wedding?
Something you said or did?<eos> I never did get on well with the staff.<eos> They disapprove of me.<eos> I don't always stick to the timetable and... we have fun in my classes, and they don't like that.<eos> There was another teacher, the one I replaced.<eos> The same thing happened to her.<eos> They didn't like her either.<eos> - Now she's in some awful kind of trouble.<eos> - Then it wasn't the analyst.<eos> It was the staff that wanted to get rid of you because you are different.
Bald Eagle wants to see you urgently at his place.<eos> Look, he's expecting you at 1200 hours.<eos> Tell Ross I'll be late.<eos> - Why try to be so insubordinate?<eos> - Why don't you go back to bed?<eos> - Shan't be long, Mrs Mead.<eos> - Mrs Ross?<eos> My name's Palmer.<eos> Oh, yes, of course.<eos> My husband's expecting you.
He's at 62 Wallington Road.<eos> - Have you ever thought of it, sir?<eos> - What?<eos> Defecting.<eos> I have.<eos> - Have you found my cat?<eos> - No, you've won the pools.<eos> Ah, Ross's little man.<eos> Was that meant to be a password, or simply a joke?<eos> I didn't recognise you, dear boy, in that gear.
I am sick... Not sick...<eos> It was him!<eos> No, this is a harp.<eos> Where is the Englishman?<eos> There's an Englishman here?<eos> Your explanation does not satisfy me!<eos> But it's rather clear!<eos> I am regular army not secret police<eos> But if you refuse to talk,<eos> I'll hand you over to a department that will make you talk.
This is all your fault.<eos> There was no need to run errands for the Brits.<eos> We could have stayed with them at the nunnery!<eos> They could not fetch Peter themselves!<eos> I don't give a damn about Peter.<eos> And neither do you!<eos> You dragged me here for that girl from the Guignol Theatre!<eos> I forbid you from talking about the girl from the Guignol Theatre.<eos> I'm fed up. Manage on your own.<eos> Don't want to see you again.
Come on, climb over the wall.<eos> Be careful!<eos> Help me come down. I can't.<eos> I have the dogs!<eos> Come closer.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Why would you want them to stop?<eos> So that you can come down.<eos> It's quite alrlight this way.<eos> You don't actually believe I'm gonna carry you on my back?
That'll be the end of Gordon, but not of Gladstone.<eos> In a nutshell.<eos> I must say, Mr. Gladstone, you're hardly a bore.<eos> You don't bore me either, Gordon.<eos> You're illogical and insubordinate.<eos> I know if I send you to Khartoum... you'll play tricks, you'll exceed your orders... and in the name of some mystical necessity... apparent only to yourself... you'll do your ingenious best to involve this government... up to the hatband.<eos> But you're in a very poor patch... and you have no one to turn to but me.<eos> Again, in a nutshell.<eos> I'll take a chance on your tricks. That's all I can say.<eos> I'll see Sir Evelyn Baring in Cairo... brings pressure on the Khedive... to appoint you Governor General of the Sudan... but I cannot and will not back you up.
Just ask for directions, it's the only inn in town.<eos> You see this is a condemned place, a God forgotten place.<eos> I am looking for the inn.<eos> I'm looking for the inspector.<eos> Inspector Kruger.<eos> You are the doctor, aren't you?<eos> In this village, we never liked doctors.<eos> Quiet! Dr. Eswai?<eos> Yes!<eos> Come. Come. The inspector is waiting for you.
Second flies...<eos> Death flies.<eos> Everything flies.<eos> Masa, dear, wait a minute.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> And I kept losing, first my shoes, then stockings... then blouse, slip and finally my panties.<eos> And who took them off?<eos> Mr. Hubicka.<eos> And now Zdena listen carefully.<eos> Before the dispatcher put you on the table, did he use force?
How cruel.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I do apologise. I was hoping to get finished before you got back.<eos> It was meant to be a sort of welcome.<eos> - Well, the door was open.<eos> - How very kind of you.<eos> I heard about your terrible experience last night, and I thought that these might help take away an unhappy memory.<eos> - Oh, yes, I've met your father.<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> - He was searching for you last night.
Let me get you upstairs.<eos> You realise what you have done?<eos> He may be alive because of your foolishness.<eos> I hope to God he is.<eos> What will happen to you and to Anna, when he goes to the police?<eos> I don't care anymore.<eos> You will care.<eos> For God's sake, let me alone.<eos> No, I will not leave you alone, Dr Franklyn.<eos> You should have thought of that before you started meddling in things that do not concern you.
Yes, it will keep her warm.<eos> - It will warm her...<eos> - Let me out!<eos> You must stay!<eos> Valerie?<eos> Mrs Spalding?<eos> Valerie!<eos> Help!<eos> Help! Help, please!<eos> There is no one to hear you.
If there IS something going on, before we start spreading around a lot of alarms.<eos> OK, Chief.<eos> The Russians have landed.<eos> The Russians have landed in West Village and are attacking the postmistress.<eos> They're attacking Muriel Everett.<eos> Where, the hell...<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Will you eat?<eos> Oscar Maxwell speaking.<eos> Chief Mattocks wants you down at the station, right away
- Now what do you want?<eos> I'm going out to the airport. You ain't.<eos> - You're gonna stay right here.<eos> - What?<eos> You're gonna stay right here till I find out what the score is, and don't you do nothing, till I tell you to, you got that?<eos> Now, wait a minute, Mattocks!<eos> You're gonna foul up the whole detail.<eos> We've got a plan of operation all worked out.<eos> That don't give you no right to tell the police what to do, Fendall.<eos> The police are governed by the laws of this town as authorized by the Commonwealth, and unless you got a federal warrant that supersedes that, you can just keep your big, fat mouth shut, or I'll throw you right in the can for disorderly conduct! You got that?
How long do you have to be in Leipzig?<eos> I have to get to one man...<eos> Gustav Lindt.<eos> Lindt?<eos> But he leaves for Leningrad any day.<eos> For how long?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should try to see him right away.<eos> You bruised one or two ribs.<eos> Tomorrow, they will probably have you in for a screening.
- How do you mean?<eos> - As you see, we pick up no passengers.<eos> Now we will have to stop.<eos> Even if we don't, the police up front will.<eos> Herr Jacobi.<eos> If the police see that second bus coming, we'll all be arrested.<eos> Let me off.<eos> Let me off!<eos> Let me off! Let me off the bus!<eos> Fräulein Mann, if you wish, I will let you off the bus, but you will not say anything to the police.
- I gave some to Alice.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - She's dying.<eos> - Is she?<eos> We'll have to go buy you a new doll then, won't we?<eos> I took the liberty of telling Mr Scarr that you were dying.<eos> Oh?<eos> Did he cough up?<eos> He coughed.<eos> The car was hired by the man that followed you.
- I don't want her.<eos> - So don't I. So ?<eos> Everything gets boring some day.<eos> Even earthquakes.<eos> We'll have to solve that problem somehow.<eos> - Please have a seat. - Thank you.<eos> Holidays passed.<eos> I owe the most beautiful days to you as well.<eos> - I can't say that.<eos> - That's why I brought you here.
These ravings about tearing out children's hearts, that's Elena screaming for help.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - We need more time.<eos> I don't have the authority.<eos> Either the girl can be trusted or she must be eliminated.<eos> Look, I need time.<eos> We may be on the verge of getting the information we need, with time.<eos> - I'm not in a position to...<eos> - We're talking about a woman's life!<eos> I'll check with my contact and call you back tonight at your hotel.
Come on, now, you're not taking me in.<eos> Nobody takes me in, at least not till I make a phone call.<eos> You can call from the station.<eos> Put them on.<eos> Well, you guys just lost yourselves a chance for a nice promotion.<eos> - Who do you think tipped off the police? - Move, move.<eos> Come on.<eos> Is it true the book The Purple Decade was written about you?<eos> I'm sorry I can't answer your questions, gentlemen, but then I don't know the answers to them myself right now.<eos> What are they taking you in for?
How am I doing?<eos> Terrible.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Say, do you do Jimmy Cagney?<eos> - Ho, ho.<eos> Not funny.<eos> Read.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - General, it is Alisio.<eos> I know you left orders not to be disturbed, but it is very important I see you immediately.
Saroyan speaking.<eos> Hello!<eos> Maréchal here.<eos> What?<eos> I can't hear you very well.<eos> Cover me!<eos> What's the weather like in Paris?<eos> Overcast, but warm.<eos> Funny!<eos> Now I hear you very well.
- Anything else?<eos> Yes, sir. I'd like a rundown on this German officer.<eos> - All right, send this along.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Get up to the line and tell them to grab some new prisoners.<eos> - I'm interested in any fresh information.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> One thing more.<eos> What are you doing in a reconnaissance plane?<eos> We're not paying you to be a combat soldier.
Send them along, and anything else you found.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Do you actually still think the Germans are preparing a major offensive?<eos> Yes, sir, colonel, I do.<eos> You mean those kids are replacements for more seasoned troops sent to the rear to re-form for the big attack?<eos> Yes, sir, colonel, I do.<eos> Kiley, you're crazy.<eos> Facts mean nothing to you. Evidence means nothing.<eos> The only thing you can see are your own cockeyed hunches.<eos> Well, that doesn't work in the Army. I'm recommending you for transfer to a desk in Washington.
-Yes.<eos> -A good shallow young fellow.<eos> -Didst thou cut an ear off?<eos> -And Poins, he a good wit?<eos> -Poins, a wit?<eos> Let us beat him before his whore?<eos> Poins and the prince are such another.<eos> A bastard son of the king's!<eos> And art thou not Poins, his brother?<eos> My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge.
- No.<eos> I came here to think, period.<eos> I just wanted to please you, but, if silence arouses you,<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> - Do you have just a couple minutes? - No, I don't.<eos> - Listen...<eos> - I'm busy.<eos> I came to Rome to conduct an inquiry on the sexual conduct of Italian men.<eos> That's why I'm following you.
Isn't that right, dear ?<eos> What is it that you want ?<eos> Concerning Shizuko, she's living, right now, on my tab.<eos> I have, therefore, the rights of a spouse.<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> In fact... forgive me for bothering you, but I would love it if you would give Shizuko back to us.<eos> As you can see, our children are still small and I've come to appeal to your good will,<eos> in the company of our children.<eos> In the name of these poor children, we thank you for your understanding.
Ladies and gentlemen... We know the true power of science and we must together fight inhumanity with an international treaty.<eos> You know what you have to do and you tell Professor Lefèvre he's wanted on the phone.<eos> The express train from Paris arrives on track 3.<eos> Martians...<eos> Cab.<eos> Chairman, I'd like to say a word.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Personally, I feel, respected colleagues.... ...that we shouldn't allow this Fantomas bogey man to bother us too much.<eos> I totally agree.<eos> Phone call for you, Professor.
I'm so scared my bones are clicking, like dice on a Reno crap table.<eos> I should be back in Hollywood, sitting in front of a typewriter, making all this up for a movie.<eos> Not living it.<eos> All battles are fought by scared men who'd rather be someplace else.<eos> Does that include admirals?<eos> Yes.<eos> Admiral, another 30 minutes and they tangle with the minefield.<eos> Jere.<eos> Loosen up!<eos> Skipper, if I let you down, will you please shoot me?
Something like that.<eos> Seven ships sacrificed.<eos> It'll make a fancy court martial.<eos> - He's still doped up?<eos> - A little, sir.<eos> Let me straighten you out, Admiral.<eos> The battle in Pala Passage was a decisive victory.<eos> Skyhook's on its way and the Japs can't stop it.<eos> I'm having you flown to the States, but not for court martial.<eos> They'll stick a peg leg on you and ship you back.
- What sort of baggage do you have?<eos> - Just a suitcase.<eos> - Arjun!<eos> - Sir? Get the suitcase from that car and put it in my jeep.<eos> In your jeep?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Have some tea first.<eos> - No thanks. Another day.<eos> Come on. I'll take you to a friend's bungalow.
I'm not playing at being provost marshal.<eos> And I never heard of luck that didn't run out.<eos> Yours will, depend on it.<eos> Because you're like all criminals, you're greedy.<eos> I'd like to point out that I don't have to put up with this crap.<eos> I'm not in your two-bit army. I'm in our two-bit Army.<eos> If you're looking for something to live for, when we get out of this... We'll see.<eos> But you make one slip, just one and we'll see how long you survive in my cage.<eos> And after my cage, I'll personally...<eos> I'll personally hand you over to the Japs.
It killed the hen.<eos> I'm gonna kill it.<eos> The dog's mine to kill, an eye for an eye.<eos> Col. Foster, I have ordered Capt. Hawkins to destroy his dog.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I'm gonna kill it just like it killed my baby.<eos> Col. Foster, accept my apologies.<eos> I'll do anything you want but let me keep my dog.<eos> - If you don't get away, colonel I'll put you under arrest.<eos> I'll get even with you.

- Can we bury this one?<eos> - They cremate their dead.<eos> Chief Du-Ramin was told?<eos> This morning, sir!<eos> When their women bring food, they will take him away.<eos> Hey, General...<eos> Chop, chop, chop.<eos> Father, please stay in the house.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What hostility brings you here?
I really don't know you.<eos> I wish you'd believe that.<eos> I believe it.<eos> Who's the Major?<eos> If you don't know, my telling you isn't going to help.<eos> Be careful, David.<eos> I'm Mr. Stillwell.<eos> I called.<eos> Go right in, Mr. Stillwell.<eos> The doctor's expecting you.
What did pictures of the Lord mean to me compared to his real emissary's smile?<eos> And for the boy who brought your little messages - - I never saw his face, or learnt his name --<eos> We can go on to the platform now, Father.<eos> Your Honour, it must be years since you were last here!<eos> Ah, Mull!<eos> How are you?<eos> This is my son, haven't you met him yet?<eos> Fähmel -- pleased to meet you.<eos> Mull -- pleased to meet you.<eos> Every child knows you here, Your Honour.
But Mr. Kuchar, what are you talking about?<eos> I am the "Arisator", not some "help".<eos> Don't interfere. I know what I'm doing!<eos> She doesn't know anything about the "Arisation".<eos> Maybe she doesn't even know there's a war.<eos> What did the young man say?<eos> But what are you going to do, Mr. Kuchar?<eos> He said he will come, but tomorrow and as often as you need him.<eos> Sure!<eos> May God bless you for being so good.
Don't I?<eos> You'll do that.<eos> You'll get it, let's see six or seven hundred Crowns a month.<eos> You never make that much in your own trade.<eos> Yes, Mr. Kuchar... Did you know Cutka, the one that stuck his hand into the circular saw?<eos> It's a hard job... taking over a Jewish shop.<eos> Tell me... what did she say?<eos> The old lady was surprised, then said she doesn't care whether the shop is managed by Tom, Dick or Harry.<eos> So she doesn't care whether it's me or someone else.<eos> And I said: "You have nothing to worry about, Mrs. Lautmann." "l am not going to eat you."
Dirty, stinking fascist guards!<eos> I swear...<eos> I swear Mrs. Lautmann, they are not going to harm you.<eos> I won't let them!<eos> I won't let them, do you hear?<eos> God have mercy on us...<eos> Mercy, mercy... Go and see for yourself!<eos> Be quiet and sit on your chair!<eos> Shut up! Not a sound.<eos> No one will see you, no one will hear you.
Put the luggage on the trucks!<eos> Hurry up, hurry up!<eos> It's either me or her!<eos> She has to go.<eos> She has to go.<eos> Start packing Mrs. Lautmann while there is still time!<eos> I'll help...<eos> You can take 30 pounds... 30 pounds is a lot...<eos> Go and register...<eos> They will send you home!
You want to say goodbye to your neighbors?<eos> Do you think they will prepare a special train for you?<eos> What, what?<eos> A transport!<eos> Do you think they'll send a special one for you?<eos> What, transport?<eos> Watch.<eos> The Jews are being deported.<eos> All of them!<eos> Do you think they are going to keep you here?
No!<eos> I'm not a bloody owl, you know.<eos> Ah, I thought I'd seen everything. This is a flaming nuthouse.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, do you always, uh... run around like, uh, this?<eos> I mean to say, it's a bit, uh --<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You ill?<eos> Ah.<eos> The, uh, heat's getting you down, hmm?
They have the kind of reverence without which religion would mean nothing.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Can I get you some tea?<eos> - Would you like some grappa?<eos> - Grappa, if you please.<eos> Okay.<eos> I talked with a friend of yours this afternoon,<eos> Mr. Ward Hendricks.<eos> He isn't exactly a friend anymore.<eos> He gave me the impression he knew you rather well.
Marta.<eos> Gretl.<eos> Now, let's see how well you listened.<eos> I won't need to whistle for them, Reverend Captain.<eos> I mean, I'll use their names. Such lovely names.<eos> Fräulein, this is a large house.<eos> The grounds are extensive.<eos> And I will not have anyone shouting.<eos> You will take this, please. Learn to use it.<eos> The children will help you.
-But I really don't need them.<eos> -Good night, now.<eos> Frau Schmidt, if I asked the captain about the material... ?<eos> -He's leaving in the morning.<eos> -Of course.<eos> How long will he be gone?<eos> It depends.<eos> The last time he visited the baroness, he stayed for a month.<eos> I shouldn't be saying this to you.<eos> I don't know you that well.
-I'm not suitably dressed.<eos> You can change. We'll wait.<eos> Captain, you must be very proud of your youngsters.<eos> I am, thank you.<eos> Is there a more beautiful expression of what is good in our country... ... thantheinnocentvoices of our children?<eos> Oh, come now, baron.<eos> Would you have us believe that Austria holds a monopoly on virtue?<eos> Herr Zeller, some of us prefer Austrian voices raised in song... ... touglyGermanthreats.<eos> The ostrich buries his head in the sand... ... andsometimesin theflag.<eos> Perhaps those who would warn you that the Anschluss is coming, and it is... ... wouldgetfurtherwithyoubysetting their words to music.
-No.<eos> Yes.<eos> -Isn't it right that I missed them?<eos> -Oh, yes.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I was only hoping that perhaps you... .<eos> Perhaps you might... .<eos> Yes?<eos> Well, nothing was the same when you were away... ... andit'llbe allwrongagain after you leave... ... andI justthoughtperhaps you might change your mind.<eos> Well, I'm sure the baroness will be able to make things fine for you.
Coffee, sir.<eos> Why don't you go back and sleep, Mr Leamas?<eos> We'll ring you if he should show up.<eos> Maybe he'll come some other time.<eos> We can have the police contact you.
And within a week or two, no doubt, the mysterious Mr Ziebold went to the bank and drew his money.<eos> I never knew when. I never knew why.<eos> I never damn well cared.<eos> By that time I hated the lot of them,<eos> Control, those damned old pussycats chewing their winegums, hated...<eos> Come in.<eos> Excuse me, Herr Peters.<eos> It came by special messenger.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They're looking for you in England.
If I'd have won it, I'd have been somebody.<eos> I might've been able to go up to any girl... even a rich and a beautiful one... and say to her what I wanted to say... ask her what I wanted to ask.<eos> Only it can't happen now.<eos> Oh, pl-please forgive me.<eos> I've been very, very selfish.<eos> I'll never forget you, Patricia.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> - Oh, no! No. Wait.<eos> I'm going to talk to Father.<eos> It won't be easy... but I'm going to get you back into the race.
Tonight there will be one !<eos> - A Chinese ?<eos> You tell him !<eos> - No, a customer!<eos> Mr. Rapière ?<eos> Let me introduce myself, Mike Mitchum...<eos> You'd rather have seen me alone ?<eos> I don't like to see people alone.. they're sad...<eos> And sadness quickly leads, to meanness..<eos> I'd better keep you amused, then ?
You'd be astonished to see how much they charge.<eos> Luisinho is good for you.<eos> He is richer than I am.<eos> -No...<eos> -But your father is.<eos> Not to mention his wife.<eos> -You better stop drinking.<eos> -It's his day of annoying people.<eos> -You mean my night, Mara.<eos> -Nobody's forcing you to go with us.
- What?<eos> That isn't a very good song.<eos> - Wait a little. How does it go?<eos> Peter!<eos> ls Peter here?<eos> ls he not here?<eos> Peter!<eos> Seems he is not here.<eos> And it goes on.<eos> Your husband, my lady, is a great hero, and he loves you faithfully...
Don't be afraid all this is too big for you.<eos> It's big, but it still depends on what each of us does.<eos> History lesson number one.<eos> I'll talk to Moscow now.<eos> It's the premier, sir.<eos> Mr. Chairman, this is the president of the United States.<eos> Do you hear me clearly?<eos> Fine, Mr. President.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm calling you on a matter of great urgency.
You won't make a scene.<eos> -It's your turn, Agnes.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Agnes!<eos> Wait, Adrien calls.<eos> You boor, let me be!<eos> Adrien!<eos> Agnes, don't worry!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> A call for you.
- Isn't that right, Carla?<eos> - Of course she understands you it's not difficult to understand after everything that happened last night.<eos> I know exactly what you're speaking about and I'm sure Carla knows as well.<eos> Terribly sorry, but would you mind explaining to me exactly what you mean by that?<eos> Do you really think that the whole world is blind? Blind and deaf? !<eos> Ma'am, if you were to speak a little more clearly perhaps we would know what you mean.<eos> - It'll just bore you in any case considering she's not even here!<eos> We all heard my... your dear friend Lisa when she asked you to leave with her!<eos> Not that it's of any interest to me but I hope, in the future, that you choose another place to arrange your dates.<eos> And if you're so anxious to start a new life no one is stopping you, you know?
Well, in a way.<eos> It includes all the animal ancestors from whom man derived his instincts.<eos> Ladies' instincts, too?<eos> Well, that paper deals with the instincts of predators.<eos> What you might call the criminal class of the animal world.<eos> Lady animals figure very largely as predators.<eos> Put on the overhead light if you like.<eos> The switch is by the door.<eos> Why don't you sit down, Mrs. Taylor?<eos> If the storm worries you that much, I'll get you something to drink.
Would you like something to drink? Some brandy?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'm awfully sorry. I...<eos> Oh, don't be silly.<eos> What is it about colors that bothers you?<eos> - Colors?<eos> - Mmm. You seem to be terrified of some colors.<eos> No, no.<eos> What I'm terrified of is thunder and lightning.<eos> You know, I wouldn't have pegged you for a woman who'd be terrified of anything.
I could get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant which requires better English.<eos> How many vowel sounds did you hear altogether?<eos> I believe I counted 24.<eos> Wrong by 100.<eos> To be exact you heard 130.<eos> Listen to them one at a time. Must I?<eos> I'm really quite done up for one morning.<eos> Your name, please?<eos> Your name, miss?<eos> My name is of no concern to you whatsoever.
Lovely, isn't it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What do you call it again?<eos> "Cup of gold." Could you drink from it, really?<eos> Champagne for two in copa de oro.<eos> Dr Shannon.<eos> Miss Fellowes.<eos> Here you are, Miss Peebles.<eos> The same brand even.<eos> Fix you up in no time.
Mr Shannon, I'll find a dry spot if it rains.<eos> How many?<eos> How many times have you been around the world?<eos> As many times as the world has been around the sun.<eos> And I feel as if I've gone the whole way on foot.<eos> Thank you, Mr Shannon.<eos> Operator.<eos> Operator, aquí parlar English?<eos> - Sí, señora.<eos> Can I help you?
The Reverend Shannon, defrocked.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> A base lie.<eos> I was never defrocked.<eos> I was only locked out of my church.<eos> Spreading a story like that is libel.<eos> I could take legal action.<eos> And I will.<eos> These ladies are my witnesses.<eos> Repeating a story like that will get you...
Yes, I do.<eos> We make a home for each other, my grandfather and I.<eos> Oh, I don't mean a regular home, because... ..I don't regard a home as a... As a place, a building... ..bricks, wood, stone.<eos> I think of a home... ..as something two people have between them.<eos> In which each can... ..nest, rest... ..live in, emotionally speaking.<eos> Does that make any sense to you, Mr Shannon?<eos> Yes, but...<eos> Well, go on.<eos> But what?<eos> Oh, leave it, I'd only say something to hurt you.
- What?<eos> "Look, I know your next few weeks are going to be tough.<eos> You're going to be lonely.<eos> Say, how would it be if we had a nice quiet little drink together some night?"<eos> Please go on, Mr. Kimball.<eos> Mr. Kimball, you just don't know how grateful I am to you.<eos> You prevented me from making a complete fool of myself.<eos> How can I ever thank you?<eos> - Oh, you don't have to thank me.<eos> I'll never forget you for this.
He was really in one of his moods last night.<eos> First he babbled in Spanish, and then he cried.<eos> He really broke down and cried.<eos> - You don't say.<eos> - I do say.<eos> When I tried to console him, make him feel better, suddenly he was tearing off my clothes and cursing like a madman.<eos> Very strange.<eos> Very strange.<eos> There's something I don't understand.<eos> Ostos was leaving you, and yet, by your own account, he was behaving like a jealous madman.
Nothing can happen to us now.<eos> Nothing can disturb us.<eos> "Trail of death follows Inspector Clouseau."<eos> Four people.<eos> The doorman, two customers, and a Cossack.<eos> Most regrettable.<eos> Regrettable?<eos> Including the Ballon murders, this brings the total to eight!<eos> That just goes to prove what I have said all along.<eos> What you have said all along qualifies you as the greatest prophet since General Custer said he was going to surround all those Indians!
A man who grieves is not a freak.<eos> Are you?<eos> My father was murdered.<eos> He was.<eos> The idea of suicide would be the most terrible thing in the world to my father.<eos> He was murdered. I know it.<eos> You must know it.<eos> Please help me.<eos> - Why me?<eos> - I saw my father watch you on TV.
Actually, it's a most interesting case.<eos> I probably didn't get the full implication.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> Actually, his lordship was wondering whether you'd care to take tea with him.<eos> - Sure!<eos> - Oh, well, then if you'd kindly follow me.<eos> - Great!<eos> - Yes, well...<eos> Is there anything special that interests you about this case, Mr. Stedman?
Are they for your accomplices, to create confusion?<eos> Accomplices?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Simpson, you're aware next Tuesday is our annual Army Day parade?<eos> I swear on the life of my fa... of my mother.<eos> You know our chiefs of staff and the foreign military missions will be together on the grandstand?<eos> Their safety is our responsibility.<eos> We shall be merciless with anyone who threatens it. Merciless.<eos> You frighten me, sir, but after all, that's part of your job.<eos> But if my father could hear you now, he'd laugh himself sick.
The arms are back in the car, just as they were.<eos> The chances are they won't be touched until the evening before Army Day, but you will check them constantly.<eos> If they have been touched, you will report at once.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - I feel dizzy. Uh...<eos> This is for your messages.<eos> Cigarettes.<eos> Be always sure to have an empty pack.<eos> Put your messages there, and drop them from the car.<eos> That car will follow you everywhere.
I have no inner conflict. I want only to marry her, and I know that'll happen soon.<eos> We like the same things. I feel good believing in God. I hold no grudge against anyone.<eos> You know, Terezinha is like an angel.<eos> We're going to renovate this house and live here together for the rest of our lives.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> What was all that faith good for?<eos> I'm stronger than you!<eos> I don't know, Barretos. It was quite a shock to me.<eos> Believe me, I would give my life for Antonio's.<eos> Don't think I'm accusing you. You were the last person to see him, so you must remain a suspect until we have an autopsy.
Have you got an appointment?<eos> No, just an old friend, passing by, bit of a surprise.<eos> I can't wait to see her face.<eos> She'sjust having tea.<eos> Just go in there and tell her the Doctor would like to see her.<eos> Doctor who?<eos> Just the Doctor.<eos> Tell her exactly that, the Doctor.<eos> Hang on a tick.<eos> Er, the Lord Mayor says thank you for popping by.
Yes. - And the white house?<eos> - Yes. That's where the Brenners live.<eos> The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?<eos> No.<eos> Just Lydia and the two kids.<eos> The two kids?<eos> Yeah, Mitch and the little girl.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> How do I get down there?<eos> You follow the road around the bay, and that'll take you right to their front door.
Excuse me.<eos> You like a homage, so I have a surprise.<eos> You're a friend of Dalayrac's, so you give him the medal.<eos> But I didn't prepare a speech.<eos> -Leave that to me.<eos> In that case...<eos> -I'll start practicing.<eos> The medal's on my desk.<eos> Get it and come to the new canteen.<eos> Take the new lift. Nobody can see you.
- Please, not on my account.<eos> I don't really love him.<eos> - At least you're honest. - Hmm.<eos> Is there a Mrs. Joshua?<eos> Yes, but we're divorced.<eos> That wasn't a proposal.<eos> I'm just curious.<eos> Is your husband with you?<eos> Oh, no, Charles is never with me.<eos> What do people call you? Pete?
Break my hand?<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Be a nice boy and stay in there where you belong.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> What's the matter with that idiot?<eos> Doesn't he know when to quit?<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> We most certainly will not let you out of here, sir.
- No tea?<eos> - Later.<eos> Keep the door locked.<eos> They killed each other.<eos> This must be kept quiet until we reach Trieste.<eos> It will be difficult.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Kerim Bey was a very important man.<eos> With many influential friends.<eos> I'm sure they also will reward you.
I'm supposed to come in.<eos> I'm expected.<eos> - Who by?<eos> - Dr. Markway.<eos> - You better come back later.<eos> - Please.<eos> I'm one of Dr. Markway's guests.<eos> He's expecting me in the house.<eos> Please listen to me.<eos> He can't rightly be expecting you... seeing as you're the only one who's come so far.
And swans and peacocks and... unicorns.<eos> It sounds like a wonderful place for Coquette.<eos> I'd like to get her out of the city.<eos> - She drinks, you know.<eos> - Really? I keep finding empty bottles under the bed.<eos> Well...<eos> Love to invite you to the castle, both of you but I'm sure you wouldn't dream of leaving your young man.<eos> No, I guess not.<eos> - Although sometimes I wonder.<eos> - Is something troubling you?
It's just that... there's this ghastly servant problem right now.<eos> The castle's overrun with plumbers, the moat is leaking.<eos> Besides, I'm a shattered man.<eos> I'd be of no use to you.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> As a matter of fact, I'm on my way to Zurich now.<eos> I wasn't planning to go to England at all.<eos> Going to consult a Swiss doctor, a specialist.<eos> But that's a waste of time.<eos> They can't help you.
I've been very edgy today.<eos> If I said anything about England, I apologize.<eos> I'm glad to hear you say so.<eos> I must say, if I had the misfortune to be a citizen of this benighted country I should be most hesitant in offering any criticism of any other.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Are you knocking this country? Are you saying something against America?<eos> Against it?<eos> I'd be astounded to hear anything said for it.<eos> The whole bloody place is the most unspeakable matriarchy in the history of civilization.<eos> Look at yourself, the way your wife and her strumpet of a mother push you through the hoop.
The show's at 10:30.<eos> I'm all ready.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> How are you, sir?<eos> Anupam?<eos> Let me have a look at you.<eos> Have I changed a lot?<eos> No, I recognize you.<eos> Please sit down.<eos> So what brings you here?
She has been dead for 20 years.<eos> With all respect, Baron, for a ghost, she's very active young woman.<eos> You're speaking of the Baroness von Lepp, my wife.<eos> I beg your pardon, Baron, I meant no offense.<eos> Perhaps the resemblance was not quite as much as I had thought.<eos> The girl at the window-<eos> Lieutenant Duvalier, the only occupants of this castle are Stefan and myself.<eos> You are the first visitor since the turn of the century.<eos> Of course, Baron.<eos> Stefan will see you to your room.
If I don't cause any trouble...<eos> - In no way!<eos> Wait, I'll get in first...<eos> C'mon, get in!<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> Times have changed!<eos> I'm sure about it!<eos> Before, one worked with more solid people!<eos> This one I was talking you about, in his last moment, calmly... - Hey, you see?<eos> It's just that my colleague here, didn't want us to take you...
I have no reason to object, you can do whatever you want, but... society will always need a justice executor...<eos> - That's it!<eos> ...Either you or another... - You see?<eos> Eh? Yes.<eos> But I think that society needs a very... practical one... self-confident... determined...<eos> But if you advise it, if you think it's alright, then...<eos> I'll do it...<eos> Because, in the last moment, I can always turn in my resignation...<eos> Ah, no, no, no!<eos> If I recommend you, you can't make a fool of myself!
And the day after tomorrow I've gotta shake Li Chin -Sung's hand and welcome him to our country.<eos> - Welcome to our country, sir.<eos> - l'm happy to meet you , Mr Pearson .<eos> I want Premier Sung to meet all of you , but he must be very tired after his flight.<eos> - Ted.<eos> - Gentlemen .<eos> Cocktails are being served in the Blue Room, if you'll join me.<eos> We'll be with you shortly.<eos> We're making very good progress.<eos> Within three weeks, American troops challenging you to the south will be withdrawn .
You know, sometimes i wish i'd never heard of you.<eos> You or your job.<eos> If you want a pink slip, write it yourself.<eos> I'm not gonna help you out.<eos> And then i turned around and i knew it was... mercurio!<eos> Señor dexter, señorita arthur.<eos> Ah, señor dexter.<eos> General.<eos> The lovely one.<eos> What brings you to san blas?
So all over again?<eos> Yes, all over again, 99 times so.<eos> DAY NINE<eos> Here comes the ninth day of our story.<eos> You proved a prophet.<eos> I'm here again.<eos> I see.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I've warned you.<eos> We'll accept you, of course, and do what's necessary.
Jules works and sleeps here.<eos> Our life's as organized as in a monastery.<eos> Jules writes his books and hunts his insects and other little creatures.<eos> Mathilde, whom you saw, is the daughter of a nearby farmer.<eos> She helps me with the housework and with Sabine.<eos> My room.<eos> That's Jules.<eos> Yes, his father liked Mozart so much that he dressed him up one day as Mozart.<eos> This is the balcony.<eos> That's the inn where you'll sleep tonight. Jules will take you there later.
Please tell me about Catherine.<eos> For a long time I feared she'd kill herself.<eos> She'd bought a gun. She'd say, "So-and-so killed himself" like others say, "So-and-so died of cholera."<eos> She withdrew into herself like a widow, as if recovering from a serious illness.<eos> She moved in slow motion, with the fixed smile of a corpse.<eos> Gilberte, this is my friend Jules.<eos> Jim's told me so much about you.<eos> I feel like I know you very well.<eos> Does Catherine know you've come to see me? Yes.<eos> She invites you for a ride in her car.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - Intimately? Well, not intimately.<eos> Well, how?<eos> On sight or how?<eos> Well, closer than that.<eos> I worked for the Federal Power Commission when he was chairman.<eos> In his office? No, sir, at a subsidiary agency.<eos> But I knew him before then in Chicago.<eos> I was in one of his classes at the university.<eos> I see. Does he know you?
I'll run you home.<eos> - Come on, hop in.<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, no. No, thanks, Harley.<eos> I've got my car over here.<eos> Brig? Do you feel all right?<eos> Good night, Harley.<eos> Good evening, senator.<eos> - Hi, Mike.<eos> - Senator Smith was around looking for you.
What's that word?<eos> Congress.<eos> The prison grapevine hammered out the news that a Federal Bureau of Prisons had been created by an act of Congress.<eos> Director...<eos> AJ MacLeod.<eos> The new warden who came to Leavenworth was Albert Comstock.<eos> One of the first prisoners he asked to see was Robert Stroud.<eos> - Sit down, please. - Thank you.<eos> You've heard about the formation of the new Bureau of Prisons, of course.<eos> I have several directives from Washington that will affect you personally.
- I think we lost them.<eos> - Mr. O'Shay?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Jacques, the professor's assistant.<eos> - Who is she?<eos> - Slave girl.<eos> She didn't like the fat boy who was buying her.<eos> - No, him fat pig.<eos> - You rescued a slave?<eos> They'll cut you to pieces, and kill the rest of us too.
I can't keep my guys together unless we get some space.<eos> How about getting a detail together and moving this stuff out?<eos> Bottle of brandy, combien?<eos> Sorry, tonight we're off the limits.<eos> One pack or two?<eos> We're not allowed to sell to soldiers tonight.<eos> Two.<eos> It will not be good for you when the MPs get here.<eos> They patrol this section.<eos> There will be trouble if they find you here.
This is not for a person of today.<eos> Sorry!<eos> I kept you waiting Mr. Yasuoka.<eos> Mother. It looks good on you.<eos> Very noble style.<eos> Like Yozeiin in the '47 Ronin'.<eos> Think it funny?<eos> Don't think so.<eos> Come this way, please.<eos> Men from the publishers and newspapers are waiting for you.
Ask him to leave tomorrow.<eos> Give him travel expenses.<eos> Next is a young man from a literary group.<eos> Asking for monthly help: as you're in sympathy with the poor.<eos> Call him a fool!<eos> Must work and earn money for his own magazine.<eos> Do you think I'm cruel.<eos> No.<eos> Please tell me the truth.<eos> One only knowing the present you... might call you a cold person.
My son was driving the car.<eos> When that thing happened.<eos> Yes.<eos> My two youngest, Jack and Mary, are in the same grade as your Lolita.<eos> He's had a terrible shock.<eos> Yes, of course he has.<eos> You know, this isn't easy to talk about, but technically it was the pedestrian's fault and not the driver's.<eos> Technically, you're absolutely right.<eos> You see, it was raining and she ran across the road.<eos> You don't have to explain to me because I have no quarrel with you.
Dutton Peabody, founder, publisher, editor in chief of the "Shinbone Star" once fired me.<eos> I'll be fired if I don't get this interview.<eos> Is it true you're going to...<eos> Here he comes now.<eos> Senator Stoddard, this is a surprise and an honour, sir!<eos> - Maxwell Scott, editor.<eos> - How do you do, Mr Scott?<eos> - This is Mrs Stoddard.<eos> - A pleasure, ma'am.<eos> What brings you back to town, sir?
- No. My dead husband gave it to me.<eos> - Please!<eos> - A widow?<eos> I'll take it...<eos> Take your hands off!<eos> What kind of men are you?<eos> This kind, dude.<eos> Now, what kind of man are you, dude?<eos> I am an attorney at law, and I'm duly licensed by the territory.<eos> You may have us now, but I'll see you in jail for this!
Pardon?<eos> No kidding.<eos> I really mean it.<eos> Crazy French pronunciation and all.<eos> - It's pretty.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> I guess your friends call you Jennie?<eos> Not yet, they haven't, for which I am deeply grateful.<eos> But you may call me Jennie.<eos> What do your friends call you?
- How do you know it's him?<eos> I've known it for a long time.<eos> - Me too.<eos> - Who else could it be?<eos> Shut up!<eos> - You've got a wicked tongue.<eos> - Me?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Good evening, madam.<eos> What brings you here at this hour?
And if I compliment you, it must be marvellous,<eos> Well, thanks,<eos> Sam, I feel great, just great,<eos> - Well, why shouldn't you feel great?<eos> - Huh?<eos> Look, and stop spending so much money on long-distance calls!<eos> I own as many shares in the company as you do,<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> - I just got a letter from Yoko,<eos> I'll read it to you,
- Well, of course.<eos> Look at your cheeks.<eos> They're all flushed.<eos> Well, tell me, does Mrs. Hardwicke...<eos> You're sure she's out?<eos> - Yes, sir. - Yeah.<eos> Well, does she...<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Hilda.<eos> - Well, Hilda, does she work you too hard?
Won't you be seated?<eos> I prefer to stand, thank you.<eos> What I have to say will take very little of your time.<eos> I realize how busy you are.<eos> Not at all.<eos> This is your embassy, Mrs. Hardwicke.<eos> - We're here to serve you.<eos> - Well, I'm not here to be served, although I might have welcomed that speech several months ago when I needed your help.<eos> - However, what I came to see you about...<eos> - Mrs. Hardwicke, we will assist you in any way we possibly can, but we cannot act in what is not in the best interest of Great Britain.
Why are my bags all packed?<eos> This is the two months' rent I owe you, all of it.<eos> Well, wait a minute. Carlye, please, Carlye...<eos> Look, I don't understand this.<eos> First you go see Ambruster on my behalf.<eos> - And then suddenly...<eos> - On your behalf?<eos> Look, Mr. Gridley, I've got my own problems, I don't need yours.<eos> Now, if you'll just leave me alone, I'll be fine.<eos> I'm not going to leave you alone.
Inspector, I am resigning immediately.<eos> I can't possibly cooperate, because now I'm absolutely convinced that Carlye's innocent.<eos> Mr. Gridley, if she's innocent, I'm just as anxious to prove it as you are.<eos> Yes, well, we've been all through that, Inspector.<eos> The statement's evasive and you know it. And I...<eos> Gridley?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Gridley?<eos> Hey, now listen to me very carefully.<eos> If Mrs. Hardwicke is there, if she's there, if she's holding a gun on you, say anything you like, but start the next sentence with Mrs. Hardwicke.
But then, I'm terribly grateful to you for leaving that one little detail out of your story.<eos> Amazing, isn't it, how it's assured me a life of comfort and security?<eos> Why don't you nap till I come back, dear?<eos> This has been a trying day for you, I'm sure.<eos> When I come back I'll fix you a nice hot tub, and then we'll have dinner.<eos> I think I'll have the ground floor done over for myself.<eos> I don't much care for stairs at my age.<eos> Yes, we must do that.<eos> It will be much better, my living with you, rather than that dreadful husband or Mr. Gridley.<eos> At least, my dear, I am a friend who won't betray you.
- Yes!<eos> Hey!<eos> Will you leave alone that poor wretch?<eos> Is it our fault, if he thinks he's a bench?<eos> Don't overdo now!<eos> But if we sit on a real bench, he takes offense.<eos> Come on, get up!<eos> - Oh, what a bore!<eos> Come into my office and see him up face.<eos> Who knows, he may recognize you!
There!<eos> Incredible, incredible!<eos> After 18 years.<eos> When I was already resigned to give up on life, grief in the heart, he reappears before me like a ghost, like a reborn.<eos> Dear Ms. Linda, these things happen. Sometimes life holds for us these surprises.<eos> But we must be certain, though.<eos> You've recognized him from a distance, you've heard his voice, seen his gestures.<eos> And him?<eos> What do we know about him?<eos> What will happen in the brain of that poor wretch when he sees you?
I'd like to throw that money right in his face.<eos> - Would you?<eos> - Yes, I would.<eos> I've waited seven years for this moment. You come with me.<eos> Say, Connie, there's a man dragging Cathy out.<eos> Gee. They don't even give her a chance to eat.<eos> She's gonna spend the rest of her life saying, "I'm not that kind of a girl."<eos> I'm only afraid that some day, before she can finish saying it, she will be.<eos> There you are.<eos> The Manhattan Home for Young Women thanks you for your generous donation and for permitting us to use your name - in our fundraising drive.
What time do you have to be home?<eos> Oh... it all depends.<eos> On what?<eos> Oh... Everett.<eos> - I'll borrow my brother-in-law's car.<eos> - Pick me up at five.<eos> And I'll be waiting... Everett.<eos> Ooh! He's like a snake.<eos> When he smiles, he rattles.<eos> He'll pick you up at five and at one minute past five I'll drop the bombshell on Mr Shayne's lap.
Let Miss Mayella have a good long look at you.<eos> Tom, will you catch this, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, then, this time, will you please catch it with your left hand.<eos> I can't, sir.<eos> Why can't you?<eos> I can't use my left hand at all.<eos> I got it caught in a cotton gin when I was 12 years old.<eos> All my muscles were tore loose.<eos> Is this the man who raped you?
I can't use my left hand at all.<eos> I got it caught in a cotton gin when I was 12 years old.<eos> All my muscles were tore loose.<eos> Is this the man who raped you?<eos> It most certainly is.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know how. He done it.<eos> He just done it.<eos> You have testified... that he choked you and he beat you.<eos> You didn't say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you out cold, but that you turned around... and there he was.
The deacon!<eos> That's what bothers me most:<eos> Our children are in that hypocrite's hands!<eos> Don't be unfair.<eos> Don't deny he was wooing you, to use a euphemism.<eos> But I'd best keep my mouth shut.<eos> - No, speak!<eos> Is our conversation that interesting?<eos> I don't give a damn about you and your pathetic marital problems.<eos> You're an insolent boor, and I've treated you as such since we came here.
Thanks.<eos> You'll present that immediately on arrival.<eos> And when is that?<eos> Immediately.<eos> Tonight?<eos> I hope you won't have too much trouble locating it.<eos> Well if I do these two can always set me straight.<eos> What exactly do you mean?<eos> Aren't they supposed to trail around after me wherever I go, observing my movements?<eos> No... They aren't going to follow you.
Do you want to lose your case?<eos> Looking for somebody?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Isn't the court in session?<eos> Not today.<eos> Why isn't the court in session?<eos> - They'll be sitting tomorrow.<eos> - You sure? Sure, my husband is a guard here.<eos> Guard?<eos> The man who was kissing you is a...
Sorry, what can I do?<eos> Now listen...<eos> Leave him alone. You want to ruin me?<eos> He's just obeying the orders of the examining magistrate.<eos> Alright, alright take her.<eos> You lied to me, didn't you?<eos> - Why should I lie?<eos> - You're not being... taken to the examining magistrate.<eos> - Yes I am.<eos> - You mean to tell me... that the examining magistrate is waiting for you in a place like that.
It's hard enough getting rid of a lover.<eos> With a husband, there's always divorce.<eos> You wouldn't need to...<eos> Kill him? Is that what you wanted to say?<eos> You still think I'm guilty, right?<eos> Don't forget, you're my defence attorney.<eos> -I know, but...<eos> I'm speaking...of love. Olga, Olga I love you!<eos> Counselor, what's your problem?<eos> Olga say yes, I beg you.
- Would you get Miss Wildwood a drink? - Yeah .<eos> Which one's Miss Wildwood?<eos> Mr Berman, we haven't been formally introduced, but I'm Mag Wildwood from Wildwood, Arkansas.<eos> That's hill country.<eos> You just make yourself right at home, senor.<eos> Oh, do not trouble yourself.<eos> I'm contented to stand observing the customs of your country.<eos> Okay, you do that.<eos> Now, come along, Mr Trawler.<eos> Let's see what we can find to amuse you with.
- How tired are you?<eos> - Oh, I'm rested enough.<eos> I've been sitting on planes for 72 hours.<eos> Good.<eos> We'll start breaking you in right away then.<eos> We'll leave for the hospital this morning.<eos> The sooner the better.<eos> Before I clear out of here tomorrow, I'll introduce you to the governor.<eos> You can form your own opinion about him.<eos> And I'll also bring you together with some of the noble Christians of the town. The brethren.
Name of Clarisse, part French, part island.<eos> I can remember when she went to Mass.<eos> - Well, he's a good pilot.<eos> - He's a better salesman, I think.<eos> He's better than I ever was.<eos> You weren't exactly selling the same wares.<eos> No.<eos> - Can I ask a question?<eos> - Why not?<eos> Why, when they insult you that way, do you go on begging?
He didn't!<eos> Then he's dumb. No, he's shy... He waits for me at the street and then comes after me.<eos> And you?<eos> I pretend I don't see him. I walk slower and slower.<eos> What does he do?<eos> Does he reach you? No, he walks slower, too.<eos> But then he's not in love he's from the police.<eos> One moment, I'll see if there's anyone.<eos> Good evening, I'm Federico di Roviano.<eos> Ah, good evening, Mr. Prince! I almost didn't recognize you. Many years have passed.
I'm talking!<eos> That's Susan.<eos> She sticks like glue.<eos> Go without me!<eos> How do you say "anniversaire"?<eos> Birthday.<eos> Today's my birthday.<eos> Want to go to the fair?<eos> - Bye, Cecile.<eos> - I'll never see you again?
Should I be bad... or nice?<eos> Should I surrender?<eos> His pleading words so tenderly entreat me.<eos> Is this the night that love finally defeats me?<eos> Should I avoid his touch?<eos> Should I be a shy pretender?<eos> Should I admit I'd much rather surrender?<eos> Yes?<eos> Miss Templeton, I don't usually discharge employees on the phone. But in your case, I'm making an exception.<eos> I just left Dr. Tyler, and he never heard of you!
- Uffa.<eos> Won't you send someone here! ?<eos> What d'you want from me?<eos> Wanna come and leave at my place?<eos> When you'll feel like it, I also want to pay the rent.<eos> - What month?<eos> - The next three.<eos> I'll have to leave, so I'd like to pay in advance.<eos> Francesco!<eos> Allow my colleagues also to see you... .. you are a rare case.
Yes, yes, of course!<eos> We must be tough, like steel!<eos> Guida, why're you against progress?<eos> I?<eos> I love progress, but I don't like the progressives.<eos> I'll put it better, I don't like fanatics.<eos> Am I a fanatic?<eos> That's how you see me?<eos> No, in fact, seeing you, one would absolutely not think that.<eos> But if they put you in a concentration camp, you'd pull fingernails out, torture the prisoners and break backs.
But the heterograft – in other words, the transplanting of living tissue or organs from one human being to another – has only been possible until now when both subjects in question were perfectly identical from a biological standpoint.<eos> This means biologically modifying the nature of the host organism.<eos> One method involves using heavy X-ray irradiation to destroy the antibodies that create resistance to the heterograft.<eos> Unfortunately, this irradiation requires such a high level of intensity that no human being can survive it.<eos> So we resort to exsanguination.<eos> We drain every last drop of blood from the subject exposed to radiation.<eos> - You just had a call, Professor.<eos> - From whom?<eos> The medico-legal – You know, the morgue.<eos> They want to see you right away.
Have a nice time.<eos> You too, sir.<eos> So I figure, a man in his position, he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.<eos> Instead he takes me to Hamburger Heaven and some schnook's apartment.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Oh!<eos> Miss Kubelik?<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you.
- I believe you.<eos> - Good.<eos> That'll give me a chance to get rid of this silly outfit that I borrowed.<eos> I borrowed this from a Halloween witch I used to date.<eos> It's getting late.<eos> We've got lots to do.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Our dance, Your Highness?<eos> With whom shall I be dancing?<eos> With one who is truly fond of you, and who worships you very much.
Ask Julia for a handkerchief.<eos> I'm shy about going back to the shop.<eos> Julia, a handkerchier.<eos> I tried to excuse you. You know me...<eos> But try to understand Don Hilermo.<eos> You order a vehicle from him, and then you don't show up anymore.<eos> Hold still, Don Anselmo.<eos> One should keep to one's word.<eos> I told him my nephew refuses to pay.<eos> They are waiting for you at the shop.
You can come in.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Emma.<eos> - Don't tire her. She needs to rest.<eos> You can take her home in a couple of hours.<eos> In the meantime, see the brigadier for the report. It's mandatory.<eos> Emma.<eos> Emma, why did you do it?<eos> Tell me.<eos> The brigadier is waiting for you.
- Met?<eos> Yes.<eos> On a Friday night, it was.<eos> Remember? Remember the riot?<eos> Some roughnecks got to whoopin' and hollerin' and fightin', and you yelled<eos> - "Hit him one for the Lord!" - That's what I said.<eos> And that's exactly what I did.<eos> I busted him one for the Lord.<eos> Oh, it was a lovely fight!<eos> When I saw you in Cato, I thought I was seein' an angel, and you haven't changed.
Fire!<eos> Get out!<eos> I'm impressed by what I've heard about you from certain circles.<eos> I'm certain that you had no idea how the gas man was getting you the money.<eos> We would like you to cooperate with us.<eos> Our scientists believe he would willingly appear for you.<eos> Please listen to what the scientists say.<eos> If the gas man accepts your invitation, they can release a large chemical process.<eos> I'm sure you don't believe he used his power for less than noble purposes but you don't know how much of a threat the gas man is to the people of earth.<eos> We'll release you as soon as we have your answer.
If I don't get them, the Indians will.<eos> Passel of them just jumped the reservation.<eos> Burning and killing all over the place.<eos> - It's your money.<eos> - No, it's not. Our deal is off.<eos> - You guaranteed what they owed me.<eos> - Show it to me in writing.<eos> - I got witnesses.<eos> - Not in this town, you ain't.<eos> I'll take you to court.
You get on the stage. Run.<eos> I'm gonna kill you, Healy.<eos> I demand an...<eos> I demand an explanation.<eos> There's a man in our dressing room.<eos> And he's drunk.<eos> That your room?<eos> Hold it, Joe.<eos> They got any other ways in here?<eos> - Who's after you?
Flaco!<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Howdy.<eos> We've come to move you into the village.<eos> - Move into the village?<eos> ! Me?<eos> ! - Everybody who lives outside.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> We can't protect you out here.<eos> Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Follow me, please.<eos> Where are you takin' me?<eos> Jenny?<eos> A gentleman to see you.<eos> Me?<eos> I do not know this man.<eos> - What does he want?<eos> - The name is Sam McCord, and I'm here as a representative of George Pratt.<eos> - Oh, him.<eos> - You'll be happy to hear he's in fine health, and I'm here to fetch you back to Alaska for the wedding.
Everything is gonna be all right.<eos> Please.<eos> Well, Miss Bonnet.<eos> You didn't leave us for long.<eos> No. I'm taking the boat back to Seattle.<eos> - Do you know when I can go aboard?<eos> - Passengers can't load till midnight, ma'am.<eos> Well, do you mind if I wait here until I...?<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Mr Canon expected you.
That can't be.<eos> Nothing's harder than running a 30-man factory.<eos> Is that so?<eos> You're thinner.<eos> Am I? It's stressful changing bars.<eos> - But even prettier.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You like tempura?<eos> - I love it.<eos> I'll treat you tomorrow.
Wear something flashier.<eos> The Carton Bar.<eos> A call for you.<eos> What is it?<eos> No, we can't provide geisha this late.<eos> Give them some sushi, then kick them out.<eos> I'm busy, so I'll be brief.<eos> I paid the 170,000 yen your guests owed at the Lilac so you'd be free to work for me here.<eos> It's just a formality, but please put your seal on this receipt.<eos> I'll collect the money soon and pay you back.
Strange that he'd be coming by ship, but that's how dreams are.<eos> He stood on deck, waving the presents he'd bought me.<eos> Guess what they were.<eos> Potatoes, onions, and radishes.<eos> We married just after the war, when food was scarce.<eos> He often brought vegetables back from his trips.<eos> Seeing those vegetables in the dream made me sad, so I started crying.<eos> I see.<eos> Was he a kind man?<eos> I love you... but I'd prefer a husband.
I've told you there's nothing wrong, except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time.<eos> Now, just a moment.<eos> Turn your motor off, please.<eos> May I see your licence?<eos> -Why?<eos> -Please.<eos> Be with you in a second!<eos> -l'm in no mood for trouble.<eos> -What?<eos> There's an old saying. "The first customer of the day is always the most trouble." But like I say, I'm in no mood for it, so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square that you won't have one human reason...
She had had little life experience.<eos> You know how it is in Paris.<eos> There are more virgins than in any other city.<eos> Proportionally, anyhow.<eos> But that wasn't why I married her.<eos> Why, then?<eos> I got used to her.<eos> We had good times together.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> I may never see you again, so I can speak freely.
Just answer yes or no.<eos> Ask away, I don't promise anything.<eos> After making love, does she pick your blackheads?<eos> Does she or doesn't she?<eos> Shit.<eos> - What a pleasant visit. - Isn't it?<eos> - You don't trust us, do you?<eos> - I do, I do.<eos> We know you're model inmates, but we have our duties.<eos> Good, because we appreciate you.
Something wrong?<eos> No, but is everything all right now with your sister?<eos> Yes, she's living with her gang at the Hotel Boileau<eos> - Do you care?<eos> - No, but it was my fault<eos> If she does anything foolish, I'll feel sort of responsible<eos> Forget about it<eos> It's wonder-boy<eos> More like this<eos> - What brings you here?
- Stop!<eos> - Take the plate number!<eos> Play it at the lottery!<eos> - Why did you beat them up?<eos> - I didn't like me!<eos> There is one!<eos> - What's your price?<eos> - This one's good for you!<eos> - Do you like him?<eos> I'll buy you for him.
I wonder how it will end.<eos> - It's close to midnight, Lance.<eos> - Okay, I'll be down in a minute.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - Your host, my dear.<eos> It's almost midnight, Nora.<eos> We're all going to get together down in the living room.<eos> Alright Mr. Loren, I'll be right down.<eos> Come with us.<eos> Come with us, before he kills you.
These are our guests.<eos> Ruth Bridgers.<eos> Dr. Trent.<eos> You know Watson Pritchard, of course.<eos> Nora Manning and... This is Lance Schroeder.<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Now what about the 10 thousand?<eos> I don't care.<eos> He wants to kill me.<eos> Who wants to kill you?
He tried to kill me.<eos> He grabbed me and choked me and put me in that room. And then he went away and left me.<eos> Who?<eos> He thought I was dead.<eos> Who?<eos> Mr. Loren.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It... it was dark, but it must have been him.<eos> Has anybody seen you since he left you?
- How can you be so sure?<eos> - She tried to warn me.<eos> Asked me to help her.<eos> The doc thinks he is going to try and kill one of us.<eos> Now there must be a way out of this place and I'm going to find it and get the police before he does.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> But if he finds out you're alive...<eos> No, Nora, you're safer here than any place else.<eos> Now just lock yourself in and keep quiet.<eos> If I find a way out, I'll come back and get you.
- I don't know, Mario.<eos> - In which tram?<eos> - I don't know, no idea.<eos> The officer said... You'd let the burglars in.<eos> And I said...<eos> No, I didn't let anybody in.<eos> I didn't open up for no one.<eos> Because if I would have said he has been inside they would suspect him.<eos> Because they are crazy.<eos> They just declare you guilty and lock you up, like me...
-Do you think they mean business ?<eos> -We can't afford to take any chances.<eos> Come over here.<eos> You ever been to Hollywood ?<eos> -Oh a couple of times.<eos> A few years ago.<eos> -You're going to be there in the morning.<eos> Just a few minutes from Hollywood, in the town of San Fernando, reports have come in of saucers flying so low the exhaust knocked people to the ground.<eos> There have even been stated claims of saucer landings.<eos> Major Carlson will replace you while you're out there.
I will not tolerate intemperance of this sort.<eos> If you once again try the patience of this court I shall hold you in contempt.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your Honour I apologise.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> The witness' answer will be stricken and the jury will disregard the answer.<eos> Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Mr. Lemon.<eos> On the night when Lt. Manion awakened you and turned himself in had you been awakened before?
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler.<eos> I wouldn't interfere with your signals to Mrs. Manion.<eos> I object to the implication I was signalling.<eos> This is the shabbiest courtroom trick I've ever seen.<eos> You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.<eos> I ask the court to rule on my objection.<eos> Will you be careful not to place yourself between Mr. Biegler and his witness?<eos> Of course, Your Honour.<eos> Anything else, Mr. Biegler?<eos> You do it again, I'll punt you all the way out into the middle of Lake Superior.
No, we will bivouac in your woods for the night.<eos> Sleeping on the cold, cold ground?<eos> When is this awful, wasteful, terrible struggle going to end, Colonel?<eos> Brother against brother...<eos> And during our stay no one will be allowed to leave the premises.<eos> Wherever would we go, Colonel?<eos> I'm sure you must agree that this war makes loneliness for everyone.<eos> Also, I must commandeer most of the grain and horses, if you have any.<eos> You will be paid, Miss Hunter, for everything, in Union greenbacks.<eos> We will not bother you any longer.
- Do me a favor, Doctor.<eos> I learned of his frequent visits here from my daughter.<eos> But please don't tell him that I came today.<eos> Should he learn that I know his secret, he may worry.<eos> I should think so.<eos> You, too, Kimura.<eos> I know, Ma'am.<eos> I'll pay you a visit tonight with some karusumi.<eos> Karusumi is delicious.<eos> We haven't seen you in weeks, Toshiko will be pleased.
Don't pay any attention to it... The usual exaggerations from my admirers.<eos> Admirers, my foot.<eos> They never had enough evidence against you... Sure, I get it...<eos> You're the king of the alibi.<eos> The king of ubiquity.<eos> You're ubiquitous.<eos> -Do you think so?<eos> Silence.<eos> You're ubiquitous, admit it.<eos> What did your friends call you?
We must love our homeland, because many beautiful teachers work here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> The floor has just been painted.<eos> Will you please go out.<eos> Ewa!<eos> You went to Saint Hedwig's middle school.<eos> You were proud, surrounded by friends.<eos> I was too shy to bow to you.<eos> I don't know you. lt was a long time ago.
-Exactly.<eos> Like that business about the seven parking tickets?<eos> What I mean is, the moment I meet an attractive woman I have to start pretending I've no desire to make love to her.<eos> What makes you think you have to conceal it?<eos> She might find the idea objectionable.<eos> Then again, she might not.<eos> Think how lucky I am to have been seated here.<eos> Luck had nothing to do with it.<eos> Fate?<eos> I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here if you should come in.
She's worth every dollar of it, take it from me.<eos> She puts her heart into her work.<eos> In fact her whole body.<eos> Sold to Mr. Vandamm at $700.<eos> Has anyone told you that you overplay your various roles rather severely?<eos> First, you're the outraged Madison Avenue man who claims he's been mistaken for someone else.<eos> Then, you play the fugitive trying to clear his name of a crime he didn't commit.<eos> Now you play the peevish lover stung by jealousy and betrayal.<eos> It seems you fellows could stand less training from the FBI and more from the Actors' Studio.<eos> Apparently, the only performance that will satisfy you is when I play dead.
- Carlos.<eos> - Señor Chance.<eos> I been looking for you.<eos> - It is very bad, señor.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Your friend Señor Wheeler.<eos> - What about him?<eos> He is a good friend, and he wishes good for you, so he talks.<eos> He talks to people. He talk to everybody.<eos> He say, why they don't help you, that you should have some more help.
You losers can help yourself to what's on the table.<eos> Thanks, Colorado.<eos> Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?<eos> I guess I was wrong about you having those cards.<eos> Is that all, Sheriff?<eos> I'm not gonna apologize, if that's what you mean.<eos> We haven't gotten past that handbill, have we?<eos> That's right.<eos> You haven't done anything to make me think we will.<eos> Idea of being searched didn't bother you much.
- Oh, a dancer.<eos> Why, that's great.<eos> - Are you a ballet dancer?<eos> - Oh, no, exotic.<eos> Oh, you don't know what that is, do you?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> - It's, uh, sort of modern, only more exotic.<eos> That sounds terrific.<eos> Listen, would you mind if I came to see you perform sometime?<eos> Oh, no. The very next time, I'll invite you.
When he refused my advances, I denounced him as a lecher.<eos> After that, I was punished.<eos> Was it true?<eos> That I was punished?<eos> Yes.<eos> - That you accused him unjustly.<eos> - Of course I accused him unjustly.<eos> After all, I'm insane.<eos> It's the sort of thing an insane woman would do.<eos> Besides, haven't you noticed how oddly I've been looking at you?
Major, you know how long we ain't had no smokes?<eos> I know.<eos> Well, you tell her that we don't like it.<eos> You tell her that she taunts us much more someone's gonna light them cigarettes and stuff them down her throat.<eos> Sergeant, you carry a tune very well.<eos> Do you know any Mexican songs?<eos> Mount up.<eos> Major.<eos> What will happen to me after we get to Cordura?<eos> I turn you over to the provost marshal.
Father.<eos> You've no right to ask a woman to bear this.<eos> I can't go on.<eos> I don't care if he dies.<eos> I don't care if they all die.<eos> They can get their medals in hell.<eos> That's where they're going.<eos> And as for you, Thorn, you're crazy.<eos> Military crazy.<eos> And I hope they kill you and put you out of your misery.
What did you say, Mr. Wormold?<eos> I said I might have spoken to him.<eos> What does that prove?<eos> I do not have to prove anything, Mr. Wormold.<eos> It is my job to know what goes on in Havana.<eos> This is a deportation order, Mr. Wormold.<eos> The names are not filled in yet.<eos> Because you have no evidence.<eos> Because Havana would be poorer without your daughter.<eos> But if I'm to do something to protect you, you must do something in return.
But you're crazy!<eos> I'm not interested in your employers.<eos> But the information you supply to them, you will also supply to me.<eos> But this is all rubbish.<eos> There will, be adequate funds deposited to your bank account.<eos> What?<eos> She's a good shot, our lady of the soda water.<eos> I don't want to leave Havana, Captain Segura.<eos> Perhaps you can persuade Mr. Wormold.<eos> One day I'll beat you at that damn game.
No, thank you.<eos> Perhaps you would prefer a dry martini, sir.<eos> Is your name Louis?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Would you like a Scotch, sherry, Old-Fashioned?<eos> I'm not drinking.<eos> You'd do better to drink all you can.<eos> My name's MacDougal.<eos> It seems we're sitting together.<eos> I haven't met you before, have I?
Well, let's take him out, shall we?<eos> Mr. Wormold.<eos> I was glad you've agreed to work for me.<eos> I have wanted our relationship to be closer.<eos> What's going on out there?<eos> Nothing to concern us.<eos> And now that you have agreed to work for me, it is easier to approach you on a subject which is important.<eos> I have come to ask for the hand of your daughter.<eos> Aren't you a rather uncertain life?<eos> They call you the Red Vulture.
I'm building a 4 floors building, I need the cash!<eos> What?<eos> I made a family, I had the wedding journey, my sun glasses are broken, I have signed checks and I want the cash!<eos> And who cares! ?<eos> And who cares! ?<eos> But I hit him in the head with the books!<eos> Ah, his sister-in-law died...<eos> poor one!<eos> And who cares! ?<eos> If you go to the funeral of your sister-in-law I send you to jail!
The project has already been rejected by the committee.<eos> Then there is only to thank the cretin who rejected the project. - Oh yes?<eos> And then know that I am the cretin who rejected the project!<eos> And now that I know you, I say I did well!<eos> - Please allow me...<eos> - Do not be surprised, I know her situation, you are on the verge of bankruptcy.<eos> But when one begins without initial capital and with the liquid shortage that there is today...<eos> And would you like become a industrial without initial capital?<eos> And you want to keep me from having ambitions just because I did not have the luck that you had?<eos> Thanks to that poor woman of his wife who is watching you, if not I already have hit you in the face.
I said buy me a drink.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> You sleep with my daughter but won't buy me a drink?<eos> I'll have you know she's a minor.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> I forbid you to touch my daughter, you hear?<eos> The law's on my side, bastard!<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> Fine. I'll buy you a drink.<eos> Mrs. Chaunier will serve you.
- I'm a cad.<eos> Goodbye, Merle.<eos> I almost forgot my hat.<eos> - Good morning, Tina.<eos> Nice Christmas? - Very nice.<eos> And yours?<eos> Superb!<eos> The mail is on your desk.<eos> And Mr. White is in, and the Faulkner galleys are ready.<eos> And that gentleman is waiting to see you.
Of course.<eos> Redlitch, I'm glad to see you.<eos> I'm astonished to see you.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I was talking to some people just the other night about you only I understood you were in Mexico.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> You see, there is this new book that I am about to get into.<eos> All of a sudden, I get this uncontrollable urge to talk with you about it.<eos> First, I figured I'd write to you and then I thought maybe I'd phone.<eos> All of a sudden, I decided I had to see you so I grabbed a plane, and here I am.
- I can go on with a spoof.<eos> - Spoof?<eos> - Silly, isn't it?<eos> - It certainly is silly.<eos> I don't intend to be the laughingstock of the trade by publishing it.<eos> - But every word is gospel, boy, gospel.<eos> - What's the use, Sid?<eos> He isn't having any.<eos> This is my hour of grief.<eos> Sidney, maybe we can find something to tide you over.
Whoa, boy!<eos> Whoa, boy!<eos> Howdy, Miss Terrill.<eos> That wasn't very social back there.<eos> Well!<eos> Whaddaya know?<eos> We got a gentleman with us.<eos> Don't it make you boys feel kinda dirty to look at such a handsome gentleman all dressed up in a fancy suit?<eos> Miss Terrill, ain't you gonna introduce me to your intended?<eos> I wouldn't introduce you to a dog.
- Where are you goin'<eos> - I'm in a mood to go courtin'<eos> The schoolmarm?<eos> How are your lessons comin' You gonna get promoted?<eos> Surprised you, didn't I?<eos> You shoulda seen yourself. You jumped like a shot deer.<eos> - Knock before you come in.<eos> - I knocked.<eos> You didn't hear me.<eos> Well, don't come in until I hear you.
Mornin', Major.<eos> The boys always try to put a stranger on Old Thunder.<eos> - Sort of a standing joke.<eos> - I see.<eos> What time do you want to start, Major?<eos> Any time.<eos> Just let me know when you're ready.<eos> Have some breakfast with me, Jim.<eos> My daughter's not an early riser, as you'll soon discover.<eos> Don't let anything Steve Leech said bother you.
- See if she's lying, Steve.<eos> - Jessy!<eos> Come here.<eos> Search every one of these shacks.<eos> You stay out of this house!<eos> I hope you're enjoying yourself, Major!<eos> He's not in there.<eos> You want that, Major?<eos> Let 'em have their fun.<eos> You look mighty fine on your horse, Major Terrill, but someday somebody's gonna pull you off.
You're a very persuasive man, Mr. McKay.<eos> Let's head back and draw up a paper before I change my mind.<eos> I don't know where else to look.<eos> We'll try it again at first light.<eos> Don't shoot, boys.<eos> I'll come peaceable.<eos> If that's coffee, I wouldn't mind having a little.<eos> You fellows on a roundup?<eos> Roundup?<eos> We've been looking for you since yesterday.
What do you want, Mr. Hannassey?<eos> I've wanted a lot of things in my life, most of which I never got.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Mandy!<eos> Bring the lady some supper.<eos> - Me too, Pa.<eos> - You do your own yelling', boy.<eos> People will be coming after me.<eos> I hope they bring a rope.<eos> They'll be comin' after you, all right.
I wrote to explain the whole thing.<eos> I never expected to see you again.<eos> - Why didn't you wait?<eos> - Please, you must leave now.<eos> - I'm not permitted to see you alone.<eos> - Why didn't you wait?<eos> I should explain, Manuel that Senor Harris is a friend from Chicago.<eos> And I should explain to you, Maria, that you are my wife.<eos> You will of course not wish to see her again, alone.<eos> I believe Senor Reece is waiting for you.
I thought it was Mizoguchi.<eos> Where is he, so late?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I counted the admission fees.<eos> - 5,800 yen.<eos> - Good.<eos> Good night. I'll be going now.<eos> - Now?<eos> - Is something...<eos> Please, tell me if something is bothering you.
How can you say that when you're part white?<eos> I'm half white.<eos> In your world, I can only be a second-class citizen.<eos> I chose China because here I'm allowed to be of value.<eos> That's why I came here. To be of value.<eos> How?<eos> By trying to make people believe what you believe?<eos> By saving souls who don't want to be saved? Who will agree to anything for an extra bowl of rice and laugh at you once it is eaten?<eos> To argue about such things is to argue about shadows.<eos> The dangers that confront you, those are real.
Maybe the women have their feet unbound. Mandarin is pleased with his new servant.<eos> She has done well.<eos> As reward, he make you official foot inspector.<eos> You will also carry messages for him to the far villages and stop foot-binding everywhere.<eos> Besides all this honor, he give you a horse for your journeys and one yuan a month pay.<eos> I'm not staying in Yang Cheng to be his foot inspector. I've got to run the inn.<eos> I want credit arranged with the food merchants.<eos> And when I take his messages to the people, I am also going to tell them of my own beliefs.<eos> It's only with honesty that I can take this job, though it was not with honesty or kindness -that he offered it to me.<eos> - Mandarin agree to what you ask and forgive you for the way you speak to him this time.
It is unfair to goad him into danger.<eos> I would not order him in there to die, Jen-ai.<eos> In this mood, the convicts would kill anyone who tried to reason with them.<eos> But it is his duty to restore order, not to slaughter people.<eos> Let others go in.<eos> I will not.<eos> This riot is not of my making.<eos> I am not responsible.<eos> You're responsible for order in the prison.<eos> I've heard that you say everywhere that you have a god who protects you from harm.
- Address and telephone number?<eos> - 23 Cederdalsgatan.<eos> 201879.<eos> - And what is your occupation?<eos> - I work at the Agency for Education.<eos> You may write "Secretary".<eos> When was the first day of your last period?<eos> I can't remember, Nurse.<eos> When the doctor said we had to hurry...<eos> The doctor will see you as soon as he can.
- Tables, desks.<eos> - Mueller, you're a thief.<eos> I'm a collector, sir.<eos> Bungo Pete!<eos> Let's put him next to his Akikaze destroyer.<eos> The unknown factor.<eos> The sea dragon of Area 7.<eos> There's nothing superhuman about him or the area.<eos> Too bad they'll never give you another chance in that area.<eos> Four submarines sunk in the Bungo Straits, and they keep you behind a desk for something they can't even figure out.
Perhaps I am intruding.<eos> You were just going out, no?<eos> Only with a general. l`ll tell him I kept him waiting for a lieutenant.<eos> - Well, in that case, I...<eos> - Vodka?<eos> - Yes, wonderful.<eos> - l have some direct from the Ukraine.<eos> And how is the captain?<eos> He`s fine.<eos> He asked me to give you his tenderest regards and to tell you that he thinks of you constantly.
The charges!<eos> Don't wait for the train.<eos> Do it now!<eos> If Saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 10 minutes.<eos> If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.<eos> Why?<eos> You'll get a better view from the bridge.<eos> It's hard to explain, sir. I'd rather not be a part of it.<eos> As you please.<eos> Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
You carried out your plan, you louses!<eos> You wanted my job, didn't you?<eos> I'll teach you a lesson!<eos> Calm down!<eos> What's happening here?<eos> What's the meaning of this?<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hold on.<eos> You cannot drive is such condition.<eos> Someone will replace you.
Order books.<eos> - A large order, so she can't refuse.<eos> - $50 worth?<eos> Yes, $50 worth if necessary.<eos> $50 to get her up here.<eos> We'll have to drug her to get her to Paris.<eos> Miss Prescott, please.<eos> - Lettie, you'd better come out here.<eos> - I've got the books she ordered.<eos> Miss Prescott's secretary will deal with you.
Oh, how could I be a model?<eos> I have no illusions about my looks.<eos> I think my face is funny.<eos> That's what Maggie said.<eos> I hate to admit it, but she's right.<eos> What you call funny, I call interesting.<eos> It's too ridiculous even to think about.<eos> - I couldn't do it.<eos> - Let me be the judge of that.<eos> I wouldn't take you to Paris if I didn't think you'd work out.
We realise what futile lives we lead.<eos> - When did you realise this?<eos> - Today.<eos> At about two o'clock.<eos> - Just after lunch.<eos> - Professor, don't believe them.<eos> We want to sit at your feet and learn.<eos> We sit at your feet, ignorant, but so willing.<eos> You leave his feet alone.<eos> Professor, they want to make a fool of you.
What is it?<eos> Relax, Doctor, you can't tell me anything I haven't imagined.<eos> You are getting smaller.<eos> I... I don't profess to understand it, Mr. Carey.<eos> There's no medical precedent for what's happening to you.<eos> I simply know that you're getting smaller.<eos> The X-rays prove it beyond any doubt.<eos> But that's impossible.<eos> That's what we've always believed, Mrs. Carey.<eos> I'm gonna send you to the California Medical Research Institute.
A man's ship is torpedoed, he loses all his uniforms, the pay accounts get lost he can't get paid.<eos> Then shore patrol expects him to own blues or stay indoors.<eos> Sometimes I wonder if they know there's a war.<eos> - I'm sorry, commander.<eos> - Don't apologize.<eos> We try to be reasonable.<eos> So many others try to take advantage of us.<eos> I reported a three-striper tonight.<eos> He said he'd talk to the admiral but I put him on report just the same.<eos> But I'm gonna let you off, commander.
- Just when I don't need it, I get it.<eos> CREWSON: What?<eos> A limp.<eos> CREWSON:<eos> Come on. Never mind.<eos> We'll help you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Oh, hello, Miss Kratchna.<eos> - We've been calling you all day.
I know what you use for bait.<eos> Here.<eos> Maybe this will help you get a girl.<eos> My, my.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Women.<eos> You don't have to worry, commander.<eos> Nothing bad this time.<eos> Just the papers for you to sign, you know.<eos> Detaching you from combat and assigning you to special services.
Do you realize you can't start a war without paper?<eos> After all, on what is the declaration of war written?<eos> Then you're drafted. "Greetings from the president to John J. Doe. "<eos> - That's paper, isn't it?<eos> - I enlisted.<eos> But your commission.<eos> Paper.<eos> Your manual of arms, your training books.<eos> Paper.<eos> The orders sending you into combat.
- To do what? - Throw it away!<eos> "The one that's been forgotten, forgets not today, tomorrow, and for ever. "<eos> Amen.<eos> He sure wrote a lot, that Carmine!<eos> I was going by...<eos> Hello, Marisa. Come in.<eos> - I wanted to thank you.<eos> This station is like my house.<eos> I can't picture myself anywhere else.<eos> There'll come a day when someone will take you away.
How did you know I was here?<eos> Isn't it the scientist who always calls what he can't explain otherwise... by the word "coincidence"?<eos> Let's call this coincidence.<eos> I wouldn't like to think I'd been followed from my hotel this morning.<eos> I assure you, you weren't followed.<eos> I just thought it might be profiitable for both of us to meet, you see.<eos> It's rather diffiicult to talk here.<eos> Why not come out to my place in the country?<eos> The book's there.<eos> If I don't fiind what I want, I might take you up on that.
Let them go.<eos> All right, Mother.<eos> Come along with me.<eos> But I tell you, it did sound like my uncle's voice. But I tell you, it did sound like my uncle's voice.<eos> It was Mr. Meek doing voice impersonations.<eos> And your supposed friend, Mrs. Karswell, states the whole thing.<eos> She's looking out for her son's interests, not mine.<eos> Tomorrow's the 28th.<eos> That would be a real miracle if Karswell could change time.<eos> What if we did fiind he really had a translation of that book. Would that convince you that there is something in all this?
Tomorrow's the 28th.<eos> That would be a real miracle if Karswell could change time.<eos> What if we did fiind he really had a translation of that book. Would that convince you that there is something in all this?<eos> It might help.<eos> Then I'm going to Karswell's house to see if I can fiind it.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Aren't you even going to try to stop me?<eos> It would be easier to stop Karswell's demon... than a woman who has her mind made up.<eos> No lights are showing.<eos> If anybody fiinds you there, the charge will be burglary.
Come back!<eos> You're running away?<eos> - Very courageous!<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> Nothing, nothing...<eos> Did you see what they're like?<eos> They enjoy bothering people.<eos> What idiots...<eos> If you hadn't run off, just then, on the bridge you wouldn't have been bothered like that.<eos> Look, I don't know you.
What good dancers they are!<eos> Can you dance that well?<eos> - I can dance.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I used to come here often.<eos> No, not here.<eos> I was transferred to this town only recently.<eos> Only two weeks ago.<eos> I meant in places like this.<eos> Your grandmother keep you pinned to her,
Don't quibble over fractions.<eos> The fact remains... a good part of your men never left their own trenches.<eos> Colonel Dax, I'm going to have ten men from each company in your regiment... tried under penalty of death for cowardice.<eos> - Penalty of death?<eos> - For cowardice!<eos> They've skim milk in their veins instead of blood.<eos> It's the reddest milk I've ever seen.<eos> My trenches are soaked with it!<eos> - That's just about enough out of you.<eos> - I'm not gonna mince words-- If you continue in this manner, I shall be forced to place you under arrest.
- Good evening.<eos> - Come and sit down.<eos> Thank you, sir. I-<eos> - I'm really sorry to intrude on you in this way. Not at all.<eos> Always delighted to see you, Colonel Dax.<eos> Will you have a cigar?<eos> No, thank you, sir.<eos> - Well, l--<eos> - Think you'll find it delicious.<eos> I must apologize for not inviting you to the party tonight... but I'm afraid that it's a dress affair.
Evald understands and respects me.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But he also hates you.<eos> What exactly have you got against me?<eos> - Do you want an honest answer?<eos> - I'm asking you. You're an inveterate egotist.<eos> You're completely ruthless, you've never listened to anyone but yourself.<eos> It's well-masked by your old man's finesse and your amiability.<eos> But you're an inflexible egotist.<eos> The world may see you as a great philanthropist.
They won't take him back.<eos> He wasn't really discharged, you know, he was expelled for conduct unbecoming a cardiac patient.<eos> Put these in water, blabbermouth!<eos> Come on in, Carter.<eos> Look at this room.<eos> It's ugly, old and musty.<eos> But I never knew I could miss anything so much.<eos> - Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.<eos> - Oh, thank you, sir.<eos> I'm not a religious man, but when they carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.
We'd better go upstairs now, get undressed and lie down.<eos> - We?<eos> What a nauseating prospect.<eos> - Upstairs, please.<eos> Are you aware that, while on my sickbed, I seriously considered strangling you with one of your own rubber tubes.<eos> I would then have admitted the crime, retained myself for the defense.<eos> My lord, members of the jury, I hereby enter a plea of justifiable homicide.<eos> For four months this alleged angel of mercy has pored, probed, punctured, pillaged and plundered my helpless body while tormenting my mind with a steady drip of baby talk.<eos> Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.<eos> Take your hands off me, or I'll strike you with my cane.
Whatever your gambit may be, do you know that, under British law, you cannot be called to give testimony damaging to your husband?<eos> How very convenient.<eos> We are dealing with a capital crime.<eos> The prosecution will try to hang your husband.<eos> He is not my husband.<eos> Leonard and I went through a form of marriage, but I had a husband living somewhere in East Germany, in the Russian zone.<eos> - Did you tell Leonard?<eos> - I did not. It would have been stupid.<eos> He would not have married me and I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.<eos> But he did marry you and brought you safely here.

You lied, did you not?<eos> Just yes or no, please.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And in arranging the marriage, you lied to the authorities?<eos> I, um, did not tell the truth to the authorities.<eos> - You lied to them?<eos> And in the ceremony, when you swore to love, honor and cherish your husband,<eos> - that too was a lie?<eos> And when the police questioned you about this wretched man who believed himself married and loved,
- Any news?<eos> One moment, eh!<eos> 2 X, 2.<eos> Put me with 10, Balestrazzi with 5,<eos> - and the usher with 2.<eos> - The usher.<eos> - And you?<eos> - No, not me.<eos> - Any news?<eos> - Your office manager was looking for you.
What, what're you doing to me?<eos> We'll give you a nice little injection, and then a nice little cut.<eos> - Are you putting me to sleep?<eos> - Local anethesia, only here.<eos> It's better not to put me to sleep, I'm calmer awake.<eos> And then, if you do it tomorrow, never even, I'd be much better, sister.<eos> Such a kiddie!<eos> Imagine I've had five operations and I'll do it all over again.<eos> It's so reposing.<eos> Stay calm and think of your fiancee, who's here, waiting for you.
I'll write a letter to The Times.<eos> -I say, Hinshaw.<eos> -Yes, Mr. Mockridge?<eos> Must we have that confounded animal around here, stamping its feet?<eos> -Mind the horses!<eos> -That bloke is barmy!<eos> There's a sight!<eos> Move over!<eos> Move that confounded contraption!<eos> When I placed you with Mr. Fogg a fortnight ago...
Those homemade American trains.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Well-played, Dennis.<eos> You have a natural aptitude for the game.<eos> Perfected by four years of practice at Oxford.<eos> I did nothing else.<eos> Cost my poor old governor over Pound12,000.<eos> Worth every penny of it.<eos> Hello, Sir Wilmette.<eos> Haven't seen you in donkey's years.
You're burning her up too fast.<eos> You'll never make it.<eos> Just steer the ship, Captain.<eos> Don't speculate.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Why are we slowing down?<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> They just put the last teaspoon of coal in the old scow.<eos> It's all finished, Mr. Fogg.<eos> Still got a little breeze left, but I don't think it'll get you there in time.
Is there anything that you particularly want?<eos> Many things, ma'am, I would not know where to start from.<eos> Up, let's see together.<eos> Maybe your family is not in good shape? - Not quite.<eos> - I imagined.<eos> You ought to be very poor or very rich to be so honest.<eos> Do you work?<eos> No, it's so hard to find a place.<eos> I'm finishing a typing course.<eos> - So a good job would please you. It would be nice!
Thanks for giving it to me.<eos> Did you like it?<eos> I often think of you, Donatella.<eos> - Really?<eos> - yes.<eos> And she?<eos> Yes, of course, too.<eos> - Like me?<eos> - I do not know this. How do you think?<eos> It 's weird, Donatella, we know you recently, in fact,... yet for me it's like if I've known you forever.
Morbius is in his study, sir.<eos> Never to be disturbed while that door is closed.<eos> All right, we'll wait.<eos> Is there any other way out of there?<eos> This is the only door.<eos> In case you require anything, gentlemen, use the beamer.<eos> How could he have slipped past two sentries?<eos> Nothing important, skipper.<eos> Doc, you stay right there where you are and keep your eye on that door.<eos> Okay, skipper, and if Morbius comes out, we'll call you from right here.
Annul it colleague lord!<eos> Nothing will be trouble then!<eos> I may not annul it.<eos> What you say here, it only explaining.<eos> I did not write a word about politics,<eos> I wrote about Hannibal's death, from nothing.<eos> And if I have truth, this one of the largest discoveries of the modern classic philosophy.<eos> I may not annul this. Only if it is disproved scientifically.<eos> The my cult government initiates a disciplinary action against you.<eos> Onto the time of the examination I suspend you from your teachership.
Now you're amazing,<eos> That is because American women are superficial,<eos> They're interested chiefly in nail polish and false busoms,<eos> Yeah, they're inclined to make mountains out of mole hills, I'm going to say,<eos> I find it hard to understand how a man of your intelligence and sensitivity is not a Communist,<eos> You'd have to blame that on my environment,<eos> I see you're one of the victims of capitalistic propaganda,<eos> Yeah, just a pushover,<eos> You know, baby, despite those medals, you're cute, Soft as a bunny's ear, Thank you, baby,<eos> If I could bring you back to Moscow,
She hasn't come back yet, huh?<eos> At least nobody's seen her.<eos> All right, now you go back to the hotel.<eos> And see if you can find out what's going on.<eos> It's so unlike my wife.<eos> I'll take care of the police and join you as soon as I can.<eos> Look here.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's probably some stupid misunderstanding.<eos> If I find anything out before you get back, I'll telephone you here.
Report back here. I see.<eos> Very good, sir.<eos> Walden, you stand by till the car arrives from the Yard.<eos> That's all, Matthews.<eos> You're not leaving?<eos> Orders, madam.<eos> Can we give you a lift somewhere?<eos> Yes, take me to Albert Hall, please.<eos> I'm afraid the Albert Hall's a little bit off our beat.<eos> Suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank?
His aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect.<eos> The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm.<eos> Worse than useless.<eos> Then your French friend panicked, made a fatal crash, landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.<eos> I don't see how you can blame me for that, sir.<eos> He was warmly recommended by our people in Marrakech.<eos> I'm glad that you are able to treat the matter so lightly.<eos> I'm holding a reception here this evening.<eos> In a few moments, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor when I hoped and expected that he would be totally unable to attend.<eos> That amuses you, no doubt.
I'm from those same goldfields myself.<eos> Uh....<eos> Is your Uncle Morse an old codger, around sixtyish, maybe?<eos> With a drooping moustache and a-- That sounds like him.<eos> Do you know Uncle Morse?<eos> Knew him well in Sacramento.<eos> Put her there, Miss Emma.<eos> How do you do, Miss-- Nell Cutts, just call me Nell.<eos> You know an interview with Miss Lizzie Borden... twelve months after might be real interesting.<eos> Dear Lizzie will never see you.
I've been around here.<eos> Ever been in this store ? No.<eos> The liquor store ?<eos> No.<eos> Now, if you'll just walk into this liquor store walk to the back of the store, turn around and come back here.<eos> - In... ? - Walk in walk to the back of the store, turn around and come out again.<eos> - Won't that look funny ?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> You're just helping us out.<eos> The fella in the store is expecting you.
Won't you come in, Captain...?<eos> - Curtis.<eos> - Come in, Captain Curtis.<eos> I was just about to have some tea.<eos> Won't you join me?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I'm sure Sheila won't be long.<eos> - Won't you sit down?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Was she expecting you?
When you've been married 25 years, as I have, you'll look back and wonder...<eos> But never mind that.<eos> One more word from you, and I'll be forced to have you disciplined.<eos> Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.<eos> Now, here's a problem for that charming Captain Curtis to handle.<eos> I have a funny hunch he's working on it.<eos> - Miss Winthrop...<eos> - You're wasting time, colonel.<eos> You hear that?<eos> The whole blooming Army is calling for you.
Do!<eos> Two on hand down, two on hand up!<eos> Re!<eos> You'll need twenty years to learn to play the piano.<eos> You played a Fa instead of a Re!<eos> ~ Two on hand down, two on hand up!<eos> ~ Re!<eos> ~ Bravo!<eos> Mi...<eos> ~ Some guy's looking for you.
Look at that.<eos> How about it, Glenn?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, I'm coming.<eos> Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but I lost my way.<eos> Would you direct me to the Bowden Dairy?<eos> There are no dairies close by...<eos> Take it easy, lady!<eos> Easy, I said!<eos> You scream and the kid'll come home and find you in a pool of blood.
- Rip it out.<eos> - There's one next door.<eos> - What's on your mind?<eos> - I know what you're planning.<eos> - You're not taking anyone along.<eos> - Say, that's not a bad idea.<eos> - I never thought of that.<eos> - You thought of it, all the way.<eos> You give us a fair shake, we'll give you a fair shake.<eos> As soon as the dough gets here, we'll take you with us.
Tonight, I sang in public for the first time.<eos> And thanks to you for kicking out that scoundrel.<eos> An ugly place that theater. I've never seen a spectator like you before.<eos> - No? But, tell me, how did you wind up there?<eos> A tourist's curiosity.<eos> - Then, you don't live in Rome?<eos> No, I'm here for the horserace at the Piazza di Sienna.<eos> I've a few days before I return to Paris.<eos> The hospital!<eos> Thank you, thank you so much.
- Bendrix.<eos> Well, you're almost a stranger.<eos> What are you doing out in the rain?<eos> Oh, just wanted a spot of air.<eos> And Sarah's out for the evening somewhere.<eos> - The cinema?<eos> - Oh, no, no.<eos> She hardly ever goes.<eos> She used to.<eos> Well, it's been a long time since we've seen you, Bendrix.
Sarah should get well here quickly.<eos> You know how to make a place really homelike.<eos> That's a gift old maids seem to have.<eos> That along with another.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Being nosy.<eos> Wait here.<eos> There'll be some luggage coming out.<eos> Would you tell Mrs Miles I'm here, please?<eos> Mr Miles will see you, sir.
What did he mean by that?<eos> The way he said you never fail in solving other people's problems.<eos> Haven't we changed places, Mr. Masterson?<eos> - Brother Sky.<eos> - Aren't we supposed...<eos> Why do you have trouble calling me Brother Sky?<eos> We're supposed to be discussing your problems.<eos> Maybe non-sinners also have problems.<eos> If you are sincerely interested in giving up gambling, Mr...<eos> Brother Sky, reading these pamphlets will help you.
Still juggling figures, eh, Parker?<eos> Leave that alone.<eos> Now, you do as I tell you or I'll throw you out for the first cop to pinch.<eos> Parker.<eos> - Parker.<eos> Impossible.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Why, he's one of our most trusted employees.<eos> They usually are, Mr. Smith.<eos> It's rather a pity to wait and let the auditors convince you, but since you asked for it...
I see you got the job.<eos> I see you did, too.<eos> Miss Hinkel, Mr. Goldman's on the phone.<eos> Says he must see Mr. Scott today.<eos> It's a matter of life or death.<eos> Fine, tell him 3:00 tomorrow.<eos> Miss Hinkel, excuse me...<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> Now, be patient.<eos> Mr. Scott will see you as soon as he can.
What's going on, sergeant? There's been a fight in the street, sir.<eos> I'm so glad you're here.<eos> Mrs. Wilberforce, what are you doing here?<eos> This lout has been behaving... you know her and you let her walk around loose?<eos> Now, none of that!<eos> Don't you distress yourself, ma'am. You don't know what she's done.<eos> Be quiet or I'll have you put in charge.<eos> Look what she did... be quiet!<eos> You better go home, ma'am.<eos> If we need a statement, we'll call on you.
No.<eos> Well, that isn't too important. But I should have been here.<eos> Do you think that is the real reason you're being dismissed?<eos> No.<eos> It is because you are Eurasian.<eos> Oh, no, I doubt that, Sen.<eos> Anyway, this isn't the only hospital in Hong Kong.<eos> You will not be offered another residency.<eos> Then I'll go into private practice.<eos> Do you think the English will seek you out?
Your cousin?<eos> Some cousin.<eos> You don't choose your relatives.<eos> This is the most unfriendly country I've ever been in.<eos> Why's everyone so touchy?<eos> It's a one-man country and Alec Waggoman's the man.<eos> I think I've got to meet that man.<eos> If you stay, you will.<eos> I'm figuring on staying around for a while.<eos> - Is something bothering you?
Here we are.<eos> $50, $100...<eos> You'd better watch what you're doing.<eos> Those aren't $50s, they're $100s.<eos> - Give him $600. - Yeah, sure.<eos> - There you are.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We're all settled up.<eos> - Not quite.<eos> - There's nothing to keep you here now.
All I know is they're excited, like they're expecting them guns soon.<eos> - In a couple of days, at most.<eos> - Why do you think that?<eos> 'Cause they already paid for them, and nobody takes pay from the Apaches without delivering.<eos> Those guns might be here already.<eos> Sounds more like it, but where?<eos> They'd be pretty hard to hide.<eos> - Are you expecting to meet someone?<eos> - No.<eos> Somebody's following you, but he's keeping out of sight.
I guess I know everything private that goes on in Coronado.<eos> What's that got to do with me?<eos> You're a man that's looking for somethin' and willing' to pay for it.<eos> That depends on what the information is, and who's selling it.<eos> I ain't got no references, but anybody can tell you that Chris Boldt is a man not to be trusted.<eos> That means nobody's secrets are sacred with me.<eos> Just who are you figuring on selling out?<eos> - You just name him.<eos> - It wouldn't be me, would it?<eos> Who put you on my trail?
To Silvana..<eos> ..sportingly?<eos> Sportingly...<eos> - Shall I put Sernesi... or Bob?<eos> - Put it Bob.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But there's even the address and phone number!<eos> Let me hope.<eos> It's okay, ma'am.<eos> The ma'am invites you in.
- Dark clouds on the psychic horizon.<eos> - That's preposterous.<eos> A twitch in a thumb, a nerve or a muscle.<eos> You psychiatrists make a case out of it.<eos> Of all the ridiculous...<eos> - Are you very expensive?<eos> - Very.<eos> - I'm sure you make exceptions.<eos> - Never.<eos> If a case really interests you?
We're not savages.<eos> We're civilized people.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> What time do you get up?<eos> - About 8, I guess.<eos> - I'll fix you breakfast.<eos> - Fix my breakfast...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Suppose someone sees you leaving the apartment at 8.<eos> Just one person sees you, and we're dead.
- Where's your car? - Right there.<eos> I can't seem to get out of this gracefully, so let's go.<eos> I've been waiting for you to mention that kiss I gave you last night.<eos> Back home in Oregon, we'd call you a headstrong girl.<eos> - Where in Oregon?<eos> The Rogue River?<eos> - Where were you born?<eos> In a taxi, halfway between home and the hospital.<eos> I've lived in 27 different towns.<eos> - Is somebody chasing you?
I've lived in 27 different towns.<eos> - Is somebody chasing you?<eos> - Boys.<eos> You can stop running now.<eos> When my father died, they discovered oil on our land. I started to travel.<eos> - The boys' fathers were chasing you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I had a funny feeling they wanted my money.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Back in Oregon, we'd have called you a rich, headstrong girl.
- Is it far?<eos> - A few miles.<eos> - Lonely and secluded?<eos> - Naturally.<eos> Then why are we dawdling like this?<eos> That's exactly what was running through my mind.<eos> - Slow down.<eos> - And let them catch us?<eos> - Let who catch us?<eos> - The police who were following you.
- Lonely and secluded?<eos> - Naturally.<eos> Then why are we dawdling like this?<eos> That's exactly what was running through my mind.<eos> - Slow down.<eos> - And let them catch us?<eos> - Let who catch us?<eos> - The police who were following you.<eos> Police following me?<eos> Yes, police following you, John Robie, The Cat.
I can't quite make you out.<eos> Not wearing a gun, for instance.<eos> I'm sure you know one end from the other, being in the Army.<eos> But just why do you set yourself apart from everyone else here?<eos> And you're so modest about your military record... When other men would brag about it.<eos> And your illness, how brave you were about that.<eos> Are you just trying to be different, Mr. Parrish, or is it something else?<eos> Well, since you know so much about me...<eos> - But I don't.<eos> I doubt if anyone here really knows you.
And your illness, how brave you were about that.<eos> Are you just trying to be different, Mr. Parrish, or is it something else?<eos> Well, since you know so much about me...<eos> - But I don't.<eos> I doubt if anyone here really knows you.<eos> Either you're just too good to be true, or you're clever and careful.<eos> And I don't like clever and careful people.<eos> You're trying to pick a fight with me.<eos> Go inside, Mr. Parrish.<eos> My father and uncle are waiting for you.
I'm sorry about Bud.<eos> - No call to blame yourself.<eos> We know who's back of all the trouble in the valley.<eos> Bud always spoke well of you, Mr. Parrish.<eos> Bud was a good, hardworking boy.<eos> It's a funny thing, he never could see working the land like his brothers.<eos> Guess a farmer's life looked kind of dull to him.<eos> I reckon herding cattle is as honest a way of making a living as any other.<eos> But some farmers I know wouldn't agree... Having had their share of troubles with cattlemen.<eos> I won't keep you any longer, Mr. Parrish.
Cousin, thou was not wont to be so dull.<eos> "True, noble prince." Shall I be plain?<eos> I wish the bastards dead, and I would have it suddenly performed.<eos> What sayest thou now?<eos> Speak suddenly, be brief.<eos> - Your Grace may do your pleasure.<eos> - Tut, tut, tut, thou art all ice... thy kindness freezes.<eos> Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?<eos> Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord... before I positively speak in this.<eos> I will resolve you herein presently.
He left it for me.<eos> Because I'm a jinx. A plague whom all must fly from.<eos> Won't this hearing make it worse?<eos> You go against the assessor Fazio and the mayor's son, why?<eos> They touch their horns in such a way, every time I pass, one can see it a mile away. - A coincidence.<eos> A coincidence that happens always?<eos> Every time I pass?<eos> They only touch their horns.<eos> Give me patience!<eos> But if this slander is said in court, nobody'll touch you with a ten foot pole.
What did I say?<eos> Winston, don't leave me...<eos> - ...alone!<eos> - 2159 Syme B.<eos> Stand where you are.<eos> All of the customers in the Chestnut Tree Cafe are to leave immediately.<eos> Quickly!<eos> Quickly!<eos> Syme, - - Thinkpol.<eos> The Thought Police are joining you.
Just the same as last night.<eos> Damn, what strong hands!<eos> My neck's twisted! Oh, yeah?<eos> This'll put it back in place! Stop hitting me!<eos> Or you'll knock me silly!<eos> - A slap of Cleopatra is an honour.<eos> - One, yes, but two's a rip-off!<eos> A message from Antony to Cleopatra.<eos> Now that we're friends again, will you promise not to change again tomorrow, and not to treat me badly again?<eos> - Tomorrow I can't treat you badly.
- Let's go.<eos> - Let's.<eos> Don't worry, Lupita.<eos> They must be out on the town.<eos> I'm not worried, it's not like he's a child.<eos> Get in. Isn't this better than a streetcar?<eos> - It is, but the deal is off.<eos> - Why?<eos> Come on, you know I respect you.<eos> I'll take you to a lovely hill overlooking the city.
The hotel manager is right.<eos> He's not rich enough to despise the opinion of his customers.<eos> So? What should do, a woman like me?<eos> With hands like yours, you can't do neither the cook nor the maid.<eos> And what must I do to be with my daughter?<eos> Want some advice?<eos> It's easy to give advice.<eos> - Well, take my arm.<eos> The world is made in a certain way, and it won't be us to change it.<eos> No one rebukes you for being who you are, but for not having been successful.
Of course, movies gotten worse.<eos> You remember when at Baldoni's house, we recited.. what did we recite?<eos> "Who knows the game, never teaches it."<eos> "The worst step is out the door".<eos> - Yeah, Martini.<eos> Ferdinando Martini.<eos> He recited excellently, excellently.<eos> Proverbs have come to an end, no one reads them anymore.<eos> Sit down.<eos> But you are just like I saw you last. Exactly on..
The food is delicious, isn't it, professor?<eos> Oh, very good.<eos> Never tasted better. There's a fork on your left, Mr. Land... Or aren't you accustomed to utensils?<eos> I'm indifferent to 'em.<eos> May I ask how you are able To set such a table as this, Captain?<eos> These dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen.<eos> There is nothing here of the Earth.<eos> How remarkable.<eos> This tastes like veal.<eos> The flavor deceives you.
Play it lower.<eos> No, that's too high.<eos> And in between?<eos> What can you do in between?<eos> It's because of the wood. Wood expands and shrinks. And I see woodworm.<eos> It's a beautiful bass, by the way.<eos> But wood expands.<eos> We have no time for a new bass.<eos> To take it apart and rebuild it.<eos> We'll leave it like this. We won't bother you anymore.
Mrs. Wendice, when you lost your handbag did you lose a letter as well?<eos> No.<eos> MARK:<eos> Margot, it was found in the dead man's pocket.<eos> HUBBARD:<eos> You did lose it, didn't you?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I asked you that before, didn't I?<eos> Yes, but you see, my husband didn't know about it.<eos> This man was blackmailing you, wasn't he?
Anyway, it's her funeral. I don't go to any but my own.<eos> You think it's a good idea?<eos> At least it is one.<eos> You mean, you let her stay?<eos> - Why didn't you ask her?<eos> - Ask her, what? Ask her if you could.<eos> I liked your speech out there.<eos> I thought it had a good idea. It was very dramatic too.<eos> You staying behind to save the life of the man you once loved.<eos> I didn't believe the truth could move you so much.
Can't you see that?<eos> It seems to me we've gone just about as far as we can at this time.<eos> I think you'll agree with that, Father.<eos> So, I'd like to close with a few words from St. Matthew:<eos> "Come unto me all you--"<eos> What did I tell you about sticking your neck out.<eos> -This is a police problem, not ours.<eos> -These people need help.<eos> Okay.<eos> Only don't blame me when they ship you off to Abyssinia.
Do you? What?<eos> Are you thinking of killing me?<eos> Give me back my ring, or I'll go to the police.<eos> Don't laugh!<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> Come, I'll show you I'm not lying.<eos> You don't have the guts! We'll see about this!<eos> I got nothing to loose.<eos> You wanted too much from me, Luisa Bilor, and you were wrong.<eos> You, and whoever is advising you.
- What?<eos> This happens to be my day off.<eos> Well, I usually took my best pictures on my day off.<eos> I'll drop by.<eos> Okay, Doyle. All right.<eos> As soon as you can.<eos> Bless your heart, Stella.<eos> Gee whiz, look at this.<eos> I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is.<eos> No wonder your husband still loves you.
- I used to like it.<eos> Certain songs bring back memories to me, too.<eos> Did you love her?<eos> - I'd rather not talk about it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> That's alright.<eos> So strange to think of you being touched by a woman.<eos> I always thought you walked alone.<eos> No man walks alone from choice.<eos> As a child, I used to watch you from the window over the garage.
- That's Phil for you.<eos> - Judy for you.<eos> The two of us were having fun and they thought we were in love with each other.<eos> - Ridiculous.<eos> They're sorry about it now and Judy wants you to come back.<eos> In fact, I'd like to see you come back myself.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I know that knight of yours has slipped off his charger.<eos> Why I don't know, but I'd like to do all I can to get him back up there.<eos> Mr Wallace has been expecting you.
It's mine!<eos> Give it to me or I'll kill you!<eos> If you want to fight, fight a real man!<eos> Leave it, it'll take it.<eos> Please, believe me. I want you no harm.<eos> You can count on me to defend you Against anything or anyone.<eos> You don't want your supper?<eos> Leave it here and go.<eos> I may have nothing in this world, but I have my word:<eos> I'll take you to your home, without a single scratch.
Scrub the floor!<eos> - Who was the set designer on this?<eos> - Cary Odell.<eos> Hello, kid.<eos> What are you doing out here all by yourself?<eos> - I'm gonna get a little drink.<eos> - Sit down. I got a bottle.<eos> Thanks, Top.<eos> I gotta hand it to you, kid, the way you beat up old Galovitch this afternoon.<eos> Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.
- No, we're just going back.<eos> Not today.<eos> No more trains until tomorrow.<eos> - I may slit my throat.<eos> - Would you like a fire?<eos> - I was about to.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> - I never saw so much snow.<eos> - I'm sorry about this.<eos> Be patient. I'll get you out of here as soon as I can.
You're trying to frighten me.<eos> You think by telling me that, I will give myself up.<eos> You think I am easily frightened after what I did?<eos> So, what are you going to do when they arrest you?<eos> Perhaps you'll point your finger at me.<eos> Perhaps you'll say, "It's Keller."<eos> That's what you will do, is it?<eos> You are a coward after all.<eos> You are frightened.<eos> Maybe they will hang you instead of me, and that frightens you.
Captain?<eos> How dreadful.<eos> What a pity, Mr Smee.<eos> I'm afraid we've lost the dear captain.<eos> Captain!<eos> In the back, captain?<eos> Give it to him, captain! Cleave him to the brisket!<eos> I've got you this time, Pan.<eos> Well, well, a codfish on a hook.<eos> I'll get you for this, Pan, if it's the last thing I do!
To cry is perfectly normal.<eos> It's important that she is calm and relaxed for the press conference.<eos> Don't worry, Doctor, I'll be calm and relaxed.<eos> I'll bow and I'll smile, I'll improve trade relations and I'll...<eos> There she goes again.<eos> Give her something, please.<eos> Uncover her arm, please.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Sleep and calm.<eos> This will relax you and make you feel a little happy.
Cool.<eos> It's just what I wanted.<eos> Now, why don't you come dancing tonight with me?<eos> You should see, it's so nice.<eos> It's on a boat, on the Tiber, the river, by Sant'Angelo.<eos> Moonlight, music, romantic.<eos> It's very, very...<eos> - Please, you come?<eos> - l wish I could.<eos> But your friends, I don't think they'll recognise you.
Better for her But she said that...<eos> Don't go telling me stories... Clara!<eos> Your husband says you want to rest Sunday<eos> No, I'd rather rest when its over, how I wish I could...<eos> Yes, Yes. I can.<eos> Today's order is good like that!<eos> You said that because...<eos> Well I thought we could go to Fregene, to relax<eos> We could spend Sunday together, just the two of us Please, Gianni<eos> Miss! A man is asking for you Where?
Just give me 5 minutes on that couch, will you? Five minutes.<eos> The young ones they put into the panzer divisions.<eos> The older ones, they put in the quartermaster corps or made them recruiting officers, or wardens, like me.<eos> Wet nurses to putrid prisoners.<eos> In Berlin, they have forgotten that Colonel von Scherbach even exists.<eos> But they will remember now.<eos> Name:<eos> Dunbar, Leutenant Dunbar.<eos> Sabotage.<eos> Well, there will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin.
Have you tried to care about others?<eos> It may sounds cheesy, but you just get pissed at not getting anything from others without giving anything to others.<eos> When do I get upset like that?<eos> You've always behaved like that to your friends and even to your husband.<eos> No.<eos> You don't understand about marriage, because you're not married.<eos> Mr. Nakagawa, I'm leaving.<eos> I have nothing to say to her.<eos> Get a divorce.<eos> I don't think I'll see you again.
Your conscience will ease !<eos> You'll go, I'm sure !<eos> Quick !<eos> It's the only way you have to save yourself!<eos> Try to understand!<eos> - There.<eos> - Did the car go to get the doctor?<eos> - Half an hour ago.<eos> The doctor is already here.<eos> Come on, lady, quick, he wants to see you.
But only misfortune beckons at your command.<eos> You promise a future bright with the early dawn.<eos> But when I awake tomorrow, will you be gone?<eos> Am I waiting in vain?<eos> May I kiss you again?<eos> Please don't hurt me or ever dessert me.<eos> Am I too late too soon?<eos> To your health, my good Doctor. To yours.<eos> Mighty Chief Rakos...<eos> I thank you for your hospitality.
- We're making root beer. - To sell?<eos> - Who wants to sell it?<eos> We wanna drink it.<eos> Do you know how much root beer this family drinks in the summertime?<eos> - No. - Three cases a week.<eos> A total cash expenditure of $3.60 every week.<eos> - It's astonishing.<eos> - Oh, Mrs. Gilbreth.<eos> - Yes, Tom?<eos> - Uh, man here to see you.
I'll train some men for you.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Right here.<eos> My husband and I trained all the others at home.<eos> Aw, never work.<eos> No man who's worth anything would ever take instructions from a woman.<eos> I know I wouldn't.<eos> That is a very narrow-minded, bigoted point of view, Mr. Harper.<eos> Well, maybe it is, but it's my opinion, and I'm stuck with it.<eos> And if it's any comfort to you... that opinion is shared by most of the big industrial firms in the country.
I don't need any references.<eos> I was just phoning about some groceries.<eos> You see, I'm very anxious to make good on this job.<eos> I always try to do my best.<eos> I work very hard, but nobody realizes it.<eos> I get paid, but...<eos> Howard, what's the matter?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Something's troubling you, isn't it?
But my mother comes to see me.<eos> - I have to get to class.<eos> - Where's the baking soda?<eos> - Just a minute.<eos> - I'll get it for him.<eos> I'm sorry you don't feel good.<eos> - I'll fix it.<eos> - No, it's no bother.<eos> I'm glad to do it for you.<eos> There, that'll perk you up.
It happened tonight.<eos> The Middlesex?<eos> Why didn't you let me know?<eos> I didn't want you to go through the suspense of it.<eos> Then forget everything now, and get a good night's rest.<eos> They walked out on me.<eos> They haven't done that since I was a beginner.<eos> The cycle's complete.<eos> But you've changed your name!<eos> They didn't know you.
He left word that he was tired and had gone home to rest.<eos> I must go at once.<eos> Say good night to Mr. Postant for me.<eos> I'll get you a cab.<eos> I'll walk home.<eos> He must be asleep, poor dear.<eos> Too much excitement for him.<eos> I'm beginning to feel the strain myself.<eos> Then I'll be going.<eos> Shall we see you before you leave for camp?
Captain, would you like to contribute?<eos> No, that's all right, put it in.<eos> I've no false pride.<eos> Sit down, have a drink.<eos> Thank you, old man, not during office hours.<eos> But I'll sit down.<eos> May I?<eos> How are you?<eos> Never felt better in my life!<eos> And how is the army treating you?
We tried to convince him to see a doctor.<eos> How much time does he have left?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Hello.<eos> Will you be singing at the contest?<eos> You also sing, don't you?<eos> -It's a festival.<eos> -I'd love to take part.<eos> Your mother won't let you?
- You're a lucky lady.<eos> Anything wrong?<eos> - Why, no.<eos> No, I should think not.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night, officer.<eos> Well, thanks for saving my life.<eos> I'll get out now.<eos> I'm driving to Beverly Hills.<eos> Can I drop you someplace?
You can see I didn't kill her.<eos> Why do you have to yell like that?<eos> Hey!<eos> ... and requests that any citizen who knows of any man who has had a badly burned right hand within the past two weeks to report him to the police immediately.<eos> He may be the sniper.<eos> I repeat, he may be the sniper.<eos> We know that this man...<eos> Burned hands, snipers, I don't know what the world's coming to.<eos> Do you, Assa?<eos> Why, Mr. Miller, what brings you home from work at this...
The dust in the nose gave me a cold.<eos> Thanks, cavalier, you saved me.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> Among us men, conspiracy of silence! - Yes, silence.<eos> Slowly!<eos> - She thought I would marry her.<eos> Really? Really.<eos> Slowly...<eos> Hey !<eos> Hurry, otherwise my daughter sees you.
There's nothing I can do.<eos> Peace be with you.<eos> I had to leave immediately thereafter for Dombasle and arrived home very late.<eos> Clovis, the old gardener, gave me a parcel from the countess.<eos> I knew what was in it.<eos> The small medallion, now empty, and its broken chain.<eos> There was a letter as well.<eos> "Dear Father, the hopeless memory of one young child had me isolated from everything in a terrifying solitude, and it seems as if another child has drawn me out of it.<eos> I hope I don't hurt your pride by calling you a child.<eos> You are one, and may God keep you so always.
The ancient world, the world before grace, rocked her in its cradle.<eos> For centuries its old hands protected the wondrous young girl whose name it didn't even know.<eos> A little girl, this queen of the angels, which she still is to this day. Never forget that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Give me your blessing.<eos> No, it's your turn today.<eos> Here you are, Father.<eos> No, thanks. Nothing.<eos> It will pass.<eos> This will put you right again.
Why not?<eos> You're always restless, hoping to conceal the truth of your soul or perhaps to forget it.<eos> I'm not afraid of the truth.<eos> And if you're daring me -<eos> I'm not daring you.<eos> I'd only agree to hear your confession if you were in danger of death.<eos> Absolution will come in due time, I hope, and from someone else's hand.<eos> That wasn't hard to predict.<eos> Father will be sure to have you transferred.<eos> Everyone here takes you for a drunkard.
I'm tired When you get to a certain age, you must rest<eos> Moreover, you have to make way for the younger generation<eos> I do a bit of film work<eos> Mum, the lady drunk an egg lt doesn't matter<eos> Little blabbermouth<eos> So, is this the child that has been selected for the second audition?<eos> Listen, who sent you here?<eos> Cinecitta?<eos> Stella Film?<eos> Who? Somebody must have sent you here.
You haven't fed the child<eos> As if I was starving her<eos> Anything else?<eos> She had a big cup of coffee with milk and two cookies<eos> Tell him<eos> Mum is going to undress you<eos> - Let me do it<eos> - Careful, you'll tear her dress<eos> OK, do it yourself then<eos> - Give it to me - Dad will put you to bed
Okay, I'm a hero.<eos> And what do I make you?<eos> Now here's the deal.<eos> The way things look, there's gonna be other newspapermen trying to horn in on this story.<eos> A lot of them.<eos> Maybe all the way from New York.<eos> This is my story.<eos> And I wanna keep it mine.<eos> You're gonna help me.<eos> Mr Tatum, we're moving you into our room.
So I said nothing to you.<eos> Until you told me that there is no love in your marriage.<eos> Yes, you told me that.<eos> And so did Uriah.<eos> His dream of glory is his wife in tears.<eos> You better go.<eos> Oh, no, keep that.<eos> It's only a stone but you lend it beauty.<eos> Uriah's a fool.<eos> When I looked on you from my terrace tonight I knew that every future moment spent away from you would be a moment lost.
I wouldn't erase that.<eos> The professor needs it very badly.<eos> - Mr Carpenter come home yet?<eos> - Yeah, he's inside.<eos> - Tell him I'd like to see him.<eos> - OK. Come on in.<eos> - Your name Carpenter?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Professor Barnhardt been looking for me?<eos> - I've been looking for you all afternoon.
You better get down there and give the boys a hand with that traffic.<eos> Romp on those cabbies.<eos> Take it easy, junior. That isn't gonna get you anyplace.<eos> Save it for New Year's.<eos> - Officer!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Are we going to be able to get through?<eos> I've got an important appointment.<eos> I'm late now.<eos> They expect you today, dear, you'd better walk.
Look, my philosophy is... no matter how horrible anything is... there's always something- something good in it.<eos> W-Well, I mean, like... you come to work at 8:00 every morning, I go to work at 8:30.<eos> I- I could have gone on for a long time, except for this... and missed you by a half an hour all the time.<eos> Uh, have you ever been to Lewisohn Stadium to the concerts on Sunday?<eos> Oh, it's beautiful.<eos> Stars out, people listening.<eos> No, I-I've never been.<eos> But it sounds beautiful.<eos> I'll take you.<eos> Uh, I'll take you this Sunday, if you'd like to go.
I believe a Mr. Thompson is your neighbor, sir.<eos> You wouldn't know a thing about Thompson or his friend Krafft, would you?<eos> Mr. Thompson is, I believe, a public-relations man. Mr. Krafft is a writer. Beyond that, I know nothing.<eos> Is everything all right, senor?<eos> I'll let you know. What's Krafft's cabin number?<eos> - Mr. Krafft is in cabin one.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> I'd like to have a little chat with you and your friend Thompson.<eos> You have either an honestly mistaken idea about me or you are a crazy man.<eos> I don't know you, and I can't help you.
- Ms. Halsworth.<eos> - Whas the matter, Pete?<eos> Ms. Halsworth, are you satisfied with my work?<eos> Well, certainly.<eos> Why?<eos> Ms. Halsworth, I'm a very sensitive fellow.<eos> Has that man been bothering you again?<eos> Fertilizer, fertilizer, all the time he wants with more fertilizer.<eos> Now, don't pay any attention to him.<eos> And if he bothers you again, you just tell him to see me.
Yeah, The Last of the Mohicans.<eos> Fire!<eos> A hit right under the stack, and nothing happens.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What's this?<eos> - Colors are coming down.<eos> - What?<eos> Get the exec up here.<eos> Executive officer, report to the conning tower.<eos> Captain wants you in the conning tower.
Jean Debucourt of the Comédie-Française is one of the main actors and furthermore...<eos> So, since you have been so good as to ask me for a dedication, Here it is.<eos> Michel Simon, this film that I have just made gave me one of the greatest joys I've had in the theater, for I think I'll be allowed to call it theater.<eos> I had never before had you as an actor.<eos> Well, you are exceptional.<eos> I would even say, unique.<eos> Between the moment when you cease being yourself and when you play your role, it's impossible to see the seams.<eos> Nor when, on ceasing to act, you become yourself again.<eos> So that there is no reason to stop shooting.<eos> I place you among the greatest.
Have you decided to tell me no?<eos> Frankly, not yet.<eos> But having never helped anyone but the guilty, you'll understand that I hesitate to proclaim, all of a sudden, the opposite of what I've been saying for twenty years.<eos> In any case, I'll agree to this: if in forty-eight hours I tell you no, it's with the commitment that I won't agree to be her defender.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your candelabra are very beautiful.<eos> Yes. An arsonist gave them to me.<eos> Goodbye. - - Goodbye.<eos> Who called five minutes ago?<eos> A man who refuses to tell his name, who is as nervous as can be, almost agitated, and who begs you to receive him.
As for the knife you used, they stuck it right in a loaf of bread on the kitchen table, with a "Don't touch" sign.<eos> It's considered as a relic, you understand?<eos> Because you've become popular, my old Paul,<eos> And whatever will happen to you, be assured Rémonville and its inhabitants aren't ingrates, and you can count on their gratitude.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> She won't put any more Water in my glass Because now Poison is dead<eos> Come on, altogether.<eos> She won't put any more Water in my glass Because that ugly woman Poison is dead.<eos> We're beginning to know it, right?<eos> Braconnier, your lawyer is asking for you.
I'll be there to meet you tomorrow night at 7:00.<eos> I don't care what kind of an excuse you have to have.<eos> I can't, darling, please.<eos> You'll do it because you've got to.<eos> It's on that 9:00 o'clock plane tonight.<eos> I'm very sorry, madam, but that night is all filled.<eos> Why, that's strange.<eos> They've always... Hey are there two sections on that Flight 27?<eos> No, sir, only one tonight.<eos> If you'll give me your name, madam, I'll put you on the next flight.
- Ames, how old are you?<eos> - 23. That's very proper. That's the right age to worry about girls.<eos> - The paper wants her name.<eos> - Fine publicity for her.<eos> If you stigmatize a girl's good name...<eos> People just don't change good names to Scanlon.<eos> She's just young and mixed up.<eos> Captain, can I see her?<eos> Send Miss Hayes up here, please.<eos> And while we're trying to find you, McQuigg sets the hearing with Judge Sherman.
John!<eos> - Ellen, what's the matter?<eos> - John I want to marry you.<eos> - What?<eos> - I said I want to marry you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes, meet me at Clyde Street church at four o'clock.<eos> Right.<eos> What do you think you're doing miss?<eos> Oh officer, I love you.
Cognac, armaniac, calvados, kümmel, brandy.<eos> Chartreuse.<eos> For you, Chartreuse.<eos> I want to tell you why I came.<eos> Whatever it is, it'll look better through the bottom of this glass.<eos> I've broken with the Colonel.<eos> Scotch for me.<eos> Don't you want to know why?<eos> I know.<eos> He bores you.
First they'll have to catch me.<eos> Here, you'd better wrap this around you and try and get some rest.<eos> No telling how long we'll be.<eos> He says you will leave tonight, Mr. Harry.<eos> At 2:00.<eos> The price will be 200, for each.<eos> 200?<eos> What does he mean, 200?<eos> He says to tell you that you are expensive.<eos> The French are looking for you all over.
Come.<eos> Your Excellency, I had to see you.<eos> You are seeing me.<eos> That's more than your other emissary did.<eos> Someone cut his throat before he got here.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I've come to make an appeal to reason.<eos> You expect me to be reasonable?<eos> How can I be reasonable with the French?<eos> Isn't it possible your hatred of the French blinds you?
What did you expect?<eos> I'm not interested in what you have to say.<eos> But my soldiers haven't had much pleasure lately.<eos> I shall give you to them.<eos> You may talk to them.<eos> They will give you the attention you deserve.<eos> We have just had word from your general.<eos> He's worried about you.<eos> He wants to save your life. He offers 10,000.<eos> My soldiers will be disappointed, but I think I should sell you.

I think I will sell you.
No, it's nothing. Nothing at all.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Excuse me, will you, please?<eos> - Mr Wilkins! - Yes?<eos> Mr Corland wants you. He's in accounts.<eos> Mr Harrison!<eos> They want you too, in accounts.<eos> Excuse me. Could you tell me where Mr Corland is, please?<eos> Stratton!<eos> Mr Corland wants you!
Mr Birnley's busy now. A meeting.<eos> - But I couldn't make an appointment. - Sorry.<eos> Write a letter or telephone.<eos> There's no question of it.<eos> It's all very well between these four walls, ...but what are the shareholders going to say?<eos> £8,300 for sundries?<eos> What sundries?<eos> Davidson will be here at any moment.<eos> Now, he should be able to answer that.<eos> Oh, Mr Birnley's expecting you.
- It's just the suit. It looks as if it's wearing you.<eos> It's still a bit luminous.<eos> But it'll wear off.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> No, it makes you look like a... a knight in shining armour.<eos> - That's what you are.<eos> - Me? Don't you understand what this means?<eos> Millions of people all over the world, living lives of drudgery, ...fighting an endless losing battle against shabbiness and dirt.<eos> You've won that battle for them. You've set them free.<eos> The whole world's going to bless you.
-She works hard.<eos> -Night and day.<eos> -She's loyal and efficient.<eos> -Like an agent with only one client.<eos> She thinks only of me, doesn't she?<eos> Well, let's say she thinks only about ya, anyway.<eos> -How do you mean that?<eos> -I'll tell ya how.<eos> Like...<eos> Like she's studying you.
- Who?<eos> - Me, that's who.<eos> - I see.<eos> - Fancy talk don't go with me.<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - I'll get out...<eos> - No, don't go. I like you.<eos> Play your cards right, I'll put you on the payroll.
Beethoven.<eos> Op 36.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - It's because of you I'm doing this.<eos> - I guess you know.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> A lot of good it did me. I never had this trouble before.<eos> - Trouble?<eos> - Sure.<eos> When I met you, I figured everything is gonna work out dandy.
Couldn't you get someone else, Kratky or Bagby?<eos> They're bigger than I am.<eos> You'll be able to hide better.<eos> Hurry now and stick with him all afternoon.<eos> Quickly, boy, quickly!<eos> - Quickly, OK, sir.<eos> Oh, elevator!<eos> Come in!<eos> Yes... Who is it?<eos> The doctor will see you in a minute.
Be quiet.<eos> So it'll be passing up and down the river until they find it. Up and down the river!<eos> It'll go on for weeks!<eos> The police will find it soon enough.<eos> Yes, but they won't know we did it. I mean...<eos> There are hundreds of sacks like it. They won't trace it to us, will they? No...<eos> Not to us.<eos> They'll trace it to me.<eos> My name is on it.<eos> There's a gentleman to see you, Mr Byrne.
It sounds like a vet's name.<eos> Then it could be the tall one from Moudon. There are plenty of vets there.<eos> I'm not trying to guess, I'll just wait.<eos> My poor darling, you really don't have a romantic disposition.<eos> Here comes the Marquis.<eos> Did you get my mail, Marquis?<eos> - Nothing for you.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I can't believe I didn't receive anything.<eos> All of your admirers have forgotten you.
He'll swindle you. He'll cheat you.<eos> He'll break your heart.<eos> You have break my heart.<eos> He is my partner and my friend.<eos> Stay away from him, my son.<eos> When you lift your hand to him, you strike me.<eos> You're very sharp, Mr. Fabian.<eos> You've done a very sharp thing.<eos> Maybe even sharp enough to cut your throat.<eos> You've made my father believe in you, but I know you.
-Where do you live?<eos> -Hollywood.<eos> Alto Nido Apartments.<eos> There's something wrong with your car, you said.<eos> There sure is.<eos> -Why shouldn't you stay here?<eos> -Look, I'll come back early tomorrow.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> There's a room over the garage.<eos> Max will take you there. Max!
- No, I'd say he was sort of in on a pass.<eos> You can sign up for the shoot over there.<eos> That's Dutch Henry Brown.<eos> I thought you said you didn't know him.<eos> I said I didn't recall the name.<eos> Pick out a name and write it down.<eos> All right if I use my own?<eos> Some folks do.<eos> Lin McAdam. That'll be $2.<eos> Being as you're a stranger and nobody knows nothing about you, I'm just going to make your odds five to one.
Mind if I help you down, ma'am?<eos> Do you mind if I kiss you?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> I'd like it, providing your man don't mind.<eos> That's for saving my life.<eos> Now you disappoint me.<eos> I thought it was 'cause I'm pretty.<eos> Got some coffee boiling on the fire. Want to just sort of help yourself?<eos> Oh, coffee.<eos> You know, now that I look at you, you are pretty.
Tell me what you want to do.<eos> I understand your situation very well.<eos> Your husband's attitude toward you... is unsupportable for us all.<eos> By the way, I think his name is Masaya.<eos> Don't speak of him.<eos> He doesn't know any of this.<eos> He'll be annoyed.<eos> Don't you fell discomforted?<eos> Madame, be courageous.<eos> No one will reproach you if you leave with your lover.
Oh, there it is.<eos> I don't know, what's your thought?<eos> I hope it teaches him a lesson.<eos> Come back here, you little pests.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> I'm gonna tear you a--<eos> Hey, what's going on here?<eos> Oh, no, you don't.<eos> Come back here with that.<eos> I'll get you for this, you little rats.
Just one of life's little jokes, isn't it?<eos> it points out our mistakes too late for us to profit by them.<eos> It might interest you to know ...that you're the only clever would-be murderer I've come across, ...who's in a position to profit by his mistakes.<eos> It'd be interesting to know how much you've learned.<eos> Bill Kronin is alive.<eos> Just barely...but alive.<eos> Shall we be getting along?<eos> I forget...what's the penalty for a near miss?<eos> Oh, it varies.<eos> In any case they won't chain you up, you know.
But hurry.<eos> And shortly before 9 this morning in Central Park a Mr. Mervin Fisher was hit on the head tied up with a necktie and robbed of a wallet containing $ 120 and a pair of silver salt and pepper shakers a present for his aunt in Flushing.<eos> A little later, Officer McCleary, patrolling the park noticed Mr. Mason loitering suspiciously.<eos> He admitted that he was unemployed, homeless about to leave town and that the necktie belonged to him.<eos> The salt and pepper shakers were found on his person.<eos> I just thought it was gonna be much worse.<eos> You expected the suspect to be involved in a serious crime?<eos> - Oh, no, no, nothing like that. - Connie.<eos> - Lieutenant, I'm a lawyer and... - Is that so?<eos> If I ever need a lawyer, I'll send for you.
You poor man. Well, you can't stay here.<eos> This is a female building.<eos> It is?<eos> Another woman's building.<eos> You know, I've come to the conclusion... that American men don't sleep.<eos> Well, not in this building.<eos> I was wondering if there'd be any objection to my sitting here for a while.<eos> You could sort of imagine I'm waiting for something.<eos> Well, it all depends on what you imagine you're waiting for.<eos> I'm sure I don't want to send you out on a night like this.
Oh, they're just kids.<eos> But I could go up against adults too.<eos> I must ask you something.<eos> If I'm mistaken, forgive me.<eos> For three months, someone has been writing very nice little letters to me saying that not everyone hates me around here.<eos> You wouldn't perchance be the one who wrote those letters?<eos> It was me, sir.<eos> I owe you many thanks tonight, Miss.<eos> Don't make fun of me or call me Miss.<eos> I'm not making fun of you.
- Yes.<eos> His friend and I picked him up, carried him across over here.<eos> - [ Car Horn Honks ] - It was a terrible thing.<eos> Terrible. We laid him down just about here.<eos> And this is where he died.<eos> Even at the end, his thoughts were of you.<eos> What did he say?<eos> I can't remember the exact words, Holly.<eos> I may call you Holly, mayn't I?<eos> He always called you that to us.
He gave you the number of the Casanova Club.<eos> That's where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.<eos> - It wasn't important.<eos> - What was the message?<eos> Something about meeting Harry at his home.<eos> Harbin disappeared the day you telephoned.<eos> We've got to find him.<eos> You can help us.<eos> What can I tell you, but you've got everything upside down.<eos> That American friend of yours is still waiting for you.
- What was the message?<eos> Something about meeting Harry at his home.<eos> Harbin disappeared the day you telephoned.<eos> We've got to find him.<eos> You can help us.<eos> What can I tell you, but you've got everything upside down.<eos> That American friend of yours is still waiting for you.<eos> He won't do you much good.<eos> I thank you, Miss Schmidt.<eos> We'll send for you when we want you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I said another man was buried in his place.<eos> Where's Harry?<eos> That's what we want to find out.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't seem able to understand anything you say.<eos> He is alive. Now this minute, he is doing something.<eos> Miss Schmidt, we know he's somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector.<eos> You may as well help us.<eos> In a few minutes, Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers.
It's hard to believe that Al' took up after some wild geese.<eos> He was always an advocate of the home and heart.<eos> I always thought so.<eos> Won't you sit down?<eos> ─ Alright.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Well, I was about to say I'm here on a vacation.<eos> I was wondering if I might help in any way.<eos> I think the Police are doing all that can be done.<eos> What did Alan usually call you, Mr Blake?
- What?<eos> - Welcome.<eos> - Is Hayase here?<eos> He just went out.<eos> To the barber, I think.<eos> She's coming from Okayama to see him.<eos> Please come in. He'll be here soon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> See you later, grandpa.<eos> Mr. Omoi, we don't see you very often lately.
We have 150000 members.<eos> Let's hear them.<eos> Tell us your decision first.<eos> Farewell.<eos> Tell me, will the Liberal Party be disbanded?<eos> I think so.<eos> But I still have hope.<eos> Liberal Party national meeting<eos> Sir, reconsider your position!<eos> The convention will follow you.
If I'm not mistaken, you were the last person to see him alive.<eos> Yes, in the village. Yes.<eos> Well, provided he is dead.<eos> Unfortunately, I have to assume he is dead. More than that, I fear...<eos> Jonas Lauretz was murdered.<eos> How did you reach that conclusion, Magistrate?<eos> -That suspicion is not new.<eos> My predecessor harboured it, and not only he, but the whole village too.<eos> I found the record of an interrogation.<eos> By the way, thank you for taking the desk key into your possession.
I ain't never going back there, he'll kill me.<eos> I'll send some men out there with you every night.<eos> - He'd kill them too. He's crazy!<eos> - Say, I'd like a crack at that...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You haven't got a title to that land until you've proved up on it.<eos> Where does that leave me? I don't know, but it leaves me alive though.<eos> - If anybody takes a shot at you he'll be hunted down by the US Marshal.<eos> We can't afford to hunt him down ourselves, it ain't legal.<eos> Say, that wouldn't stop you, Mr Miles.
I remember you as a general from the war, sir.<eos> Very flattering.<eos> Didn't you receive my telegraph, captain?<eos> The wires have been down between here and Fort Grant for two days. We've had no communications.<eos> Two days? The break should have been repaired.<eos> It's 110 miles to Fort Grant, sir.<eos> I take it this dance is not in my honor.<eos> - It's a birthday dance, sir.<eos> - Birthday? Whose birthday? General George Washington's, sir.<eos> Shall I show you to your quarters, or will you remain?
We were on the same boat yesterday.<eos> It must have been our fate to float down the Chikuma River together.<eos> About that...<eos> As we've been brought together by fate, I'd like to discuss something with you.<eos> It's related to your family background.<eos> I know a bit about it.<eos> You might have heard. I recently got married.<eos> She's from a neighboring village.<eos> What a small world it is.<eos> My wife told me she's known you since childhood.
Sit down.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Take off your hat.<eos> That was quite a boy you sent to see me yesterday.<eos> I've met some weird ones in my life<eos> But that one nearly scared me to death.<eos> MacDonald isn't with the company.<eos> He's a private detective we use sometimes.<eos> I don't care who he is.<eos> I'm sorry he annoyed you.
Go on, get out of here.<eos> I'd like to hold you, all right?<eos> Personally, I think we've got the wrong person in the cell Upstairs. There's nothing I can do about it.<eos> It so happens the homicide you committed was justifiable.<eos> Bill Smiley was coming to kill you.<eos> Just a little call to the police and you Could have avoided all this mess.<eos> But no.<eos> You kill a man.<eos> And that's not a pleasant thing to live With for the rest of your life.<eos> Or don't things like that bother you?
- This time it's important, did you try? - I can't do it.<eos> - You've done it all wrong.<eos> - Can we try again? - You don't know how.<eos> That's 100,000.<eos> I gave you 45,000 on the 23rd.<eos> That's it, we're square.<eos> Well, what are you waiting for?<eos> Get going!<eos> Are you going?<eos> Ah, I almost forgot, there's a girl waiting for you by the gate. - Who?
That on the wall...<eos> "Eachhumanbeinghas an integrity that can be hurt only "by the act of that same human being.<eos> "... And not by the act of another human being." Is that Quaker stuff?<eos> You mean nobody can hurt you but yourself?<eos> That's what the "Friends" believe.<eos> Well suppose somebody whacks you over the head with a branding iron won't that hurt?<eos> - Physically, of course.<eos> But in reality, it would injure only the person doing the act of violence.<eos> Only the doer can be hurt by an evil or mean act.<eos> Are there many of you Quakers?
-l just want to say goodbye. That's all.<eos> You don't have to make a big thing about it. The war's over.<eos> I know, but guns go off by accident. A fellow could trip on a bayonet.<eos> I know. Going away, perhaps not seeing your loved ones for years.<eos> You're a fine boy, Jerry, and a good friend. Possibly Mr. Nugent doesn't know how good.<eos> -You don't have to tell me about Jerry.<eos> -Maybe I could tell you things.<eos> How loyal he is, and how he made sure you won that race this afternoon.<eos> Race? Where were you this afternoon?<eos> -lt doesn't concern you.
Good evening.<eos> Sister Ruth?<eos> I can't stand it any longer.<eos> I left the order.<eos> I gave up my vows.<eos> I've finished with them up there.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, I can arrange for you to stay at the rest house.<eos> I'll send my boy over now.<eos> In the morning, I'll get ponies and porters to take you to Darjeeling.
I see.<eos> Well, I can arrange for you to stay at the rest house.<eos> I'll send my boy over now.<eos> In the morning, I'll get ponies and porters to take you to Darjeeling.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - You...<eos> Well, if you do, you can forget about it.<eos> I'm sorry, Sister Ruth.<eos> Very sorry, but...<eos> Look, let me take you back to the palace.
You're the coldest iceberg of a woman I ever saw, and the rottenest inside.<eos> I've seen plenty, too.<eos> I wouldn't trade places with you if they sliced me into little pieces.<eos> Do you want to live or die?<eos> Laury, Laury, I've failed you.<eos> You understand that if Sam Wild is turned over to the police for any reason your life is over.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - Wait.<eos> I'd be a bad hostess if I didn't see you out.
You'll look older, but you'll always feel 10 years younger.<eos> And you're through with me and I'm through with you.<eos> The artist in me wishes I could see what a nice job I've done.<eos> But I never will.<eos> Good-bye, and good luck.<eos> - So long, Walt.<eos> - So long, Sam.<eos> I didn't do this on a cash basis.<eos> Okay, friend.<eos> I'll save you using your face to talk me into it.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, sure, I believe you but I still want that letter.<eos> Let's get out of this lobster trap.<eos> We need salt air.<eos> They say salt's antiseptic.<eos> Rip, what's the matter?<eos> Is something the matter?<eos> - Yesterday you called me Dusty.<eos> Today...<eos> - Johnny used to call you that.
Up, friend.<eos> My position is clear.<eos> Since I was in it with her, that gun could send us both to the chair.<eos> As a choice, particularly under these circumstances, I find a bullet...<eos> As a good last gesture just shoot straight and make it fast, will you?<eos> All mushy outside and hard at the core, eh? I counted on that too.<eos> These are out of Tojo, by Hitler. Creeping Jelly, we called them.<eos> Because they crawl and burn, not quick like the chair, but slow and to the bone.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Either I get that gun or the slow broiler for you, even if we all cook.
- "Stafford, Fifth Avenue."<eos> - Should I take it to the lost and found?<eos> No, I'll deliver this myself tomorrow.<eos> Only six more months to Christmas, you know.<eos> - Where to, lady?<eos> - 780, Fifth Avenue, and hurry, please.<eos> - Fifth Avenue, not a bad address.<eos> - What are you doing in my...<eos> You get out of here this...<eos> If you think I'm going to take you home with me, well, you've got another think.
- I wanted to make sure I was right.<eos> - What are your charges?<eos> Bigamy.<eos> 14 counts of murder.<eos> Congratulations, Monsieur. With the murder charges, you won't succeed.<eos> We'll see.<eos> - There is corpus delicti.<eos> - Don't worry, we'll find the bodies.<eos> I don't think you will, Monsieur.<eos> However, we'll hold you for bigamy until we do. Let's go.
No, I don't.<eos> I can't keep on doing this sort of business all the time.<eos> - I don't want any money.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> Nothing, I just wanted to say hello, that's all.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> However, take this.<eos> - No, I don't want your money.<eos> - Take it.<eos> Will I see you again?
See, starting tomorrow you have to spend a whole month in bed.<eos> If you need anything from the village, we'll send it up for you.<eos> - A whole month in bed?<eos> - That'll be a month well spent if you're a good girl.<eos> Is it necessary to refer to me as a child?<eos> Up here in a way, you are a child.<eos> You have no responsibilities.<eos> You make no decisions.<eos> And who will make my decisions?<eos> I will. And the first day you're up, I'll take you into town myself.
The menace is practically over.<eos> I'll have you in the village in a few minutes.<eos> You shouldn't drive so fast.<eos> Are you warning me not to speed?<eos> I am. I want this to last as long as possible.<eos> After all, speed isn't necessarily movement.<eos> It can be a kind of philosophy, too.<eos> A pattern for living.<eos> A pattern for winning races.<eos> Do you want me to drop you at the garage?
- Dinner? - Engagement.<eos> - Sounds terribly monotonous.<eos> - It isn't. This can't go on forever.<eos> You're going to the race of course.<eos> - No.<eos> - I'll get a box for you at the race<eos> And we'll have cocktails and then dinner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not going to the race.<eos> I don't blame you, but I'll meet you just the same.
Dear, dear. You must mind your verbs.<eos> Sir Simon means it was a piece of voluntary service. You devoted your whole life to this splendid fellow freely, gladly.<eos> Yes, I see what you mean.<eos> It was a sacrifice. A sublime sacrifice.<eos> Yes, I think it would be better to regard it in that light.<eos> It was the more tremendous that Paradine could not understand...<eos> Could not possibly understand the sacrifice you were making. He'd never seen you.<eos> He'd never, as I say, seen you.<eos> Yes, yes, quite so.<eos> Quite so. I'm not sure whether Mr. Keane will put you in the witness box or not, but if he does...
Yes. That's it. That's very comforting.<eos> They were retrying Charles the First, and Tony got him off.<eos> You've been such a long time. I've been chattering and chattering.<eos> My dear, I'm sure that Keane and Simmy would like to see your jade.<eos> Would they? I have some such pretty pieces.<eos> Very much indeed.<eos> You look very, very appetizing tonight, my dear.<eos> Charming compliment from such a gourmet as yourself, Lord Horfield.<eos> Tell me, Mrs. Keane,<eos> I don't amuse you very much, do I?
I walked on the terrace, went into the house, into your room.<eos> I saw Latour.<eos> He behaved very strangely.<eos> At first, he avoided me, then he forced himself on me. He came to my room at the inn late at night.<eos> - Why did he do that? - He wanted to talk to me.<eos> - About you. - Indeed.<eos> And what did my husband's valet have to say about me?<eos> Don't, I beg of you. Don't behave this way with me.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Latour hates you. You know that? He hates you most bitterly.
- Your age?<eos> - Thirty.<eos> You were born, I believe, in Montreal, Canada. And you served in the war with Colonel Paradine?<eos> Yes, sir. I was his manservant before the war.<eos> And later I had the honor of serving under his command.<eos> You won the Distinguished Conduct Medal and Bar for gallantry in the field?<eos> That is so, sir.<eos> At the time of Colonel Paradine's death, you were again employed as his valet and confidential companion?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Speak up, Latour, so that we can all hear you.
No maybe about it.<eos> Was it or wasn't it?<eos> It was, sir.<eos> And after he'd told you this, - then you went upstairs again?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> I had no special reason, sir.<eos> Shortly before, the Colonel had denounced you in strong language for deserting him. And yet you went upstairs for "no special reason"?<eos> I was unhappy about being on bad terms with him. What's that?<eos> Speak up. The jury can't hear you.
I should like to know whether you intend to continue with the case.<eos> Yes, of course. I am planning to cut out all the witnesses except you.<eos> I'm going to rely on your evidence and my final speech to save you.<eos> I know I can trust you. I feel it.<eos> Yes, you can trust me.<eos> You will save me. But not at his expense.<eos> You understand that, don't you?<eos> I suppose that's the only way to save you.<eos> You are not to destroy him.<eos> If you do, I shall hate you as I've never hated a man.
- Thank you.<eos> - George, table four.<eos> - Yes, Mr. Talbin.<eos> - Well, my old friend slush pump.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - Do you attend all the openings?<eos> - Naturally.<eos> It's my business.<eos> If Hollis has really come out of the fog... and is half as good as he was, I can book him.<eos> I think he's going to surprise you.
Apart from this income from your wife, can you just tell the Court what personal money you have?<eos> Is that necessary, milord?<eos> I think it's a relevant question.<eos> I have about 1000 pounds in cash and a few shares in a mining syndicate.<eos> Not a large fortune, fortunes go.<eos> Not as yours goes, perhaps?<eos> Lord I ought to be protected from the sarcasm of the witness.<eos> You must answer the questions in a proper manner.<eos> Yes, milord, if they are put in a proper manner.<eos> This attitude won't help you, Mr Talbot.
Now you got a tougher one.<eos> Ajob that you can't do without knowing.<eos> O'Connell has been assigned a mission in Holland.<eos> That's the clincher to all the misinformation we have allowed him to obtain.<eos> - Holland?<eos> - The invasion of Holland.<eos> That's the lie we're trying to sell... to the German High Command, and Kuncel... O'Connell... is the salesman.<eos> - That's where you come in.<eos> - What could I do?<eos> - O'Connell asked for you.
- He's on the second floor... but I haven't been able to find out what room yet.<eos> - You go the back way.<eos> See if you can find the room.<eos> Corporal?<eos> Corporal.!<eos> Corporal!<eos> - Room 210, in the front.<eos> - Come on, Duclois.<eos> - No.<eos> No. If they get you, they'll kill you.
I can't afford to be seen with you.<eos> So long, Bernie.<eos> Sternwood residence.<eos> Hello, Norris?<eos> This is Marlowe.<eos> Yes, Mr. Marlowe. I...<eos> I'd like to come out and see General Sternwood.<eos> I don't think it would be possible tonight.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I've been trying to call you.
- No, no.<eos> If anyone's been wrong, it's us.<eos> Nobody's done anything wrong.<eos> We've enjoyed seeing you.<eos> And we hope you'll be happy here and stay a long time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Syrette, this is Cluny Brown, the new maid.<eos> Now, sit down, my dear, and finish your tea.<eos> Sit down, my dear.<eos> And when you've finished, Syrette will take you to Mrs Maile, the housekeeper.
But if by chance you should find yourself in the same room with them, you will not be in the room.<eos> You will see and not see.<eos> You will hear and not hear.<eos> And should Her Ladyship happen to address you, which I very much doubt...<eos> But if she should, you will answer "Yes, milady," or "No, milady,"<eos> depending on the circumstances.<eos> However, these things will come to you more easily when you've put on your uniform.<eos> I couldn't have stated it better myself, Mrs Maile.<eos> Thank you, Mr Syrette.<eos> And now, Brown, Weller will show you to your room.
- You know Mrs Maile suffers from rheumatism.<eos> - You haven't caught it, have you?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> But you see, if Mrs Maile hadrt sent me to the chemist's shop for Pear Tree's liniment, I might never have met Mr Wilson, the chemist.<eos> That's the way things happen.<eos> Think of it.<eos> Mrs Maile's swollen knee might change my whole life.<eos> Oh, is it as bad as that, Cluny?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> What would you think if a gentleman invited you to tea
- Good afternoon, Miss Brown.<eos> - Good afternoon, Mr Wilson.<eos> Well, Miss Brown, I could relish a crumpet or two.<eos> And you?<eos> - Ditto.<eos> - Then, uh, shall we step into the parlour?<eos> - Oh, Mr Wilson, didn't you notice anything?<eos> - Uh, notice what?<eos> The way I look.<eos> Well, I remarked about it the last time I saw you.
I don't say she clipped the cupid's wing on the punch bowl deliberately, but it's clipped, Mrs Maile.<eos> And what about the master's hunting trophies?<eos> I shall never forget the day she dusted the left eye out of Sir Henry's moose.<eos> No, Mrs Maile, she was not born with the instincts and talents of a second maid.<eos> You're so right, Mr Syrette, so right.<eos> One is born to things or one isn't.<eos> I remember when I was a little girl, I used to say to my dolly,<eos> "Did you ring, Your Ladyship?<eos> Shall I bring you tea, milady?"<eos> Mrs Maile, 15 years ago, when I saw you for the first time, you were removing the crumbs from Lady Carmel's bed with such earnestness.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Pretty sure.<eos> Won't you swear to it?<eos> I think so.<eos> Still, there is something...<eos> Yes, I swear to it.<eos> I hope you'll remember that.<eos> - Don't you remember me?<eos> - Sure if you want me to.<eos> I remember you all right.
Which one stayed here last night?<eos> One of us went to Jefferson Park.<eos> The other...<eos> But what one do which?<eos> Which one did which?<eos> I'll just have to run you both in.<eos> Are you aloud to play the field like that?<eos> What?<eos> Can you throw a number of people in the court and tell the judge to take his pick.<eos> No lawyer would take you seriously.
- A pleasant smell?<eos> - Yes. - Could you place it?<eos> - Fried onions.<eos> And this messenger, he hasn't turned up again?<eos> - No, but he will.<eos> - When? - He picks his own time and stops it.<eos> - Peter's appealed against his call-up.<eos> - That's the spirit.<eos> Don't give in. - I won't.<eos> I'm lucky June knew you.
Can't you understand?<eos> Sorry...<eos> I'm not capable...<eos> I can't share.<eos> Do you have anywhere else to sleep tonight?<eos> You are too kind.<eos> Almost all houses are free... without a lease...<eos> It depends what standard you require.<eos> It doesn't matter anyway.<eos> I am not forcing you to leave.
They got a new manager for the hotel.<eos> Any man who'd take this job must be a big sucker.<eos> - Anybody here for the Hotel Casablanca?<eos> - I'm here for the Hotel Casablanca.<eos> - Oh, are you the new manager?<eos> - New manager?<eos> Anybody here for the Hotel Casablanca?<eos> - Anybody here for the Hotel Casablanca?<eos> - Here, boy. I'm going to the hotel.<eos> They'll never let you in.
Eight days.<eos> Practically whitewashed.<eos> I'm very happy, Dev.<eos> - Why won't you let me be happy?<eos> - Nobody's stopping you.<eos> Why don't you give that copper's brain of yours a rest?<eos> Every time you look at me, I can see it running over its slogans,<eos> "Once a crook, always a crook. Once a tramp, always a tramp."<eos> Go on. You can hold my hand.<eos> I won't blackmail you for it afterwards.
Your car is waiting, doctor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is Miss Jordan, from my office.<eos> Lieutenant Stewart.<eos> How do you do, Lieutenant?<eos> Mrs. Stewart has had a nervous collapse.<eos> What a shame.<eos> Don't you worry, Lieutenant, we'll soon have her well again.<eos> You'll call for me in the morning, right?<eos> Yes, I'll pick you up at 11:30.
So they keep telling me, but...<eos> Well, she's getting worse.<eos> I'm thinking of taking her back to San Francisco to a hospital there.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you, Lieutenant.<eos> Dr. Cross is tops, you know that.<eos> You brought Harvey in to consult.<eos> You can't do any better than that.<eos> But I can't just sit around and watch her get worse.<eos> I've got to do something.<eos> Lieutenant, I wouldn't try to kid you for the world.
But why?<eos> Well... it's hard to explain.<eos> But if you come with me, I think I might be able to clarify it for you.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Penny.<eos> Good day, doctor.<eos> How are you feeling today?<eos> Just fine, doctor, just fine.<eos> That's a lovely thing you're knitting there.<eos> It's a shawl for one of my friends.<eos> Everyone here treating you well?
You have been a patient here for over three weeks now.<eos> Three weeks?<eos> That's right.<eos> So you see, this has all been a very vivid dream.<eos> You must fight these dreams, Mrs. Stewart, or they're going to become worse and we don't want that to happen.<eos> My mind is all right.<eos> It's not all right, Mrs. Stewart.<eos> Your mind is sick and it's getting worse.<eos> My mind is all right.<eos> You wouldn't like your husband to see you in that condition, would you?
- If it's around, I'm sure you will.<eos> - Oh, we're having repartee, are we? - We are not.<eos> - Now that we are all here-<eos> - But we are not.<eos> Aren't you confused, Mr. Taylor?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Sit down, Chris.<eos> The reason for this informal gathering was the news on the radio tonight that you are wanted for murder.<eos> - That's not news.<eos> You might say the police have a priority on you.
Speak to her.<eos> I'd be delighted.<eos> See you tonight.<eos> - Will it be just us?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's a joy for us to be here. We live like savages at our place.<eos> - Are you blaming me?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> Mother only meant it's delightful of you to have us over alone.<eos> You know very well I wouldn't dream of introducing you to anyone.
Somebody looked through my things.<eos> I was tidying up. Your costume fell down.<eos> And what's this?<eos> "Even if you never come, I will wait for you every day at the waterfall."<eos> Agnès, tell me about your job.<eos> What kind of work is it exactly?<eos> Are you sure no one will recognize you if you work in public?<eos> Don't be rash, Agnès.<eos> I'm not being rash, Mama.<eos> Shall I lock you in?
- Yes.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She said she would never let me go.<eos> How soon after this were you married?<eos> A couple of days later.<eos> She wanted it that way.<eos> Were you reluctant?<eos> I was doubtful.<eos> Now, Mr. Harland, I don't say this critically, nor in mockery, nor to suggest that you are conceited, but simply to be sure that I understand you correctly.<eos> You suggest that a beautiful young woman engaged to another man... falls in love with you, wins you and persuades you into a quick marriage... against your better judgment. Is that a fair statement of the facts?
- What's the matter?<eos> - What's the idea of pulling her leg?<eos> - You're not gonna take her out.<eos> - Who says I'm not?<eos> You're drunk and just making with the mouth.<eos> - Give me a drink.<eos> - That other dame... the lady, I mean...<eos> - I don't like what you're doing to her.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> You should've seen her last night looking for you... her eyes all rainy and the mascara all washed away.
Tell me.<eos> Beragons have lost two properties because of back taxes.<eos> It sounds as if they're broke.<eos> Using your gams all day hasn't hurt them.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello! Mr. Beragon, please.<eos> Now watch your Uncle Wally go to work.<eos> How do you do?<eos> This is Wallace Fay of Fay Real Estate.<eos> I've been looking forward to calling you for some time.
I've come to tell you, Mrs Bond, that when you came to see me you overlooked one vital point.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> If you succeed in involving my son in this case you will automatically defeat your own attempt to blackmail me.<eos> I cannot falsify an analysis performed by somebody else.<eos> The police will obviously decide that I'm not the proper person to do it.<eos> What are you up to? I told you, the police needn't know if you did what I said.<eos> The police already know.<eos> - David has gone to them.<eos> - The little fool.<eos> He's gone to tell them that you had an opportunity to steal strychnine when he left you in the laboratory to fetch you a glass of milk, at your request.
Miss Carmichael, please. Dr. Petersen is ready for you.
Oh, nothing.<eos> Another brave caller.<eos> I warned you.<eos> What do you want now?<eos> - I'm not here for you.<eos> I'm worried for the boy.<eos> - He's perfectly safe.<eos> And JacqueIine? - She's sitting on her bed.<eos> She's listening, but she's calm.<eos> Happy now? AII those people agree with you.
You know, sneezes and animated stuff, things like that.<eos> I have some photographs here...<eos> I'd rather you wouldn't take them out.<eos> I don't feel up to capturing them if they get loose.<eos> I think there's something you can take.<eos> I'd find out about it.<eos> Take?<eos> For what?<eos> Those glands.<eos> They're going to turn on you one of these days.
Beauty like hers demands things, Mr. McGuire:<eos> Luxury, gentle living, money.<eos> - I have these.<eos> - Are you sure she wants them?<eos> What beautiful young girl doesn't?<eos> Have you given her the chance to make up her own mind?<eos> Have you?<eos> That's fair enough.<eos> Why don't we leave it up to her?<eos> She won't leave you. She's in love with you.
- Not while he's there.<eos> - He goes out every evening?<eos> - Right, sir.<eos> Tonight after dinner.<eos> Nancy says he's told her not to let her mistress see anyone.<eos> Then you'll have to see to it that Nancy isn't home tonight.<eos> - Any little thing I can do for the Yard, sir.<eos> - I thought you wouldn't mind.<eos> There's just one thing more though.<eos> How do you know the lady herself will see you?
- It makes a difference?<eos> - No. I'd still like to help.<eos> What?<eos> He was the one at Rennit's office.<eos> All clear.<eos> What time is it?<eos> Almost 5:00.<eos> Did you sleep?<eos> I thought our friend with the fingernails might come back.<eos> You won't need to worry where I'm taking you.
- That's a pretty good reason.<eos> Besides, I need boat fare to get out of Martinique.<eos> Another good reason... but you'll have to get it from somebody else.<eos> - How do you like that?<eos> - Find anything?<eos> About $60 in cash and about $1,400 in travelers checks.<eos> Do you expect more?<eos> That bird owed me $825.<eos> "I haven't got that much on me," he says.<eos> "I'll have to go to the bank and pay you off tomorrow," he says.
He doesn't appreciate a good airplane, major.<eos> It ain't that. It's just that I don't like them big.<eos> - Tail wheel clear, sir.<eos> No damage. - Okay.<eos> Take her down the end and get her a full load of gas drop your extra tanks and get ready for action, Irish.<eos> - The Japs been hitting us with 60 bombers at a clip.<eos> You gotta be ready to take off at any time.<eos> You can see yourself, you're wide open on the ground.<eos> Colonel Blake wants to see you.<eos> I'll pick you up in a while.
Got it? Four north, 124 east.<eos> Contact all air bases in this area.<eos> Army, Navy, carriers, everyone you can reach.<eos> Tell them we sighted a big Jap task force headed south.<eos> - Give them that position.<eos> - Yes, sir. We're gonna play hide-and-seek until they get here.<eos> - Radio to pilot.<eos> - Go ahead, Peterson.<eos> Army bombers and Navy torpedo planes have reached the approximate position.<eos> Their formation leader's calling you on the command set.
- You write in bed?<eos> - What?<eos> You have ink on your fingers.<eos> From yesterday's dictation.<eos> You'll hate me for this, but the ink's still fresh.<eos> And you wash your hands before doing your nails.<eos> Laura, if you've done this...<eos> Germain, my boy, what's got into you?<eos> If you wrote that letter and put it in the box yourself if you really made that call... then Demise would be done for.<eos> I pity you, Remy.
Er... a cafe?<eos> No, sir.<eos> It's a convent.<eos> It's on the way to Ami-le-Bon.<eos> Show me the way, will you? I think I hear Armstrong coming with a bathtub now.<eos> Armstrong, I want you to take the General here over to the Crown of Thorns.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, sir, General.<eos> I sure will do that.<eos> It's kinda damp, but I'll get you there.
I may throw something your way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Where can I find the big boss?<eos> - Sorry, they're all very busy just now.<eos> I want to make a donation.<eos> What kind of donation did you want to make?<eos> Seventy or eighty thousand... dollars!<eos> Just wait!<eos> There's a man over there who'd like to give $70,000.<eos> Our captain Steadman would like to see you mister ...
- A story? - Yeah. That you aren't cooperating with the relief organizations.<eos> Not cooperating?<eos> What on earth are you talking about?<eos> ! I'd like to have your suggestion... as to how I can explain why that money... that those ladies need to finance their ball tomorrow night... must be given to you today.<eos> We had no idea there was any difficulty about the deposit.<eos> Well you see how it looks?<eos> And it looks bad!<eos> Now the heart of my organization is very much with you people... but there's certain members that think that...<eos> Greece, China, Czechoslovakia could use some...<eos> - But then... perhaps that would put you personally in a very awkward spot.
Why Bataan?<eos> Why Corregidor?<eos> Maybe they were all nuts, but there's one thing they did do:<eos> They delayed the enemy and kept delaying them until we got strong enough to hit them harder.<eos> I ain't no general, but it seems to me that's one way to win.<eos> If all I've said don't answer your question then somebody tell me why.<eos> I'm for staying.<eos> -I'll stay.<eos> -Me, too.<eos> It may surprise you, Professor to know that you're the one man I was absolutely counting on.
It's just whole wheat bread and cream cheese.<eos> It's the paprika makes it pink.<eos> - Mr. Greene.<eos> - Mrs. Greene, what would you like?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I think I'd like to propose a toast, too.<eos> - Emmy.<eos> To our distinguished visitor, the man who's made the best speech heard in this town for years.<eos> To that very good fellow, Mr. Oakley.<eos> Thank you, sir.
And then Charles went away, and I got married, and...<eos> Then you know how it is.<eos> You sort of forget you're you.<eos> You're your husband's wife...<eos> We'll be looking for you, Mr. Oakley.<eos> We feel you're one of us, don't we, Margaret?<eos> Indeed, we do.<eos> And I want to thank you on behalf of our club members.<eos> And bless you for your gift to our hospital.<eos> The children will bless you, too, in all the years to come.
Case Ables alone has wagered $20,000 on my protégé Nicely Nicely Johnson, the greatest eater alive.<eos> - He's a sure thing. - Exactly.<eos> And even a policeman will admit that when Case Ables ventures a dollar on anything it isn't exactly a laughing matter. - Except this time.<eos> My boy, Joel Duffle of Boston, will hang up a new world's record tonight.<eos> Any further wild remarks, and I start clopping again.<eos> Fiddle-de-dum.<eos> - Fiddle-de-dum?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Professor B.<eos> Mr. Ables wants to see you in the office, right away important.
- Cross my heart.<eos> Stay right with her, Little Pinks.<eos> Don't you leave her for a second.<eos> We're snowed in good with that skeleton.<eos> Kindly clear the way, please.<eos> Do you let me go through or do I start slugging? Keep it up.<eos> It's very nice to see you here, Miss Lyons. Very, very nice. - Who are you?<eos> - You wouldn't remember me.<eos> I used to work at the Club Glamor.<eos> I used to stand and watch you. - I have your picture at home on the wall.
Perhaps I can get what I want then, power.<eos> I want that as much as you want your comfort, or your job, or that girl.<eos> We all have different tastes, as you can see.<eos> Only I'm willing to back my tastes with the necessary force.<eos> You certainly make it sound smooth and easy.<eos> Well, that's a trick.<eos> I know the results of that power you believe in.<eos> It killed my friend, and it's killing thousands like him.<eos> That's what you're aiming at.<eos> But it doesn't bother you, I can see that.
- Get out of here, Leopold Dilg.<eos> - I'm sorry, but it's important.<eos> - I'm warning you!<eos> Dilg!<eos> Dilg!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Dilg, what are you doing here?<eos> You broke out of jail.<eos> In passing, it was necessary to hit me on the skull.<eos> You fool, the whole police force must be looking for you.
Where's the warm, human side?<eos> Conduct the law on sentimentality and you will have violence and disorder.<eos> Your way, you have a Greek statue.<eos> Beautiful, but dead.<eos> All right, two schools of thought.<eos> I see your point of view, theoretically.<eos> In fact, I respect it.<eos> I wish I could respect yours, professor.<eos> Joseph puts it a little strongly.<eos> He does respect you.
"The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...<eos> "Or to take arms..."<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Tura, for receiving me.<eos> If you knew how I was looking forward to this moment...<eos> - And now you're probably disappointed.<eos> - Mrs. Tura. - Please sit down.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So you are the gentleman that sent me those lovely flowers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Somehow, I pictured you quite differently as a dignified old gentleman.

I wonder if it was the right thing to ask you back here.
When I saw that picture of you at the farm, behind the plough...<eos> - By the way, where was that?<eos> - In The Chronicle. No, I mean, where is the farm?<eos> No, I think we've talked much too much about me.<eos> Tell me about yourself.<eos> There isn't much to tell.<eos> I just fly a bomber. How perfectly thrilling.<eos> I don't know about its being thrilling, but it's quite a bomber.<eos> You may not believe it, but I can drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes.<eos> - Really? - Does that interest you?
Yes, I have a vague idea.<eos> I really...<eos> Will you forgive me, please?<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes.<eos> How do you do, Colonel Ehrhardt?<eos> Yes, the trip was a little bumpy... but I'm certainly glad that you sent that plane to Sweden.<eos> Otherwise...<eos> Whenever you wish, of course.<eos> 10:00 tomorrow morning at Gestapo Headquarters... unless I hear from you tonight. Very well.
- Of course.<eos> Tell me, is Berchtesgaden really as beautiful as they say it is?<eos> Yes, I think I can say that without any risk.<eos> But it isn't the architecture or the landscaping... it's the presence of the Führer that lends the real beauty to the place.<eos> Naturally.<eos> Well, what news you bring from London?<eos> London?<eos> Oh, yes, London.<eos> Colonel, you're quiet famous in London.<eos> You know what they call you?
- Good night, Schultz.<eos> - Good night, Colonel.<eos> This Schultz!<eos> Oh, Mrs. Tura, I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't like to be impolite, but I have an appointment.<eos> I'll drive you there.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Someone is coming.<eos> - Someone is coming here.<eos> - If he should find you...
Baseball and what it represents is part of that way of life.<eos> What's the sense of abolishing what you're trying to protect?<eos> That's a beautiful thought, Sammy.<eos> - You ought to write a poem about it.<eos> - I'll do better than that.<eos> "...and she might remember what the Duke of Wellington said about sports.<eos> The duke was the baby who whipped Napoleon at Waterloo and made an ex-champ out of him.<eos> After it was all over, the duke let out that the battle was really won on the playing fields of Eton."<eos> What?<eos> Well, that's about all, Miss Harding, except at the end he calls you:
3790.<eos> This time, he's shaving.<eos> No, don't bring a lottery ticket in here.<eos> I can escape to the lobby for a moment.<eos> - I'll see you there.<eos> Right now.<eos> - Did you give him my message?<eos> Yes, and he said to have you arrested for trespassing if you came in again.<eos> Mr. Davis, give up.<eos> He'll never see you.
I tell you, he had it on a string.<eos> Don Jose, you never saw such arrogance and grace.<eos> - Yes, I did, once.<eos> - What corrida was that?<eos> That was a dozen years ago when I saw a very little boy fight a very big bull.<eos> Curro, that was the night you and I met and split that bottle of wine together.<eos> - Remember?<eos> - Yes, I've carried the scar ever since.<eos> My most prized possession, gentlemen, since it was given me by Juan Gallardo.<eos> I didn't see you again until you fought as a novillero in Madrid.
- He was obviously insane.<eos> - He was nothing of the kind.<eos> I knew him better than any of you.<eos> - He was fine and generous. - Don't cry, Bette.<eos> I can explain those tears, Inspector.<eos> The last time I spoke to Mr. Farnsworth, he told me that he loved Miss Logan... that he wanted to marry her, and asked me to divorce him.<eos> I see.<eos> You can say "aha" again. It won't get you anywhere. Quiet.<eos> Miss Logan.<eos> If he were alive, you feel sure he'd communicate with you?
What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I thought I'd given you six cards.<eos> Far from it, my little minx.<eos> Far from it.<eos> - And 100.<eos> - I wonder if I have enough money.<eos> Oh, yes, plenty, plenty.<eos> I'll raise you 1,000.<eos> I don't want to win so much from you, but I'll call you just to show you how hopeless it is.
It was about you.<eos> About me?<eos> Sure was crazy.<eos> I dreamt I was your father.<eos> There was something I was trying to stop you from doing.<eos> So, I got out of bed,<eos> I walked right through the wall, straight into your room. You know how dreams are.<eos> You were there in bed, but you were a girl, about 1 0... and very pretty, too.<eos> I shook you and... the moment you opened your eyes, you hopped out of bed and started running like the devil.<eos> You ran out the window, over the tops of buildings and roofs for miles and I was chasing you.
The Barhams? I thought you didn't like them.<eos> I loathe them.<eos> Really, it's most extraordinary.<eos> You're not really going to church, are you?<eos> Certainly, I am.<eos> No you're not, you're coming for a walk with me.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Tell you what I'll do, I'll toss you for it. Heads you do, tails you don't.<eos> Mother.<eos> Now what did you think I was trying to do, kill you?
Certainly, I am.<eos> No you're not, you're coming for a walk with me.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Tell you what I'll do, I'll toss you for it. Heads you do, tails you don't.<eos> Mother.<eos> Now what did you think I was trying to do, kill you?<eos> Nothing less than murder could justify such violent self-defense. - Look at you.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> I'm just beginning to understand.<eos> You thought I was going to kiss you, didn't you?
Will you excuse me, Isobel? I want to make some inquiries.<eos> - Certainly, my dear.<eos> - I'll see you for dinner soon. - Delighted.<eos> - I'll phone you, then.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Hello, old girl.<eos> Mr. Thwaite, I owe you an apology.<eos> Good. I mean, what for?<eos> I'll explain to you later, but I'm afraid I've done you an injustice.<eos> You've done me an injustice? Thanks very much. I, my dear, forgive you from the bottom of my heart.
Won't you come in, Captain...?<eos> - Curtis.<eos> - Come in, Captain Curtis.<eos> I was just about to have some tea.<eos> Won't you join me?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I'm sure Sheila won't be long.<eos> - Won't you sit down?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Was she expecting you?
When you've been married 25 years, as I have, you'll look back and wonder...<eos> But never mind that.<eos> One more word from you, and I'll be forced to have you disciplined.<eos> Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.<eos> Now, here's a problem for that charming Captain Curtis to handle.<eos> I have a funny hunch he's working on it.<eos> - Miss Winthrop...<eos> - You're wasting time, colonel.<eos> You hear that?<eos> The whole blooming Army is calling for you.
- What are these?<eos> - There were some sort of stones in it.<eos> Stones?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Quick.<eos> They were loose, so I took them out and put them in here.<eos> There you are!<eos> Alice Barlow's brooch, Alice Barlow's rubies.<eos> L20,000 worth.<eos> This brooch and these rubies are going to send you to the gallows.
The whole family is a little bit crazy.<eos> - $25,000- can you imagine?<eos> - A dreamer.<eos> - Mrs Schwartz, Mr Zimmerman...<eos> - Let me handle this.<eos> He gave me a cheque.<eos> - If he says he did...<eos> - then he did.<eos> Just go home and think it all over.<eos> I'll break you in so many pieces...
Well, there's always money where the ghost walks. Cute.<eos> I hope you still feel as comical when you come out of the castle, my friend.<eos> You smell something burning?<eos> Sulfur, no less.<eos> Thanks for dashing to the rescue.<eos> Well, I got a little excited when I read your fan mail.<eos> I don't mind saying that it did something to my girlish morale.<eos> That was the idea, to scare you off the boat.<eos> What's the answer?<eos> Lady, one or more persons, identity unknown, definitely do not want you in that castle.
Well, well, how are you?<eos> No, he hasn`t been playing much lately.<eos> Went around in 92, really?<eos> You want to speak to his Excellency?<eos> Just now he`s a little hoarse.<eos> No, I mean he can`t talk.<eos> May I take a message?<eos> He says no doubt you`ve heard about Osterlich. He`d like to discuss it.<eos> Ask him to come here.<eos> His Excellency invites you to Tomainia to discuss the matter.
I'm Edythe Van Hopper.<eos> It's so nice to run into you here, just when I was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in Monte.<eos> But do sit down and have some coffee.<eos> Mr. De Winter is having some coffee with me.<eos> Go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup.<eos> I'm afraid I must contradict you.<eos> You shall both have coffee with me.<eos> Garcon. Coffee, please. - Cigarette?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> You know, I recognized you as soon as you came in, though I haven't seen you since that night at the casino at Palm Beach.
- This your car, sir?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Will you be going soon? This isn't a parking place, you know.<eos> Oh, isn't it?<eos> Well, people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to.<eos> It's a pity some of you fellows haven't anything better to do.<eos> When you phoned, did she say she'd wait up?<eos> I asked her to go to bed, but she wouldn't hear of it.<eos> I wish I could get some more speed out of this thing.<eos> Is something worrying you, Maxim?
I appeal to your sense of chivalry, Your Honor. I take it you're a married man and that the charming lady who opened the door was your, uh--<eos> Spent the night in my field. From out of the state.<eos> My learned opponent here, I-I mean that bug with a shotgun is trying to inject into this case an element of--<eos> You plead guilty or not guilty?<eos> - To what?<eos> - It must be all kind of funny to you--<eos> To trespass, destruction of private property, and petty larceny.<eos> - What'll you settle for? - What will I settle for?<eos> Did you ever hear of contempt of court while you were studying the law?<eos> I think I'll just remand you to the constable and send you over to the county seat.
-Bear that in mind in your future ventures.<eos> -Yes, Madam.<eos> Now to business.<eos> I understand your voyage was very profitable.<eos> Unusually so, Madam.<eos> An inventory of the treasure, with the crown's share at your disposal.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I shall put it to good use.<eos> If what I've done has pleased Your Grace, I have a favor to ask.<eos> That our contributions induce you to begin work on the fleet.
Oh, thank you.<eos> See you later son.<eos> Well Stu.<eos> Do you want something?<eos> Me?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> I've been wanting to meet you for some time Mr. O'Neil.<eos> That's wonderful!<eos> You mean you like the band?<eos> Oh I didn't mean I wanted to meet the band exactly, although I thought they did back you up rather well.
- This time, he...<eos> - Don't distress yourself, Mrs. Carlsen.<eos> Just take your time.<eos> This time, he must have awakened still drunk and started the car.<eos> Oh, it's awful.<eos> He wanted so much to live.<eos> - He had everything to live for.<eos> - Thank you, Mrs. Carlsen.<eos> I regret that I've been forced to question you.<eos> I won't bother you further.
Here, do you see this? That's General Gage's own order. What more do you want?<eos> Here, do you see this? It's the King's proclamation.<eos> We want to see the goods. Nothing short of that will satisfy the people around here.<eos> You'll inspect no goods in my care.<eos> I've my orders.<eos> It might be as well to remember, this road is not a military road.<eos> And while we're talking, you might get it through your head. We built your fort. We'll not have it used against us.<eos> Now, will you let us in? I will not.<eos> You're using our fort as a storehouse for illegal goods.<eos> According to the King's proclamation, you're a criminal. And we'll deal with you as a criminal.
Hey, Asta, come here.<eos> That's not that kind of a cat.<eos> What are you sticking your pretty nose in here for, chum?<eos> - Sorry, the door was open.<eos> - All right, you made your joke.<eos> Now, pull your freight. Get going.<eos> Just as you say, Chief.<eos> - Good evening, sir.<eos> - How do?<eos> Mr. Church expecting you.
- What fuse?<eos> - The fuse that was blowed out.<eos> - How did you know it was blowed out?<eos> - I don't know nothing.<eos> I was just doing what Mrs. Bellam told me.<eos> - And you were here reading?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ain't that late for a lady your age to be up?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Got things on your mind that worry you? Keep you awake?
He said that if I gave him the $14.75, he'd tell me where Dum-Dum was.<eos> How are you going to contact this mysterious informer?<eos> I told him I'd be holding the money in a handkerchief like this.<eos> But, you didn't have any money until I showed up.<eos> I was doing all right. I'd have gotten it.<eos> - Madame.<eos> At last.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I knew you would come to me.<eos> I've been watching you all evening... with that thought in heart and in my eyes.
Fine.<eos> - Where is Mr. Wilson?<eos> - He's on the train.<eos> On the train?<eos> It was awfully nice of you floating this case my way.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> If you hadn't sent for me... I'd probably be home now in a nice warm bedroom... in a comfortable bed, with a hot toddy.<eos> - That's a drink.<eos> - That's too bad.<eos> If it was up to me, I'd let you on the train like that.
Will you walk on the ceiling?<eos> And when I'm on the ceiling, you'll run out and call...<eos> You'll run away.<eos> That's the farthest thought from my mind, so help me the law of gravity.<eos> All right, I'll walk on the ceiling if you will, too.<eos> No, thanks. I'll sit this one out.<eos> I'm just an old groundhog.<eos> I shouldn't even be out until February.<eos> But it's so easy.<eos> The bottom of the shoe creates a suction that holds you up on the ceiling.
No, of course not.<eos> The number is 5-8-3-9-6.<eos> And I think it might be better if you didn't mention my being here, just to avoid any misunderstanding.<eos> Well, there's nothing broken.<eos> Might be a slight concussion.<eos> We'll know better in the morning.<eos> And I don't have to tell his mother and father tonight?<eos> John, just give me a hand here, will you?<eos> Maida, perhaps you better get those car keys.<eos> Thank you so much for your help.
Well, this is sort of a cleaning day.<eos> Well, incidentally, it was darn nice of you to cover up for Mrs Duross.<eos> Oh, that's all right. I hope somebody will do as much for me some day.<eos> Well, I hope that won't be necessary.<eos> Well, you never know. Look... Don't get the wrong idea about last night, will you?<eos> The whole thing was an accident. Not only to the car, but my being with Suzanne, Mrs Duross.<eos> She was the accident.<eos> That's something for you to tell Mrs Walker, isn't it?<eos> Well, I did and she wouldn't believe me.<eos> And that's something I want to talk to you about.
I imagine she will still be there.<eos> Hello.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Miss.<eos> They want you up in room 802.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> Dr Muller, this is Miss Eden.<eos> How do you do?<eos> How is he, Doctor?<eos> Our patient wants to see you, Miss Eden.
Where's Dr Gateson?<eos> In his office.<eos> You can take the stairs there. Room 706. Thank you.<eos> 802.<eos> The first door.<eos> Wait.<eos> Please, don't go in there.<eos> How dare you!<eos> Alec is very ill. He may not live.<eos> But if he does live, it'll be because he believes he'll never see you again.
- Anything up to ten.<eos> - One to ten, number...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> If you want to gamble on who flies in that weather, pick someone else for a number.<eos> - Bonnie.<eos> - Anything up to ten.<eos> - Not me.<eos> I feel the same way he does.<eos> - Nobody's worrying about who's flying.<eos> We're worried about who's going to take you to dinner.
I've gotten you into some of our very best homes!<eos> Yes, for some of their very best insults.<eos> What?<eos> Who was Mrs. Buck Winston before she married Buck Winston?<eos> La Comtesse De Lave.<eos> Imagine giving up a title to marry that cowhand.<eos> I laugh every time I think she got him into radio.<eos> My dear, he's positively the chambermaid's delight!<eos> Is he?<eos> Mrs. Potter is on the phone for you, Mrs. Fowler.
There's little to choose between them.<eos> -What's your name?<eos> -Much, the miller's son.<eos> -It's death to kill the king's deer?<eos> -And death from hunger if I don't.<eos> Thanks to you and the rest of you Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle.<eos> -Be quiet, you.<eos> -I won't be quiet!<eos> You can kill me if you like, but not until I've had my say.<eos> You can beat and starve us Saxons now but when King Richard escapes, he'll take you by the scruff of the neck and fling you into the sea!
You can save three miles and cut him off through Low Wood.<eos> Come on, lass, give us a kiss and wish me luck.<eos> Hurry up and take your ugly face out of here.<eos> Oh, Much.<eos> Oh, you will be careful, won't you?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Greetings, sir abbot!<eos> -You've traveled far this morning?<eos> -Too far to be patient with delay now.<eos> Perhaps it's the weight of your purse that wearies you.
- Stop it! - You're shedding.<eos> Now, where's the telephone?<eos> - Out that door. - That's all I want to know.<eos> What I want to suggest is...<eos> I don't want any more suggestions from you.<eos> My fiancée is waiting for me.<eos> In order to get married, I have to get to New York.<eos> I want you to be married, I think you should be married.<eos> I think every man should be.<eos> But I don't think any girl will marry you... - looking the way you do. - Where's the phone?
- What did you say?<eos> I just said...<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'll find the place myself.<eos> The gardener must have clothes. Clothes are clothes.<eos> The gardener's in town.<eos> He couldn't have taken all his clothes with him! Yes, he could.<eos> Of all the conceited, spoiled little scatterbrains.<eos> My goodness, the man who gets...<eos> The man who gets you is gonna have a lifetime of misery!
Connors, you better go in there, give Miss Cooper a teaspoonful. - It's very important.<eos> Make her take it.<eos> - Miss Cooper, yes, sir.<eos> Steve, maybe we better walk down.<eos> - Are you Miss Cooper? - Yes.<eos> Dr. Flagg sent me to take care of you.<eos> Well, how nice of Dr. Flagg.<eos> Come in.<eos> What does he think should be done?<eos> Well, I'm gonna give you something that'll relax you completely.
I got up at six in the morning and went to bed at nine at night.<eos> What was he doing when you met?<eos> A draughtsman.<eos> Was that his sole livelihood?<eos> Did you become his mistress at once?<eos> I was smitten.<eos> You didn't waste any time.<eos> I did, I was locked away till the age of 21.<eos> Life in an orphanage is hard and so sad.<eos> They took you in and enabled you to live.
Thanks.<eos> What for?<eos> For calling my lawyer.<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> Maybe I'm a social climber or a fortune hunter. Or maybe I'm beginning to like you very much.<eos> Anyway...<eos> I realize I should let go of your hand, But the fact is, I'm finding I don't want to.<eos> You've been very sweet.<eos> Thanks.<eos> When can I see you again?
am I being paged?<eos> Hello, Eddie. Thought you were in jail.<eos> Got out a week ago. They knocked off a couple of years<eos> Because I was a good boy.<eos> Look here, Eddie. I had nothing to do with this.<eos> I'm just up here on a job. I got 100 smackers for it.<eos> Shut up, rat.<eos> Put those papers back in the envelope.<eos> You know, Norris, you've just done a stretch.<eos> If they nab you with that water pistol, You're going to catch an awful spanking.
I refuse to answer.<eos> I must see the district attorney immediately.<eos> I'll not be intimidated!<eos> Please sit over there and wait your turn.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> bring in that police report. Yes, sir.<eos> Norris, we're going before the grand jury in a few minutes.<eos> Why don't you write out a confession?<eos> You threatened to kill anyone that mistreated Sheila.<eos> Now, look, Norris, I'm your pal. Play ball with us, and I'll get you off with second degree.
So that's it.<eos> Beldon helped you murder your husband Because he found out about you two, oh, no.<eos> And Beldon loved you enough To get rid of the body for you!<eos> No! Then you murdered Beldon because he knew too much!<eos> Oh, lieutenant Brent, There isn't very much left in my life.<eos> I really don't care what you do with me.<eos> Do as you please. Take her back to her cell.<eos> Hello, Miss Manton.<eos> Glad to see you.<eos> Lieutenant Brent is waiting for you.
Now, here's the idea, Miss Manton.<eos> You saw Ronny Beldon come out of the Lane house, didn't you? Yes.<eos> Everybody knows you're mixed up in this.<eos> Collected evidence. Everybody suspects you holding out.<eos> Even I do. Oh, I'll bet you say that to all the girls.<eos> Oh. Now, what would happen if we published the fact That you had just uncovered some new evidence<eos> I'd probably be found In a refrigerator.<eos> That's right.<eos> Well, isn't it lucky I didn't find any new evidence?<eos> Now, all you have to do Is appear in public with Pete here Where the murderer can get at you.
Is the chef from headquarters, too?<eos> Nah.<eos> Good.<eos> Dance?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> Is it necessary for you to hold me so tightly?<eos> Of course, you make a better target by yourself.<eos> Why don't you draw red circles around me And rent me out to a rifle range?<eos> That wasn't the real reason I was holding you so close.
What is all this?<eos> Tell him, Miss Manton.<eos> He killed Lane and Beldon.<eos> He used an electric handcar in the new subway To get there and back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look. She gave you a break with the alibi, Norris.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> We won't do anything about this till tomorrow.<eos> Take a head start and beat it.<eos> If they do nab you, I'll play you up sympathetically in the papers.
Hurry!<eos> The back way out.<eos> It's safe here.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> I'll get your things.<eos> Masseur.<eos> Stay put.<eos> I knew from the start.<eos> Tokyo lady, you may fool those who can see. But you can't fool me.<eos> Though blind, I've been watching you.
What are you gonna do, take a poke at him and lose your job?<eos> I'll take a poke at him and I'll get another job too.<eos> That don't worry me none.<eos> You were a long time getting this one.<eos> Weren't you, Frank?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Why don't you get wise to yourself?<eos> You don't have to be pushed by no foreigners.<eos> There are a lot of guys in this town. Americans who feel like you and me.
You may proceed.<eos> Now, Mrs. Danvers, you knew the deceased, Edward Jackson, did you not?<eos> Yes, sir, I did.<eos> And is it true that you were at one time engaged to marry him?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Who broke off that engagement?<eos> I did.<eos> Why?<eos> I was forced to.<eos> Will you kindly tell the jury what forced you to?
The sun in a bottle.<eos> Exuberance in a flask.<eos> I shouldn't drink.<eos> I'm in mourning.<eos> A loved one, I suppose.<eos> No, but I don't have a family.<eos> So when an interesting person is murdered, I mourn for a while.<eos> It's a distraction. I feel less lonely.<eos> It's sad to be alone.<eos> Do you want us to comfort you?
Good morning, Mr. Conway.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - Very well, thank you.<eos> Children, Teacher is going to be very busy this afternoon.<eos> So, school's dismissed.<eos> Please.<eos> I hope you're not going to run away this time.<eos> My name's Sondra.<eos> I hope you'll forgive me for...<eos> You know, each time I see you, I hear that music.
What happened, Shinza?<eos> Nothing<eos> What'll you have to eat?<eos> Anything will do<eos> You'd better lie low<eos> If Yatagoro's men catch you, there'll be hell to pay<eos> Not too hot, old man<eos> Mr Unno!<eos> What a surprise!<eos> Won't your wife scold you for coming here?
You poor kid. You've never been to New York?<eos> No, my grandmother took me there when I was three, but I didn't appreciate it. Listen, we'll show you the town.<eos> We'll take you everywhere. You'll have more fun than if you lived a hundred years in this moth-eaten yep-and-nope village.<eos> - That's so very true...<eos> - Is it a bargain? I don't know.<eos> It would be imposing on everybody because... Imposing?<eos> In what way?<eos> Oh, I just thought it'd be wrong to make people sad. - I'd be kind of a killjoy, wouldn't I?<eos> - Listen, I'll be frank with you.<eos> Even if I sound like a ghoul. You'll be a sensation. The whole town will take you to its heart.
- Are you looking for Johnny Blake?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> My name's Nick Fenner.<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> Well, I've got to find him.<eos> - You're Lee Morgan?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You run the numbers game up in the Bronx.<eos> So what?<eos> - I hear they started running you out.
And the first thing we want you to do is to collect our royalties in the garage tonight and bring them here.<eos> I've already made arrangements about collecting them.<eos> - Will it be all right if I'm here at 10?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> Before we go into detailed instructions, I suggest we drink to Mr. Blake's success.<eos> - Well, that's a good idea.<eos> - How about it?<eos> Well, it'll taste pretty good.<eos> You're making a mistake not telling the public what you're doing.<eos> - The papers are blasting at you.
And, do give fodder.<eos> - Yessir.<eos> And once again, take good care of the training of the recruits.<eos> Our officer's uniform is a little bit as the robe of a missionary.<eos> It is thus with goodness, with discipline and with good example, that we must guide the soldier and make of him a perfect citizen.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> You are free.<eos> - Gentlemen Officers, attention!<eos> Oh, Second Lieutenant Rolla, stay on.<eos> You, Second Lieutenant Solaro, wait a moment outside, I'll send for you.
- Why?<eos> Oh, I don't want to wake up some morning and find myself married.<eos> Acted as cold as I could. A dame like that always makes me feel like a heel.<eos> She brings out your finer instincts.<eos> - Where have you been, Bilgy?<eos> I want you to meet my shipmate, Bake Baker.<eos> This is a friend of mine, Mrs. Manning.<eos> How do you do, Mrs. Manning?<eos> I'm always happy to meet a friend of Bilgy's.<eos> Sometime when I'm having a party I'll invite you to come.
Why, everything, everything, J.J.<eos> You're just in the prime of life.<eos> You're right at the peak.<eos> Why, you'll soon be the old hard-fisted, fire-eating producer again.<eos> Think of your responsibilities.<eos> Think of the audiences of America.<eos> The millions of them.<eos> Think of posterity.<eos> Well, you can't let them down.<eos> You may be broke but you've got us and we'll get together and put you back on your feet where you belong.
Couldn't you, Mr. Chandler?<eos> Yes, yes, and back again.<eos> - Good night, Dad.<eos> - Good night, dear.<eos> Good night, Mr. Chandler.<eos> Don't keep father up too late with your fish stories.<eos> Gluckman's Point?<eos> Glasses?<eos> How do I look?<eos> Nobody in the world will know you.
Why this change of heart?<eos> You're so fragile.<eos> - Fragile.<eos> - Yes, you damage so easily.<eos> - Damage?<eos> - Sues for $5 million.<eos> That fascinates me.<eos> Asks $5 million damages.<eos> - So the Burns-Norvells told you.<eos> - It gave me a new light on you.
- Now look, Gladys...<eos> - You're 10 times worse than he is!<eos> At least he had some excuse for kicking me around.<eos> He was in love with another woman.<eos> But you double-crossed me for the sake of a newspaper!<eos> Marry the paper and be the proud father of a lot of headlines!<eos> That's all you're good for anyway.<eos> I suppose this is all very distasteful to you, Miss Allenbury.<eos> You're not accustomed to hearing the truth.<eos> You've had money to protect you from it all your life!
No. You never go out without telling us.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - We're your bodyguards.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr Cobb said stick to your tail.<eos> That's very nice, but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail.<eos> Sorry, mister.<eos> Orders is orders.<eos> We get you up in the morning, put you to bed at night.
- Uh, no. Nobody important.<eos> Be sure and point them out to me.<eos> I'm a writer myself, you know.<eos> Well... you've been having quite an exciting time, haven't you?<eos> With all these meetings, business deals, society people.<eos> - Haven't you been having fun?<eos> - No.<eos> That is, I didn't until I met you.<eos> I like talking to you, though.<eos> Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - How'd you like to make five dollars?<eos> Huh? I didn't quite catch what you said.<eos> I said, how'd you like to make five dollars?<eos> - Five dollars?<eos> - Five dollars.<eos> Well, I don't want to seem inquisitive, but what would I have to do for it?<eos> All you have to do is go to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me,<eos> I'll show you to a few people, and then I'll send you right back.
Someday I'm going gorilla hunting, and I won't miss.<eos> Has Cornelia gone?<eos> Yes, darling, she's gone.<eos> - Where's Godfrey?<eos> - He's here.<eos> Don't go away, Godfrey.<eos> We'll be late for the concert.<eos> I'll be right with you.<eos> Godfrey's right here.<eos> Godfrey, come over here so Irene can look at you.
- I won't cry, I promise.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> After all, I'm your protege.<eos> - You want me to improve myself?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You don't want me to go on being just a butler all my life, do you?<eos> - I want you to be anything you want. - Well, that's very sweet.<eos> - When are you leaving?<eos> - Oh, pretty soon.<eos> But I'll call you up every now and then.
Yes, indeed.<eos> Just leave everything to Godfrey.<eos> Godfrey will take care of everything.<eos> Now, you just sit right down there like a good girl, and in just a minute you'll forget that you had any trouble.<eos> - I thought so.<eos> Let that be a lesson.<eos> Godfrey!<eos> Oh, Godfrey, don't go away!<eos> Oh, Godfrey, now I know you love me.<eos> - I do not love you!
He wouldn't live long enough to tell us.<eos> You said there's only one chance in a thousand he'd live.<eos> - But, it's worth that chance.<eos> - Why?<eos> Werner, the evidence that Ellman will be able to give to you will be nothing compared to the information he'll be able to give me.<eos> Secrets from the beyond.<eos> Things that no man has ever dreamt of are within my reach.<eos> Think of it.<eos> Pardon me, doctor.<eos> Mr. Nolan is waiting to see you in your office.
- Is this your husband's coat?<eos> His Sunday best one, but never mind.<eos> They must not see you.<eos> - What will happen to you?<eos> - I'll say I couldn't stop you.<eos> - He'll not ill treat you?<eos> - He'll pray at me, but no more.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Margaret.<eos> Good-bye, Margaret. I'll never forget you for this.
- The professor wants his lunch.<eos> - There's no hurry, my dear.<eos> Still, if you must go...<eos> Pat, ring for Captain Ogilvey's car.<eos> - Come again another time.<eos> - Good-bye. We'd love to.<eos> Whenever you catch him, you'll find me at the Sherif Court every morning.<eos> - Bring him along. - Good-bye.<eos> Louisa, if you'll excuse us...<eos> Now, Mr. Hannay... I suppose it's safe to call you by your real name now.
They must be a mile away by now.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Do stop whistling.<eos> You can't possibly escape.<eos> What chance have you got tied to me?<eos> That question's for your husband.<eos> I'll admit you're the white man's burden.<eos> I know, and I can't tell you what comfort that thought gives me.<eos> What's the use of this?<eos> Those policemen will get you as soon as it's daylight.
Facts from history, from geography... from newspapers, from scientific textbooks... millions and millions of them down to the smallest detail.<eos> Test him, ladies and gentlemen. Ask him any question.<eos> I've got it!<eos> Of course there are no papers missing.<eos> All the information's inside Memory's head.<eos> Mr. Memory.<eos> - I still don't understand. - Don't you see?<eos> The details of that Air Ministry secret were borrowed, memorized by this man... and then replaced before anyone could find out.<eos> That's why he's here: to take Memory out of the country after the show.<eos> - Some gentlemen want to speak to you.
One would think you were still at medical school.<eos> Geraniums!<eos> You would think of geraniums... when every other able-bodied man is out fighting.<eos> It's out of favor I seem to be with you, my vinegary virgin.<eos> - Half the town is saying you're a papist.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I have the sense to sleep tonight instead of rushing to my ruin... in an attempt to put this Duke of Monmouth on the throne?<eos> He'd be even worse than King James.<eos> Make haste with that cloak there, my pretty one.<eos> And the other half of the town that defends you... claims that you're just a coward.
My business was with his wounds, not his politics.<eos> Did you know the law... that any person who does knowingly receive, harbor, comfort... or succor a rebel is as guilty as if he himself bore arms?<eos> I only knew my sacred duty as a physician.<eos> Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king!<eos> I thought it was to my fellow man.<eos> It's a fearful thing to send a man's soul to perdition... but I am bound by my conscience... and my love of my king to deal out justice.<eos> Therefore, I instruct you, gentlemen of the jury... that inasmuch as Peter Blood has admitted... aiding a traitor to your king... you do bring in a verdict of guilty... that he may be hanged... for the high treason he has committed.<eos> What a creature must sit on the throne... who lets a man like you deal out his justice.<eos> - Your Majesty.<eos> - Sunderland, what brings you here?
Go on.<eos> I've resented you because your name is Bishop.<eos> My thoughts have lumped you with your uncle.<eos> How was I to know that a devil could have...<eos> That a devil could have an angel for a niece?<eos> From a resentful man, that is a pretty fair compliment.<eos> Have you any more reasons for resenting me like that one?<eos> Indeed, I have.<eos> And the strongest of all...<eos> I've resented you because you're beautiful, and I'm a slave.
- Where's Byam?<eos> - I couldn't help it, Stewart.<eos> When the man looks at me, I want to jump overboard.<eos> Where's Byam?<eos> - The old man sent him aloft.<eos> - You let him take the blame, huh?<eos> Here, here!<eos> You've started enough trouble!<eos> Time you learn discipline!<eos> Get into your hammock before I put you over a gun!
You're almost not a man.<eos> Almost...<eos> A god?<eos> Yes.<eos> A God with the taint of human emotions.<eos> The scar is almost gone.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> When I touch it, does it still hurt?<eos> No.<eos> A month ago, I didn't know you.
Ladislaw.<eos> Oh, don't go away. I want to thank you.<eos> Gee, you saved my life. I'm ever so much obliged to you.<eos> Oh, it's nothing at all.<eos> Oh, I mean you're welcome, of course.<eos> Do you know where I can find Madam Roberta?<eos> Yes.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I didn't really mean that about a dumb foreigner.<eos> I forgive you.
It's no crime to look, is it?<eos> - I think there is no gas left.<eos> Perhaps I'd better look at the engine, where is it?<eos> They may have hidden it up there under the hood.<eos> This is the first time I ever had to walk back from a boat ride.<eos> Jerry, you mustn't come with me.<eos> I'd rather talk to Alberto alone.<eos> Alberto will have to get accustomed to talking in front of me. No, seriously,<eos> I'd rather you wouldn't. Please.<eos> When am I going to see you again?
Well, I've been waiting for an opportunity like this since my childhood.<eos> You frozen-faced flatfoot.<eos> And grazie to you if it comes to that, you stultified shrimp.<eos> Can I help it if you look like a mildewed donkey?<eos> I'm adoring this.<eos> And grazie to you, since you insist.<eos> You see, I happen to be breaking the law.<eos> I admit it wholeheartedly... but, of course, you would never know that, you fish-faced nincompoop.<eos> Good night.<eos> I arrest you for masquerading as a gondolier.
Hey, sister.<eos> There is fifty grand on this case.<eos> Can you tell him I'm here?<eos> Mr Gentry is very busy.<eos> You will have to take your turn with the rest.<eos> Good morning, Mr Mclintock.<eos> ─ Say, my appointment was for 9 o'clock.<eos> It's half past now.<eos> I've got some very important games. Mr Gentry will see you as soon as he possibly can.
I can take care of myself.<eos> You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.<eos> Here's your ticket.<eos> My ticket?<eos> I found it on the seat.<eos> Thank you. It must have fallen out of my purse.<eos> You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - You won't get away with it.<eos> Your father will stop you before you get halfway to New York.
I could dance with you till the cows come home.<eos> On second thought, I'd rather you came home.<eos> Where's my secretary? - Here I am!<eos> - Good heavens!<eos> Take a letter.<eos> - Who to? - To my dentist.<eos> "Dear Dentist, Enclosed find check for $500." Send it off now.<eos> I'll have to enclose a check first.<eos> - You do and I'll fire you.<eos> Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.
That's wonderful of you, but His Excellency won't hear of it.<eos> Perhaps he will listen to you.<eos> You think so?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - I'll call him.<eos> I hate to disturb you.<eos> You're a busy man, but I must see you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Oh.<eos> You can come in the back way, no one'll see you.
You've sunk $ 70,000 already, and you're gonna toss that away because of a dame?<eos> That's my funeral, ain't it?<eos> And the funeral of 200 other people:<eos> Chorus girls, boys, electricians.<eos> You wouldn't be that mean, would you?<eos> Well, I think she ought to apologize.<eos> Why, of course she'll apologize.<eos> She'll be sorry by morning.<eos> I wish you wouldn't take it like this.<eos> Back in New York, they're calling you "The Angel of Broadway."
- Why?<eos> - You go in for dangerous things.<eos> - Darned if I don't!<eos> Slow down!<eos> I said the office, not the cemetery!<eos> I never knew there were women like you in the world. You're game and decent.<eos> And so determined to live that I'll take a taxi if you don't watch where you go.<eos> I've only known you 24 hours, but I'm in love with you.<eos> Doesn't usually take that long.<eos> I forgive you.
Give it here, it's late.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - I'll bring some coffee.<eos> Mom, when will buy me the gloves?<eos> Tonight.<eos> But, you must be nice, okay?<eos> She's always nice.<eos> What a hurry!<eos> They won't eat you if you arrive a bit late.
- Good morning.<eos> You're becoming more beautiful every day.<eos> What do we do about it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank, that's all.<eos> When are you and Matt going to get married?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - Stalling, eh?<eos> Anything new?<eos> The directors are waiting for you in the boardroom.
Now, get out.<eos> I'm appealing to you, Mrs Dickson.<eos> Think what you're doing to him.<eos> You're passing up the whitest man on earth for a dirty, no-good...<eos> Cyril.<eos> Now, get out of here.<eos> Wait a minute, Matt.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> But you needn't go on account of this idiot.<eos> You better carry that around with you all the time.
- No. Not with strangers.<eos> - Never?<eos> - Never.<eos> - Thanks very much.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - I say....<eos> - Are you back again?<eos> He must be an awful nice fellow.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Whoever's keeping you waiting.
- You approached us!<eos> - Please wait.<eos> Can you imagine 100 girls in a ballet school... each thinking she would become the most famous dancer in the world?<eos> I was ambitious then.<eos> We were drilled like little soldiers.<eos> No rest, no stopping.<eos> I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.<eos> Then I became famous soon.<eos> But why am I telling you all this?<eos> Last night I didn't know you at all.
- I don't know.<eos> One can't get intimate just offhand.<eos> I could go to England with you and all that, but....<eos> I always say that nothing should be left hanging over.<eos> And names are like that.<eos> Supposing I met you next year and I said:<eos> "How do you do, Mr. Preysing."<eos> And you said, "That's the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester."<eos> That's all quite proper.<eos> But supposing I saw you and yelled:
We hang around here... - That's all I wanna know.<eos> Prof. Wagstaff from Huxley College.<eos> - That means nothing to me.<eos> Means nothing to me, either.<eos> I'll try it over again.<eos> I'm Prof. Huxley from Wagstaff College.<eos> You didn't stay at the other one long.<eos> Why don't you pull yourself to pieces?<eos> - I'll talk it over with my partner.<eos> In case I never see you again, what would you want to play football?
Here, put your name on there.<eos> Gee, I didn't know you could write.<eos> Wait a minute, this isn't legal.<eos> There's no seal on it.<eos> Where's the seal?<eos> - Where's the seal?<eos> And thus we see that the function of the respiratory system is to transmit oxygen into the bloodstream, which is called osmosis...<eos> Have they started sawing a woman in half yet?<eos> Mr President, what a pleasure!<eos> What brings you here?
You filthy, good-for-nothing convict!<eos> A bluff?<eos> You'll see.<eos> -You'll see.<eos> -Put that down.<eos> -Give me the police station.<eos> -Put that down!<eos> You don't think you'll stop me, do you, now that I've made up my mind?<eos> We'll only take a minute of your time, Mr. James.<eos> In view of your marvelous achievement on the new Stevens Bridge... the Chamber of Commerce would like you as their principal speaker at their banquet.
What do you know about a will anyhow? You're only a lawyer.<eos> Now, Mr Glidden, you shouldn't exert yourself this way.<eos> "Now, Mr Glidden." I'm up, aren't I? I walk.<eos> Every time you leave the room, I walk.<eos> I walked over there just a little bit ago.<eos> Nobody's gonna tell John Glidden what to do.<eos> What if it does kill me?<eos> I'm gonna die anyhow.<eos> Today, tomorrow, what's the difference?<eos> Now, just a moment and I'll fix you up a...
Shall I pay it?<eos> If it isn't the work of that forger we've been warned about, I'm crazy.<eos> Look at that n.<eos> You're right. It's a false cheque.<eos> There he goes, Mike!<eos> Come in.<eos> - Are you Eddie Jackson?<eos> - Who wants to know?<eos> I do.<eos> I've been trying to get in touch with you all day.
"The most dangerous game"?<eos> You mean tigers?<eos> Tigers?<eos> No.<eos> The tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs.<eos> I heard some queer beast howling back there along the water.<eos> Was that it?<eos> It's no use, Rainsford.<eos> He won't tell.<eos> He won't even let you see his trophy room... till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit.
This requires a little thought.<eos> Now, easy down on my back.<eos> Get off of my back!<eos> Why don't you be careful?<eos> Come on!<eos> Now "Hi-ho"!<eos> - Would you gentlemen please let me pass?<eos> - Why, certainly, Ma'am.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Just a moment, maybe I can help you.
It serves her right.<eos> - I feel sorry for her.<eos> - Well, I don't see why.<eos> Mary, look at me.<eos> If I permit you to join your classmates out on that platform, will you strive to do your best from this day forward?<eos> Will you listen to this fine mother of yours and do what she expects of you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> All right, then, take your place.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Gilmore.<eos> I'm sure Mary will not disappoint you.
The lady in the next booth heard you saying that you went to Public School 6210 years ago.<eos> She says she went there, too.<eos> Now don't tell me I'm gonna meet another one.<eos> You tell her I'm Mary Keaton, the worst girl in school.<eos> She'll remember me.<eos> Sounds like old home week.<eos> Funny, meeting two people in one day you haven't seen for 10 years.<eos> Makes me feel like a kid again.<eos> - Hope I don't break out with the measles.<eos> She says she knows you.
I think you'll lend me the money now, won't you, Mr. Kirkwood?<eos> You wouldn't want me to sell that story to the newspapers, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> And you won't.<eos> In the first place, no newspaper, reputable or otherwise, would buy it, because if they printed it, I could take their shirt for libel.<eos> Let me give you a lesson in elementary law, Mr. Dunlap.<eos> The truth is no justification for a libelous article printed without cause.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, I'll call your bluff, Mr. Kirkwood.<eos> If you make one move against my wife or me, I warn you, I'll break every bone in your body and then throw you in jail.
- No, thanks. We'll be going now.<eos> Aren't you being a little rash, Mr. Parker?<eos> - Rash?<eos> - Come on, Donahue.<eos> You have a mile to go through my jungle.<eos> - Yes, I realize that.<eos> - We're not afraid.<eos> I can see, Captain Donahue, that you would be afraid of nothing.<eos> But Mr. Parker had one experience at night in my jungle.<eos> I have no wish to frighten you, Miss Thomas... but if Mr. Parker chooses to put you in what he knows to be real danger... it will be his responsibility.
First to destroy it, then re-create it.<eos> There you have his mad dream.<eos> - Can we go to him?<eos> - You will not be very welcome.<eos> What does that matter?<eos> I must see him.<eos> Dr Waldman, you have influence with Henry.<eos> Won't you come with us?<eos> I'm sorry, but Herr Frankenstein is no longer my pupil.<eos> But he respects you.
- I'm right here, sir.<eos> - Not you, him! Step up.<eos> You, too.<eos> Is this your niece?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This gentleman wishes to marry her.<eos> This gentleman is my friend.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Perfectly, sir.<eos> The director wants you.
You may, Poole.<eos> You may, my dear fellow.<eos> I'm going to be married, Poole.<eos> In a few weeks, she'll be under this very roof... in this very room, as my wife.<eos> Think of it.<eos> Think of it, Poole, and let me see your face.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> I beg to congratulate you, sir!<eos> - "If music be the food of love, play on." - Yes.<eos> I beg your pardon, sir... but Miss Pearson is waiting for you in the consulting room.
Oh, why am I so romantic with you?<eos> Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic?<eos> When you're near, why am I so romantic?<eos> What a grand feeling, when your lips touch mine.<eos> That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine.<eos> When we touch, close in your arms you hold me. I forget all that my mother told me.<eos> Other girls bore me, they just leave me blue.<eos> But why am I so romantic with you?<eos> Oh, Signor Ravelli!<eos> I've been looking for you all morning.
Very, very pretty.<eos> Tonight... You're not here in your official capacity.<eos> I'm afraid that last night I may have... Behaved somewhat unseemly.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Today you're much nicer.<eos> Pardon!<eos> Hey, Herr Professor... Send me a postcard when you are ready.<eos> You're a sight!<eos> Hold still.<eos> If your boys could see you now!
It's not good to get so worked up.<eos> Damn that bell!<eos> What's going on here?<eos> You going to order?<eos> The place is half empty!<eos> Stop complaining!<eos> Who brought the skipper in?<eos> Get going, wiggle your fannies.<eos> Come out with us, Herr Professor!<eos> A little music will put you right.
Stop complaining!<eos> Who brought the skipper in?<eos> Get going, wiggle your fannies.<eos> Come out with us, Herr Professor!<eos> A little music will put you right.<eos> You landed a few good punches... But I'm not the kind... Who bears a grudge.<eos> Herr Professor... I'm going to give you... A little shot... From my personal medicine cabinet.<eos> Down the hatch!<eos> Do you really think this will help?<eos> Sure, it'll set you back on your feet.
What you have done to me shall never be forgotten:<eos> But business is business:<eos> I had made up my mind never to enter this room again:<eos> But when I heard you were going to the opera, I said to myself:<eos> "Rudolph, here's your chance - one you can't afford to lose:"<eos> Madame, as a hairdresser: I have the greatest interest that you see this opera tonight:<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'll dress your hair as I've never dressed it before:<eos> You'll be so beautiful, you won't know yourself:<eos> And when you sit in the box with His Grace, Duke Otto von Liebenheim: All Monte Carlo will look at you:
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?<eos> Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> I don't think it's funny.<eos> I think it's serious. Very serious.<eos> - And I shall have to punish you.<eos> - Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> - I shall have to punish you very severely.<eos> - Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> Otherwise you'd start all over again. Yes!<eos> I shall think of a punishment that will cure you forever.
I'm her husband.<eos> I pinched them duds myself!"<eos> "Break in anywhere - take anything you want - - that's your idea, I suppose?"<eos> "No, sir, I rung the bell!<eos> But there wasn't no answer, so I helped myself."<eos> "I see - man of importance - no time to waste.<eos> Just what was your hurry?"<eos> "Well sir, I'm a stoker.<eos> I only had one night ashore, an' I wanted to have a good time."<eos> "Sixty days will slow you down.
"Oh, forget it," said Jack.<eos> "How about giving me a little attention?"<eos> A day or so later in the recorder's office, Big Jim tried to convince the assayers... that he had a mountain of gold.<eos> "Where is this place?" they said.<eos> But Big Jim's memory had failed him.<eos> All he knew was that it was near the cabin.<eos> "The cabin... that's it.<eos> If I could find my way to the cabin, I could find the mine.<eos> But I can't remember."<eos> "Hey," said Jack, "your lady friend Georgia's been looking for you."
I want to find him.<eos> Call up Andy and John.<eos> APB, the works. I also want an APB on Dan Keeton, Hugh Priest.<eos> - I'm sorry. What?<eos> - I found the money, Alan. - Hold it.<eos> What money?<eos> - The money that you and Dan Keeton have been embezzling from the town treasury.<eos> Wait. What are you talking about?<eos> I can put two and two together, Alan. I'm not stupid. I heard you covering up for him with that tax guy.<eos> I saw the two of you at his dealership.
Where you all from?<eos> Drove from Texarkana yesterday.<eos> - Long haul.<eos> - You said a mouthful there.<eos> No sense sleeping in the car when I got a foldout couch in there.<eos> Don't wanna put you out.<eos> Gotta get on the road.<eos> No trouble.<eos> I'll wake you at first light. Fill your belly with some food.<eos> Send you on your way.
Here, Papa.<eos> You shouldn't have gone up there.<eos> I don't like it, and nor does Papa.<eos> We can play cards if you like.<eos> She's asleep.<eos> One night she was found on the road to London.<eos> Grandpa said her feet were cut very badly.<eos> Ada.<eos> Alisdair, is it because of our play?<eos> Have the natives aggressed you?
Do you have any idea of what sort of a place the world is becoming?<eos> The days when you could act out of noble instincts are over.<eos> Europe has become the arena of Realpolitik, the politics of reality.<eos> If you like, real politics.<eos> What you need is not gentlemen politicians, but real ones.<eos> You need professionals, or you're headed for disaster.<eos> So I propose a toast, gentlemen to the professionals.<eos> Well, I've no wish to enter into a quarrel on our last evening together.<eos> But let me say this. What you describe as amateurism is what I think most of us here still prefer to call honour.<eos> Miss Kenton would like to see you concerning your father.
- Five hours.<eos> I doubt it could be done.<eos> If it could be done,... .. where would it be done?<eos> - It's quiet.<eos> - Hardly anyone's in yet.<eos> They were working late last night on a rush project.<eos> I'm sure Nakamoto appreciates the hard work.<eos> Yes.<eos> I heard it went real well for them.<eos> Mr. Donaldson is expecting you.
Dad!<eos> Dad! Mom!<eos> Dad!<eos> Mom!<eos> Mom!<eos> Dad!<eos> Mom!<eos> You!<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> All residents are requested here to assist you. Repeat.
O.K., let's go.<eos> I'm standing here with Fred Waitzkin.<eos> I hope I pronounced that right.<eos> Fred, what's it like being a chess parent?<eos> In my case, the hardest part is keeping track of my son's toy cars, making sure he eats something other than French fries...<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Your son's the odds-on favorite, I understand.<eos> He's rated number one in his division, yes.<eos> So every other parent in this room hates you.
What's that?<eos> Schleimann attack.<eos> Where'd you learn that from, a book?<eos> My teacher taught me.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Play like you used to-- from the gut.<eos> Get your pawns rolling on the queen's side.<eos> Put it out.<eos> Josh is playing.<eos> He taught you how not to lose, not how to win.
There are new clothes in the wardrobe.<eos> Who'll dress me?<eos> You can't dress yourself?<eos> Of course not.<eos> My ayah dressed me.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> As old as you are?<eos> What do they do with children in India? Carry you around in a basket?<eos> How dare you talk to me with such disrespect!<eos> Nobody's going to carry you around Misslethwaite Manor.
I was pleased to think I was.<eos> You don't know anything about anything!<eos> None of you know nothing!<eos> Please.<eos> Don't be vexed.<eos> I don't know anything about anything like you said.<eos> I'm sorry, miss.<eos> I'm too common and I talk too much.<eos> I beg your pardon, miss.<eos> I don't know when exactly your uncle will call for you.
Its owner was a man named Giaco.<eos> The brigand Giaco.<eos> A real man, full of initiative. Even had his own small army.<eos> One day Giaco returned,.. with no longer any soldier, dead tired, covered with wounds.<eos> Then he thought:<eos> "Sooner or later they'll pursue me, and I'll have nowhere to take refuge.<eos> I'd better plant a woods. The most suitable place to take shelter."<eos> Said and done, he planted this forest.<eos> Since then, it's been so many years that it would be useless to count them.<eos> But who told you, Colonel,.. that the brigand Giaco can not return?
Here is the Faust!<eos> Only, the sound is no longer as limpid as before.<eos> You too hear it,.. this.. faraway hum?<eos> It's true.<eos> It almost seems like the wail of the woods.. when there is wind.<eos> - Woods?<eos> Why do you say woods?<eos> I said it... so to speak.<eos> The first thing that came to my mind.<eos> Excuse me for having inconvenienced you at this hour.
The Golden Valley runs along the river Dore.<eos> Here, let me show you on the map.<eos> It runs from here to here.<eos> Why "golden"?<eos> It's a mistake, really.<eos> The Welsh for "water" is "dwr" which sounds like "d'or,"<eos> the French for "golden." It isn't golden at all.<eos> It's wet. Where can one get a view of the valley?<eos> I should go along here, down to the junction here, and turn left up this little road.<eos> That'll take you up into the hills.
You'll fight in it, maybe even die in it<eos> But you won't see it.<eos> There's a lot of smoke in a battle.<eos> Our cannon, their cannon.<eos> Our shot their shell<eos> Our volleys, their volleys.<eos> You don't see a battle.<eos> You hear it.<eos> Black powder blasting by the ton on all sides.<eos> Back smoke binding you and choking you and making you vomit and the French come out of the smoke
Don't know, sir.<eos> What about your family?<eos> Don't know, sir.<eos> Previous employment?<eos> Army, sir.<eos> Just army.<eos> Why are you here, Harper?<eos> You boneheaded Paddy!<eos> So... The Chosen Men, eh?<eos> Well... I didn't choose you.
- I'll be back.<eos> - You're a good man!<eos> - We're behind you!<eos> - Take care!<eos> I always did have a hankering to go see Nashville.<eos> Proud to have you with me.<eos> I wish I knew why you was arresting this man!<eos> Stand clear!<eos> Federal marshals.<eos> God bless you, now.
Which is why you can lie about me.<eos> You are the liar!<eos> The real reason you are here is to stop me from selling land to a colored man who'd then be a landowner on a level with yourself.<eos> You may go to hell!<eos> You will watch your tongue in my court.<eos> And you will watch your tongue in my presence!<eos> You sit up there in judgment of nobody!<eos> In two years, when the Yankees are gone you will be back in the field where you belong!<eos> Quite possibly, Mr. Folsom.<eos> But in the meantime, you are in contempt of my court and I sentence you to 30 days in county jail.
Why are you here?<eos> Mr. Takahashi says you can take me to Okinawa.<eos> Fuck, they look green.<eos> This is no kindergarten picnic!<eos> You fuck off!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I told you to quit that stuff.<eos> Welcome to Okinawa, gentlemen.<eos> Now we take you to your office.<eos> Have some rest, and the boss will take you out to dinner.
It is quite simply the journey you have always been destined to take.<eos> What?<eos> I was just thinking how much you look like your mom.<eos> Kira to Sisko.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - Sorry to disturb you, Commander.<eos> There's something on the Promenade you might want to see.<eos> On my way.<eos> Step up, step up!<eos> Fortune's fates are with you today, friends.
You can count Gul Dukat among them.<eos> This is Federation Ship Yangtze Kiang.<eos> Major Kira Nerys in command.<eos> Yes, Major?<eos> We know you're headed for the wormhole.<eos> Wormhole? What wormhole is that?<eos> I strongly suggest you do not proceed.<eos> We encountered a hostile life-form inside.<eos> Perhaps they will be less hostile to Cardassians than to humans.<eos> These people are trying to save you from a lot of trouble.
-Garden?<eos> -Sure.<eos> That way, please.<eos> Do you think we'll find Novacek?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> We spooked Foster. Word gets to Novacek. Novacek gets worried.<eos> She doesn't know what move to make. She's fretful.<eos> She's nervous. You're describing a baby with colic.<eos> All right.<eos> What can I get for you folks?
Come back, you wicked wench!<eos> Come back!<eos> Come back, you foul slut!<eos> God shield!<eos> My crossbow!<eos> Come back!<eos> There's no bear.<eos> steer clear, beloved! steer clear!<eos> I saw a huge beast.<eos> I'll spend my life in a convent, faithful to you.
What?<eos> What if it was Pumpkinhead?<eos> What if we brought him back to life and he's out there killing people?<eos> What if he is?<eos> What if he comes after us?<eos> Jesus, you guys are pathetic.<eos> How do you know we didn't do something out there?<eos> That was some pretty bad shit we were messing with, Danny.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Danny will take you out there - and show you that no monster crawled out of that box.
Just five minutes.<eos> Quilly, will you be an angel?<eos> He's amazing, isn't he?<eos> They do still like to see me.<eos> I know that.<eos> Would you like to have some nosh?<eos> Why not?<eos> It's free.<eos> Come on, Stamper. I'm listening.<eos> After your divorce, the family made a financial settlement on you.
With a telescopic lens.<eos> Like to get a picture of his face when his pudgy little legs hit that farmhouse down there.<eos> Aah, aah, kids....<eos> Stewardess, since we got a breeze in here, can we smoke now?<eos> Fairly well circulated at this point.<eos> True story.<eos> But, you know...<eos> Why is marijuana against the law?<eos> It grows naturally upon our planet.<eos> Doesn't the idea of making nature against the law seem to you a bit paranoid?
- We lost the original sample in the fire.<eos> I want you to understand what it is you're saying.<eos> - You said it yourself.<eos> - You have to write it in your report.<eos> You're right.<eos> We'll take another sample from the forest and run a comparison before we do anything.<eos> The detective's here.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You wouldn't listen to me.<eos> I told you to stay out of this.
Since you're in similar circumstances we can help each other.<eos> This should make you feel better.<eos> Major... I'm so sorry.<eos> I would have done anything.<eos> It's all so senseless.<eos> Opaka's been a symbol of hope to me.<eos> Her words gave our struggle meaning.<eos> And now she's dead.<eos> Her life ends on some unknown moon... and for what?<eos> Dr Bashir will help you, but understand, we can't take sides.
I'm afraid so.<eos> The Kai?<eos> Rio Grande to Sisko. This is O'Brien.<eos> - Go ahead, Chief.<eos> - ls everyone all right?<eos> We're alive, but the Yangtzee Kiang was destroyed.<eos> - Can you beam us up? - Not yet.<eos> We've got to penetrate these satellites.<eos> It's impossible to lock on to anything.<eos> Those satellites will come after you if you get too close.
- Rio Grande to Sisko. - Go ahead, Chief.<eos> We're going to poke a hole up here if you're ready to go.<eos> Only three of us are coming back.<eos> Kai Opaka is remaining.<eos> Benjamin, did you say we're not transporting the Kai?<eos> That's correct. I'll explain later.<eos> We need a few minutes.<eos> Rio Grande out.<eos> Leaving without us?<eos> My analysis of these microbes that keep you alive showed that if you left you'd die.
- Wadi do love games.<eos> - Think of it.<eos> We've been given directions, clues, obstacles to overcome...<eos> Pawns.<eos> Excuse me...<eos> Excuse me...<eos> This has gone far enough.<eos> Will somebody tell me what is going on around here?<eos> Why are you doing this to us?<eos> What is wrong with you people?
You'll have to face them sooner or later.<eos> That was very funny what you did.<eos> You see, Jake?<eos> There's a man with a sense of humor.<eos> - Nobody's laughing.<eos> - Luckily nobody got hurt.<eos> My friend's sorry for what he did.<eos> - Aren't you?<eos> - l suppose.<eos> - What did I tell you?
Believe me, you won't.<eos> Shall we?<eos> This is an... historic moment.<eos> Nagus...<eos> There must be some mistake.<eos> There's no ship docked here.<eos> Wait!<eos> Rom, you idiot!<eos> Krax, what are you standing there for?<eos> What's the matter with you two?
Alright.<eos> Lower the force field.<eos> What is your designation?<eos> I do not have a designation.<eos> My name is Crosis.<eos> Crosis?<eos> How did you get that name?<eos> - It was given to me by The One.<eos> - Who is that?<eos> The one who will destroy you.
We traced the shuttle to this point but there's too much interference to scan.<eos> - Are they jamming our sensors?<eos> - More likely a natural phenomenon.<eos> There's a lot of EM interference in the planet's magnetosphere.<eos> Can we transport through it?<eos> We could, but there could be 50 Borg down there and we'd never know it.<eos> We have to risk it.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Take a well-armed away team and transport down.<eos> Have the transporter chief keep a lock on you so we can get you out quickly.
They will not pay us until they get both pieces.<eos> They've been waiting too long to take any risks.<eos> Take one artefact and beam down.<eos> That is all I was waiting for.<eos> Go to the navigational computer and check file 137/Omega.<eos> There's a message secretly transmitted to the Enterprise containing our flight plan.<eos> She's right.<eos> The message was sent by Galen.<eos> He's a Starfleet officer.<eos> Tallera is right. But what she's not telling you is that those artefacts she's holding are part of an incredibly powerful weapon.
It's all right. lt's all over.<eos> It all stops right here, right now.<eos> OK, I got it.<eos> At the intersection of Yukon and 17th.<eos> State patrol is on the scene.<eos> Code 3. Over.<eos> She'll be put in quarantine along with the dog.<eos> We'll keep her there until we're sure she won't infect the population.<eos> Meanwhile, our tests came back normal, so we've been released.<eos> Plane ready. lt'll take you as far from the ice as you wanna go.
The windup and the pitch on the way. Strike three called! The Mets win it.<eos> Harris doesn't like it, but it's all over.<eos> The Mets have won the championship, and the Mets are the first team ever to come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a playoff or a World Series.<eos> The Mets are on the field. Jeff Torborg in the middle, a very happy man.<eos> What a job he's done for the team.<eos> - Dwight Gooden gets the victory with an aid and assist from David Cone in the eighth and ninth innings.<eos> Well, you can't believe it. The Mets are going on to the World Series.<eos> The Mets make history.<eos> Not only have they won the National League Championship Series with this 8-1 victory over Los Angeles, they've become the first team to come back from the brink of elimination, down three games to none, and win the series by taking four straight games.<eos> You raped a holy thing. You destroyed that young girl, and she forgives you.
There was this agonizing feeling.<eos> - I started shaking.<eos> - It's all right, you're dreaming.<eos> It pulled me and lured me.<eos> I had no control.<eos> Those red eyes.<eos> I still have the taste of his blood in my mouth.<eos> Master, I'm here to do your bidding.<eos> Master, I am here.<eos> I have worshipped you.
We must go.<eos> He needs me!<eos> We are passed Bistrita.<eos> Dracula outsmarted us again.<eos> His gypsies met him at Galatz and are now on the Borgo Pass.<eos> - You must eat.<eos> - I am not hungry.<eos> Mina!<eos> You have been so good to me, Professor.<eos> I know that Lucy had secret desires for you.
She's still a beauty.<eos> That's when I met her.<eos> This is Jenny's bed.<eos> I'll show you something.<eos> You can tan while you make love.<eos> When you're through, you've got a brown ass!<eos> Ever see anything like it? Bet not!<eos> What nonsense!<eos> Baloney, baloney...<eos> Jenny used to live... I told you she moved.
You wouldn't happen to be gay?<eos> No kidding, Remy?<eos> Because I don't mind if you are...<eos> Close the door, Remy.<eos> She'll calm down soon enough.<eos> Honey!<eos> Catherine, get the door!<eos> Who was it, darling?<eos> Andre, Remy!<eos> Does this remind you of anything?
- I'll look into the matter.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> Listen.<eos> Leave the boards here and I'll inquire.<eos> We will clear up the situation.<eos> It's not complicated at all.<eos> We can talk things out. So you come back tomorrow.<eos> Fine. We'll leave the boards but you pay us a $20,000 deposit.<eos> You think I'll rip you off?<eos> You are lucky I'm not asking you to pay.
My lord's almost so far transported...<eos> "Let't alone...<eos> "Still methinks there is an air comes from her.<eos> "What fine chisel could ever yet cut breath?<eos> "Let no man mock me, for I will kiss her.<eos> "... My Lord, forbear.<eos> The ruddiness upon her lip is wet; you'll mar it if you kiss it, "Stain your own with oily painting...<eos> Either forbear, quit presently the chapel,<eos> Or resolve you for more amazement.<eos> "If you can behold it, I'll make the statue move... Descend, and take you by the hand...
I was born to solve this kind of affronts, and I won't let you take a step more, scoundrels.<eos> Those rogues will know my Tizona.<eos> You rascals!<eos> Don't you see they are only some penitents?<eos> Stop, whoever you are. Don Quixote orders this.<eos> - Stop, furious people!<eos> - Nobody can stop him.<eos> I know you are responsible of this.<eos> Don't go away, scoundrels.<eos> Answer for you acts or my sword will go through you.
I don't keep accommodation for strangers.<eos> Or I'll sleep in the chair.<eos> There's a room they don't use.<eos> Don't leave it by the window.<eos> Why not?<eos> "Catherine Heathcliff."<eos> "Catherine Linton."<eos> "Catherine Earnshaw."<eos> Let me in.<eos> Who the devil put you in there?
Heathcliff!<eos> Morning, Cathy.<eos> Morning.<eos> "Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, 'Hear ye the words of the great king. '"<eos> "Hearken not to Hezekiah, for thus bade the king of Assyria make an agreement with me by a present."<eos> "And come out to me and eat thee every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye everyone the waters of his own cistern... until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,<eos> a land of corn and wine,"<eos> Hindley, don't... "a land of bread and vineyards."<eos> Stop it...<eos> "Beware, lest Hezekiah persuade you."
Sit down.<eos> I have no male heir, Catherine.<eos> I'm certain that Heathcliff seeks by some means to dispossess you of your inheritance... and in that way, to revenge himself on me.<eos> He's a diabolical man, Catherine.<eos> He will stop at nothing to bring down those he hates.<eos> She might have been living yet... had it not been for him.<eos> Dearest Catherine... why have you not come back to me?<eos> Every day... I wait for you.<eos> My one waking thought has been of you.<eos> Perhaps Uncle Edgar has forbidden you to visit Wuthering Heights.
It's been a long fight.<eos> I wish it were over.<eos> Cathy?<eos> Mr. Heathcliff?<eos> You'll have to wait.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I - I'm Lockwood.<eos> Your new tenant up at the Grange.<eos> I'm surprised you'd choose a storm to go wandering about in, Mr. Lockwood.<eos> Who the devil put you in there?
Yes, sir.<eos> -Did he?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> -Why didn't you mention this before? -You didn't ask us, sir.<eos> Corporal, I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail.<eos> Yes, sir. I know you do, sir. -Fuck you, Harold!<eos> -All right. -At ease.<eos> Let's sort this thing out. -Shit.<eos> There was a platoon meeting on September 6th at 4 p.m.<eos> Lieutenant Kendrick says he told you nothing was to happen to Santiago.
They're our closest friends!<eos> There is no one traumatic event.<eos> People grow apart.<eos> It's a lot of little personal things.<eos> Now stop it.<eos> I don't wanna hear this bullshit.<eos> - Why is she so upset?<eos> - Judy...<eos> She cares about us.<eos> Well, I care about you too.
Three points, Mr. Asselin.<eos> One:<eos> Le Guen won't talk.<eos> Not a word since his arrest. Not even to my chief of staff, his classmate.<eos> Two: if I hand him over, perhaps he'll talk.<eos> I prefer not: I know your methods.<eos> Three:<eos> Le Guen is a sailor.<eos> He will be tried by sailors.<eos> What is of interest will be communicated to you.
- Understood?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> This is Hanley.<eos> Code:<eos> Foxtrot-Tango-Whiskey-Delta-Tango.<eos> We have a confirmed Angel.<eos> Repeat, confirmed Angel touchdown.<eos> Midwest sector.<eos> Procedure Zebra-Echo-Zebra now in effect.<eos> Warm you up?
Beach or Leach or something, asking a while back about the same sort of thing.<eos> It was all very similar to your case.<eos> Missing time...<eos> - UFOs?<eos> - Yeah, I think it did involve UFOs.<eos> Perfect.<eos> That's all we need.<eos> I think you should speak with him.<eos> I'll see if I can come up with his name.<eos> If I do, I'll put him in touch with you.
Explain to the Major he has little to fear from this General Marquis de Montcalm in the first place and therefore scant need of a colonial militia in the second because the French haven't the nature for war.<eos> They'd rather eat and make love with their faces than fight.<eos> Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters?<eos> I was to rendezvous with them in Albany, and escort them to the fort, sir.<eos> You there.<eos> What does Munro call you?<eos> The Scotsman has sent you one of his Mohawk allies to guide you.<eos> Magua.<eos> The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house.<eos> A company of the 60th will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Eighteen killed.<eos> These men came to our aid. They guided us here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Can we help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores?<eos> And some food?<eos> I'm indebted to you.<eos> Miss Cora, how are you?<eos> Hello, Mr. Phelps.<eos> Mrs. McCann will get some dry clothes for you.
Go on.<eos> Burn yourself.<eos> Pain yourself.<eos> Put all that poison in your hair, in your body, trying to be white!<eos> [CHUCKLING]<eos> -I don't want to hear this shit.<eos> -I thought you were smart.<eos> But you just another cat strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you!<eos> Looking like a monkey!<eos> The white man sees you and laughs because he knows you ain't white.
You're dead.<eos> You're dead, spiritually.<eos> You're dead to the knowledge of yourself and your people and to the knowledge of your God.<eos> Why, my brothers and sisters, he should get down on his knees.<eos> He should beg our mercy.<eos> Oh, my brothers and sisters his kind has committed God's greatest crime against your and my kind every day of his life!<eos> He should get on his knees and say he's committed a crime.<eos> But does he do that?<eos> Does he do that?<eos> No. No, he scorns you.
Because no one as young as you should be so serious.<eos> But I don't think that anymore.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I want to have a lot of babies with you.<eos> Dear heart.<eos> [KNOCKING ON DOOR]<eos> I love you.<eos> We're waiting on you folks.<eos> Trying to starve us?<eos> Brother Malcolm, Sister Betty we pray that Allah blesses you with a happy and fruitful marriage.
Malcolm had become an Afro-American.<eos> And he wanted so desperately that we, that all his people would become Afro-Americans too.<eos> There are those who still consider it their duty as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him.<eos> To flee, even from the presence of his memory.<eos> To save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times.<eos> And we will smile.<eos> They will say that he is of hate, a fanatic a racist, who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle.<eos> And we will answer and say unto them:<eos> "Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm?<eos> Did you ever touch him or have him smile at you?
Help! Somebody help!<eos> Jenny.<eos> We were all going to the beach today to have a... a Valentine's Day picnic.<eos> Jenny took Amy to the park while I packed up the Jeep.<eos> I guess that was at about eight.<eos> They were supposed to be back at ten.<eos> My wife is never late.<eos> I was immediately concerned.<eos> So I went to the park to search for them at about ten thirty but they weren't there.<eos> So I called up you fellas and came right over here.
There was a suicide note but they never recovered the body.<eos> Great.<eos> Carter says they're with his father.<eos> His father's been dead for 18 years.<eos> This gets better all the time.<eos> Let's hope Waldheim can get something out of this psycho.<eos> When I got myself out of the car, I could only think of one thing.<eos> If he was crazy enough to kill me what was he going to do to Amy?<eos> So then I went home... but she wasn't there.<eos> That's when I called you.
Okay.<eos> May I ask why you're closing your account with us today, sir?<eos> Well, I just had this weird feeling that my money wasn't safe here anymore.<eos> Gentlemen, your communication lines are vulnerable.<eos> Fire exits need to be monitored.<eos> Your rent-a-cops are a tad under trained.<eos> Outside of that, everything seems to be just fine.<eos> You'll be getting our full report and analysis in a few days.<eos> But first, who's got my check?<eos> So, people hire you to break into their places to make sure no one can break into their places?
Whistler, you've got to do it.<eos> Do what?<eos> You gotta drive.<eos> I'll talk you through it.<eos> Now, hurry.<eos> Drive what?<eos> Okay, Bish.<eos> There's a gate about 30 yards behind you.<eos> Put it in reverse and floor it.<eos> Did I ever tell you why I had to leave the CIA?
- Good evening.<eos> Good evening.<eos> See you, Brice.<eos> So long.<eos> Maxime's busy, so...<eos> Of course.<eos> You were there for...<eos> Two minutes.<eos> You should have spoken.<eos> I didn't want to disturb you.
OK, time's up for this week.<eos> Until then, good night!<eos> - Party on, Wayne.<eos> - Party on, Garth.<eos> And...we're clear!<eos> - All right!<eos> - Excellent!<eos> - All right!<eos> Excellent! - Excellent!<eos> Let me bring you up to speed.
And it is possible, my king.<eos> To found a family before dying.<eos> But I don't want to be a king anymore. I want to have family and children.<eos> Somethings happened to me. I have to find myself, like I found you.<eos> I can't stay in one place.<eos> I am a wanderer.<eos> If I change, will you still love me?<eos> Can you feel me?<eos> I can!<eos> I greet you all on behalf of those ex-patriots the Totality forced across the ocean.
It wans't so bad during Communism, was il?<eos> You had meat every day, a job, you could drink at work<eos> without getting fired. Now I can't afford n.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Czech girl, pay the tab and I'll do it to you like you've never had it in the Czech lands.<eos> Thanks, but I've already had one Secret police agent.<eos> Convenient for you, throwing everyone in the same barrel.<eos> Even me, Slovak.<eos> I IOId you to knock il Off, but you won't stop till somebody samcks you.<eos> Go on, run away, the nation will remember you.
I can't accept.<eos> But I... I, am England.<eos> And you are mine.<eos> I see. On what grounds?<eos> That I adore you.<eos> And this means that I belong to you?<eos> Are you refusing me?<eos> - I am, I'm sorry.<eos> But Orlando.<eos> With your history quite frankly who else will have you?
Don't worry.<eos> Samba asked me to marry him.<eos> - I hope you didn't refuse?<eos> - I didn't reply.<eos> Don't be silly, or you'll end up an old maid.<eos> Don't exaggerate.<eos> This mariage will be a memorable event.<eos> There're my words.<eos> Hurry they are waiting for us.<eos> I pronounce you man and wife. May God bless you with many children.
"We're here...<eos> Somebody's been fucking!<eos> You follow your family tree back and every branch fucking."<eos> Sure, what caused the way back then?<eos> Well, maybe the wagon trail ride out west;<eos> I don't know what she has under that gingham skirt, but when we stop for water baby, we're fucking, ha!<eos> I gotta woody on the trail, I gotta woody on the trail."<eos> You see, they're getting cart the before the horse on this pornography issue;<eos> Playboy does not create sexual thoughts. There ARE sexual thoughts and THEREFORE there is playboy, don't you see?<eos> I know these sound like philosophical musings to you, what came first, the hard on, OR the Madonna video?
He's yelling something about the cross, I didn't catch it..."<eos> Jesus!<eos> You know, I don't know what you all believe and I don't really care, but you have to admit, beliefs are odd.<eos> A lot of Christians wear crosses around their necks.<eos> D' you think when Jesus comes back, he ever wants to see a fucking cross?<eos> It's kind of like going up to Jackie Onasis with a little sniper riffle pinned in, you know:<eos> "How are you Jackie, we're just thinking of John.<eos> Yea, he was great."<eos> OK, it's time for some ah, time for a question.<eos> This question I'm going to ask you is very crude...;
Pietro, the Professor!<eos> I'm not a professor.<eos> Sure!<eos> Giovanni told us everything.<eos> Come on over.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Some wine for a toast.<eos> Giovanni's so pleased, what a great satifaction!<eos> Professor.<eos> But really... ls it true the professors thanked you and even applauded?
Our life will be a bed of roses because Allah protects those who love,<eos> and I do love you, my twenty future wives.<eos> I love you, I love you,<eos> women of my harem:<eos> Zoraide, Scheherazade, Zobeida, Farah, Zimrut,<eos> Rose, Zulma, Delilah, Zaida, Jasmine, Fatima,<eos> Mora, Farisad, Marien, Amina, Zuleica,<eos> Axa, Dunia, Zoe and María Angélica!<eos> We shall live passionately, our life shall be an Eden,<eos> iii be eternally faithful, lll never cheat on you, with another harem.
- Let them go or you will all die!<eos> - Your threats are meaningless.<eos> We are still in control of these three bodies.<eos> Will you sacrifice the others?<eos> They will die when the hatch is blown.<eos> - You will die too, Picard.<eos> - I would die to save my child.<eos> To die defending one's ship is the hope of every Klingon.<eos> If you each know the officers you inhabit, then you know they would give their lives for this ship.<eos> Free them now and I will return you to the moon's surface.
Josh didn't let us down, sir.<eos> It wasn't his fault.<eos> Mr Locarno you are the leader of Nova Squadron.<eos> Do you have anything to say?<eos> Mr Locarno?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Mr Locarno has been expelled.<eos> - They should've expelled all of us.<eos> - They very nearly did.<eos> Mr Locarno made an impassioned plea for the rest of you. He said he'd used his influence to convince you to attempt the manoeuvre and to cover up the truth.
I cannot ignore the requests of people, humans, who ask for transport away from here.<eos> But thousands will suffer if you agree to take them.<eos> As suffering grows, more will demand to leave.<eos> We are witnessing the end of this existence.<eos> I implore you, Captain, do not let this happen.<eos> You would have me make the decision for you, but I can't.<eos> I am willing to talk to these people with you.<eos> I will urge them not to be impulsive but if finally they choose to leave the Enterprise will not turn them away.<eos> Capt Picard will grant transport to any individuals who wish to leave.<eos> I am asking you to stay.
No.<eos> How did he put it?<eos> "As I experience sensory input patterns, my mental pathways become used to them."<eos> "The inputs are anticipated and even missed when absent."<eos> - So what's the point?<eos> - He's used to us, and we to him.<eos> It's like finding out a loved one has a terminal illness...<eos> - Data!<eos> - Counsellor. Commander.<eos> Would either of you mind if I made a personal inquiry?
Stop!<eos> - You're hurting me!<eos> - Who is it?<eos> Who is doing this to you?<eos> It's Tarmin.<eos> It's your father.<eos> Captain's log, stardate 45433.2.<eos> We have set a course for Starbase 440, where the Ullians will disembark and return home.<eos> Inad and I have contacted our home planet.<eos> If you want to prosecute my father, the authorities will support you.
CITY LIFE GOT YOU DOWN, KIDDIES?
And all of a sudden I noticed a tiniest scratch on the finish.<eos> I said, oh, my cat did that two years ago.<eos> That lamp used to be in my collection.<eos> Could you imagine.<eos> Do you like cats?<eos> Do I like cats?<eos> Sometimes I trust cats more than I do people.<eos> Somebody call for a toe truck?<eos> I knew it was too good to last.<eos> Well, ladies thank you very much for your hospitality.
It's like the man in tonight's tale.<eos> He's a head shrinker who's about to undergo a little final analysis of his own in a paranoid parable<eos> I call the new arrival.<eos> Don't forget tomorrow our subject issex with the supernatural.<eos> Is it possible?<eos> Is it cheating?<eos> Have you had it?<eos> And most important, honey, did the spiritmoveya?<eos> Call in tomorrow and tell us right here on talk radio 99.<eos> Until then, lothar loves you.
Hello.<eos> I've come to see Miss Midori.<eos> Midori, a visitor for you.<eos> Here's my card.<eos> Kamata Studios!<eos> The filmmaker?<eos> I want you in my new film.<eos> I'm looking for a girl for the starring role.<eos> An actress!<eos> I realised when I saw you on stage, that you are just what I need.
You pass me my downer?<eos> A downer!<eos> Can't find a snug fit?<eos> Quick, need my downer.<eos> Too much drink.<eos> Doesn't mix. Yes... quick... don't wanna be left alone.<eos> No!<eos> Go on!<eos> BEAT IT!<eos> Somebody loves you.
This one goes down in the record book.<eos> A sword fight to the death, thermonuclear destruction, time travel to a land that doesn't have gas stations.<eos> I mean, how much fun can a girl take?<eos> I know.<eos> I'm going to miss him, too.<eos> He was really something special.<eos> Good day, brother.<eos> It seems you've travelled a long distance.<eos> You'll never know.<eos> What brings you to this forsaken desert?
I believe you have a visitor, doctor.<eos> Doc, my foot feels so good, I brought you this pig.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can't abide being in no man's debt.<eos> This pig's all I got to give.<eos> I'm already paid, more or less, by the hospital.<eos> - I really can't accept your pig.<eos> - It's a done deal.<eos> She's your pig now.<eos> God bless you both.
But him, he's the type that could end up killing every man in this outfit.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Why are you mad at me?<eos> He's the one who ate your father.<eos> Like father, like son.<eos> You've already been tossed out once.<eos> Hold it, hold it.<eos> We can't fight among ourselves.<eos> We're all on the same team here.<eos> I want the two of you to shake hands.
Call 1 -800-l'm-Gonna-Fuckin' -Die!<eos> Toll booth!<eos> Exact change!<eos> - Make a road kill.<eos> - Up yours, Cesar!<eos> Cesar!<eos> Antony!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> MY NAM E IS KIT KAT<eos> - What's the matter with you?
It was I who baptized him. And gave him to you when he was an outlaw viking in England,<eos> and outlawed in Norway<eos> If he gives you Norway. Speak to me as well.<eos> Odin!<eos> Come!<eos> Odin!<eos> Come!<eos> In the beginning the Aesir created the world... and hit the flame of life.<eos> Then the hammer made man and woman so that the people could grow.<eos> Stronger then the veins of a bear is the blood bond that binds you.
The American public has yet to see the real X-rays and autopsy photographs.<eos> Why?<eos> Hundreds of documents could help prove this conspiracy.<eos> Why are they being withheld or burned by the government?<eos> When my office or you, the people, asked those questions, demanded evidence the answer from on high has always been: national security.<eos> What kind of national security do we have when we're robbed of our leaders?<eos> What national security permits the removal of fundamental power from the people and validates the ascendancy of an invisible government in the US?<eos> That kind of national security is when it smells like it, feels like it, and looks like it you call it what it is:<eos> Fascism!<eos> I submit to you that what took place on November 22, 1963 was a coup d'etat.
His job is to speak as often as possible of the nation's desire for peace while he acts as a business agent in the Congress for the military and their contractors.<eos> Some people say I'm crazy.<eos> Southern caricature seeking higher office.<eos> There's a simple way to determine if I am paranoid.<eos> Ask the two men who profited most from the assassination former President Johnson and your new President, Nixon to release the 51 CIA documents pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby.<eos> Or the secret CIA memo on Oswald's activities in Russia that was destroyed while being photocopied.<eos> These documents are yours.<eos> The people's property.<eos> You pay for it.<eos> But as the government sees you as children who might be too disturbed to face this reality or because you might lynch those involved you cannot see these documents for another 75 years.
It's him<eos> - He's incredible!<eos> - Yes<eos> Good job, Wong Chun<eos> He can't breathe anymore<eos> Boss, this chick saw us<eos> I brought her back with us<eos> When you're through with her, it's our turn<eos> Be careful!<eos> If an old lady sees you Am I to have fun with her too?
- The light's good here, don't worry.<eos> - Yeah, I think it's good if you lie down.<eos> - That's Al Pacino.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - That's Mandy Patinkin.<eos> - Hello. Hi. Nice to meet you.<eos> Los Angeles was hard.<eos> I always find it weird that celebrities assume a friendship with you just because you're a celebrity, too.<eos> It can get kind of awkward.<eos> Warren thanks you all for coming.
Whoo!<eos> Well...<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Long time ago.<eos> Well, tell me something.<eos> How did you boys get so far?<eos> To Idaho?<eos> I only left you in Portland a couple of days ago, right?<eos> We rode on our trusty motorcycle.<eos> And what brings you to this exciting Family Tree Inn?
I made that myself.<eos> Has English hospitality changed so in six years... that a friend of mine's not welcome?<eos> But he's a savage, sire!<eos> That he is.<eos> But no more than you or I.<eos> And don't call me "sire."<eos> With regret, I must decline.<eos> Allah forbids it.<eos> Your loss!<eos> Why are so many of you in hiding?
-Do something for me. -What?<eos> Take a bath.<eos> A bath?<eos> These are my private chambers, my son.<eos> I have priests who would hear your confession.<eos> I see the boy I knew in the man before me.<eos> Welcome home, Robin.<eos> You shine like the sun, milady.<eos> You've been meeting with Robin.<eos> My cousin tells me the knave deprived you of some horses.
A child?<eos> How?<eos> Ally with royal blood.<eos> Who?<eos> It's a personal matter, my lord.<eos> But of vital importance.<eos> I understand, milady.<eos> This is my most trusted emissary.<eos> He must travel to France immediately and give this personally to the King.<eos> My lady-in-waiting will accompany you.
-Fight your way free.<eos> -Look out!<eos> This way!<eos> To the wall!<eos> Lord Sheriff... is this your idea of control?<eos> Shut up, you twit!<eos> English!<eos> Behold Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir!<eos> I am not one of you... but I fight!<eos> I fight with Robin Hood... against a tyrant... who holds you under his boot!
Her boss walks in he sees her cord pulls it and she falls off her chair<eos> Just as the microphone is adjusted perfectly<eos> Her boss walks in he sees her cord pulls it and she falls off her chair<eos> I'm going to the USA to see them shoot talkies<eos> They started with that not long ago So they often make slips<eos> Thank you, Mr Skiner<eos> Let's all thank Mr Skiner for installing this microphone for us<eos> Next time I can talk on the screen<eos> I can speak Mandarin<eos> Miss Ruan thanks you on our behalf for establishing the sound synchronizing department
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.<eos> Do you read?<eos> It's very hard to make out.<eos> There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.<eos> - She's still listing.<eos> - She's spinning out of control.<eos> Restoring auxiliary gravity...<eos> Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?<eos> We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.<eos> For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
I'm sorry?<eos> He's definitely on about something, Jim.<eos> If this is your spot, we'll move on.<eos> He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.<eos> - He's got it.<eos> - And your coat.<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> It wouldn't fit.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - This will help keep you warm.
Great!<eos> Are you girle ready to get serious?<eos> I think so.<eos> Follow ue.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Freeno.<eos> We've eeen you all over.<eos> Take off thoee ehades.<eos> I want to eee your eyes.<eos> Yeah, I been seeing you, too.
- What motorbike, by phone..<eos> - No, I mean, just to understand.<eos> - Was she there too?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You don't know anything, what the use of calling.<eos> Give the money to the blind man singing, because here somebody his suffering.<eos> If it's Cecilia asking about me, tell her you haven't heard and seen me at all.<eos> Hallo...good morning...<eos> no..no..yes..no..yes<eos> I talked to my sister, she does not know you she never met you.
So we started doing behaviour modification experiments using young subjects, 18, 19.<eos> 13 of the original subjects died in training.<eos> Seven became exceptional operatives.<eos> Six are still active.<eos> And the seventh?<eos> Eddy Kay-<eos> Probably the best subject, I'm certain. Highest scores ever.<eos> Technology, languages, hand-to-hand, everything.<eos> So?<eos> He quit on you?
"The Battle Of The Beatles" - they're taking on all the groups in the world and your favorites will be represented by vote.<eos> And tomorrow night at 7:00 The Beatles read their own poetry on a documentary, "Meet The Beatles", done all over the world.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't understand this.<eos> Tomorrow night, here at WINS.<eos> Don't miss it.<eos> We ain't written no poetry.<eos> Looking for a cigarette that satisfies?<eos> One that will give you the pleasure you want in smoking.<eos> There is a cigarette that gives you what you're looking for.
With me?<eos> Nothing. It is my hand.<eos> - He is in the Guards?<eos> - Since this morning.<eos> Baron Christian de Neuvillette.<eos> In your own regiment.<eos> Promise me...<eos> - Promise me... to be his friend?<eos> - I promise.<eos> I love you!
Both proud, stubborn, more alike than either is prepared to admit.<eos> A lifetime spent building emotional barriers. They're very difficult to break down.<eos> And now the time has come when it's too late.<eos> It's a difficult moment.<eos> It's a lonely one.<eos> It's a moment that Spock is about to face.<eos> Don't you two look sweet?<eos> Be careful, Android.<eos> Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you. Lick that paint right off your ears.<eos> Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are?
- Victimised?<eos> Exactly, sir.<eos> We were lucky to escape.<eos> I saw the whole thing.<eos> Yes, and I'm sure you'd let me know if these gentlemen were at fault.<eos> - That's affirmative, sir.<eos> - That'll be all, Mr Cole.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, I'll cover your asses, both of you.
- That's Me.<eos> - I Heard You Were Shot Dead In Bangkok.<eos> - Well, I Was In Bangkok. I Was There.<eos> But I Didn't Get Shot, If That's All Right With You.<eos> Hell, Yeah!<eos> - Coach, We're Ready!<eos> - Be Right Back.<eos> Show Him You Can Play Ball!<eos> You Know, If You Like Dat, You Shoulda Try Some O' Dis Ting Right Here.<eos> Send You Right To Heaven.
-You should...<eos> -What?<eos> Nothing. It's...<eos> They found them.<eos> So Mohammed spilled the beans, huh?<eos> Hey. I'm still a part of this fucking outfit.<eos> All right. Grab your gear.<eos> We're going to Beirut.<eos> The missiles are located in a schoolhouse in the Shiite slums of Beirut.<eos> A contact from the Amal militia will meet you on the beach and take you in.
- We're still here. Certainly.<eos> How much did you bring?<eos> Two million, as you said.<eos> I believe you.<eos> We must trust each other.<eos> They've turned out fine.<eos> Are there no political problems?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> - That's fine then.<eos> This man will give you passports and tickets. He'll take you aboard the ship.
? What do you mean, waste?<eos> When traveling, praying is not mandatory.<eos> What? God should forgive.<eos> Have you become unfaithful, just because we are in the country of the unfaithful?<eos> God have mercy and stand by us.<eos> In which direction is Mekka?<eos> God forgive us!<eos> Anybody not happy can get out, okay?<eos> Who else has something to fuss about?<eos> You want to start a new life and carry your whole past with you.
Crazy Yank.<eos> Quick, Sparky, we gotta extend the runway.<eos> Here we go!<eos> We'll never make it!<eos> Hot! Passengers, please remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop.<eos> Quick, Sparky, we need to make a drag line!<eos> Don't try and tell me the runway's too short.<eos> Hold this for me, will you, pal?<eos> Bloke ought to have his wings clipped.<eos> Captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines...
Right.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Mr. Cochran.<eos> I'm sure Tibey would want you to stay.<eos> Do you like swimming?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - Good.<eos> Maria will show you to the cabana.
Thing of beauty.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm hungry.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Yes! Yes! "Spider Baby" Stalinski!<eos> He's come out for Detroit and now you come out for him.<eos> The lines are open. Waiting for your pledge.<eos> If you want honest government, government that works for you,<eos> I'm asking you to dig deep into your pockets.
- Richard.<eos> Go make the changes. Yes sir.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> Nobody gets out till we have a rescued princess, and a defeated demon.<eos> - I'll pass these out.<eos> - Oh Brad, I've given each one of the homing devices an identity of its own, so just for fun, let's try and figure out which character you are, huh?<eos> - Oh great! - Huh!<eos> All right, well, go down to the second floor as soon as you're ready.<eos> Oh, your starting locations are on the scrolls inside.<eos> Yeah, I'll start contacting you in a few minutes.
You know, they measure vibrations.<eos> Vibrations in the ground.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I've been getting some really strange readings.<eos> I mean, the school's had these machines up here for three years, and we've never recorded anything like this.<eos> Well, we'll ask around. You know, see if anyone's heard anything.<eos> Thanks.<eos> God, I hope they're not broken.<eos> I might have to bag the whole semester.<eos> Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Stay the hell outside then!<eos> Chief of the Five Ranges has arrived.<eos> I am Zhor. Chief of the Five Ranges.<eos> Last month an imposter calling himself Zhor was thrown into a river of crocodiles.<eos> The Five Ranges ar full of heroes.<eos> How dare you claim yourself Chief of the Five Ranges.<eos> Shameless as you are, why not declare yourself king?<eos> No more nonsense<eos> Give me back the Sacred Volume.<eos> If you're so well-bred. Why do people call you shit?
Buy yourself a sword to arm against enemies.<eos> Take the money.<eos> You are so kind.<eos> I will repay your kindness.<eos> I, Lam Ping Gi, do hereby thank you deeply.<eos> Lam Ping Gi, descendant of Master Lam?<eos> Lam Ping Gi, You're alive?<eos> Ping Gi?<eos> You are Lam Ping Gi?<eos> It's been over 10 years since I last saw you.
Thank you so much.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> I know you love wine.<eos> Wait.<eos> There is a wedding of the Highlanders.<eos> This is a gift for you.<eos> How do you know that I love to drink?<eos> It smells good.<eos> Have you finished talking?<eos> Teacher invites you to dinner.
There will be no more make up, no more of kimonos, and no more chop sticks.<eos> So you're just going to leave Snipes alone.<eos> Harry? Harry get the hell out.<eos> Get the hell out.<eos> Get the hell out. Jesus Christ.<eos> Something had to be done.<eos> Snipes had to be dealt with.<eos> Brothers and sisters. Brothers and sisters, let me here an amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> The good Lord thanks you for your generosity.
Nor were his murderers ever brought to book.<eos> They walk the streets as free as you and I.<eos> But their Maker knows who they are.<eos> They can't escape from Him, and He will punish them.<eos> Now I say to you, mend your ways.<eos> Your feet are already on the downward path.<eos> Stop!<eos> Before the fires below devour you.<eos> Amen.<eos> May God bless you all.
O woman, whom I see before me in the night, if you are deceiving me again, woe betide you!<eos> Ha, how you rave!<eos> Be calm and collected!<eos> I will teach you the sweet delights of revenge!<eos> May the work of revenge be conjured up from the wild night of my breast!<eos> You who are lost in sweet sleep know that disaster awaits you!<eos> Brisas que tantas voces con mis lamentos Ilene ahora agradecida, he de deciros that happiness fills my heart<eos> - lt is she!<eos> - Elsa!<eos> He came through you. You smiled on his journey.
A curse on him who was untrue!<eos> And further the King proclaims that the God-sent stranger, whom Elsa wishes to take as her husband, is to be enfeoffed with the land and crown of Brabant.<eos> But the knight does not wish to be called Duke. You shall call him: Protector of Brabant!<eos> Great is the long-awaited man!<eos> Hail to him, hail to him! Hail to him who was sent by God!<eos> We will faithfully serve the Protector of Brabant!<eos> Now hear what he bids me tell you:<eos> today he celebrates his wedding feast with you;<eos> but tomorrow you shall come here prepared for battle, to serve the King as soldiers;<eos> he himself spurns the sweet pleasures of rest, he will lead you on to enjoy the noble fruits of glory!
Hail to you, Elsa!<eos> - Let us now go before God!<eos> - Lo, he is sent from God!<eos> Hail, hail to you!<eos> Hail Elsa of Brabant!<eos> Hail to you, Elsa!<eos> May you be blessed as you proceed!<eos> - Hail to you, virtuous one!<eos> Faithfully guided, draw near to where the blessing of love shall preserve you!<eos> Triumphant courage, the reward of love, joins you in faith as the happiest of couples.

Yeah,it was really messed up.<eos> no,stop.<eos> My ears are bleeding.<eos> You have no passion,girls.<eos> You got to sing like your privates are on fire.<eos> For god's sake.<eos> Just because you're a bunch of rich brats doesn't mean you can't have angst.<eos> Channel it.<eos> This is a song about your mother.<eos> She's been lying to you about sex,and it pisses you off.
They worked in some department store, they had little money, they had to make some extra.<eos> - It's the same with shop-girls today.<eos> Don't they have to make some extra money?<eos> Just got to a night-club.<eos> There are secretaries making extra money to help pay their share of the rent.<eos> - Look, these days you take a girl somewhere and you just want to cry.<eos> You have to drink plonk with some bimbo who can't tell one and from the other.<eos> She can't play the piano, she can't talk or hold an animated conversation.<eos> Yeah, back then...<eos> - The era will sweep you all away.
I'm willing to pay you your weight in gold in exchange for the disc.<eos> Is that not a generous offer?<eos> I must have that woman.<eos> What are you doing in my room?<eos> We are Vorgons.<eos> I am Ajur.<eos> This is Boratus.<eos> We come from the 27th century.<eos> We travelled 300 years into the past to find you.<eos> Alright, let's assume that I believe you, that you are indeed from the future.
- There's my problem!<eos> I can't tell the Continuum you committed a selfless act.<eos> There'd be questions and explanations for centuries.<eos> - I've learned my lesson.<eos> - Remember who you're talking to.<eos> All-knowing, all-seeing.<eos> Fine, you got your powers back.<eos> Try and stay out of trouble.<eos> So, they wanted to destroy me, did they?<eos> If you think I tormented you in the past, wait until you see what I do with you now.
- Number One!<eos> - Here I come.<eos> Am I late?<eos> Did I miss the fight?<eos> En garde!<eos> You, sir, have a familiar bearing.<eos> Have we crossed swords before?<eos> Where is he? Where's Barclay?<eos> A personal grudge.<eos> I warn you, put your affairs in order before you meet him in combat.
You will be condemned.<eos> So will your brother.<eos> There is no other way now.<eos> You admit the truth, yet expect him to accept punishment?<eos> What does this say of an Empire who holds honour so dear?<eos> The Empire will not be destroyed for one family's honour!<eos> - Unacceptable, K'mpec!<eos> - You have no say in this!<eos> I speak now as the Captain of the USS Enterprise and Lt Worf's Commander!<eos> You will not execute a member of my crew, nor will I turn his brother over to you!
Hey.<eos> Mrs. Tremond's the one who told me about Harold Smith.<eos> She has a grandson and he said this to me. The same words that are in Harold Smith's suicide note.<eos> Maybe the boy said the same thing to Harold.<eos> No, Harold's world was in his words.<eos> The suicide note has to be a message.<eos> It all leads back here.<eos> She's pretty old.<eos> It might take a second if her grandson isn't here.<eos> - May I help you?
I mean, you remember that time my toe turned purple, right?<eos> So instead, I took a bath in baking soda and then my toe came around, but I got the worst cramps like I swallowed a kinked hose or something.<eos> Have you seen Andy?<eos> Oh, you must be that native person I've heard so much about, Eagle Eye?<eos> Hawk.<eos> Sister?<eos> Oh, yeah, this is my sister Gwen.<eos> This is Hawk.<eos> Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> God, how you must hate us white people after all we've done to you.
- Nobody's perfect.<eos> - Isn't that the truth?<eos> What the hell kind of a two-bit operation they running out of this tree house, Cooper?<eos> Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.<eos> I have seen some slipshod backwater burgs, but this place takes the cake.<eos> What are you waiting for, Christmas?<eos> Got work to do.<eos> They're putting this girl in the ground tomorrow, and we've wasted half the day traveling here to the middle of nowhere.<eos> Well, Albert, I suggest you and your team should get started.<eos> I'll have one of my men escort you over to the morgue.
Old mule! The work is worth less than nought. I silenced it without a thought.<eos> Lord in heaven!<eos> What of the money to pay back?<eos> Bellerose, those are wise words.<eos> I do not wish to see Thespis' robe full of tatters.<eos> Take this and go.<eos> You're mad!<eos> That famous actor has the Duc de Candale as protector.<eos> Do you have a patron? No patron?<eos> No name to protect you?
My patronness here keeps her word.<eos> Turn and walk!<eos> But...<eos> Why are you looking at my nose?<eos> Does it disgust you?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Is it soft and dangling?<eos> I did not look at it.<eos> And why did you not look at it?<eos> Sickened you, did it?
Swords up! We're leaving!<eos> Out of here!<eos> All of you!<eos> Monsieur, have you read Don Quixote?<eos> I've practically lived it.<eos> Meditate on the windmill chapter.<eos> Chapter thirteen.<eos> If you fight with windmills...<eos> Are my foes like the wind?<eos> their heavy spars may spin you down to the mud.
Who could write so late?<eos> A sacred matter no doubt as a holy man...<eos> De Guiche!<eos> He dares?<eos> I've stayed here for this night with you, my dear.<eos> I'll come in secret. Wait...<eos> I hope the lips which smiled of late...<eos> Father! Listen carefully to this<eos> Richelieu must be obeyed whatever you may say or do.<eos> That is why I send this note to you with this holy, intelligent and discreet brother.
Please keep your seat belts on.<eos> We've made arrangements for your next flight, so you won't miss it.<eos> In your seat, please.<eos> We're just like British Rail, love.<eos> We may be late, but we get you there. Don't worry.<eos> Good luck, McClane!<eos> Dulles, this is Windsor 114 inside the outer marker.<eos> Roger, 114.<eos> This is Dulles tower.<eos> We have radar contact and show you on ILS.
Not with a body temperature of 86% .<eos> Dr. Mannus, will you handle the injections?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Quite simply, why are you doing this?<eos> To see if there's anything beyond death.<eos> Philosophy failed. Religion failed.<eos> Now it's up to physical science.<eos> Mankind deserves to know.<eos> You're doing this for mankind?<eos> This letter absolves you of any responsibility.
Yeah.<eos> I don't know how you can drink this shit.<eos> Did you brush your teeth and say your prayers yet?<eos> Go upstairs and do it.<eos> - How did you get these seats?<eos> - I humped a couple of affiliates.<eos> - It was worth it.<eos> What a birthday!<eos> - There's more.<eos> The Knicks and Madison Square Garden thank you for attending.
He wants to personally congratulate you.<eos> Show his respect.<eos> - Do I have to see him?<eos> - He says you're his patron.<eos> Hey, Vinnie!<eos> - Who's your favorite aunt?<eos> - You are.<eos> Today I'll talk to Michael about your little problem.<eos> If you'd warned me, I would have worn a better suit.<eos> The Meucci Association has elected you Italian-American Man of the Year.
My family has done much of the hard work, taken many risks.<eos> All to make money for the rest of the families.<eos> You all know Joey Zasa.<eos> He is, I admit, an important man.<eos> His picture is on the cover of the New York Times magazine.<eos> He gets the Esquire Magazine award for the best dressed gangster.<eos> The newspapers praise him because he hires Blacks, which shows he has a good heart.<eos> He is famous.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe one day he'll make all of you popular.
You're always talking."<eos> [ALL LAUGHING]<eos> But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.<eos> - Cornuto contento.<eos> - That's it.<eos> JIMMY:<eos> What does that mean?<eos> - It means he's content to be a jerk.<eos> He doesn't care who knows it.<eos> - Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
JANICE:<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> - Hi, Paulie!<eos> - Hi, honey.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> - Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Any of you need anything?
"This is Angry Bob, the man with the industrial dick!"<eos> "Coming at you loud and clear on W.A.R. Radio."
- It's Wednesday.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> We gotta go to work.<eos> Traffic is bad on Wednesdays, especially when streets are wet.<eos> You want me to stay home because of traffic?<eos> I want Rosalie to stay home and help me with the housecleaning.<eos> Housecleaning?<eos> I got work to do.<eos> No!<eos> What's the matter with you two?
Come on, Bowers!<eos> Run, Henry!<eos> Come on!<eos> -Get out.<eos> -What if I won't?<eos> I think the six of us could put you in the hospital.<eos> Seven.<eos> -I'II kill you all.<eos> -Get some new material, champ.<eos> I'II kill you all!
He was here then?<eos> -It's just a drawing!<eos> Now look.<eos> Here he is again, the same man.<eos> -It's not a man.<eos> -It... .<eos> It!<eos> that's what happened back in Georgie's room!<eos> Look!<eos> I'II kill you all!
Let's have a drink and we'll see.<eos> Just drink!<eos> Goddamn, sing, we're not a funeral procession!<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Where's Vinco?<eos> You were the one talking to him.<eos> There was no talking with you.<eos> The destination is clear.<eos> You have to cross the Danube, go down to Budapest, then to Yugoslavia and on to the Near East.<eos> The French will divide you by the kinds of arms.
The French will divide you by the kinds of arms.<eos> L'll fetch the wine.<eos> Soldiers first.<eos> You'll be given passports and money.<eos> The civilians go by a different route.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Hasil, Air Force.<eos> Who secures the route?<eos> Military intelligence.<eos> If the Hungarians arrest you, you'll be reclaimed by the French consulate in Budapest.
It looks like it.<eos> Have you risen from the dead?<eos> Kind of.<eos> I prefer to die in the fresh air.<eos> You must go on.<eos> We'll cross the Danube, and that'sjust the beginning.<eos> Yes!<eos> And it feels as if we've already been on the road for ages.<eos> Eat. It'll be a Iongjourney.<eos> The world awaits you.
No. No?<eos> Captain, in fairness, let me try.<eos> - I deserve at least that much.<eos> - You kidnapped the Captain...<eos> I add spice to your lives, and you complain.<eos> Where is your adventurous spirit?<eos> Picard, think of the possibilities.<eos> Simply speaking, we don't trust you.<eos> Maybe not, but you do need me.<eos> You are not prepared for what awaits you.
Damage them and their essence remains.<eos> They regenerate and keep on.<eos> Eventually you will weaken.<eos> Your reserves will be gone.<eos> They are relentless.<eos> The Borg ship is firing.<eos> We have lost shields again.<eos> Captain, we've just lost the warp engines.<eos> Where's your stubbornness now, your arrogance?<eos> Do you still profess to be prepared for what awaits you?
It was.<eos> Fires lit the sky.<eos> There was unbelievable thunder.<eos> The ground never stopped shaking.<eos> And yet you survived.<eos> We don't know why we survived and the others didn't.<eos> I've tried to put some purpose to it but I can't.<eos> I've been wondering when your ship would be leaving?<eos> I don't have an answer for that.<eos> A few hours ago, we encountered a warship, possibly the one that attacked you.
Sovereign, if the situation were reversed, I'm sure you would demand equal levels of representation.<eos> You're right, Captain.<eos> I apologize for my temper.<eos> Perhaps a brief pause would be helpful.<eos> I agree.<eos> Maybe a little touch of that brandy.<eos> Yuta.<eos> You know...<eos> Thank you.<eos> It is remarkable how very much alike the two of you actually are.
The night will smell of trees and earth.<eos> That's when the images return...<eos> Images of my former life, suddenly arising, alljumbled...<eos> Makes me feel uneasy.<eos> I wasn't happy in a cage with others of my breed.<eos> Even then, my dearest wish was to live with humans.<eos> to see them, smell them... and try to understand the astonishing things they sometimes do.<eos> I figured I had a lot to learn from humans.<eos> THE HUMANS<eos> Never put a coin in your mouth... and don't let dogs lick you...
So, what was I doing in jail?<eos> What I was doing, let me advise you was fixing to shoot some motherfuckers in that hospital.<eos> That's what I was doing.<eos> But you know what?<eos> It was like they read my mind and they kept me in that jail until my mind was turned around.<eos> When I got out, I only wanted to see my baby and my wife.<eos> And I started thinking to myself what happened is the way things are.<eos> So why try and buck the system?<eos> This is what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna break up the squad, send you in different directions.
- Exactly, morose.<eos> Now, language was developed for one endeavor, and that is?<eos> Mr. Anderson?<eos> Come on, are you a man or an amoeba?<eos> Mr. Perry?<eos> - To communicate.<eos> - No. To woo women.<eos> Today we're gonna be talking about William Shakespeare. - Oh, God.<eos> - I know.<eos> A lot of you look forward to this about as much as you look forward to root canal work.
Unless you... Unless you done stood in the door, listened to your five hungry children crying for bread, and you can't do a damn thing about it.<eos> Your woman standing there, you can't even look her in the eye.<eos> Unless you done that, you don't know me, my pain, my hurt, my feelings. You don't know shit!<eos> No, let him finish. Let the old man finish.<eos> Don't call me bum.<eos> Don't call me a drunk.<eos> You all ain't got the sense that God give a billy goat!<eos> Don't call me nothing.<eos> It's disrespectful.<eos> I know your mamas and your papas raised you better.
What you doing? Think this is Birmingham? Fucking Alabama.<eos> Yo, where's Bull Connor?<eos> Son of a bitch !<eos> My people, my people... What can I say?<eos> Say what I can.<eos> I saw it, but I didn't believe it.<eos> I didn't believe it, what I saw.<eos> Are we going to live together?<eos> Together, are we going to live?<eos> This is your Mister Señor Love Daddy talking to you from We Love Radio, 108 FM on your dial, and that's the triple truth, Ruth.
Look, Nadine, I don't know.<eos> Okay?<eos> I mean, all we have to do is not talk about pets and not leave any hats on any beds.<eos> Now, what's hard about that?<eos> I'm just gonna prove to all of you that a hat on a bed doesn't mean anything.<eos> Hey, Rick.<eos> Let's go. Come on.<eos> I really wish you hadn't done that.<eos> You're just goin' out with them tonight.<eos> When you come back, I'll show all of you.
The famous royal guard, whose bravery the whole world talks about.<eos> - We are honoured, noble lord. - The whole world talks about our bravery?<eos> Tell people that you have seen us, will you?<eos> Wait.<eos> What's your name, stranger?<eos> - You must tell us your name.<eos> - Rumata of Estoria.<eos> The king will be pleased to see you.<eos> We don't have many guests.<eos> May I ask, noble lord, what brings you to our once-splendid town?
Just a formality.<eos> We have to register you.<eos> You can't imagine the guile the king's enemies are capable of.<eos> I'm responsible for his protection.<eos> What's your name again?<eos> - Rumata of Estoria.<eos> - From a very old family.<eos> - I'm sorry to bother you with such trifles.<eos> - Your seal, please.<eos> Now tell me, what do you want? What brings you to Arkanar?
What brings you here?<eos> - I just wanted to look around. - With pleasure.<eos> It would be an honour.<eos> - Do you know why they're screaming?<eos> - They won't tell the truth.<eos> And they regret it.<eos> Power stems from truth. Without truth you cannot govern.<eos> Would you like to scream like that too?<eos> I'd like to go now.<eos> Then you must tell me the truth. Who instructed you to come here?
- The Lord has forgiven us.<eos> - Return to Reba.<eos> And you accuse me of intervening.<eos> Pampa!<eos> No!<eos> I know how much I owe you.<eos> Farewell, my friend.<eos> Rumata, he's up there.<eos> - Rumata, kill him!<eos> - God has delivered the enemy to you.
Oh, you have to say yes.<eos> You're too brilliant for Berkeley.<eos> Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam.<eos> Origin and destiny.<eos> Origins and destiny.<eos> The struggle to unearth the one and to discover the other.<eos> That is science!<eos> And as I leave here to unravel my own small destiny, I congratulate each of you on being the best of the best.<eos> I have faith in you all.<eos> God keep you, and may your lives be rich and sweet.
- Well, I trust my partner, Ray.<eos> - Never trust anybody.<eos> Everybody in this business is a criminal.<eos> This is too deep for me. I think I'm going to go home.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> What's your rush?<eos> Here, have some wine.<eos> By the way, Mr Quick, did a Sergeant Phil Cantone come by the other day?<eos> He came by.<eos> He told you about my business proposition?
We'll yet enlarge that man, though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care and tender preservation... of our person would have him punished.<eos> And now to our French causes.<eos> Who are the late commissioners? I one, my lord.<eos> Your highness bade me ask for it today.<eos> So did you me. - And I.<eos> - Then, Richard Earl of cambridge, there is yours.<eos> There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham, and sir knight, Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours.<eos> Read them... and know... I know your worthiness.<eos> My Lord of Westmoreland, uncle Exeter, we will aboard tonight.<eos> Why, how now, gentlemen what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion?
It's footsteps.<eos> There's somebody out in the hall.<eos> - They're coming closer!<eos> - That's it, go!<eos> Richard!<eos> He's in the room.<eos> Richard, he's in the room.<eos> Freeze, police officer!<eos> Coffee?<eos> I'll have a uniform take you back to my place.
Programs!<eos> Get your programs!<eos> Only $2.00.<eos> - You see?<eos> Perhaps you...<eos> - lf you're lonely, he's very lonely.<eos> I used to play football.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Group tackling.<eos> Would group tackling work for you?
Think not what you shall eat nor how you will be clothed.<eos> Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.<eos> Live in peace with one another.<eos> Do not resist evil.<eos> If any man will sue you and take your coat,<eos> let him also have your cloak.<eos> It will be hard for those who have riches to enter God's kingdom.<eos> For where your treasure is, there will your heart also be.<eos> If you love those who love you, what merit have you?<eos> Do good to those who hate you.
The other day your men fired on ours.<eos> Why?<eos> We had a cache of arms in a garage and your men wanted them.<eos> Did they get them?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Nicely done.<eos> There's nothing to be proud of: It was ten against one.<eos> When the point is to win, it's the right proportion.<eos> Gentlemen, let's get down to business.<eos> Good. I'm listening to you.
James, Mommy ...<eos> Here I come.<eos> - Mikey!<eos> - I'm coming.<eos> - Did you see what just happened?<eos> - Give me my baby.<eos> Are you all right, honey?<eos> Let me see you.<eos> He doesn't have a scratch on him.<eos> I finally got you both together.
- Well...<eos> - Did he pull it off, tear it?<eos> Made a hole.<eos> He took me through my lace.<eos> Here's Turd-Packer polishing the silver!<eos> The maid at Milady'sl<eos> Piss on it and it will shinel<eos> Turd-Packer!<eos> You drunkards!<eos> But while this monster deflowered you, what did the others do?
I'll cut off the funds and turn my coat.<eos> My lord wanted to help others, and here I am, chained!<eos> File harder, you'll never make it!<eos> I was wrong, I'm also paying for it.<eos> Liar! You make do with anything as long as you have a pen and paper.<eos> Don't add insult to injury!<eos> If only I could write my thoughts! I'll go mad!<eos> You're free.<eos> Well, I know what's left for me to do.<eos> See what Health Care in the Bastille sends you.
Sade.<eos> "Sade"?<eos> Yes.<eos> S-A-D-E.<eos> Sinful Addressee Died Estranged.<eos> Goose feathers slide on their own on this marvellous Dutch vellum!<eos> But this is your place. I detain your work.<eos> Sit down, sir.<eos> To what do I owe these favours?<eos> To a highly placed person who loves you well.
- Prison lowered 20 centimetres?<eos> - It could be, man.<eos> - 'the fuck is this guy?<eos> - You are not Rudy.<eos> - I am Salvatore. Who the fuck are you guys? - We were waiting for another italian, a friend, Rudy.<eos> - He was supposed to go out.<eos> - I've done three months and I know everyone.<eos> But there is nobody called Rudy.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Your friend ripped you off!
If it wasn't for that wall of sand, I would be first.<eos> The wall of sand?<eos> Guys, I don't know about you but it was years since the last time I had so much fun.<eos> Becuase you don't hang out with me anymore.<eos> And you always had fun with me!<eos> - Hei, Cedrone, where did I bring you?<eos> - Where did you bring me?<eos> Hey professor, look at this place!<eos> Planetary my ass!<eos> I defeated you all with the final rush
We have considered your physical and psychic state, your birth chart, position of the planets, the influence of the stars, and especially of the Moon, on each of you.<eos> All this, in order to give material form, so to speak, to something which will come from the unknown.<eos> For this reason, we have gathered here all those who have helped us find the path which will lead us to an important...<eos> Obviously, only two of you, a man and a woman, can produce this being.<eos> Those who are not chosen, however, must not think they have failed in any way.<eos> The choice is made to obtain a specific result.<eos> It is in no way a reflection on the rest of you.<eos> We will shortly have the final results.<eos> You will then be free to stay at the Center,... or to return to your everyday life.<eos> But I am sure that what you learned here will help you greatly.
Welcome to Flint.<eos> You staying here?<eos> Yeah, we are.<eos> Lots to do? Sure, there's lots of attractions here.<eos> Have you seen Crossroads Village?<eos> See how a little hospitality, right from the start, really makes a difference?<eos> Suggesting things to see and do builds our own image... and it creates positive word-of-mouth endorsements... the most inexpensive, yet most valuable type of advertising there is.<eos> Once again, you see our slogan:<eos> "Flint:<eos> Our new spark will surprise you."
- What if they kill you?<eos> How could they kill me, of all people?<eos> It's so hard to say anything...<eos> Look after your mother.<eos> Leave it be, we'll be back soon.<eos> I've been thinking about what happened to Estonia and the others.<eos> Try to save Finland from the same fate.<eos> We're not going to war.<eos> - It's just maneuvers, father.<eos> Just remember what I told you.
Detective Cash assaulted me.<eos> He put a chair on me and sat on it.<eos> I couldn't find a piano.<eos> This bastard can speak English!<eos> The squarecrow can talk!<eos> Squarecrow?<eos> What do you call it?<eos> As the attorneys for Tango and Cash left the courtroom their mood can only be described as grim.<eos> They face an uphill battle if not an impossible one.<eos> Ray, somebody set you up good.
Matt, is it really you?<eos> It is.<eos> Am I glad to see you!<eos> My arm.<eos> -Who's he?<eos> -Matt Sokowski, assistant warden.<eos> My C.O. when I was a rookie.<eos> You guys are in deep shit.<eos> Really?<eos> Who set you up?
I do miss my wardrobe.<eos> This is the ventilation system.<eos> Enter it from the utility shaft in the yard.<eos> This main ventilation shaft leads beyond the wall.<eos> I can shut down one fan and leave this door unlocked.<eos> I'll get you the right work detail and leave tools at the shaft.<eos> This way looks faster.<eos> -No, it's longer.<eos> -Let's stick to plan A.<eos> Let's get you to the infirmary.
I'd like to propose a toast, to Harry and Sally.<eos> To Harry and Sally.<eos> If Marie or I had found either of them remotely attractive, we would not be here today.<eos> Hi, it's me.<eos> It's the holiday season, and I thought I'd remind you that it's the season of forgiveness.<eos> And, although it's not widely known, it is also the season of grovelling.<eos> So, if you felt like calling me back, I'd be more than happy to do the traditional Christmas grovelling.<eos> Give me a call.<eos> Hi, I'm not home.<eos> I'll call you right back.
It's not true.<eos> You can not die.<eos> I am curious what will happen.<eos> Nutcases like it unsafe. Only the Normal want to know what to expect.<eos> Sleep now.<eos> Then ...<eos> What happens next?<eos> All clear?<eos> Then we begin.<eos> I love you all!
I knew you would be.<eos> I headed the team that built her.<eos> - Are these gentlemen the Bynars?<eos> - They're not gentlemen. Or ladies.<eos> They're a unified pair.<eos> They're always together.<eos> This is One Zero.<eos> And this is Zero One.<eos> They upgraded the computers on the Wellington. A great job.<eos> Your reputation precedes you.
I'm sorry, Will, but you must wait.<eos> Understood.<eos> Doctor, would this virus have any effect on Mr. Data?<eos> Not likely.<eos> You're going back there alone.<eos> Get the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone before it's too late.<eos> This is Data, standing by to beam up.<eos> What of them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mistress Beata invites you to witness this morning's reaffirmation of Angel One's moral imperative.
- Come, have a look.<eos> - I'll summon my Science Officer.<eos> It won't like your Science Officer.<eos> It does like you!<eos> Vitamins.<eos> They do wonders for the body.<eos> Riker to Security, guest quarters 17.<eos> Emergency!<eos> Let's have some Andonian tea while we wait for Riker.<eos> Then you can tell us what's brought you here.
Why?<eos> Is there a place for my parents to rest, Captain?<eos> Well, we're not really tired, son.<eos> Besides,...<eos> I'd like to see some of the ship.<eos> Steven, you know full well Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam on board until we leave.<eos> - So?<eos> - You can see your quarters now.<eos> Show the Millers to their accommodations.<eos> I shall join you later.
I was the whole room.<eos> - She said I spoiled the joke.<eos> - "Killed" is a better word.<eos> You should always try out new material on an audience.<eos> He could be right. Perhaps that's what you need.<eos> Computer, program an audience appropriate to this venue.<eos> Yanar.<eos> You're angry at the embarrassment of all this.<eos> Maybe the timing is not the most romantic, but... I know you love Benzan. I don't want to see you throw that away just because your parents have been quarrelling for years and don't know how to behave properly.<eos> I've carried your messages for almost six months, smuggled you to see each other.
It's not only because we are short of staff it's also because what we require here are people of the highest integrity.<eos> Headquarters only recognizes the importance of bacterial weapons in this war.<eos> They fail to realize that biological and chemical weapons will greatly affect the future of Japan.<eos> They will play a very important role.<eos> - So we must work hard on these experiments.<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> That was really unexpected.<eos> We have to step up security and discipline.<eos> It's late.<eos> I'd better leave you two to talk!
You are in us like marrow in the bone...<eos> Nothing, nothing, sir.<eos> You let us rejoice.<eos> They are play-acting... That in the beginning, the Shern, out of vanity, created the world which he thought ideal.<eos> But when he looked up, he saw the light which he did not create himself.<eos> Then he returned to his homeland.<eos> And then his masculine creative power turned into feminine readiness.<eos> Oh, sir, how hard I am trying!<eos> Gentle Malahuda, her father, is seen hanging around town at nights.<eos> He mocks you,
The only one.<eos> Now, you watched Kenneth Joyce. How did he strike you?<eos> Did he seem especially sensitive?<eos> Especially observant?<eos> Did he seem so remarkable that you immediately thought<eos> "Of course.<eos> This man would notice things other people wouldn't."<eos> Do you believe that Kenneth Joyce saw something those three men didn't see?<eos> In all the time that Sarah Tobias was held down on that pinball machine, the others didn't know?<eos> Kenneth Joyce confessed to you that he watched a rape and did nothing.
Why?<eos> You're perfect.<eos> Orderly!<eos> Orderly!<eos> All right, calm down!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let him down.<eos> Let him go, let him go.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Fifty-fifty.<eos> A partner who knows his place. Seventy-thirty.<eos> You do have your pension to think about, so I'll settle for sixty-forty.<eos> To health and friendship.<eos> Life and love.<eos> Our future. To our future.<eos> Let's really do it.<eos> Do it! Do it!<eos> Let's do it!<eos> Listen, why the fuck are two stars like you wasting your talents in a hole like this?
And Danceny is an entirely respectable young man.<eos> Tell me does Cecile have a great many correspondents?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I went to her room at the beginning of this week.<eos> I simply knocked on the door and entered.<eos> She was stuffing an envelope into the top right-hand drawer of her bureau in which I couldn't help noticing there seemed to be a large number of similar letters.<eos> I am most grateful to you.<eos> Would you think it impertinent if I were to make another suggestion?<eos> No, no.<eos> If my recollection is correct I overheard you saying to the Vicomte de Valmont that his aunt invited you and Cecile to stay at her chateau. No...
I love her, I hate her...<eos> My life is a misery.<eos> Well, I think I may have kept our young friend waiting long enough.<eos> I shall call on you sometime soon after Thursday.<eos> Only if you succeed, Vicomte.<eos> I am not sure I can face another catalogue of incompetence.<eos> I shall succeed.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Once upon a time you were a man to be reckoned with.<eos> I understand that Father Anselme has explained to you the reason for my visit?
I'm sorry to tell you she has been ill.<eos> - Ill!<eos> - Calm yourself, my friend.<eos> The surgeon has declared her well on the road to recovery.<eos> But you can well imagine how desperate I have been to find you.<eos> Of course, I...<eos> My God, how could I have been away at such a time?<eos> How can I ever forgive myself?<eos> But, look all is well now with Cecile, I assure you.<eos> And I shan't disturb you further.
Well, as you can expect, she protested vociferously.<eos> But to everything she said to every objection she made he simply replied:<eos> "It's beyond my control."<eos> Good night.<eos> You're only five minutes late, but I get so frightened.<eos> I become convinced I'm never going to see you again.<eos> - My angel.<eos> - Is it like that for you, too?<eos> Yes.<eos> At this moment, for example, I'm quite convinced I am never going to see you again.
What?<eos> Danceny isn't coming.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> What do you mean. How do you know?<eos> I know, because I have arranged for him to spend the night with Cecile.<eos> Come to think of it, he mentioned he was expected here.<eos> But, when I put it to him that he would really have to make a choice I must say, he did not hesitate.<eos> He is coming to see you tomorrow, to explain.<eos> And to offer you... I think I do his eternal friendship.<eos> As you said, he is entirely devoted to you.
Yes, I am.<eos> I feel such a fool, actually.<eos> I must be the only woman in town who doesn't know about the fabulous Mantle twins.<eos> What are you drinking?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I want to be very sober right at this moment.<eos> There really isn't any telling you apart, is there?<eos> Absolutely identical in every respect.<eos> I'm actually a couple of millimetres taller.<eos> I bet somebody who knew you both - how shall I put it? - ...knew you both really well could tell the difference.
Hey, babe, I negotiate million-dollar deals for breakfast.<eos> I think I can handle this Eurotrash.<eos> Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?<eos> If you'd listened to me, he would be neutralized already.<eos> I don't want neutral.<eos> I want dead.<eos> Hope I'm not interrupting.<eos> What does he want?<eos> It's not what I want.<eos> It's what I can give you.
I'm warning you, Otto.<eos> What are you going to do? Shoot me?<eos> Gun me down in cold blood, like a dog? Hey?<eos> You're a man. Let's fight like men! Come on!<eos> All right.<eos> OK. You look good, Arch.<eos> That's right. I used to box for Oxford. Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, I used to kill for the CIA. Now, get your hands up.<eos> Now, out.<eos> I'm going to have to shoot you now, Archie.
Did you release the three civil rights workers into the hands of the Klan on the night of June 21st?<eos> - No.<eos> - Are you a member of the Ku Klux Klan?<eos> - No. - Have you ever been a member?<eos> - No.<eos> - Do you know the term "grand cyclops"?<eos> - I have heard of it.<eos> Were you the grand cyclops of the East Mississippi white knights of the Ku Klux Klan for the past three years?<eos> Objection.<eos> My client already told you he is not a member.
-You're just going to have to wait and see.<eos> -Oh, Well....<eos> You have a fine operation, David.<eos> Thank you for showing it to me.<eos> My pleasure, Eric.<eos> I am just sorry that I made us run Late.<eos> All right.<eos> Between us, we've covered every hotel on hotel row.<eos> You guys. I want you guys to start South Beach.<eos> We don't see him here, we'll start Northside... and work our way to you.
I'm 38 years old and I've been locked up 26 of those.<eos> I educated myself in here.<eos> I've come to understand this country was built on exploiting the black man.<eos> Of course, I don't hear anything about brothers in your country. But your country exploits its own people just the same.<eos> So I guess that makes me the only Marxist around here right, comrade? You see, this ain't just no drug deal. This is politics, baby.<eos> I plan to sell drugs to every white man in the world and his sister.<eos> I still want Viktor Rosta. -Yeah, real bad.<eos> I can tell.<eos> -Where can I find him?<eos> I'm gonna put you two white boys together see if you can't work this thing out.
- Knows about things.<eos> - I'd like to stay here.<eos> Maybe we should go to that dance Roche mentioned.<eos> I'm not too keen on those things.<eos> You go. I wouldn't go on my own.<eos> But it would have been nice.<eos> She's gone to bed.<eos> They seemed friendly.<eos> Maybe they don't hate us.<eos> Of course they don't hate you.
- This!<eos> If it was summer we would take a bath...<eos> If it was summer...<eos> I am thirsty.<eos> Come on.<eos> A beer and two orange sodas.<eos> Where are we going then?<eos> Where?<eos> To Salonicco, don't you remember?<eos> Didn't I tell you that night that I had to leave the company for the military service?
The tradition of our Sisterhood at Phi Gamma Kappa... goes back to the days when cotton was king.<eos> And just as it has been for generation after generation... the friendships you have so lovingly cultivated... and nourished here... will remain amongst the most treasured possessions of your lives.<eos> Through times of happiness and times of sadness... good fortune and tribulation... you will always remember... this time together.<eos> You are at a crossroads... a junction in your lives.<eos> May the road you travel speed you toward your dreams and goals... with no sudden curves or detours... to divert you from your path.

We shall receive a royal welcome.<eos> Now what?<eos> I've got you, at last.<eos> - Your Majesty! What a great pleasure to see you again.<eos> May I introduce my friend Sally.<eos> Sally, King of the Moon.<eos> My full title is King of Everything. Re di tutto.<eos> You can call me Ray.<eos> You seem to be in some discomfort.<eos> What ails you?
- Oh yeah?<eos> Same old baron, eh?<eos> - Can we go now?<eos> Get weaving!<eos> Hang on ... It's all coming back.<eos> I've been stuck here for 20 years.<eos> Ever since you were last here. You abandoned me here.<eos> You swine!<eos> You went off with the Queen of Tarts and left me to rot in a cage.<eos> Now you come back and expect me to follow you to the ends of the Earth?
- Baron.<eos> - Don't interrupt.<eos> What is it?<eos> This isn't going to work.<eos> They're old and tired now.<eos> It isn't like it used to be.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To give myself up.<eos> I gave my word I would raise the siege and gathered you all here.
We seek only what is equitable.<eos> What do you seek?<eos> Why did you attack us?<eos> We did not attack. We gave chase to recover a Federation energy device...<eos> Which is ours!<eos> Your Federation placed it on one of our planets.<eos> No, Gamma Tauri IV is recognized by all civilized...<eos> The Ferengi are not uncivilized.<eos> Are you suggesting otherwise?<eos> All I'm saying is that you removed something which did not belong to you.
Bobby, you want to go out and play?<eos> You ain't going nowhere unless you eat something.<eos> You look terrible.<eos> Thin.<eos> Come on, lady. You got to stop this.<eos> Eat, for the love of Mike.<eos> You're just like your father.<eos> I don't know nothing about my father, and I don't want to know.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> He loves you.
Inside.<eos> I'd approach her from the side, she's a high kicker.<eos> I've been there.<eos> - Who's he? - Pilot.<eos> We checked, he's been cleared.<eos> You again.<eos> Yes?<eos> No use arguing.<eos> The President's cleared her for the flight.<eos> I'll have a limo for you at the John Wayne, Newport Beach.
No visitors?<eos> What the hell is it to you?<eos> My message today is especially for the youngest among you who will be confirmed in a few weeks.<eos> My children, we live in a time of discord and hatred. Lies are all-powerful. Christians kill one another.<eos> Those who should guide us betray us instead. More than ever, we must beware of selfishness and indifference.<eos> You're all from wealthy families, some very wealthy. Because you've been given much, much will be asked of you.<eos> Remember the Bible's stern lesson:<eos> "It's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."<eos> St. James said,<eos> "Now, you rich, weep and wail for the woes awaiting you."
The ingredients for the dinner.<eos> For the French dinner.<eos> Surely that's not wine?<eos> It's Clos de Vougeot 1845.<eos> From Chez Philippe, Rue Montorgueil.<eos> We had no bad intentions.<eos> Filippa and I merely wanted to grant Babette's wish.<eos> We had no idea where it might lead.<eos> And now... we have exposed ourselves to dangerous, or maybe even evil, powers.<eos> I cannot even tell you what you will be served to eat or drink.
Well, he does well in school.<eos> He's a nice kid.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm just worried about Erica.<eos> I feel like she were my daughter.<eos> That's nice.<eos> She feels the same way about you.<eos> She loves you.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - And I love you both.
- Argh! - Jack!<eos> It's a set-up!<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm the guy that set you up.
My name is April. Don't tell me.<eos> Your favourite movies are The Sound of Music and Yes, Giorgio. You love to go bobbing for apples.<eos> Your major turn-offs are... anchovies, people who don't use coasters and--<eos> And men who smoke in public places.<eos> Let's go meet Jerry.<eos> There's Jerry over there.<eos> I'm gonna have a place like this someday.<eos> Dream on, Streebek, dream on.<eos> It's about time.<eos> I called you cops three hours ago.
"To come and ask me where I'm going?<eos> Nobody owns me.<eos> "I own myself.<eos> I am my own person."<eos> And we hear all that shit, then be, "OK."<eos> "Well, where you gonna be?" "I'm gonna be where I'm at!<eos> "You don't own me!" Well, you don't.<eos> You don't own your woman.<eos> "You gonna put a ring on my finger?"<eos> That shuts you right up.
I said, "Security!"<eos> And that's when one of my boys jumped over the table like Linc Hayes from the Mod Squad and grabbed that boy and started going:<eos> Boy hit the deck.<eos> My boy jumps up and starts fucking this boy up and his brother woke up, jump on top of my boy and started kicking his ass.<eos> Then somebody says, "Fight in the back!"<eos> And all the people, the bouncers, came and saw two niggers fighting two white guys.<eos> They jump on the niggers.<eos> "You niggers have to learn<eos> "to stop fucking up our club.<eos> Didn't we let you in here, nigger?
Second chapter.<eos> "A slave market".<eos> "How human livestock is paid for.<eos> A blackman's word".<eos> Hi, Adelina.<eos> "Setback, the rise and fall of an African king".<eos> "Three men for nine pounds of salt..." ".. memories of two Europeans".<eos> Despite the social and political differences that divide us, I believe that in today's Italy there is a euphoria, a tension, a stimulation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A superficial observer would only see a grand confusion, and not the desire to discuss and to debate, within the parties, in the press, between ex-enemies, after the silence fascism forced you to.
Do any of you people know where these individuals learned how to shoot?<eos> Private Joker.<eos> Sir, in the Marines, sir.<eos> In the Marines.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> Those individuals showed what one motivated Marine and his rifle can do.<eos> And before you ladies leave my island you will all be able to do the same thing.<eos> Today is Christmas.<eos> There will be a magic show at 0930.<eos> Chaplain Charlie will tell you about how the free world will conquer communism with the aid of God and a few Marines.
Yes, have you used any?<eos> Well, once, yes, on myself.<eos> And it had no...<eos> - No effect on me.<eos> I've had no actual...<eos> Whoa, big dogs.<eos> Big dogs landing on my face.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> Hey, that's it for me.<eos> That's the end of the Adrian Cron-Hour, but I'm gonna turn you over right now to Mr. Warmth, Dan "The Tan" Levitan.
I don't want to drink, I'm too depressed.<eos> That's what we wanted to talk about, we're your friends.<eos> Tell us what's on your mind.<eos> Lately, I don't know why -<eos> I've lost my cheerful spirit. I don't even enjoy sports.<eos> I've changed so much - that this wonderful world looks like a barren reef.<eos> Somehow I feel like puking all the time.<eos> Evening, Mother dear.<eos> Hello, Klaus.<eos> I know I've been just impossible but I'd like to make it up - and invite you to the theatre with me.
Dedicated to Sohrab Sepehri.<eos> Where is my friend's house?<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's all this mess?<eos> What happened?<eos> Hadn't you promised me you'd be quiet?<eos> I can't even be away for five minutes.<eos> Everybody, stand up.<eos> Come on.<eos> Who has told you to sit down?
Many heads are being decapitated, unfortunately.<eos> That will stop them from thinking, forever.<eos> It is time for the Emperor to rest.<eos> The students are right in being angry.<eos> I am angry too.<eos> But I am not allowed to leave the Forbidden City.<eos> I want to go out too, Mr. Johnston!<eos> My lord.<eos> I want to see the City of Sounds.<eos> The Emperor confers to you the Order of the Ruby Button Hat, with a right to be transported with your chair, by four carriers.
"Pu Yi left Tientsin and went to Manchuria spontaneously.<eos> - Johnston is a liar.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> Mr. Johnston had left when they took me to Manchuria.<eos> Perhaps he was wrongly informed.<eos> Sit down!<eos> You say that you prepared this man's suitcases on the morning of November 9.<eos> Isn't it strange that a man who will be kidnapped asks to prepare his suitcases one day before that?<eos> It is what you wrote, right?<eos> Who ordered you to prepare this man's suitcases?
What are you two doing?<eos> Fighting?<eos> Chow, Lau wants to shoot me.<eos> Put down your gun.<eos> This can't happen in the police station, release him.<eos> Be quick!<eos> You two come into my room.<eos> Man, you look after him for me.<eos> Close the door.<eos> I asked you to co-operate, not to fight.
[Pop rock music begins]<eos> "Thou shall not die<eos> "Thou shall not fear<eos> "Thou shall not kill"<eos> [Ambient sounds of amusement park]<eos> [Angry shouting and bickering]<eos> I told you to stay off the boardwalk.
Don't run off like that.<eos> There you are.<eos> WOMAN BO Y: Thank you.<eos> LUCY:<eos> Bye, Terry.<eos> We only come here to watch one thing.<eos> Well done.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Well, on second thought...<eos> I told you not to come in here anymore.
Happy holidays.<eos> Same to you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Going home for Thanksgiving?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> Just gonna make it.<eos> What did you do here?<eos> Did he say he smelled smoke?<eos> You walk a mile and a half to the highway, the trucks will take you into Jefferson City.
And that's the correct way to eat a doughnut.<eos> -A doughnut--<eos> -Attention!<eos> Capt. Harris.<eos> From this moment on, anyone who misplaces their canister of Mace... will be reprimanded and fined.<eos> -Is that clear?<eos> -Yes, sir!<eos> Bye.<eos> As Citizens On Patrol... endurance and longevity should be very important to you.<eos> Aerobic activity will keep you in shape... and keep that heart rate up.
I can't leave him alone.<eos> He's getting away from me, Fezzik!<eos> Please!<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Strange wedding.<eos> Yes... a very strange wedding.<eos> Come along.<eos> What was that for?<eos> Because you've always been so kind to me. And I won't be seeing you again... since I'm killing myself once we reach the honeymoon suite.
- You've gotta be a little cool about it.<eos> The one thing you shouldn't do is let your desperation show.<eos> I don't think I have.<eos> I always felt there was a fatal element of hunger in your last affair.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I don't think Jeff would have run quite so quickly back to his wife if he didn't feel a certain pressure.<eos> I sensed it.<eos> His name was Jack. And you were never around, so you don't know what happened.<eos> Darling, don't be so defensive.<eos> I'm basing this observation on the time I saw you together. And I'm not saying anything different than those high-priced psychiatrists have said.
If we can learn nothing from you, we'll leave.<eos> No!<eos> Oh no, please, don't leave!<eos> I'll... try to explain.<eos> First Officer to Enterprise.<eos> We've lost Zorn.<eos> Something like a transporter beam has snatched him away.<eos> Question, sir.<eos> Could it be this Q?<eos> None of you knows who transported him.
- You're full of bull.<eos> It's OK, you can say "bullshit" in here.<eos> I'm grateful.<eos> I'm sure you're aware that I'm teaching next door.<eos> And this swearing is getting a little loud.<eos> You think you could concentrate on some obscene gestures for a while?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, that's the idea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't think she likes you.
With tongue.<eos> And rips off my mask.<eos> Mom freaked out.<eos> She made me put on her coat.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You're sorry?<eos> I'm at my sexual peak.<eos> Once a guy hits 18, it's all downhill.<eos> But it's a lovely ride.<eos> Mr. Shoop, why did you tell the arresting officers that the vodka found in the possession of Mr. Gremp and Mr. Frazier belonged to you?
May I see it, please?<eos> - I'd rather you didn't.<eos> - I'd rather I did.<eos> You were a black Marine in 1968?<eos> Vietnam.<eos> A war puts a man through many, many changes.<eos> Young man, the possession of false identification and of alcohol by a minor are serious crimes.<eos> You've just confessed to both of them.<eos> - I didn't mean to.<eos> - However, since the arresting officers let you off with a warning, I'll probably do the same.
Miss Lane!<eos> Miss Lane, take a look at this.<eos> Hot off the press.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> This time he's gone too far.<eos> Look, Clark.<eos> Can't wait to see the chief's reaction.<eos> I'm through taking it lying down.<eos> I'll be downtown.<eos> Chief look different to you?
In Orlandos poems there are no horses.<eos> You know because you read them. Have you ever seen a horse there?<eos> In his poems everything is static.<eos> Put some movement, something human...<eos> Nothing.<eos> I think that his poems are...<eos> I will never tell him, but I dont like his poems.<eos> Theyre too short..., they don`tt say anything.<eos> Maybe you like them because you are smart guys.<eos> Get engaged, be smart together and God bless you!
Come on, old boy.<eos> What's in your hump?<eos> Now look, you.<eos> Them pheasants are for his pot. These here are for my pot. Now what makes you think I should give you something for your pot?<eos> - What pot?<eos> - Our cooking pot.<eos> He knows.<eos> Hey, give us a wheeze on that fag.<eos> I might come and see you lads in a week.<eos> I might fetch you up a rabbit.
General Walker, Corral is like a father to these people.<eos> A tyrannical father who would betray his children.<eos> He was calling on foreign troops to start an insurrection.<eos> Treason must be punished. I have no choice.<eos> Doña Yrena says it is a terrible mistake to kill Corral.<eos> A mistake, General. In this case I entirely agree with her.<eos> Morally and politically you will lose everything you have gained up to now.<eos> She said something else. She called me a name.<eos> What did she call me?<eos> She called you a dog's asshole.
As long as I'm needed, I'll not leave.<eos> - Your country is in chaos.<eos> Guerilla wars are taking place. Yet you refuse to engage the enemy.<eos> Why?<eos> A long war against scattered guerilla groups would be disheartening and too exhausting for our American troops.<eos> Do you have anything to say to the American people?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Climb aboard one of Vanderbilt's ships and come on down.<eos> The truth is, Cornelius Vanderbilt is taking advantage of you.<eos> His company, which guarantees overland passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, isn't paying you what they should.
- D'you wanna bet?<eos> - President Walker, it might be better to use more diplomacy instead of force.<eos> For you, perhaps, but not for me.<eos> Excuse me. I have work.<eos> Forgive me, but your work is here.<eos> Sir, come back here!<eos> I've had it with you foreign weasels.<eos> You have the nerve to come here, barely speaking the language, taking our jobs and women.<eos> Take that!<eos> I can't help noticing, sir, during the time I've spent with you, that you've betrayed your principles, all the men who supported you...
You're fairly pretty.<eos> Oren sends me.<eos> You came to see me about Sentaro?<eos> I have something to ask you first.<eos> What is it?<eos> If you arrest Sentaro you won't need the cord anymore.<eos> This cord again?<eos> Come on, give it to me.<eos> You're right.<eos> It would fit you prefectly.
Genshiro.<eos> Oren wants the cord too.<eos> It's getting complicated.<eos> Don't worry about Oren.<eos> She doesn't know about our conspiracy yet.<eos> This Ocho slut reappeared. She's involved in Genshiro's business.<eos> Denzo died because of her.<eos> She must know the fate reserved for traitors.<eos> You're right.<eos> Since Denzo's death, we all consider you as our boss.
Why did you tell me, why did you relate to me, who he was!<eos> God help you!<eos> What do we hear?<eos> She's sighing for that pallid man!<eos> She's losing her head over him!<eos> You see what a picture can do!<eos> In vain do I chide her every day.<eos> Come, Senta!<eos> Turn round this way!<eos> She doesn't hear you.
Undoubtedly, you deserve it.<eos> (chuckling) Glad you agree.<eos> Get Dragon and Ronald's daughter to meet you at Toyota's Restaurant.<eos> Tell them you want to make a deal. And then, heh, take care of them.<eos> Hmm. Okay, boss.<eos> But Tiger Kwok wants to see you.<eos> Shall I arrange it? Very good.<eos> I'll contact you later.<eos> (laughing) Very good!<eos> Do it as I told you.
Holy shit!<eos> Wonder what team he's on?<eos> Hey, Jake, are we gonna get a couple beers over here or what?<eos> Keep your shirt on, asshole.<eos> I got a problem here.<eos> You believe these guys?<eos> It ain't Halloween, is it?<eos> If anything does happen to me, you crooks won't live long.<eos> What does he mean we won't live long?<eos> What can I get for you fellas?
One hour late.<eos> Are you Ginger?<eos> yes, it's my nickname.<eos> My real name is Amelia Bonetti.<eos> - where will we go now?<eos> - to the hotel.<eos> - Is Fred already there?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Let's hope that one is a real porter!<eos> It's Christmas and... who's waiting for you at the station?
Well, it's Rome!<eos> Maybe not so good today.<eos> Centro Spaziale Televisivo, the admiral is on board.<eos> Mister admiral, just one question.<eos> Could you imagine you'd become a hero?<eos> In case you change your mind, I'm here!<eos> Mister admiral, these ladies and these men are all artists.<eos> I know, I love artists.<eos> They're humanity's benefactors.<eos> Yes, I love you.
- Is this Recon Platoon?<eos> - No speak English.<eos> - You?<eos> - No habla.<eos> My name is Gunnery Sergeant Highway.<eos> I've drunk more beer, pissed more blood, banged more quiff, busted more balls than all you numbnuts put together.<eos> Major Powers has put me in charge of this Recon Platoon.<eos> We take care of ourselves!<eos> You couldn't take care of a wet dream.<eos> - God loves you.
This is Thomas Highway.<eos> This is Roy Jennings.<eos> He owns the Palace.<eos> I've heard about you and your bullshit heroics.<eos> Now, Roy, Tom is just going to leave.<eos> Aggie, I'll take you home after we close as usual.<eos> You sure can pick them.<eos> Look who's talking.<eos> I'm going to play something from NYC.<eos> I want all of you to rock the house.
They're all part of it!<eos> Walker, would you please come in here?<eos> Ma'am, I'd like you and the boy to leave us for a moment.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir? Walker, I want you to escort these two people to the briefing room.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Please, follow me.<eos> Rinaldi, I want you to notify NASA that we're going to do just a routine security check on their men.<eos> Don't want to make an issue out of this. Yes, sir.<eos> The general's ready to see you now.
- You're gonna kill him! - Sensei, please.<eos> You're hurting him. He's sorry. He really is.<eos> - Let him go.<eos> - Mr. Miyagi's right.<eos> Let him go!<eos> I said, let him go!<eos> Beat it, slope, or you're next.<eos> Mercy is for the weak.<eos> We do not train to be merciful here.<eos> A man face you, he is enemy.
What about Tsak?<eos> No, they'll have to tolerate us without it.<eos> Earth!<eos> ...sings the same old Russian folk song again...<eos> Nope... not Earth.<eos> Hello!<eos> We're Patsaks from planet Earth.<eos> And you are...?<eos> This is planet Alpha.<eos> Tell your co-ordinates to Decont, and she will transport you to your point of departure.
What conclusions do you draw?<eos> If men believe things strongly, they may die for them.<eos> What would you be prepared to die for, Lady Jane?<eos> I would die to free our people from the chains of bigotry and superstition.<eos> What superstition did you have in mind?<eos> For example, the idea that a piece of bread can become the body of our Saviour, Father.<eos> Did he not say at his last supper, "Take, eat, this is my body"?<eos> He also said, "I am the vine, I am the door."<eos> Was he a vine, a door?<eos> Who has been teaching you to say such things?
I wasn't whipped.<eos> They had a boy.<eos> If I did something bad, they beat him in my place.<eos> See?<eos> You should have been born heir to the throne.<eos> Though, in a way it made it rather worse.<eos> You understand?<eos> But it was his duty, as it was mine to suffer for his suffering in my stead.<eos> As it is yours now to obey your parents and your King.<eos> - Why must you do what he tells you?
Your husband was taken from his room by the Lord Lieutenant of the Tower through the Bulwark Gate, followed by the sheriffs, up to Tower Hill.<eos> He was led through all the people to the scaffold steps.<eos> Just three or four.<eos> And when he'd climbed them, he turned held the rail, and addressed the people, asking God's forgiveness.<eos> Took off his hat and coat, and his collar, and forgave the executioner, who told him to step upon the straw before the block itself, and placed his head within the crevice of the block.<eos> And when he was ready, threw wide his arms.<eos> And the headsman's axe came down.<eos> It was a single stroke.<eos> He can have felt no pain.<eos> God will requite you for your kindness, sir.
Algeria, get dressed!<eos> - Divided in how many parts?<eos> - Two, basically.<eos> What are they?<eos> The envious and the intolerant.<eos> Elvira, get ready!<eos> - Which side do you belong to? - Both.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - And you?<eos> I've told you not to shoot up in the dressing rooms!
He took it back to his desk in the scriptorium and began to read it.<eos> After scribbling down those few mysterious quotations he died with a black stain on his finger.<eos> The assistant librarian discovered the body and dragged it down to the pigpens to avert suspicion falling on him.<eos> But he left his autograph behind.<eos> The book remained on the translator's desk.<eos> Berengar returned there last night and read it.<eos> Soon after, overcome by some agonizing pain he tried to take a soothing bath with lime leaves and drowned.<eos> He, too, had a blackened finger.<eos> All three died because of a book which kills or for which men will kill.<eos> I therefore urge you to grant me access to the library.

And I ain't gonna allow that in any of you.<eos> Not one.<eos> Y'all love Elias.<eos> Oh, you wanna kick ass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, here I am, all by my lonesome,<eos> and ain't nobody gonna know.<eos> Six of you boys against me.<eos> Kill me.<eos> I shit on all of you.
But that is nothing compared to what he has achieved in this century.<eos> Mankind has hunted whales to the brink of extinction.<eos> Virtually gone is the blue whale, the largest creature on Earth.<eos> Despite all attempts to ban whaling, there are still countries and pirates currently engaged in the slaughter of these creatures.<eos> Humpback whales, once numerous, now number about 10,000 specimens.<eos> Those that are taken are no longer fully grown.<eos> In addition, many of the female whales are killed with their unborn calves.<eos> To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.<eos> Whoever said the human race was logical?<eos> If you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the institute's pride and joy.
You look well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Maybe you're not as ill as they say.<eos> I'd like something to remember you by.<eos> Take a flower.<eos> No, it'll wither and I'll be sad.<eos> It's all I have.<eos> A hair?<eos> A fingernail?<eos> Will you forget I didn't like you?
Daniel, we'll do everything we can for Spike.<eos> And what do we gonna do when we get there?<eos> If that thing crunches moons, it'll make short work of us.<eos> Maybe the Matrix can stop it.<eos> You're right, it can.<eos> What do you know about it, lad?<eos> I just got this feeling.<eos> Look!<eos> To the shuttles!<eos> I Galvatron will crush you just as Megatron crushed Prime.
Rocker arm.<eos> Valve. - Rocker arm.<eos> Rocker arm, indeed.<eos> How very odd.<eos> I'm going back.<eos> What?<eos> - Back to Paris.<eos> The nearest plane is four days away.<eos> It's the last favor I'll ask.<eos> I take her to lferouane and meet you in five days.
I call dibs on the offal.<eos> little Quark...<eos> That little monster.<eos> I'd sure like to see Thor and his friends now.<eos> I'll bet they have their hands full.<eos> Has it occurred to you that they might send him back?<eos> if it isn't Thor and his friends.<eos> Allow me to introduce myself.<eos> and your cave is my glove.<eos> What brings you to...
Very accurate and very exact.<eos> It's very dangerous for your friend to...<eos> He's been making Xerox cop...<eos> He's been making Xerox copies, probably on a machine where he works.<eos> The counters on those machines are more than likely checked.<eos> So you want us to photograph them from now on.<eos> - Decent idea.<eos> Give me the camera.<eos> - No, this one's mine.<eos> I had an idea that might be of interest to you, OK?
- Where are you going?<eos> - Can I talk to you?<eos> Sit down and shut up!<eos> Also physical descriptions of each.<eos> Height, weight and so on.<eos> Their home addresses if you know them.<eos> And maybe some details about their families.<eos> Drinking habits, religious habits.<eos> Sexual deviations and so on.<eos> None of those people will help you the way I've helped you.
Am I to blame for something, father?<eos> Mind your business.<eos> She lives over there!<eos> - All the way up?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Let the Czar's envoys pass!<eos> Make way for the Czar's envoys!<eos> Make way!<eos> Step back!<eos> What misfortune has brought you here?
You!<eos> Pile them up over there! And get that cart out of here!<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I've ignored you.<eos> You did come for the Black Cauldron, didn't you?<eos> Good. Then climb in!<eos> It will only cost you your life.<eos> Everything is ready, sire.<eos> My, such a brave and handsome group:<eos> a pig boy, a scullery maid and a broken-down minstrel.<eos> Perhaps it may interest you to see what fate has in store for you.
The firm is naturally concerned with how Mr. Brewster conducts himself with his inheritance.<eos> If you're in his employ, it could make it easier for us if you could act as our eyes and ears.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> No problem.<eos> My first loyalty would always be to the firm.<eos> Keep us posted.<eos> Oh... and don't mention this conversation to Miss Drake or anyone else.<eos> Oh, of course not.<eos> And thank you.<eos> Thank you both very much.
And I won't regret what I did for love<eos> What I did for love<eos> Gone love is never gone<eos> As we travel on Love's what we'll remember<eos> Kiss today goodbye And point me toward tomorrow<eos> We did what we had to do<eos> Won't forget, can't regret what I did for love<eos> What I did for love<eos> What I did for love<eos> We'll put you into groups of four.
No.<eos> When would you go, if you did?<eos> Soon, my boy.<eos> Soon.<eos> - And do you know where?<eos> - Where?<eos> Look up.<eos> Outer space, my lad.<eos> Outer space.<eos> Who's gonna take you to outer space?
What's this got to do with insurance?<eos> Oh, trust me, Marvin, this is a comprehensive policy.<eos> Well, you can forget about that lady friend business.<eos> Alan is the most loving husband a girl could have.<eos> He dotes on that bride of his.<eos> His wife.<eos> You've met her?<eos> Well, of course we have.<eos> He brings her with him.<eos> Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh to you?
There is one thing.<eos> The Princess Rubali, where is she?<eos> With her father, of course.<eos> And as I said, welcome.<eos> Thanks.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> The first challenge is a three-mile run across the swamp to the second obstacle, a 200-foot rope climb.<eos> From there, it is but a half mile to the gorge.<eos> The fourth part is to enter the river that will lead you, dead or alive to the high forest.
That's terrible!<eos> -You can always bargain.<eos> Now, Colonel Bockner, soon the girl will be ours... and Quatermain will be groveling at my feet.<eos> Miss Huston, meet the Mapaki.<eos> We'll talk about it later, boss.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They were just grocery shopping.<eos> Cannibals.<eos> I hired you to take me to the House of Isis, not to take me on a tour.
In the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit<eos> You can all sit down.<eos> Alesandro and Silvia. You just received the Sacrament.<eos> I hope that you are both aware of it.<eos> I don't really know Alessandro.<eos> But not Silvia.<eos> I know her since a long time.<eos> Silvia isn't a bad person.<eos> She is not bad, like some may say.<eos> This Sacrament oblige you to an absolute fidelity that only death could undo.
They don't make these anymore.<eos> In October, one day she came in<eos> "Guess what I just brought you!" But we knew it!<eos> They were the first mandarins of the season.<eos> These days, we can find cherries and strawberries all year long.<eos> What kind of memories will the children keep?<eos> I wanted to read you a passage from the Bible where it says...<eos> Where is it?<eos> I can't find it...<eos> It doesn't matter because I need to say my last goodbye to you.
- This is not a Ferrari.<eos> - It is now.<eos> Car 21 to Station.<eos> Stand by, we're almost there. You've got three minutes.<eos> Okay, slow down.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All right. The play is over, you guys.<eos> It's too hot to fight.<eos> Hold it.<eos> Here come the troops, fellows. They'll take you to the showers.
Well...<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> Redl, you father has died.<eos> Here's the telegram.<eos> You'll get leave of course. If you should need anything... money for the journey or a wreath for the grave... please tell me.<eos> You can count on me.<eos> Colonel, may I ask for permission to stay here... I want to take part in His Majesty's... name-day celebration.<eos> Now that Emperor Franz Josef the First... has become your godfather and by the bond... of our Holy Church, you have become his sons. Our Father, Franz Josef.<eos> You may call him that from this day forward... with humble pride and the right to do so. By the sacrament of confirmation... you're accepted as his sons.<eos> This will make the bond between you all... between you and the army... between you and His Majesty even more indissoluble.
- No.<eos> Or do I?<eos> It is cold.<eos> Yes.<eos> - The weapons?<eos> - Here they are.<eos> - Redl will tell his dream. - That's not of interest now.<eos> - Gentlemen...<eos> - Please, go on.<eos> I ask you to discuss your disagreement... and use your weapons symbolically.
Your task will be in the provinces... with people whose language you know.<eos> Our mutual task is to preserve and protect... the strength of the Monarchy.<eos> Whatever we say or don't say in order to reach our goal... is not lie, but our mission. Duty.<eos> We must know everything about everyone.<eos> The smallest town holds people we need.<eos> It's up to us entirely to find them.<eos> Suitable types abound, nearly everyone is susceptible.<eos> Details of our work are strictly confidential.<eos> If you are successful... you'll be praised by nobody but me.<eos> Mistakes, nobody will defend you, the same goes for me.
Don't take charity from peasants.<eos> A samurai will starve rather than beg.<eos> The peasants are presumptuous.<eos> Burn their villages!<eos> Wait, my Lord!<eos> Don't blame the peasants.<eos> Rather than disobey Taro's decree, they fled.<eos> What decree?<eos> That you are banished.<eos> Anyone who helps you... will die.
Mention Saburo and he runs away.<eos> He doesn't dare face him.<eos> On that point, he's sane.<eos> What about Master Saburo?<eos> Would you like to see him?<eos> The only way is to bring Saburo here.<eos> Maybe he can talk sense to him.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> Take good care of him.<eos> Lady Kaede leads you by the nose.
We need to retrench, not attack.<eos> Lady Kaede awaits Lord Jiro to celebrate his departure for battle.<eos> A warlord doesn't run to his woman.<eos> Stay away.<eos> When the enemy is assembled, we can go after his lordship.<eos> Be patient.<eos> Rest the horses!<eos> Dismount!<eos> Weakling!<eos> Kurogane has swayed you again.
I serve you, but never her!<eos> Fox-devil!<eos> Your scheming destroyed the house of Ichimonji!<eos> Such is the vanity of woman!<eos> Vanity, you say?<eos> I wanted to avenge my family!<eos> I wanted this castle to burn!<eos> I have done all I set out to do.<eos> My Lord, prepare to die.<eos> I, Kurogane, will follow you.
- I think it's wrong.<eos> - No. It's never been more right.<eos> You're a great fighter, but you've been retired five years.<eos> Isn't it time to start thinking about something else?<eos> How much can you take?<eos> Either of you?<eos> I'll... get the coffee.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> I just care about you both. I...
The Stuff will be coming down earlier tonight.<eos> It's been coming down right after sunset every night this week.<eos> Units three and four, be ready to proceed to the quarry at 8pm.<eos> Units five and six should be ready to move out at 9:15pm.<eos> All personnel are restricted to the factory grounds until morning.<eos> No passes are valid.<eos> You had a long flight and all. - You both must be tired.<eos> - No, we're not tired...<eos> We've made arrangements for a motel for you nearby.<eos> We'll get you in the morning for breakfast and bring you back here.
- Good.<eos> He talks straight.<eos> That was for your benefit.<eos> Taber's CIA.<eos> - Is it all right to talk in front of your son?<eos> - I know everything, I think.<eos> That's more than I know.<eos> My God, what has it been? 15 years?<eos> And then some.<eos> As I remember, Lily invited you to a party and you didn't show.
Or you can stay and die.<eos> Choice is yours.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Beg your pardon.<eos> You have a lovely home.<eos> Terribly sorry.<eos> Call me. We'll have lunch.<eos> Can we keep this between us?<eos> I'd hate to lose my teaching job.<eos> God bless you.
Come on, you wrecked the fucking road.<eos> - I can't take this up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Just give it a shot.<eos> - Look.<eos> - No look. You look.<eos> - It takes half hour to take back.<eos> It happens sometimes.<eos> Do nothing.<eos> I asked you to move this horse.
Get Laura Wong.<eos> Get the close-up. Come on.<eos> - That's the daughter.<eos> - You people...<eos> Hey! Don't touch the camera!<eos> (in Chinese) Get rid of the camera!<eos> The camera is none of your business!<eos> Go away!<eos> (in English) Enough!<eos> What'd I tell you before?
- What about their civil rights?<eos> - Fuck their civil rights!<eos> I want the honchos around here to go apeshit.<eos> I want to disrupt the entire commerce of Chinatown.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> I want chaos.<eos> You know, you people, you're starting to look like the Chicago Cubs.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> You look like you already lost.<eos> The world has fucked you over, so now you don't give a shit.
- Come and look.<eos> No, it wasn't me.<eos> Sit down.<eos> We'II be a while yet.<eos> Did you know what it means to read these things?<eos> No.<eos> Did your liberal friends advise you to read these books?<eos> I have friends of all creeds... and I don't think you need be a liberal to read.<eos> These are forbidden texts!<eos> Did the priest Garcia de Ia Serrana encourage you to read them?
- Were you lovers?<eos> - No.<eos> No!<eos> Are you saying that between a young widow and a married man...<eos> - there can only be friendship?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I am innocent.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Was that which you call friendship not really... a unión in favour of the liberals?<eos> Did that idea unite you while you lived in sin?
You don't.<eos> Don't help them.<eos> - If you want them, they're yours.<eos> - In exchange for what?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - You're a liar.<eos> None of my friends give me anything... unless I give them something.<eos> Of course, you're right.<eos> No one gives anything for nothing.<eos> I'II give you them, and you say if Captain Sotomayor has visited you.
Why must I submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?<eos> Because His Majesty wishes it.<eos> Is the emperor angry with me?<eos> - Quite the contrary.<eos> - Then why not appoint me to the post?<eos> You are not the only composer in Vienna.<eos> No.<eos> But I'm the best.<eos> Mozart.<eos> A little modesty might suit you better.
- Frau Mozart?<eos> - I've come on behalf of my husband.<eos> I brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment.<eos> How charming, but why did he not come himself?<eos> Well, he's terribly busy, sir.<eos> I understand.<eos> I will look at them the moment I can.<eos> It will be an honor.<eos> Please give him my warmest regards.<eos> Would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?
Of course not.<eos> I have to tell you.<eos> Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.<eos> Really?<eos> One of my own pupils, a very young singer Maria Theresa Paradis told me she was...<eos> Well...<eos> Well, what?<eos> Molested, Majesty.<eos> Twice, in the course of the same lesson.<eos> There is a Herr Mozart waiting for you in the salon.
You're not to work on this ever again.<eos> I've decided.<eos> This is not his handwriting.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I was assisting him.<eos> He's not to work on this anymore.<eos> - It's making him ill.<eos> - But...<eos> Good night.<eos> I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri.
Time for the water closet.<eos> Then we have your favorite breakfast.<eos> Sugar rolls.<eos> He loves those.<eos> Fresh sugar rolls.<eos> I will speak for you, Father.<eos> I speak for all mediocrities in the world.<eos> I am their champion.<eos> I am their patron saint.<eos> Mediocrities everywhere I absolve you.
..is that so?<eos> Was I imprisoned just because they made me believe in the system and you're free because you don't believe in the system?<eos> -Oh you, motherfuckers, what does that mean?<eos> -Does it mean I was a fool my whole life?<eos> That I worked against my own principles, always on the wrong side...<eos> Is that it?<eos> Was I imprisoned just because I shouted "Long live Stalin and World revolution"?<eos> -Is that why you imprisoned me?<eos> What was I suppose to shout "Long live capitalism"?<eos> -Listen to me, Stalin killed you... ..but not enough, obviously, I kept his..
- Tina, we didn't think you were coming.<eos> - Hi, guys.<eos> You look handsome!<eos> Yeah, well, I had a change in plans.<eos> Great.<eos> OK, the party can begin.<eos> - Can we help you, sir?<eos> - I'm with Tina.<eos> I'm a friend of Tina's.<eos> God bless you.
Shit, shit and more shit!<eos> I'm sure they'd sooner make him drop dead than let me beat him.<eos> What you want is to be world champion.<eos> But I play to make them crazy, those bastards!<eos> How is he?<eos> He's sleeping.<eos> I couldn't come back until tomorrow evening.<eos> Let's go in.<eos> Excuse me, Akiva Israelovitch.<eos> This is Dr. Randelier. We'd like him to examine you.
Certainly...<eos> Certainly...<eos> Who?<eos> The landowner<eos> Don't move<eos> Since when did they hide at your place?<eos> Did they mention where they were going?<eos> Say something!<eos> Did they head for Taipei for Big Head's sister?<eos> Did they threaten you?
- Careful, guys.<eos> - It'll be broken by dinner.<eos> Try to keep all the pieces together, OK?<eos> So I don't have to look for them.<eos> I just have to put this one on.<eos> Is that the right one?<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Open it up.<eos> - No, you're not right!<eos> - What did I just tell you?
People are calling.<eos> They're over at the library.<eos> Roger, Eleanor, what are you doing?<eos> We decided these books are influences our children don't need.<eos> On whose authority?<eos> - You agreed this is garbage!<eos> - Wait!<eos> Listen!<eos> When did you all decide to sit in judgment?<eos> Who elected all of you as the saviours of everybody's souls in Bomont?
But if I see it again I'll be back.<eos> What?<eos> It was a cat!<eos> Look, can we talk later? OK?<eos> I know what I saw!<eos> Honey, really, sometimes we get frightened...<eos> Please, excuse us.<eos> It's only Sparky.<eos> What do you mean "only Sparky"?<eos> I explained everything to you.
Dad, is it possible that the coffee is bad?<eos> You put something into the coffee, didn't you?<eos> What?<eos> That's wrong.<eos> You said, so we get a leveled head, but my head feels muzzy now.<eos> I had such a weird feeling all the time.<eos> What are you planning, dear?<eos> You locked us all up in here and now u want to murder us.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm afraid it's about time, that I am forced to, honestly tell you something concerning you.
Good.<eos> I'm afraid it's about time, that I am forced to, honestly tell you something concerning you.<eos> If possible, I will end this without ruffle or excitement.<eos> But I'm sadly afraid... it won't work.<eos> You force me to be stumpy.<eos> You all are terrible sick!<eos> Totally mentally impaired!<eos> But you don't notice that.<eos> And this symptom has developed that far, that there no-one can help you.<eos> I noticed the sickness you have already several years ago and nursed you my way.
Then you really put something into the coffee?<eos> But that can't be.<eos> So you poisoned...<eos> Yes. That's right.<eos> The ant poison is in the coffee.<eos> Now I want to die with you too.<eos> So take the mugs, please close your eyes and drink everything at once!<eos> When you have drunk this, you'll finally be freed.<eos> This is my last therapy for you.<eos> After I stood by you I will follow you instantaneous.
I think we should take the black one, definitely.<eos> He'll go very well with the new wallpaper.<eos> As far as the others are concerned, I don't think it really matters.<eos> Then, I suppose we'll take... this one.<eos> He's certainly not the biggest or the best... but that won't matter in the sewage plant.<eos> That's true.<eos> Excellent, then.<eos> If you'll step this way, I'll give you the service manuals and contract forms.<eos> This way, Your Highness.<eos> The Princess will explain later why she saved you.
- No, not my head.<eos> - Then your hands, perhaps?<eos> It wasn't my hands, it was my...<eos> - My misunderstanding.<eos> - Exactly what we have here.<eos> I have heard the evil stories of the Thuggee cult.<eos> I thought they were told to frighten children.<eos> Later I learnt the Thuggee cult was once real and did unspeakable things.<eos> I'm ashamed of what happened here so long ago, and I assure you this will never happen again in my kingdom.<eos> Have I offended you?
I don't know.<eos> I don't know if this is such a hot idea?<eos> He didn't seem too enthusiastic about my park.<eos> I'm sure he thinks i'm crazy as a bed-bug.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I'm gonna get these little guys some water, cool 'em off a little bit.<eos> It's a plenty hot day.<eos> Come on, oh i'm gonna show you something nice, come on.<eos> I'm gonna show you something you haven't seen.<eos> Gonna take you up to the high country.
-I wish only to play music.<eos> -You'll get your chance.<eos> -So will you.<eos> Do you know how difficult it is to get a job in celestial mechanics and astrophysics?<eos> Boy, you speak English well.<eos> In a couple of minutes, we will take a break.<eos> Maybe we pick up cheeseburger, side of fries, and Coca-Cola.<eos> "Dearest parents, dear Sasha, and beloved Grandfather:<eos> "I don't know if you'll ever receive this letter...<eos> "...but I will write to you every week.
USE ONE OF OUR ROOMS ON THE NINTH FLOOR.<eos> THEN, WHEN WE MEET AGAIN, WE CAN TALK ABOUT YOUR REACTIONS TO WHAT YOU SEE, AND WHAT YOU THINK OF THE WAY YOU'RE BEHAVING.<eos> OKAY?<eos> GOOD.<eos> -IS THAT S YSTEM HOOKED UP TO A...<eos> A S YNCHRONIZING GENERATOR?<eos> -YES.<eos> NOW...<eos> GOOD.<eos> COULD SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT'S BROUGHT YOU HERE?
- Now they can see us.<eos> - Now we can see you.<eos> - Clasp your hands behind your heads.<eos> Stand out in the middle of the room. Stand back to back.<eos> Do not touch one another.<eos> - The house is surrounded.<eos> - The house is surrounded.<eos> - I suppose we may as well say goodbye.<eos> - You may as well say goodbye.<eos> While we're on the subject, here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head.
Are you all right?<eos> God, I miss my husband.<eos> Lord, I can't hardly see my hand in front of my face.<eos> Feels like rain.<eos> - Must be coming up a real storm.<eos> - Sure is.<eos> Help me wash dishes.<eos> Now don't be mad, baby.<eos> You're a good baby.<eos> I made each of you some cookies too.
Who'd you rather have out?<eos> Is that true, Blankes?<eos> Did Mahoney start it?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Mahoney started it.<eos> Then, Mahoney, my little pissant... you are out of the academy forever.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> And get out.<eos> Too bad, so sad, bye-bye.<eos> Does the radio bother you?
I'm really beat.<eos> If I could use your shower, I'd like to lay down for an hour.<eos> Shower?<eos> You can hose off under the tank if you like. There you go, Bill.<eos> This is your bunk here, mate.<eos> Nice and soft, eh?<eos> That's a good one for you.<eos> You can punch a few Zs away there, mate.<eos> Do you want a rum?<eos> 'I knew you'd be a fun group when I saw you with the whoopee cushions.'
I would like to add that the Professors last experiment, freezing a chimp for six months, was a complete success.<eos> Excuse me, unfreezing.<eos> Now, allow me introduce, Mr. Albert Starski - and Mr. Maximilian...<eos> ...Paradys.<eos> These two handsome and brave men will soon be locked in containers, not unlike 21 st century sarcophagi.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> These are hibernators and not sarcophagi.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And in three years, they will wake up as living proof of the victory of the human mind over nature.<eos> What drew you to this freezing experiment, gentlemen?
I'm warning you, you could be restrained.<eos> And I'm warning that I was boxing champion!<eos> Clown!<eos> Lets have some music.<eos> May I?<eos> Don't get any closer!<eos> JESUS!<eos> I'm not aggressive.<eos> Don't do that again.<eos> Or well have to put you to sleep.
-Like it?<eos> -Falkor, it's wonderful.<eos> Falkor, it's like the Nothing never was.<eos> Atreyu and Artax!<eos> What would you like to wish for next?<eos> Look, there they are. It's a monster!<eos> Get them, Falkor!<eos> Let's see how you like it, chickens.<eos> Down here.<eos> We're going to get you!
Oh brother. Looks like we'll be staying here again tonight.<eos> We've got a real manpower shortage here! No wonder, considering how unpopular Ataru is.<eos> HEY! You guys still goofing around?<eos> ! When in the hell is your shop gonna be ready, morons?<eos> So don't goof around, work!<eos> Got it?<eos> Hey!<eos> We have tons of things to do before tomorrow's opening!<eos> So quit screwing around, and get...!<eos> What's wrong with you?
What?<eos> The School Festival's big theme is management by the students themselves!<eos> You think you can trample on that and get away with it?<eos> Hey, Onsen! You're gonna regret this!<eos> At daybreak, we'll file a complaint with the Festival Committee and see that you get nailed for this!<eos> Right on! Ok, fine, fine. Go right ahead.<eos> That is, if you still remember this tomorrow. You saying we'll forget?<eos> - How can I go home looking like this?<eos> - Just wait! You're gonna get yours!<eos> Miss Lum, Miss Shinobu, let me take you home in my car.
L would like to say a few humble words to you.<eos> Thank you for honoring my brother by coming.<eos> L am very grateful for that.<eos> And thank you for your many gifts which would have... pleased the deceased.<eos> He was born in Hokkaido, but in the harsh postwar days... we moved to Mikawa where we struggled together as brothers.<eos> In the end, fate willed that he live here in Izu.<eos> And thank s to you his last years were full and happy.<eos> But despite everything, it became his fate to die here.<eos> So today we are here to say goodbye to him.<eos> On his behalf let me thank you for all you have done.
Oh mommy.<eos> - Oh darling, it's all right now.<eos> Mommy's here. - Go to the aid station.<eos> We'll give her a sedative.<eos> - Oh, rip, I called her Suzy. - What?<eos> - I kept running and running towards that light.<eos> It kept moving further and further away from me.<eos> It was a nightmare.<eos> - With a happy ending-<eos> I'll have one of my men take you down to the aid station.
If you only knew how much this dinner's costing me.<eos> No one really cares about your dinner.<eos> - I do.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I had to bear mockery from your friends for three years.<eos> It's my turn now to laugh at them.<eos> If you plan to start an argument, Larissa and I won't come.<eos> Please, don't offend anyone.<eos> There'll be no arguments.<eos> I will just propose a toast in your honor and thank you publicly for the happiness you're giving me by choosing me as your husband, for your appreciation of me and for believing in my sincerity.
The deceased had been thrice dug up from his grave.<eos> Three times!<eos> It is an indisputable fact that the motive was not robbery:<eos> the valuables buried with the deceased had not been touched.<eos> What was it then? What was the motive of the crime?<eos> I tried to talk to the defendant, but she refused to speak.<eos> Therefore, we'll have to conduct both a hearing and an investigation, and, certainly, pass the verdict, right here.<eos> That's why I ask this court to listen carefully to the defendant.<eos> The defendant may speak.<eos> Of course, all of you wonder why I'm persecuting the deceased.
I'm surprised at the superficiality of my colleague's reasoning.<eos> "Can the defendant develop a delirious idea?"<eos> he poses an unexpected question.<eos> And he answers it himself: "She certainly can."<eos> He paints the picture of a person possessed by delirious ideas, about whom it is written clearly: "She is not mentally ill."<eos> I hope my colleague will excuse me, but such perfunctoryjudgement of the fate of a long-suffering person is a patent sacrilege.<eos> The severe mental trauma, the abnormal living conditions had affected the defendant's health and, as the psychiatrists say, deformed her personality.<eos> But her vengeance is not the result of a decision nurtured for years, but a temporary insanity, not psychosis but a reaction of protest!<eos> Your Honor! The members of the jury!<eos> I'm not asking for your leniency, I plead with you to take into consideration all the aforesaid and, based on this, pass on the defendant the verdict of 'not guilty'.
But it may ease your mind.<eos> Then I'll ask him if he's starving and freezing.<eos> You won't touch the telephone if you're going to ask that.<eos> Look at the cake!<eos> It's Anton to the life.<eos> My call to Propaganda Company 421 Sector Sebastopol-Krimskaya.<eos> I am ready to take the call.<eos> Yes, it's the proxy marriage.<eos> Please ring us back. Fine, we are waiting.<eos> I'm going to church to pray Our Lord to bless you.
Don't tie me up!<eos> I won't stir.<eos> I promise.<eos> Oh, she never did so before.<eos> No, but it was always in her.<eos> I've said so to missus before and missus agreed with me.<eos> Oh, she's an under-hand little thing.<eos> You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed.<eos> If she were to turn you out, you'd have to go to poor house.<eos> You'her dear dead husband to ponly took you in because he was your mother's brother.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Aunt reed, please.. aunt reed, please...<eos> Good morning, Miss Eyre.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Well, who am I?<eos> Mr. Lloyd, the physician.<eos> I... I was in that room.<eos> Missus said I could let you out. You were that quiet.<eos> I thought you were dead when I saw you.
She flew at me like a wildcat.<eos> Don't talk to me about her, John.<eos> I told you not to go near her.<eos> She's not worthy of notice.<eos> I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her.<eos> They are not fit to associate with me!<eos> Why, you... come here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't you dare rise from that place or utter one syllable for the rest of the day.<eos> What would uncle Reed say to you if he were alive?
Rosamund a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle.<eos> A missionary's wife?<eos> No.<eos> But you might not be a missionary.<eos> You might relinquish the scheme.<eos> Relinquish my vocation?<eos> My foundation on earth for a mansion in heaven? Never.<eos> It is dearer than the blood in my veins.<eos> And Miss Oliver?<eos> Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?
Don't pronounce an opinion on him.<eos> Very well. Your uncle having died,<eos> Mr. Briggs could not trace the heiress.<eos> Where is Mr. Briggs now?<eos> He may perhaps know more of Mr. Rochester than you do.<eos> Briggs is in London.<eos> I should doubt his knowing anything at all about Mr. Rochester.<eos> It is not in Mr. Rochester that he is interested.<eos> You forget essential points in pursuing trifles.<eos> You do not enquire why Briggs has sought after you, what his interest was in you.
You forget essential points in pursuing trifles.<eos> You do not enquire why Briggs has sought after you, what his interest was in you.<eos> Well, what did he want?<eos> Merely to inform you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira has died, that he has left you all his property and that you are rich.<eos> An heiress.<eos> I, an heiress?<eos> Your uncle left you £20,000.<eos> I shall leave you for a while.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Mr. Rivers, when first Mr. Briggs wrote to you, you were disinherited in favour of another relative.
The other brother was a poor clergyman who died, as his wife did, many years ago.<eos> I know your whole story.<eos> Then your mother is my father's sister.<eos> Undeniably.<eos> -We are cousins! -Yes.<eos> We are cousins.<eos> Oh, I'm glad.<eos> I am glad!<eos> You are an odd girl.<eos> You remained quite serious when I told you you had got a fortune.
Is anybody there?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Is that the lady from the coach?<eos> I am here.<eos> What has happened?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You was in such a rare state, ma'am.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> I was coming this way, so I thought I'd take a look at the poor old hall.<eos> I thought you might like me to take you back to the inn.
I'm an independent woman now.<eos> An uncle in Madeira died and left me £5,000.<eos> What, Janet?<eos> You're an independent woman?<eos> A rich woman?<eos> A free woman?<eos> Quite rich.<eos> Enough to build a house close by where you can come and sit in my parlour when you need company of an evening.<eos> Ah, you're rich, Jane.<eos> You have now no doubt friends who will not suffer you to devote yourself to a lame, blind wreck.
Why?<eos> I have been wrongly accused, ma'am, and everybody now will think me wicked.<eos> We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.<eos> Tell me, the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress is Mrs. Reed, your uncle's wife?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> He is dead and she didn't want me, but all the servants knew...<eos> Helen has told me your story, my dear, as you told it to her.<eos> - Is all that true?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Did she tell you about the red room?
Well, Jane, I know that you will work harder than ever to prove your merit.<eos> I will, Miss Temple.<eos> I would not leave Lowood now for Gateshead and all its luxuries.<eos> It was typhus.<eos> Overcrowding, lack of sanitation, semi-starvation, and previously neglected illnesses had made most of the pupils an easy prey to the deadly fever.<eos> Teachers helped those girls to pack friends or relatives able and willing to take them away from the seat of contagion.<eos> Many went home only to die.<eos> Driver.<eos> Some died at the school and were buried quickly and quietly.<eos> Miss Temple is waiting for you in the sick room.
Nor ever had, I suppose.<eos> Do you remember them?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I thought not.<eos> So, you were out waiting for your people in that lane.<eos> For whom, sir?<eos> For the men in green.<eos> The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago.<eos> The moon will never shine on their revels more.<eos> Who recommended you to come here?
You're dumb, Miss Eyre?<eos> Stubborn?<eos> Ah, I put my request in an absurd, almost insolent form.<eos> Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon.<eos> The fact is, once and for all, I do not wish to treat you like an inferior.<eos> I speak merely with 20 years more of age.<eos> And a century more of experience.<eos> Now, have the goodness to talk to me a little.<eos> Divert my thoughts which are... which are galled with dwelling on one point.<eos> I am willing to amuse you if I can, sir, but how do I know what will interest you?
What?<eos> Are you quitting me already?<eos> And in that way?<eos> You said I might go, sir.<eos> At least shake hands.<eos> You've saved my life.<eos> I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt.<eos> There is no debt or obligation in the case, sir.<eos> Oh, I knew you would do me good in some way, at some time.<eos> I saw it in your eyes the first time I beheld you.
Would that be wrong, Jane?<eos> Now, Jane, I'll put a case to you.<eos> Suppose you were no longer ago but a wild boy indulged in childhood.<eos> Imagine yourself in a remote foreign land.<eos> Conceive that there you commit a capital error, never mind what, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and taint every hour of your existence.<eos> An error?<eos> An error, not a crime.<eos> No shedding of blood or any other guilty act. I speak of error.<eos> Now, in time, the consequences of what you have done become utterly insupportable.<eos> Hope has quitted you.
I'm no elf, sir.<eos> Truant!<eos> Absent from me a whole month.<eos> And forgetting me quite, I'm sure.<eos> I thought you were in London, sir.<eos> I suppose you found that out by second sight.<eos> But I'm back.<eos> I had a letter from Mrs. Fairfax.<eos> Stay still.<eos> And did she inform you of what I went to do?
Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I do not wish to grieve you.<eos> But you are so young and so little acquainted with men.<eos> I wish to put you on your guard.<eos> Against what, Mrs. Fairfax?<eos> In this case, I do fear that there may be something found different to what either you or I expect.<eos> Why?<eos> Am I monster?<eos> Is it impossible that Mr. Rochester should have a sincere affection for me?<eos> No, I daresay he is fond of you, but gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their governesses.
Good afternoon.<eos> Is this the parsonage? Aye.<eos> Is the clergyman in?<eos> Nay.<eos> Will he be home soon?<eos> Nay. His father's died and he'll most likely be away a fortnight or even more.<eos> Is there a lady of the house? Nay.<eos> I keep house here and I've nowt for charity.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me for disturbing you but is a servant wanted here, please?
Oh, at least you're eating and drinking better.<eos> Can you sit up?<eos> Only just.<eos> how long have I been here?<eos> You've not been out of this bed for 3 days, and tonight makes 4 nights.<eos> I would get up if I had the strength.<eos> And I have nothing to wear.<eos> My clothes are ruined.<eos> One thing at a time.<eos> Lie back now and sleep, like Miss Diana told you.
Help!<eos> Help!<eos> 0h, my God, help us!<eos> They've dropped off!<eos> Damn!<eos> They must have gone down the secret passage to the nunnery.<eos> Sisters, three men came in.<eos> Which way did they go?<eos> (Falsetto) 0h, I think they went that way.<eos> God bless you!
- Can you imagine the power?<eos> - It's ours, all ours!<eos> - What?<eos> - Yours, all yours!<eos> Ah, Edmund, there you are.<eos> It's early, but I'd like to sort out these battle averages.<eos> - Um... no one.<eos> no one!<eos> Oh, dear. I'll put you down for a duck, then.<eos> I'm afraid that takes you out of the running
(Low voice) Brilliant.<eos> Quite, quite brilliant.<eos> I thought it was good.<eos> I'm hoping to squeeze in a banana by the end.<eos> Willkommen... (Fanfare) My Lord, this is it.<eos> Mother, for Chrissakes, what do you want?<eos> Oh!<eos> Nothing, nothing.<eos> It's working, it's working!<eos> - I embrace and love you utterly.
How you doing?<eos> Don't have to be in such a good mood.<eos> Look what I found in Alex's papers.<eos> I will be in Detroit sometime on this deal... and I'm just dying to meet your boys.<eos> I'd love it.<eos> - You're all welcome in New York.<eos> - Great!<eos> Not in my apartment, you understand.<eos> But in the city.<eos> I'll accompany you anywhere, even to Elaine's.
- l think you should do that.<eos> That is it.<eos> I am getting the fuck out of here.<eos> - Arnie, what kind of language...<eos> - What did you say?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Look.<eos> You wanted me in college and I am there.<eos> You wanted me in chess club instead of the band. I am there too.<eos> I have never embarrassed you in front of your bridge club or landed in jail.
We're here to see Dr. Pendleton.<eos> Have you got an appointment?<eos> He's expecting us.<eos> Your name?<eos> Stryker.<eos> There's a Mr. Stryker and a lady to see Dr. Pendleton.<eos> Do you know who that lady is?<eos> That's Samantha Sherwood, you know?<eos> Yeah, I knew that.<eos> Uh, the doctor will see you right away.
The marriage is my choice.<eos> If it were anyone but Turold's son.<eos> Colwyn is a great fighter.<eos> Good fighters make bad husbands.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Horsemen approaching!<eos> Open the gate!<eos> We sent to you for help.<eos> None came.<eos> Twenty men were despatched to you.
Let's go dancing?<eos> Where?<eos> - There's nowhere to go.<eos> The Casino!<eos> It's awful.<eos> Doesn't matter!<eos> We'll have fun together.<eos> I'm going home!<eos> Pierre, don't!<eos> OK, but I warned you.
'Cause he see the people, come back like this.<eos> How's our baby?<eos> How you doin'?<eos> I'm happy to be here in New Orleans. I really am.<eos> This is a beautiful theater.<eos> What? Well, thank you.<eos> Thank you, baby.<eos> Going to- - You gonna out-drunk each other?<eos> Sho' you right.<eos> I love you too. I love you back.
The bad news is the entire program's probably going to be scrapped.<eos> From now on, the astronaut boys in Houston have got the only ticket.<eos> Barring, of course, some unforeseen event.<eos> The Russians set a new record of 114,000 feet going straight off the ground.<eos> Nobody cares about that kind of record anymore.<eos> All they want now is capsules up in outer space.<eos> I get a feeling this plane might be able to beat that Russian record.<eos> You might be right.<eos> And here they come!<eos> Looky here what I brought you!
Lana was hungry.<eos> She wanted to go out for a bite.<eos> She wanted to make love on a real train.<eos> Who was I to say no?<eos> I thought no one was going to be here.<eos> Be patient.<eos> Hi.<eos> They stole the goddamn house, Lana!<eos> I'm not here right now.<eos> But if you'll leave your name and number I'll call you back as soon as possible.
That's up to Frank, not you!<eos> I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.<eos> No, it is all right.<eos> You're right.<eos> Maybe you should talk to Frank.<eos> Well, good.<eos> I don't think it's something I want to do on an overseas phone.<eos> But as soon as I get back to Miami, I will talk to Frank personally.<eos> Good.<eos> My associates can escort you to my chopper to take you to Santa Cruz.
I got some Valium if you want.<eos> Take aim.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You can all go home.<eos> Thanks for coming. We don't need you.<eos> Send out the vermin!<eos> - This can be settled peacefully.<eos> - No, it can't.<eos> Send him out or we open fire.<eos> What's the matter with you?
O woman, whom I see before me in the night, if you are deceiving me again, woe betide you! Woe!<eos> Ha, how you rave!<eos> Be calm and collected!<eos> I will teach you the sweet delights of revenge!<eos> May the work of revenge be conjured up from the wild night of my breast!<eos> You who are lost in sweet sleep know that disaster awaits you!<eos> Ye heavens, so oft filled with my sad laments, now I must gratefully tell you of the happiness that is mine!<eos> - lt is she!<eos> - Elsa!<eos> He came through you. You smiled on his journey.
And further the King proclaims that the God-sent stranger, whom Elsa wishes to take as her husband, is to be enfeoffed with the land and crown of Brabant.<eos> But the knight does not wish to be called Duke. You shall call him: Protector of Brabant!<eos> Great is the long-awaited man!<eos> Hail to him, hail to him!<eos> Hail to him who was sent by God!<eos> We will faithfully serve the Protector of Brabant!<eos> Now hear what he bids me tell you:<eos> today he celebrates his wedding feast with you;<eos> but tomorrow you shall come here prepared for battle, to serve the King as soldiers;<eos> he himself spurns the sweet pleasures of rest, he will lead you on to enjoy the noble fruits of glory!
Hail, hail to you!<eos> Hail Elsa of Brabant!<eos> Hail to you, Elsa!<eos> May you be blessed as you proceed!<eos> - God be with you!<eos> - Hail to you, virtuous one!<eos> - Hail Elsa of Brabant!<eos> - Hail to you!<eos> Faithfully guided, draw near to where the blessing of love shall preserve you!<eos> Triumphant courage, the reward of love, joins you in faith as the happiest of couples.

Here, there is no time.<eos> We passed beyond time.<eos> There is immortality.<eos> I am 1000 years old.<eos> But I own a physical immortality, not spiritual.<eos> They too will become immortal.<eos> Bring them!<eos> Take them away.<eos> I said take them away!<eos> I told you to take them away!
What affection!<eos> What concern!<eos> What do you fear, my father?<eos> In heaven above, at God's right hand, an angel watches over us.<eos> We are shielded from all harm by my mother's blessed prayers.<eos> No hand will ever pluck or crush this flower so dear to you.<eos> There is someone outside!<eos> Dear God!<eos> Always some new suspicion!<eos> Has anyone ever followed you to church?
Sir, give him to me.<eos> I'll make him talk.<eos> Sir?<eos> We searched all over his car, but we Haven't found any evidence yet.<eos> I think we'd better bring him over to Senyor Manolo.<eos> You have many things to clear up.<eos> OK, bring him along.<eos> After them!<eos> Quick!<eos> MR. X (ON TV): This is my final warning to all of you.
Come with me.<eos> Guard the road and go for the search separately.<eos> Master!<eos> Chase Yes...<eos> Keep guard here!<eos> That way<eos> Run up to the back of the hill and don't turn back.<eos> Don't stop or I will shoot!<eos> Run for it!<eos> Who told you to come in?
Please let me in!<eos> Master!<eos> Master!<eos> Tie him up and take him down hill!<eos> Master, you have saved my life.<eos> And abbot has helped me in reincarnation.<eos> I can't cause disaster to Shao Lin because of me.<eos> Let me have the suffering.<eos> Master!<eos> Sorry for not seeing you off.
The recuperation will be swift.<eos> Your companions have entered the sanctum, they've disturbed the neuronic nucleus, but they will have paid for the incursion with their lives.<eos> Nyssa and Tegan dead?<eos> Well, they're as likely to have been protected as destroyed.<eos> The power works against as well as for you.<eos> I shall soon have total control of the force.<eos> The Tardis key, Doctor.<eos> No, heroics.<eos> Please, gentlemen.<eos> The Master will eliminate you without a second thought.
But surely there's more good than evil in the Xeraphin.<eos> And the good is controlling the power that helped Tegan and Nyssa and is still resisting the Master.<eos> The schismatic affected the Time Lord's intervention.<eos> We are infinitely divided.<eos> Listen carefully, together we must secure the safety of your friends and yourself, and the regeneration of our race.<eos> We'll have to deal with the Master first.<eos> It is possible.<eos> I will explain... (SCREAMING)<eos> I am Zarak, of the race of the Xeraphin.<eos> My brother has misled you, Doctor.
..a chauffeur, a butler....<eos> - And a brown bear.<eos> And a brown bear, indeed!<eos> In five years I spent all my money and Alice's<eos> It's at least 5 or 6 billions, And I'm proud of it!<eos> I'm proud of it!<eos> And then a spider came, who made me young again.<eos> Give way!<eos> Poor bourgeois, tradesmen, Philistine!<eos> For the last time, the Count Mascetti greets you and leaves.
- Of course!<eos> - Take it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Oh!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Enjoy your meal, mr shylock.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> - Friends, mr shylock.<eos> - Who wants to warn you.
You're welcome.<eos> Enjoy your meal, mr shylock.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> - Friends, mr shylock.<eos> - Who wants to warn you.<eos> - About what?<eos> You push people to desperation,.. ..but a downfallen aristocratic, before going to jail,.. ..could do something stupid<eos> Got it!<eos> Mascetti sent you.
- Good night, darling.<eos> - Night, Ivan.<eos> I'm glad you're home.<eos> - I'm glad I'm home too, honeys.<eos> It's easy to come home when I got you guys waiting.<eos> Same for us too.<eos> Listen.<eos> I don't know if I can keep you here, you know, without your mother.<eos> - Don't you want us here?<eos> - I want you. Of course I want you, Deb.
Youunderstandthatifweseparatethe deformity from Duane, it will probably die?<eos> It's better off dead! What kind of life will it have the way it is? - We're talking about your child!<eos> - Child?<eos> Duane is my child, not that other thing!<eos> All I want is Duane to be normal. It's too late to change the other one, just cut Duane from it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know!<eos> The hospital says no, every doctor I've asked says no ...<eos> You two may be my last hope!<eos> I don't know who you are, or where Lifflander found you and I don't care. No questions asked. Just separate them.
Why is that, Leon?<eos> They're just questions, Leon.<eos> In answer to your query, they're written down for me.<eos> It's a test designed to provoke an emotional response.<eos> Shall we continue?<eos> Describe in single words only the good things that come into your mind ... about your mother.<eos> - My mother?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let me tell you about my mother.<eos> A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies.

No doubt in his dreams as well though I've not been well acquainted with his dreams.<eos> With such an excellent relationship as your husband has with his property he surely, having the real thing, does not need a copy.<eos> I do not take well to young men who preen.<eos> Their vanity outweighs their prowess.<eos> Mr. Neville has prowess enough.<eos> Enough to charm where he cannot impress. He can charm and impress the wives of rich men.<eos> That's not so uncommon, Mr. Seymour.<eos> You come with me to Southampton tomorrow. I'll show you how to impress a lady with a good drawing on.<eos> My father's property, Mr. Neville is a little more forward than humble.<eos> Since humility in a building is not antithetical to you perhaps I can prevail on you to draw my father's house?
Since I have taken valuable time to fill this basin with a little water why not share it with me?<eos> You have a curious mole, Mrs. Herbert and it is ideally placed.<eos> Does your gardener catch moles, Mrs. Herbert?<eos> No, he says they are to be encouraged for good luck and the destruction of one's enemies.<eos> They trip up horses, Mrs. Herbert.<eos> You will not persuade Mr. Porringer to persecute them.<eos> A curious man and ideally placed.<eos> Ideally placed for what?<eos> Why for persuading a fine white horse from Southampton to go lame in the leg.<eos> You have nothing to fear from Mr. Porringer, Mr. Neville. He watches you for his own amusement.
Is his pleasure in your encouragement so necessary?<eos> Although Mr. Neville has qualities he is neither as intelligent nor as talented as he thinks.<eos> Both characteristics you have observed from the start, Louis. Though I admit more by prejudice than by observation.<eos> I understand that you will be leaving us tonight, Mr. Neville.<eos> With Mrs. Herbert's permission I will be leaving after the arrival of Mr. Herbert and after he has passed an opinion on the drawings of his house.<eos> If my servant has obtained a vehicle I will be leaving in the morning.<eos> And, of course, Mr. Neville, the sooner the better as you expected me to say.<eos> You Sir, have acquainted me with your opinion on drawing on horticulture, the Roman church, childbearing the place of women in English life, the history and politics of Lubeck, and the training of dogs.<eos> So I am in a fair position to anticipate your opinions to my departure.<eos> Is Radstock to greet you with such devoted hospitality?
Maybe there again Mr. Seymour will be doing you a favour.<eos> What do you mean? By taking away the possibility of your son ever seeing them when you have one, as I'm sure you will.<eos> Why should he not see them?<eos> Because he might perceive the allegorical evidence in them which you might be stubborn enough to deny.<eos> Mr. Neville had no use for allegory and I am unlikely to miss what my son would appreciate.<eos> An allegorical meaning that might involve his mother.<eos> What?<eos> My Wife?<eos> How is that?<eos> It is fancifully imputed that Mr. Neville saw you as a deceived husband.
It would be a pity to destroy them.<eos> You are concerned that posterity will know of your duplicity.<eos> Louis they contain evidence of another kind. A kind more valuable than that seized upon by those titillated by a scandal that smears your honour.<eos> Evidence that Mr. Neville may be cogniscent to the death of my father.<eos> Good morning, Madam.<eos> Mr. Neville.<eos> Good morning, Sir.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Though the summer suddenly seems past and the weather less than good.<eos> What has brought you back to Anstey so soon?
My speech is in no way dependable on your view of fashion.<eos> We all know that in the field of deeds and of talent you in your field are an innovator.<eos> That must be some sort of flattery, Mr. Talmann.<eos> Have your companions also come to flatter?<eos> We have come merely as curious observers, Mr. Neville. To wonder why after so much has happened you return to continue to fix Mr. Herbert's property on paper and chose to draw this particular site?<eos> I might be inclined to answer those questions if I didn't feel that the truthful answers I would give would in no way be of interest to you.<eos> It is our belief, Mr. Neville, that in returning here you are seeking a codicil to your original contract. A codicil of a more permanent nature than the last one. A lasting contract with a widow.<eos> You speak, of course, Mr. Talmann, like a disinherited man. Uninterested in painting or draughtsmanship. Uninterested even in the prospect of the estate you covet from this position.<eos> An ideal site for a memorial, perhaps. Do you think Mr. Herbert would have appreciated the prospect of his estate?<eos> As a landowner yourself, Mr. Seymour I leave you to judge.
The affair is a mystery to me though I have suspicions Mr. Talmann Mr. Seymour, Mr. Noyes. And if they were here, indeed of Mrs. Herbert herself and Mrs. Talmann. Ladies who both after all entered willingly into their contracts.<eos> Is that why, Mr. Neville, you have just abused Mrs. Herbert further?<eos> That was clever.<eos> We now have a contract with you, Mr. Neville and under conditions of our choosing.<eos> The contract concerning our present pleasure has three conditions.<eos> It would be best served when you have removed your finery.<eos> Take off you hat.<eos> My hat has no contractual obligations with anyone.<eos> The contract's first condition and there's no need to write it down for you will never see it, is to cancel your eyes.<eos> Since we have now deprived you of your access to a living this shirt on your back will be of no value to you.
Raoul.<eos> Probably just got in from Guadalajara.<eos> I think it's a good idea.<eos> -What's a good idea?<eos> -Putting in new locks.<eos> We don't want people wandering in when we're bopping perverts.<eos> Look, Mary, our ad's out.<eos> "We do anything."<eos> Well, that's certainly laying it on the line.<eos> "Whatever your sex fantasies, from ordinary to bizarre Carla and Nancy will accommodate you."
Dear friends... dearest Mama... my most beloved wife, Alma... my darling Emilie, more beautiful than ever.<eos> My wonderful children, Petra,<eos> Jenny and Putte, and little Miss Helena Viktoria, lying so peacefully in her bed.<eos> And dear Maj... of whom I'm very fond.<eos> And not forgetting my incomparable brother Carl, and his sweet wife.<eos> My most honored friend,<eos> Isak Jacobi, who has rendered immeasurable service to this family.<eos> Dear Vega and Ester, and you good friends who faithfully help us up the hill of life.<eos> Last, but not least dear and admired, greatly talented and brilliant artists, if I could I would encompass you all in one big embrace and plant a kiss on your brows.<eos> A kiss which, more than words, would tell you of my happiness and love.
You see, this actress started like this:<eos> naked in the river.<eos> Without false shame and disgrace.<eos> And now she is the most popular star of Hollywood, famous Hedy Lamar.<eos> The richest actress in the world of the art of film.<eos> She has two houses with pools, she has five hand made cars.<eos> And she doesn't know what to do with dollars and gold.<eos> But she didn't pretend to be ashamed.<eos> This was what she was doing, you see?<eos> I ask you and beg you for your own good to undress and lie down a bit, and you almost killed me.
where late grandfather left it, you bandit.<eos> Read.<eos> My dear fellows,<eos> The day has come that I have to say good-bye to you, my dearest.<eos> I write this, and my hand is trembling from the sorrow and from the pain<eos> You vagabond!<eos> You chose such a man to falsify!<eos> You said that you don't know where the testament was.<eos> Continue daddy.<eos> My heart loves you all equally, but as the nature prescribes and orders
I was just kidding...<eos> Silence!<eos> We will talk later about that disgrace.<eos> And that is supposed to be the real will?<eos> You have doubts in me?<eos> No, daddy.<eos> Thanks God, I have been living a century and a half in health and work I feel this is the time to die, so I am telling these words in the pen of my friend lawyer Milic because I don't have any trust in you altogether, kids.<eos> I am sorry that you are mine, and not the kids of some enemy of mine.<eos> One who knew you could bear the hell easily.<eos> About my property, and that interests you the most,
Jad, is there anything I can do?<eos> Against the thing, your thought is powerless a feather against a mountain<eos> - That is, unless...<eos> - Unless what?<eos> Unless you can turn your thought against itself and any other thought<eos> If you can become pure denial, pure hate, pure insane fury... Then there's a slim chance that you can annihilate the thing<eos> But you will annihilate yourself at the same time<eos> - I prefer to be destroyed than enslaved<eos> - They're here!<eos> Hurry to the shuttle, and do exactly as I told you
Beth, how about a drink, hm?<eos> - Help you sleep.<eos> - But not in the bar.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To life.<eos> Charlie and I always say that.<eos> Now...<eos> - I owe you an apology.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> For a long time now, I've sold you short, both of you.
What is that?<eos> This is my idea of an ass bandit.<eos> Wait till the girls see you, scrotumhead.<eos> Scrotumhead!<eos> Think that's funny, don't you, boy?<eos> Not all the obstacles that can trip you up are on this base.<eos> Let me tell you something about the local girls.<eos> Ever since there's been a base here, there's been what you'd call the Puget Sound Debs.<eos> The poor girls come across the sound on the ferry every weekend with just one thing in mind, and that's to marry themselves a naval aviator.<eos> A Puget Deb will tell you,
Like pick up a bottle and go to the motel?<eos> Just like that, yeah.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I'll vote for a motel.<eos> My kind of group.<eos> Troy, here they come.<eos> Well!<eos> Make way for the warmongers.<eos> What did you call us?<eos> I called you a warmonger.
Dal, is it you?<eos> How you doing, Mama?<eos> There's only one man in the world with that voice.<eos> Underneath that grizzle, it's his face.<eos> The army told us you were dead.<eos> Son.<eos> Mac, give me a hug.<eos> Hey, where are the girls?<eos> What happened, Ma?<eos> Let me get a jug, and I'll tell you.
The eastern army has been destroyed.<eos> Destroyed?<eos> Father, it's black...<eos> Tavis.<eos> Tavis.<eos> Roust Duncan.<eos> He will ride with me.<eos> The others I leave in your charge.<eos> Take them and escape.<eos> A boat awaits you on the river.
- No sweat.<eos> I play video games better than anybody.<eos> Move out!<eos> You, you come this way.<eos> There's been a mistake. I've gotta see the guy in charge.<eos> You will.<eos> Command Program Sark's carrier is approaching.<eos> He will explain the training procedures.<eos> Greetings.<eos> The Master Control Program has chosen you... to serve your system on the game grid.
Bread.<eos> Now, now...<eos> And you draw bread from the ground...<eos> Amen!<eos> Where God lives, who knows?<eos> Where God lives, lknow.<eos> Where is the open door?<eos> Where does God live?<eos> Is this appropriate?<eos> Think, my dears! I've already told you that she is laying in this house.
You don't know my mom was great, listen to this:<eos> One time she came out of the house for a ride.<eos> And she was OK she was cool she was great.<eos> So she went out with this guy, this really straight guy, they went to this really fancy restaurant.<eos> You know, best in town!<eos> Right? She was doing fine.<eos> And all of a sudden, man, she stood up on the balcony.<eos> She could be right up on the balcony man, and she pulled up her skirt and she looked at all the people and she said:<eos> I'm Jesus Christ, man.<eos> And I baptize you in the name of the son the father and the holly ghost and she pissed on every body.
Consuls, you saw what happened.<eos> Your Keeper was attacked.<eos> Wait!<eos> Do I understand you to imply that one of us here used force against the Keeper?<eos> DOCTOR:<eos> Yes, someone here.<eos> Or someone very near here.<eos> -One of us?<eos> -Against the Keeper?<eos> The Keeper recognised you for what you are, strangers.
Even though we've got the master plans of the Source Manipulator.<eos> You mean there may be a way to short-circuit the security system?<eos> Neman, you carried out my orders?<eos> Yes, Keeper.<eos> The consuls are confined to their quarters.<eos> The residential wing is sealed off.<eos> That is good, very good, because until my power is fully active, I shall depend on you.<eos> -You may count on me, Keeper.<eos> -Excellent.<eos> Let us entrust you with another task.
It's madness.<eos> It's swarming with combat ships.<eos> Stand by ...<eos> Zero. 25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.<eos> Gibraltar.<eos> It's the best chance to get ourselves killed.<eos> When we reach Vigo, you go ashore with the chief.<eos> - But, sir ...<eos> - I've already made the decision.<eos> I've got to find a replacement for the chief. Our agents will smuggle you out of Spain somehow.
All right, hit it.<eos> - Hit it?<eos> - Hit it?<eos> - Freeze, or name your beneficiary.<eos> - Officer, I sincerely hope you're not a Catholic.<eos> - Pay no attention to him.<eos> He's been locked up for six years in that monastery.<eos> He don't know what he's doing.<eos> I don't think both of his paddles are in the water.<eos> Six years is gonna seem like a summer vacation when the state of Missouri gets through with you.
Where is she?<eos> - Where's my girl?<eos> - Who is that?<eos> Where did the giant come from?<eos> Someone stop him!<eos> - There she is!<eos> - Is that your friend, Marianna?<eos> Out of my way!<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'll find you ...
You have no right...<eos> Dzidek, show him your back!<eos> No need to. I've had a bruised back too.<eos> - Not bruised enough!<eos> - What conclusion did you draw?<eos> To sit on your ass?<eos> !<eos> Maciek, calm down!<eos> Look, we're trying to move things here!<eos> They're using you to move things.
We read the constitution... and we knew our activities were completely legal.<eos> But then... then something funny happened.<eos> Maciek asked me to marry him.<eos> Actually, he asked if I'd marry an unemployed worker.<eos> Then the wedding.<eos> I'd never been religious, my parents used to drag me to church.<eos> As long as I lived at home. But with Maciek, I knew that it had to be a church wedding... that it was necessary, essential.<eos> May almighty God grant you his blessings.<eos> May He bless you and your children.<eos> May the Son of God aid you in good days and difficult moments.
All I know is that she woke me up last night.<eos> She seemed hounded. She asked me to pick her up at the station to protect her.<eos> To protect her, you!<eos> We used to be together, a long time ago.<eos> So, why did you contact us, the police?<eos> - What?<eos> - Why did you call the police? !<eos> Because it's too big for me.<eos> Nadia is something from the past. It's the past.<eos> I know nothing. I called you right away.
The British gave him a medal for resistance fighting in the war.<eos> - Yes, but can I meet him?<eos> - I've set it up.<eos> He is waiting for us at the Olympic ice rink.<eos> Signor Kristatos?<eos> - Kristatos, Aris Kristatos.<eos> - Bond, James Bond.<eos> - Would you join me in some gluhwein?<eos> - A very good idea. Thank you.<eos> Well, gentlemen, how can I help you?
- She is, ma'am.<eos> - Well, tell her Mr Charles is here.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Might it be possible for me to see Ernestina?<eos> - Alone?<eos> - But of course, of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Miss!<eos> Miss!<eos> Mr Charles is here, Miss, to see you.
We could have met at my office in the City... but I thought you'd be interested to see this place.<eos> - Indeed I am.<eos> - Mind.<eos> Of course, in a few months we shall be opening depots in Bristol and Liverpool.<eos> I see.<eos> That's the May Queen, in this morning for a carpenter.<eos> Yes, indeed. I recognise, er, Charles... that you bring to Ernestina not only love and protection... but also in time a considerable inheritance.<eos> That is so.<eos> Yes...<eos> Well, I know my daughter loves you.
How banal.<eos> How has she supported herself since her dismissal?<eos> Most pitifully.<eos> I understand...<eos> Miss?<eos> Miss?<eos> Miss Woodruff, would you come in, please?<eos> Mrs Poulteney, this is Miss Woodruff.<eos> I see.<eos> I wish, as the vicar has told you... to take a companion.
It's really not necessary to hide.<eos> No man who cares for his good name can be seen with the scarlet woman of Lyme.<eos> Miss Woodruff... I've heard something of your circumstances.<eos> It cannot be any great pleasure being in Mrs Poulteney's employ.<eos> Why don't you leave Lyme?<eos> I understand you have excellent qualifications.<eos> - I should be happy to make inquiries...<eos> - I cannot leave this place.<eos> But why?<eos> You have no family ties, I believe, that confine you to Dorset.
And I want to hear nothing more about it.<eos> You shan't.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> - Where the devil have you been?<eos> - I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I...<eos> Go and lay out my clothes.<eos> I'm dining at my club.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Can I have a word with you, sir?
Let's think about the West Australians' first attempt to beat the bloody Vics.<eos> Something's gotta be done about that long, thin streak of pelican shit.<eos> Yeah, get him, Bill.<eos> Sort the bastard right out.<eos> All right, men.<eos> You are shortly to be let loose on the local inhabitants... who, you will be surprised to find, don't look at all like you.<eos> A fact of which they are, no doubt, eternally grateful.<eos> First up, beware of the local eggs, which can be distinguished only by their antiquity, the local liquor, which is poisonous,<eos> and for those of you contemplating some horizontal refreshment... Just be warned.<eos> Because those proverbial few moments of pleasure are very likely to leave you with a legacy which is horribly painful, difficult to cure and may get you sent home to face embarrassing questions from girlfriend and or...wife.
I can't take it anymore and also that poor creature is scared.<eos> Why don't you speak?<eos> Are you angry with me?<eos> She's angry because this winter you have come only 3 or 4 times.<eos> My daughter is always sad because she loves you.<eos> She has to love me, I have given you a house!<eos> You've given us a beautiful house, but you never come here.<eos> We are always alone and she is sad for that.<eos> Your mother tells so many lies. At least you are silent, you are more honest than her.<eos> - Mr. Marquis, the Pope's guards are looking for you!
Vic spent $17 on pants and a shirt from Goodwill.<eos> And there's a receipt here for $32... from Mr. Fong's Fast Chow.<eos> Do you want me to call the National Guard now, Daddy?<eos> - Elaine, get the car.<eos> - What for?<eos> Just do as I ask.<eos> Please.<eos> Give me the wallet.<eos> All right, now... I don't want any argument about this.<eos> This is the least I can do after all the trouble I've put you two through.
That's all right, Arthur.<eos> The colonel of the security, Martin, wants to see you.<eos> I'll receive him after dinner or tomorrow.<eos> Your Excellence, tomorrow you have a meeting with the President of the Council.<eos> It'll be a busy day.<eos> Well, in that case, I won't see him at all.<eos> It must be very urgent, your Excellency, he's waited for more than an hour.<eos> They let me wait fifteen years, Arthur, and for the most part, in prison.<eos> One little hour certainly did him no harm.<eos> Gentlemen, his Excellency can see you now.
Mine, next to yours, look like Laurel and Hardy...!<eos> Wow, it's superb like that!<eos> Not at all, it doesn't fit me at all, it's much too tight...<eos> It's very pretty and, what's more, it'll attract guys like flies...<eos> Where were you brought up, in the woods?<eos> There you go!<eos> You see, your T-shirt fits you like a glove!<eos> Hey, Catherine!<eos> Come, come!<eos> Let me introduce you to Lulu and Robert...
Good morning, Mr. Mayor...<eos> Well then...<eos> You didn't want to see Mr. Mayor, eh...?<eos> Ah, you old-timers...<eos> Ooooh...not a dull moment, eh?<eos> Hands on the "apéro", and it's not even noon...!<eos> So this is how old workers while away their retirement!<eos> You'll drink a toast with us, won't you?<eos> That's an offer I can't refuse!<eos> Anyway, Mr. Mayor, what brings you over... no problems, I hope...
You piece of shit... get the hell out!<eos> Ah, I warned them at the municipal council that you would be troublemakers, just to spite us!<eos> If you weren't old and sick, I would have you expropriated!<eos> But don't laugh too soon, Chérasse and Ratinier very soon we'll win!<eos> The bulldozers and the shovels, they'll be roaring in your ears, I guarantee you that!<eos> Out!<eos> Human wrecks...pile of old bones...<eos> Me!<eos> Out?<eos> You'll be happy on Sundays when people will watch you through the fence and will throw you peanuts for fun, old wrecks!
- What did he say?<eos> - He said the black guys... help the white guys.<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> Cut it out!<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey, stupid, look at yourself!<eos> Cut it out!<eos> Cut it out! Cut it out!<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?
It's in the regulations.<eos> If we were in Germany... I would have to make yours.<eos> But we're in Italy, so you've gotta make mine.<eos> It's regulations.<eos> Who's gonna make the beds?<eos> Buona sera, gentlemen.<eos> It is alive.<eos> Welcome to Italy.<eos> We can forget all about the tearful reunion.<eos> There's a couple things I want to get straight with you right off the bat.
We're supposed to be soldiers.<eos> We're not taking hostages.<eos> I want the officers in the administration building.<eos> Let's move out and move the food!<eos> Attention!<eos> I don't ever want to see what I just saw.<eos> We didn't train to go spastic at the first sign of trouble.<eos> Goddamn!<eos> I'm glad the general didn't see that.<eos> These cadets will follow you only if they respect you.
Captain Shawn, escort my...<eos> the sergeant off the base!<eos> - Muster the men in the quad.<eos> - We've pulled together well, haven't we?<eos> - Yes, sir! General Bache would be proud of us.<eos> If he were here, I know he'd tell us to hold out.<eos> To finish what we've started and not to be halfway about anything.<eos> They're saying some of you are being held against your will, you don't want to be here.<eos> Either they're right or we're right.<eos> Nobody's gonna cut you down if you don't believe in what we're doing, or if you're afraid of parents or the cops.
Mother of God, pray for us... the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<eos> Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with Thee.<eos> Blessed art Thou among women. And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<eos> Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.<eos> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.<eos> As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<eos> This program is maintained only by your contributions. This is your program.<eos> At any sacrifice, it must continue.<eos> This is Monsignor Spellacy thanking you for your support and inviting you to be with us daily as we pray the rosary for peace.
- Not at all.<eos> Well, now, if you guys say he's a diabetic, OK.<eos> But if we find out he's drunk, we're gonna book you as accessories.<eos> - He's bombed.<eos> - The son of a bitch does it all the time.<eos> Officer. Excuse me, but I couldn't help but notice what's been happening here.<eos> - And who are you?<eos> - Just a bystander. Brian Schwartz.<eos> Now, I don't know if this is important, but I overheard this poor fellow saying the reason he'd gotten drunk... that his girlfriend broke up with him.<eos> Now, tell me, gentlemen, wouldn't you be likely to toss down a few if the woman you loved turned her back on you?
Stop it!<eos> Go away!<eos> Don't come any closer!<eos> That's enough!<eos> Stop fighting!<eos> How dare you make trouble here?<eos> Over there!<eos> Don't do it again!<eos> Forgive us!<eos> I'm letting you off this time
- No, not yet but I plan to open one as soon as I finish my tour of duty.<eos> Nothing spectacular, you understand.<eos> Just ordinary food... French fries, hamburgers, hot dogs.<eos> I didn't know you were into gourmet food, Sam.<eos> Gourmet food, Jeff!<eos> I think our table's ready.<eos> Now, look, hold it.<eos> Before we start, I'd like to make a little speech.<eos> I want to wish you three guys the safest of journeys.<eos> May God watch over you and protect you on your mission.
Oh, that'd be... all of us?<eos> - Yes.<eos> How's your wife?<eos> - She's fine.<eos> - And you had a child.<eos> - Yes, a daughter.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> They're fine?<eos> They're waiting for us down at the hut.<eos> We've got a great meal waiting for you.
I leave the place to you, so stake your claim!<eos> Try your luck with Mime, your brother.<eos> You'll fare better with his kind.<eos> That others are different<eos> you will find out soon enough!<eos> There he goes striding away, leaving me troubled and mocked.<eos> Laugh yourselves to death, you gang of carefree, pleasure-seeking gods!<eos> I'll see you all perish yet!<eos> As long as the gold gleams in the light I shall wait here to take my chance.<eos> And I will defy you to the end!
Terrible god, spare this dreadful disgrace.<eos> We should share in her shame, which would fall on us too.<eos> Did you not hear what I decreed?<eos> Your disloyal sister is banished from your band.<eos> No longer shall she ride her horse with you through the air.<eos> The flower of her beauty will wither from the maid.<eos> A husband will win her feminine favours.<eos> Henceforth she shall belong to this masterful man, sit and spin by the fire,<eos> the butt and sport of all mockers.<eos> Does her fate appal you?
I presume, that was his card.<eos> Correct.<eos> All of London's criminal world is at his service.<eos> He pays generously.<eos> Once he paid 700 pounds to a servant for a note of 2 sentences.<eos> As a result the head of a family committed suicide and the whole family was ruined.<eos> Come in, he's upstairs.<eos> I imagine you must be quite surprised, Mr. Holmes.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Did the doorman from the "Diogenes" club tell you?
Honesty suffers, I acknowledge but when we have need of men, we must adapt ourselves to them and if we have no other hope of success, it is not after all the fault of the flatterer but the fault of those who wish to be flattered.<eos> Why do you not try also to gain my brother's goodwill in case the servant should betray our secret?<eos> I am afraid I cannot humour them both.<eos> The temper of the father is so different from that of the son.<eos> Rather try your brother yourself. Make use of the love that exists between you to enlist him in our cause.<eos> I leave you, for he's coming.<eos> Speak to him, sound him, and see how far we can trust him.<eos> I fear I shall never have the courage to speak to him of my secret.<eos> I am very glad to find you alone, sister.<eos> I longed to speak to you and to tell you a secret.
Enough on this subject. Let us talk of something else.<eos> I believe they are making signs to one another to pick my pocket.<eos> What do you mean by those signs?<eos> We are hesitating as to who shall speak first for we both have something to tell you.<eos> And I also have something to tell you both.<eos> We wanted to speak to you about marriage, father.<eos> The very thing ... I wish to speak to you about.<eos> Ah! my father!<eos> What is the meaning of that exclamation?<eos> Is it the word or the thing itself that frightens you?
That is something.<eos> Charity, Mr. Simon, demands of us to gratify people whenever we have it in our power.<eos> Evidently.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Mr. Simon talking with your father.<eos> What?<eos> -Your father talking to Simon.<eos> What?<eos> Ah, you are in good time!<eos> But who told you to come here?
The girl is young, you know and young people generally like those who are young like themselves.<eos> I am afraid that a man of my age may not exactly suit her taste and that this may occasion in my family certain complications that would in nowise be pleasant to me.<eos> Oh, how badly you judge her.<eos> This is one more peculiarity of which I had to speak to you.<eos> She has the greatest detestation to all young men and only likes old people.<eos> Does she?<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> I should like you to hear her talk on that subject.<eos> She cannot bear at all the sight of a young man and nothing delights her more than to see a fine old man with a venerable beard.<eos> The oldest are to her the most charming and I warn you beforehand not to make yourself any younger than you are.
But if you wish me to forget your last offence I advise you, above all things, to receive her kindly and to give her the heartiest welcome you can.<eos> I cannot promise you that I am very happy to see her become my stepmother.<eos> I would lie if I said otherwise.<eos> But as to giving her a kind welcome I promise to obey you in that to the very letter.<eos> Be careful you do, at least.<eos> You will see that you have no cause to complain.<eos> You will do wisely.<eos> Good, everybody, let's go...<eos> Valère, help me with this.<eos> Master Jacques, I kept you for the last.
Alas, can you ask me?<eos> Can you not understand the alarms of seeing the instrument of torture to which one is to be tied.<eos> I see very well that Harpagon is not the torture you would embrace and I can judge that the young man you spoke of to me is still in your thoughts.<eos> Frosine, it is a thing I do not wish to deny.<eos> The visits he has paid at our house have left a great impression on my heart.<eos> But do you know who he is?<eos> No, I do not.<eos> All I know is that he is made to be loved.<eos> That if things were left to my choice I would much rather marry him than any other and that he adds to the dread that I have of the husband they want to force upon me.<eos> I fully acknowledge that the senses somewhat clash with the end I propose and that there are certain inconveniences to be endured with such a husband but all that won't last and his death will soon put you in a position to take a more pleasant husband who will make amends for all.
In marriage?<eos> In marriage.<eos> It is true she is not at all to my taste but, to please you, father, I will bring myself to marry her.<eos> I am more reasonable than you think. I don't wish to compel you.<eos> Excuse me! I will make an attempt to love her.<eos> No, no, a marriage cannot be happy where there is no love.<eos> That, my father, will, perhaps, come by and by and it is said that love is often the fruit of marriage.<eos> No, it is not right to risk it on the side of the man.<eos> If you had felt any inclination for her you should have married her instead of me but as it is, I will return to my first intention and marry her myself.<eos> Well, father, since things are so, I had better be frank with you and reveal our secret to you.
If he wants to make you a judge between us, I have no objection and I don't mind referring our quarrel to you.<eos> You do me great honour.<eos> I am in love with a young girl who returns my affection and who receives kindly the offer of my heart but my father takes it into his head to disturb our love by asking her in marriage.<eos> He certainly is wrong.<eos> Is it not shameful for a man of his age to think of marrying?<eos> I ask you if it is right for him to fall in love?<eos> Ought he not now to leave that to younger men?<eos> You are quite right. Let me speak a word or two to him.<eos> Your son is not so extravagant as you think, and is amenable to reason.<eos> He says that he is conscious of the respect he owes you and that he only got angry in the heat of the moment. He will willingly submit to all you wish if you will only promise to treat him more kindly than you do and will give him in marriage a person to his taste.
Gentlemen, you have nothing to do but to talk quietly together.<eos> You are agreed and yet you were on the point of quarrelling.<eos> My poor Master Jacques, I shall be obliged to you all my life.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> You have given me great pleasure and deserve a reward.<eos> I will remember it, I promise you.<eos> I'll kiss your hands.<eos> I beg your pardon, father, for having been angry.<eos> It is nothing.<eos> I assure you that I feel very sorry about it.
Have his throat cut at once have his feet singed put him in boiling water and hang him up to the ceiling.<eos> What!<eos> Him who has robbed me?<eos> I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent me.<eos> This is no longer the question... and you have to speak of something else to this gentleman.<eos> Don't get frightened.<eos> I am not a man to cause any scandal, and matters will be carried on by gentle means.<eos> Is this gentleman coming to supper with you?<eos> You must, in this case, my good man, hide nothing from your master.<eos> Sir, I will show you all I know and will treat you in the best manner I possibly can.

We have other matters to talk about than supper and I want you to tell me what has become of the money which has been stolen from me.<eos> Some money has been stolen from you? Yes.
I will hear nothing, and justice must have its course.<eos> You shall pay me for the blows you gave me.<eos> What a perplexing state of affairs!<eos> You are quite upset, Mr. Harpagon.<eos> Mr. Anselme you see in me the most unfortunate of men and you can never imagine what vexation is connected with the contract you have come to sign.<eos> I am attacked in my property.<eos> I am attacked in my honour and you see there a scoundrel who has violated the most sacred rights who has introduced himself into my house in order to steal my money... and seduce my daughter.<eos> Who ever thought of your money?<eos> They have given each other a promise of marriage.<eos> This insult concerns you, Mr. Anselme and it is you who ought to be plaintiff against him and who ought to prosecute him to the utmost, in order to be revenged.
I'll be going now.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> May I come in?<eos> So this is where Professor Tikhomirov's daughter lives?<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine, thank you.<eos> - May I sit down?<eos> - Please do.<eos> I had a long serious conversation with Rudy.<eos> He never really loved you.
No, we don't work together. Though we're going to live together, I hope.<eos> You mean that you want to marry her?<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you known her for a long time?<eos> Forty-four hours and about twenty-two minutes.<eos> But Mother has always been of the opinion that you have to know a man well to marry him, and that takes time.<eos> Right, to marry a person after only a two-day acquaintance is a very thoughtless act.<eos> It's best to wait about a week.<eos> So you can let me know next Wednesday.<eos> There's a good way for us to get to know one another. I invite you and your mother for a Sunday picnic in the country.
You say this because you are in a group, but one by one...<eos> - Do I have a bad behavior? Yes.<eos> - You are a brave man.<eos> People say he's grumpy because he's not married.<eos> Am I grumpy because not married?<eos> ...<eos> I understand!<eos> You, ''married'' man, you dare to say that?<eos> The marriage ruined your life!<eos> Women have changed you.
Running Water took him to their truck and gave him a shot of Doc's Snake Bite.<eos> I don't know why he can't just do the Great Apache Flaming Arrow Act.<eos> Didn't you tell him to use the gopher snake?<eos> I did, but he's a proud Indian.<eos> The only good Indian is a dead Indian.<eos> Let's go, girl.<eos> How about it?<eos> How about a big hand for Lasso Leonard James?<eos> The greatest rope artist in the West!<eos> And now, ladies and gentlemen... it is my privilege and honor... to present to you this evening... the greatest trick shooter... the fastest draw... the toughest hombre... the one and only Bronco Billy McCoy!
Would somebody tell me what's going on here?<eos> I'll have to call the authorities.<eos> I'm so glad you're alive.<eos> Because I'm going to sue you and your stepmother... and that crooked lawyer of yours for all you've got!<eos> Do you mind telling me what's going on here?<eos> She's my wife!<eos> And I was just beginning to like her.<eos> They look like a herd of buffalo!<eos> Are you patients here at Mineral Wells?<eos> Have the doctors treated you well?
We got ourselves plenty to think about today.<eos> Never mind dwelling about yesterday.<eos> We all gotta get back to the basics at hand.<eos> And that's why I'm standing up here, saying to you convicts straight out, how Rory Poke is gonna run this here prison.<eos> So we won't be wasting any more time misunderstanding each other.<eos> I am a firm believer in discipline.<eos> A convict does his fair share of work and he's not gonna have anything to worry about.<eos> But I know that that ain't been happening around here lately.<eos> And there ain't no crop in no field at no prison that I'm in charge of that's gonna die in the fields.<eos> The trusties will divide you up into work groups.
The best we can... in spite of it.<eos> Here I am!<eos> Two coffees.<eos> - Long ones?<eos> - No, why?<eos> Just wondering.<eos> Are you coming down here or I should I go up there?<eos> Here comes Michele to provide you with all your comforts.<eos> Black coffee, hot milk, cappuccino.<eos> Coffee's the best friend a man ever had, keeps you wide awake, helps you avoid trouble and gives you the strength to live to a ripe old age.
It´s probably theatre business mail.<eos> I´ll take it.<eos> D´you want all his mail?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You´re most welcome.<eos> Room service?<eos> No, I ate at the theatre.<eos> Did the reporter from "Paris Echos" call you ?
A real lynch mob!<eos> So I beat it fast and never looked back!<eos> There are the Boches, the Heinies... the Krauts, the Jerries...<eos> You forgot the buzzards...<eos> That´s right... the buzzards.<eos> Say, that´s my record-player!<eos> It´s not yours, it´s Marion´s. She lent it to me for a party.<eos> They swipe all my props:<eos> when it´s not an armchair, it´s a record-player.<eos> A gentleman is waiting for you.
Dr Dietrich left for the Eastern front.<eos> He was recalled for active duty.<eos> Then, that´s that.<eos> Mrs Steiner, I´d like a word with you.<eos> I´m an admirer of yours...<eos> I am Lieutenant Berger.<eos> About Dr Dietrich...<eos> He´s not on the Eastern front: he shot himself last night.<eos> It´s tragic...<eos> He admired you enormously... and so do I.
- Sure.<eos> No sweat.<eos> - What is going on?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - Who are you people?<eos> - Camp counselors.<eos> Ned is fooling around.<eos> - Right, just...<eos> - Can it, Cochise.<eos> Steve Christy hire you people?
No wonder some people go off the rails a bit.<eos> Does the noise in my head bother you?<eos> No.<eos> Still got that story about the teacher shortage in Botswana?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You gonna use it?<eos> -No. Maybe they can use me.<eos> In the Kalahari, it's always Tuesday, or Thursday if you like.<eos> Or Sunday.<eos> No clocks or calendars tell you to do this or that.
Take me somewhere.<eos> Let's go to the movies. Where's the nearest cinema?<eos> Cinema?<eos> Do you feel like going?<eos> Okay. I'll show you the way.<eos> I'm sorry you found me crying.<eos> It's only human.<eos> Well now, shall we go to the movies?<eos> Yes, that will be best.<eos> Your father hates you.
Ida, what does the good book say?<eos> I know: "Do unto others... as ye would have others do unto ye," right?<eos> Right.<eos> And no animal should ever suffer any unnecessary pain.<eos> There, there now.<eos> None of that.<eos> I have a treat for you.<eos> I had a feeling you boys could get behind this.<eos> Now... as you check out the swirling colors... notice how your heads become more and more mellow.<eos> Each word I say will take you farther and farther... into a radical hypno high!
Well, Elisabeth, you've come back.<eos> You know me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Since I've been living here, my mind is intact.<eos> I no longer forget.<eos> So I know you are Elisabeth.<eos> You disappeared two days ago.<eos> You both look very sad.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Dr. Francis will cure you.
- You can go, Norma.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Good morning, madam.<eos> Your husband called me after your terrible crisis last night.<eos> What happened?<eos> Can't you relax?<eos> Don't you feel loved by him?<eos> You must find serenity...<eos> If the crisis persists...<eos> The Marquis will send you back to the clinic.
Do you want to come with me on my adventures?<eos> Good!<eos> Don't be afraid if I take you along to public restrooms or the baths.
What do you think ?<eos> We should give ourselves up.<eos> You want us to go to jail ?<eos> What do we do ?<eos> She hasn't called yet.<eos> Regarding the bombing in a theater, the police suspect the triads.<eos> Anybody who may have information can call the following number :<eos> K-377777.<eos> I repeat : call K-377777.<eos> The authorities remind you that possession of risky materials such as explosive chemicals, can make you liable to a 24 years penalty.
- Your brother ?<eos> - He's a cop ?<eos> He's never at home.<eos> What about your parents ?<eos> Dead.<eos> Don't you think those mice are funny ?<eos> A quoi tu joues ?<eos> Your brother's a cop.<eos> What's on your mind ?<eos> Do you know that you'll go to jail, if the police finds you ?
"Use both your arms..."<eos> Spin, roll, twist, turn.<eos> The old man wants to teach me something.<eos> I'll try it.<eos> I beg you, have pity.<eos> Spare something for a poor old beggar.<eos> Pity.<eos> Have pity.<eos> Listen to the word of God.<eos> Jesus will save you if you believe in him.
Shall we follow him?<eos> At our place***** No lo entiendo, me suena algo así.<eos> What are you going to do about the damage to my ship?<eos> Mister Dymond.<eos> All I'm concerned to my ship, my crew and 900 passengers.<eos> You're fully covered comprehensive by all third party damage, so you don't worry.<eos> I was involved in a most important survey job when you just came crashing in on me.<eos> Then you tell me not to worry!<eos> What am I going to do for a ship?<eos> The company will compensate you.
-You.<eos> -Do you want to make something of it?<eos> -No. I just want to know what it means.<eos> -It means hairy.<eos> -What do you mean, my lady?<eos> Well, I should have thought that was obvious.<eos> -Hairy, covered with hair.<eos> -No!<eos> What do you mean when you said we were committing suicide?<eos> Well, if this Lady Adrasta, whoever she might be, is going to hunt you down for kidnapping me, what do you think she'll do if she finds out you've killed me?
It's excellent.<eos> - That'll be all.<eos> - What?<eos> Your lambs are getting cold, Mr Johnston.<eos> Colder.<eos> If you'd like them warmed up...<eos> Forget it!<eos> You could get your wife to sit on them.<eos> I'm so sorry, but the rubbish we get in here.<eos> If you'd be so very kind as to fill that form out. Mr And Mrs Hamilton... Ah, yes, we've put you in room 12 which has a charming panoramic view overlooking the lawn.
Form up into two lines<eos> Masks off!<eos> Good morning<eos> - You're fit!<eos> - No, I was late<eos> The exercise has been carried out, Commander<eos> Drop in with Osuch when this is over<eos> Masks on!<eos> If anyone calls, I'm out<eos> I asked you both so you couldn't deny that you own a camera
I've received a few important awards<eos> Worker of Merit, for instance<eos> A watch... they seem to value me<eos> That's it<eos> I like the idea<eos> A man who finds things harder than others<eos> That's how I see it.<eos> But everyone says I'm making fun of a cripple<eos> You're not making fun of anyone<eos> Who funds you?
This is me, Daddy.<eos> This is what you do to me inside.<eos> Go all the way through it, Michelle.<eos> Go all the way through it to the end.<eos> Come out the other end. Don't stop in the middle.<eos> I'm watching you. I'm watching everything you do, Mike.<eos> Oh, Daddy.<eos> Wow. The man is a genius.<eos> The man is a genius.<eos> Dr. Raglan would like to thank you all for coming this afternoon.
But also the Saint of this town is a good Saint.<eos> His name is Maurizio.<eos> As for me, I serve Mass every morning.<eos> At the age of 84, I feel like the most humble of altar-boys.<eos> What is there that has not already been given us?<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> In the name of the Baby Jesus saviour of the world, I give you my blessing.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Wake up, don Carlo!<eos> The carabiniere is looking for you.
What does it mean?<eos> It means that on this day you should have given your pastor a kid, a small goat according to the custom.<eos> But you didn't do it, because you are non-believers.<eos> Because in you there is no goodwill.<eos> Therefore, you won't receive God's blessing.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Think about it.<eos> And bring your pastor that kid.<eos> Pay the debts you owe him since last year, on this land.<eos> If you want the Lord to look upon you with pity and put his hand on your heads, and give peace to your hearts.
At last we are free, dear Zerlina, of that simpleton.<eos> What do you say, my joy, didn't I do well?<eos> - Sir, he is my husband.<eos> - Who?<eos> That man?<eos> Do you think an honest man, a nobleman, which I am proud to be, can bear to see your golden face, your sweet face handled roughly by a lowly boor?<eos> But sir, I promised to marry him.<eos> Such a promise means nothing.<eos> You weren't born to be a peasant.<eos> Another destiny awaits you, thanks to your sparkling eyes, your beautiful lips, those white, scented hands.
Oh, damnation!<eos> I seized on her mistake.<eos> I don't know how, but she recognized me. She screamed. I heard people.<eos> And you tell me this with such indifference?<eos> Why shouldn't I?<eos> Suppose it had been my wife?<eos> Better still!<eos> You shall stop your laughter before dawn.<eos> Who spoke?<eos> Some ghost from the other world, who knows you well.
Is the show over?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I just wanted to kiss you.<eos> AII the doors have two keys.<eos> The spare for my bedroom was in the bedside table.<eos> Now I need an explanation,<eos> Iady-in-waiting, or companion!<eos> I want to know right now who you are and why this chateau is deserted.<eos> We can ask questions, too.<eos> Who is chasing you, and why?
That's good, you're very brave.<eos> Did you really think that I would burn you?<eos> Is that all?<eos> I just wanted to bring you down a bit.<eos> You're too bossy for my taste.<eos> The fifteen minutes are up, it's nearly midnight.<eos> Now, you're ours!<eos> The show's over now.<eos> I don't even want to know the secret behind your little reunion!<eos> Perhaps your position shields you from the murder of a girl like her, but it's not the same for me.
Fine day for a hanging.<eos> Do you really think he'll make it?<eos> - Did you bring the trimmings?<eos> - It's all here.<eos> - Medicine?<eos> - Everything.<eos> - Do you want some cold chicken?<eos> - No.<eos> Willy's the best snakesman there is - but he can't get out of there.<eos> Dearly beloved, wonder not if the world hate you.
What's this fellow Simms up to, eh?<eos> Please, sir, I can't tell you.<eos> Should have thought of that before we caught you with this purse.<eos> I don't want to go back to prison, sir.<eos> Well, then.<eos> Better tell us.<eos> I don't know, sir.<eos> I told you.<eos> All's I know is that he's a cracksman planning a flash pull, he is.<eos> The letter will put you on to him.
Can you imagine!<eos> - Well, me mum, she told me...<eos> - My dear, my dear, my dearest!<eos> What a man you are!<eos> What do you take me for?<eos> Impossible woman.<eos> Robbery indeed.<eos> The very idea!<eos> Arrest that man!<eos> The court thanks you for providing us with so clear an explanation of your manner in committing the crime.
- What? Nobody to serve drinks?<eos> - Not like you did!<eos> Do you have earrings?<eos> - How much?<eos> - A hundred.<eos> It's pure gold.<eos> Too expensive.<eos> We're taking them.<eos> You're giving me earrings?<eos> They really look good on you, Taya.
It's vital I know what they're doing here.<eos> That is precisely what I would like to know, too.<eos> But, Commander, what...<eos> The patrol has found a prisoner.<eos> Yes.<eos> Bring him in at once.<eos> Starship engineer Tyssan.<eos> Serving with the Deep Space Fleet out of the planet Earth.<eos> By my timescale, I was taken captive two years ago, and since then I've been a prisoner of the Daleks.<eos> How long have the Daleks been guarding you?
Then we'll see.<eos> That's curious.<eos> Father Stefani...<eos> Neither I nor my sister were expecting you.<eos> Not today, anyway.<eos> - Who are these two?<eos> - Our niece and nephew, Ann's children.<eos> - Christine and Mark.<eos> - What do they want?<eos> If we're disturbing you, we can leave right now.
I sing to you, God Hymenaeus,<eos> God Hymenaeus, God Hymenaeus!<eos> - Ladies and gentlemen!<eos> A kiss!<eos> - A kiss for the bride!<eos> Your Excellency...<eos> Sergey Petrovich...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen.<eos> You see a happy man now.<eos> God is my witness, howl love you all.
. She's the only... . - (Lamb bleating)<eos> . l know she likes me... .<eos> I think... I think it's laid wrong.<eos> Aye.<eos> - Let's see what we can do now.<eos> I knew something was amiss...<eos> - Hold her steady!<eos> Hold her steady.<eos> Come on, old lady.<eos> T'old lady'll help you, just ask her nicely.
An assistant?<eos> Please, sir, on an assignment like this, I'd much rather work alone.<eos> In my experience, assistants mean trouble.<eos> I have to protect them and show them and teach them.<eos> Couldn't I just...<eos> Couldn't I just manage with K9?<eos> -K9 is a mere machine.<eos> -He's a very sensitive machine!<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> You will find your assistant waiting for you in the Tardis.
Have a drink.<eos> Come on, Barlow, have a drink.<eos> All right.<eos> - What are we drinking to?<eos> - Only to your friends.<eos> To your friends, come hell or high water!<eos> - He's on the wagon.<eos> - Novocaine lives!<eos> My friends, you've come together in this church so the Lord may strengthen your love and Christ blesses this love.<eos> He has consecrated you in baptism and now he strengthens you by a special sacrament so you may assume your duties with mutual and lasting fidelity.
Mrs. Bartowski?<eos> You girls looking for somebody?<eos> I think we just got the wrong house.<eos> No, man.<eos> You didn't get the wrong house, you just got the wrong time.<eos> - We wasn't gonna do nothing.<eos> - Lying son of a bitch!<eos> Wait a minute, man.<eos> Come on, let's talk.<eos> - I want to know who sent you.
Fuck you mean, "No more, brother"?<eos> I want to know who sent you, man.<eos> Gimme a name.<eos> You know he's not gonna walk no more.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Who sent you, man?<eos> - Who the fuck sent you?<eos> - Some union guy, I don't...<eos> What fucking guy?<eos> Who the fuck sent you, man?
- This is Dietrich Hessen, son of Wilhelm Hessen.<eos> - Welcome, young man.<eos> - Wolfgang Kleist.<eos> - I am pleased you are with us.<eos> Thank you, Herr Doctor.<eos> - And Arno Schwimmer.<eos> - A great pleasure, Herr Schwimmer.<eos> And now to business.<eos> Sit down, gentlemen, please.<eos> [ Mengele over radio ] The task before you is the most important operation... that the Kamerads organization has ever undertaken.
Today, young people dress like Indians!<eos> But your children don't help with the work at the store?<eos> No, the poor souls!<eos> They study, going to university.<eos> That is hard work!<eos> You've made a lot of sacrifices, but now you have a lot to be proud of.<eos> - That's right!<eos> - We can't complain.<eos> Romolina goes to the Academy of Fine Arts, Pasquina studies sociology and psychology and Cesare is in his second year at medical school.<eos> - God bless you and keep you!
Some of the men have already expressed their appreciation to me personally.<eos> That's very nice.<eos> I was thinking, Mr Talbot, not of your lending them money, but of paying the bills.<eos> We're gonna cut 'em off, pal.<eos> You know that?<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - I said, we're gonna cut 'em off.<eos> Your balls.<eos> And what exactly do you mean by that crudity, Mr Kovak?<eos> - I mean we're gonna shut you down.
I mean, you and me, we... built this whole thing together.<eos> You're like my brother. You're like my brother.<eos> You're the only guy...<eos> I can't trust nobody.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> Ah, Mr Kovak, welcome.<eos> I'm Peter Jacobs, head of Public Relations.<eos> Nice hand you got there, Peter.<eos> Bernie Marr, my assistant.<eos> Mr Graham is expecting you in his office.
"Department of Dirty Tricks" as the Whitehall chaps call it.<eos> Well, they speak very well of you.<eos> Right.<eos> We need you chaps for something rather special.<eos> I'm afraid it's not exactly a masterpiece... but I wonder if you can identify this fellow.<eos> Think back to Navarone.<eos> I'd rather not, sir.<eos> Nicolai?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let you down a bit, didn't he?
I've often thought that I'd rather like to settle down there some day.<eos> Looks like you're gonna have to change your plans.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Capt. Drazak.<eos> Seventeenth Partisan Regiment.<eos> - Good morning, captain.<eos> - Welcome, welcome!<eos> Thank you, Capt. Drazak.<eos> They frightened you with bandages, huh?
So do I. Right in it.<eos> Do you think he's recognized you?<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> Lt. Col. Barnsby, United States Rangers.<eos> Maj. Mallory, sir.<eos> You got away from the Germans.<eos> How?<eos> We escaped.<eos> Capt. Lescovar has his doubts about that.<eos> If you escaped, why were the Germans not pursuing you?
He's outside.<eos> The bogeyman's outside.<eos> - Look, there's the bogeyman.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I saw the bogeyman.<eos> He's at Lindsey's-- - Oh, Tommy, stop it.<eos> You're scaring Lindsey.<eos> He's over there at--<eos> Tommy, stop it. Now, there's nobody out there.<eos> There's no bogeyman. And if you don't stop all this, I'm gonna turn off the TV and send you to bed.
The effect must be considered in a totally different way.<eos> Otherwise we shall become entangled in the snare set for us.<eos> In this particular case, the thing to be considered is the form of the mirror.<eos> With due care, however, for therein lies another snare.<eos> We must not linger over the significance of this form to the theme.<eos> It is common knowledge, more common within each day, that the crescent moon is a Saracen symbol.<eos> No one can fail to be aware that the presence of so impious a token within the Order is surprising, to say the least.<eos> Today, though they find it difficult to accept, everyone knows that the presence of this token in the Order was, alas, probable.<eos> But this is of no consequence. None of this matters.<eos> What matters is the form itself, the fact that this crescent should be reproduced in another painting which I now invite you to consider.
She'll have a hard time at first, but she'll get over it.<eos> - That's easy for you to say.<eos> - It's not easy.<eos> How long have you know her, Dad?<eos> Now a month.<eos> A month?<eos> Isn't that a little hasty?<eos> We've spent a lot of time together.<eos> That's a lot of time, four weeks?<eos> I expect you all at the wedding.
- Nicholas!<eos> You should be in class.<eos> I've got company!<eos> - I'm going for lobster.<eos> - Great!<eos> Bring me one!<eos> - I want mine with butter.<eos> - Got that, Tom?<eos> So long, turkeys.<eos> Sparky will take you down today.
It's OK.<eos> It's all right.<eos> No.<eos> Tina, Tina...<eos> Tina, it's OK.<eos> - It's still there.<eos> - What is?<eos> What's still there?<eos> Sh-sh-sh-sh... Shark!<eos> That boat will take you in.
- Please hurry!<eos> All right, hold it steady.<eos> Dad!<eos> I'm all right.<eos> Hold on.<eos> All right, take this and I'll get you over.<eos> - All right, tie it on.<eos> - OK.<eos> All right, pull these hooks over with the rope.<eos> Secure them to the raft then I'll pull you back with the winch, OK?
And if I should die there are still others to carry on the Snake Fist!<eos> I'm aware there are two others Pai Chang Tien and your son, still alive today.<eos> That's right.<eos> And just as long as Pai is still alive the Snake Fist will live and rise again.<eos> I'll kill you and Pai Chang Tien!<eos> Where is Pai Chang Tien?<eos> He's too smart for you. You won't find him.<eos> Pai Chang Tien.<eos> Damn it, mosquitoes you'd better go away.<eos> Warned you.
"Use both your arms..."<eos> Spin, roll, twist, turn.<eos> The old man wants to teach me something.<eos> I'll try it.<eos> I beg you, have pity.<eos> Spare something for a poor old beggar.<eos> Pity.<eos> Have pity.<eos> Listen to the word of God.<eos> Jesus will save you if you believe in him.
Is it all right if I bring them down?<eos> Come on, then, though I'll probably get my ears chewed off for this.<eos> Now, Walnut.<eos> - It is Walnut, isn't it?<eos> - No, sir. Hazel.<eos> I knew your mother well.<eos> And your friend?<eos> - My brother, sir.<eos> Fiver. - Well, then.<eos> Now, do tell me how I can help you.
His Majesty desires peace for all his people.<eos> He even made a poem--<eos> Forget poems!<eos> Chamberlain, as I listen to the lmperial envoy, it's evident we samurai are worrying His Majesty.<eos> I believe Prince lemitsu should apologize personally.<eos> Well said.<eos> It's no surprise you're famed for your loyalty.<eos> Your words must carry weight.<eos> - No objection?<eos> Then we'll escort you to Kyoto at once.
This can't be true!<eos> This could never happen.<eos> This is a dream.<eos> This must be only a bad dream.<eos> Everybody, keep calm.<eos> Don't be upset.<eos> Nothing happened. Nothing has happened.<eos> This is a dream.<eos> Yes, this is only a dream.<eos> Don't let these nightmares confuse you.
Master.<eos> He is a Japanese Kendo expert.<eos> And you hold a Chinese sword.<eos> Why don't you see who's better?<eos> I have no such intention.<eos> You're pretty good, lad.<eos> Why don't you take my sword?<eos> You Chinese have no manners.<eos> You Japanese are ill-mannered.<eos> I fear you not, I can fight all of you together.

- But... your vitamins.<eos> - No time!<eos> Now, listen. This is important.<eos> You've got to go down and warn Gretta that there's tomato activity in sector 2.<eos> You got that?<eos> No matter what happens, you tell her. - Yes, sir.<eos> - We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin.<eos> The following is an nbs hotline bulletin with Douglas Keikler in New York.<eos> NBS... the network that brings you the news as it happens, brings you these bulletins in times of emergency, the news you need to know when you need to know it, on NBS, the network of the news.<eos> This NBS news hotline bulletin is brought to you by Schritz Beer.
- Sir.<eos> Well, Lord Gomer?<eos> He has suffered a severe sub-mental shock.<eos> I've given him a massive deranger dose, but even that will take hours to...<eos> - Incredible.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Quietly now.<eos> - Lord Chancellor, what happened?<eos> Your alien friend almost killed you.<eos> She openly attacked you.
- I destroyed the...<eos> - She couldn't have, she was with me.<eos> - Who did, then? - I have no idea!<eos> Look, we must get out of the Citadel.<eos> What for?<eos> Well, it's safer than staying in here.<eos> All right.<eos> But be careful.<eos> There's a total curfew on.<eos> If any of my men see you, they'll shoot.
Help yourself, my boy.<eos> Noblemen have congratulated me on my choice of canary wine.<eos> Alas, I may not drink it meself before sundown, so Behenna says.<eos> Though what difference it makes in the end, the good God knows.<eos> And talking of the good God, I'd remind you - l live in your parish.<eos> Job, in the time of his tribulation says, "lf a man dies, shall he live again.<eos> "All the days of my appointed time, will I wait till my change come."<eos> I believe a glass of canary would be helpful to me, me boy.<eos> You're a parson.<eos> The bishop has laid hands on you.
Alas, I've not altogether endured temptation.<eos> I've yielded here and there.<eos> I don't fancy meeting me maker with a burdened conscience.<eos> But is there really such a being?<eos> Do you believe these tales of hellfire and eternal damnation?<eos> Upon me soul, I don't know what to think.<eos> God is eternal, God is omnipresent.<eos> If you travel down to the furthermost part of hell, he is there also.<eos> There is no escaping him.<eos> is it the sins of your youth that trouble you?
Master's given most of us servants t'day off to celebrate.<eos> Have y'heard the good news? - News? - A great victory for England.<eos> Master was so excited.<eos> Nile, ain't it?<eos> Admiral Nelson destroyed the French ships.<eos> Blowed them all out to sea, he has. Pray it'll end the war.<eos> Bells be a-ringing, London way.<eos> They'll peal at Sawle soon.<eos> What brings you here, Emma?<eos> I done a letter for you, Sam.
That will soon be remedied.<eos> I leave for Westminster in a few weeks.<eos> is, er... Geoffrey Charles here?<eos> No, he's at school.<eos> - He must be growing up.<eos> - Quite the young man now.<eos> And Valentine?<eos> Is George still suspicious of his parentage?<eos> No, not any more but if he heard you were here...<eos> is this gentleman annoying you, Mrs Warleggan?
- Do as I tell you.<eos> - Have you come courting?<eos> Ned!<eos> He's at that age.<eos> Take no notice.<eos> Mary Ann, I have something to tell you.<eos> Er, Mary.<eos> But it may take long to explain.<eos> Roddy and Ruth will be in for their dinner soon.<eos> I ask you to hark to me because I have a taking for ee, and I wish to explain what's in my mind.
But she be wed, three year now.<eos> I've not spoken to her and only seen her but once.<eos> Where are those children?<eos> Their dinner will be cold.<eos> Mary Ann, folk do tell me, and I come to believe, that I need a wife.<eos> I've a home and a good trade, none better, and I've a taking for ee.<eos> I don't feel, maybe never shall feel, what I feel for Morwenna but I'd like you for a wife if you'd have me. Just so long as you understand.<eos> Now, I'll not stay for your father or your dinner, just ask that in due time you'll give me your answer.<eos> Drake.<eos> You're a brave and honest man and I respect you for what you've told me.
Where?<eos> - In the bank.<eos> - Pascoes bank?<eos> - Yes, where we keep ours.<eos> Why?<eos> We've heard tales - that's why we best talk to you.<eos> Tales of what?<eos> They say Pascoes bank ain't safe no more.<eos> I cannot afford to take a risk, Mr Pascoe.<eos> What leads you to suppose there is a risk?
- See what?<eos> - How quickly you respond.<eos> - You flatter yourself.<eos> Shall I prove it?<eos> I'm deeply enamoured, this is not some trivial fancy.<eos> - You're very enchanting... - And now you flatter me.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't feel the way you want me to feel.<eos> That...could be altered.<eos> I have a sovereign remedy.<eos> - Do you cry out when a man takes you?
Ross, do you think your landlady could provide us with some chocolate?<eos> I woke so late I've not had breakfast.<eos> You were very gentle.<eos> Do you mean to have the baby in London or are you returning shortly to the country?<eos> Did I say I was from the country?<eos> No, Mrs Tabb, but in London I can attend the birth myself.<eos> - l have my own physician.<eos> - He can be relied on? - Yes.<eos> - Good.<eos> I have made you up a simple, little vegetable remedy that I know to be efficacious.
There can be no doubt, ma'am, he is much recovered.<eos> Oh, not to mention his appetite.<eos> Are you not a magnificent recovery?<eos> It's been so long.<eos> There were times...<eos> Nature cannot be hurried, ma'am.<eos> Festina lente, as they say.<eos> The next thing is to bring you back to health.<eos> Oh, I am well enough, just a simple chill.<eos> I cannot think why my husband would summon you.
I shan't believe it till I hear it from your own lips.<eos> I been out in the hay fields with many a man.<eos> - Be that the same thing?<eos> - You seen me drunk. And I prayed for ee, every night.<eos> Oh, Sam, what do praying do?<eos> - You're a good man.<eos> - Let me help you find repentance.<eos> - Meaning you'd wed me, Sam?<eos> - Yes. - Oh, yes. - Even if I didn't repent?<eos> I'd wed you in the hope that God's bountiful love would bring you to the light.
You heard of the attempt to invade Ireland?<eos> - Yes, but that was months ago.<eos> - Two months, to be exact.<eos> In spite of Sir Edward Pellew, most of the invasion fleet reached Bantry Bay and were landing their troops when the gales fortunately struck.<eos> is that the Pellew who distinguished himself at the engagement where you were captured?<eos> Indeed, and a finer English gentleman never put to sea.<eos> Perhaps the reason why we do not make progress in the war is that it is English gentlemen that lead us.<eos> All these Frenchmen rose on merit alone and there's not a gentleman among them.<eos> Do you suppose the English are inferior to the French?<eos> I warned you, my wife is a student of polemics.
- Finish your broth.<eos> - No, I got to get up.<eos> I got to go to Truro. I got to speak with Mistress Warleggan.<eos> - l'll come with ee.<eos> At least there be no gamekeepers at Truro.<eos> There be footmen. They be nigh as wicked.<eos> But they don't know me.<eos> Two of us, they'd suspicion.<eos> You're both as crazy as calves.<eos> Nobody'll see you in that state.
- Do you mean we've done it?<eos> You and Poldark, 13 votes apiece.<eos> Trengrouse and Warleggan, 12.<eos> I had hoped for something more conclusive.<eos> Had you indeed?<eos> Be content.<eos> Warleggan won it by one vote last time.<eos> He's lost it by the same amount today.<eos> Oh, it's conclusive enough for me.<eos> That one vote will send you to London as soon as you're packed.
We get our raw materials and food from other communities.<eos> In return, we give them what we produce.<eos> Anything from aspirin to synthesised plaster of Paris. So why the aggro?<eos> The aggro comes from misinformation, ignorance, suspicion.<eos> -You provide a good example.<eos> -Oh, thank you!<eos> Your sarcasm proves my point.<eos> The chemical processing here requires raw materials in bulk.<eos> And there's very little to show as an end product.<eos> So, your suppliers accuse you of extortion.
Maybe something can be made for you there.<eos> CHARLES: Whereabouts is that?<eos> I wondered how long it would be before the English found their way here.<eos> What's it like in the south?<eos> One terrible graveyard, from what we've heard.<eos> Well, it's not so bad now.<eos> We've even got a sort of government established.<eos> You have?<eos> That's an extraordinary thing to be wanting again, isn't it?<eos> What brings you to Scotland?
Hardly that.<eos> Well, it's needless to finish so early.<eos> What, has Hubert found us somewhere, then?<eos> (PANTING) Jenny has.<eos> They live in a place called the Tollbar.<eos> CHARLES: (LAUGHING) So what?<eos> Come on, Dylan.<eos> (URGING HORSE)<eos> Charles Vaughan, Jenny Richards.<eos> -Sam sent you over?
You know that, don't you?<eos> Colas will bring your luggage in, and you'll get an excellent night's sleep.<eos> Tomorrow the rain will have stopped, your windscreen will be repaired... and you'll be relaxed, your spirit will be free to roam.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> I'm sorry I hesitated before.<eos> Please...<eos> You're exhausted, my dear child.<eos> Go and get some rest.<eos> Good night.<eos> Thank you, with all my heart.
- What about tobacco?<eos> - You can leave it.<eos> And what is this?<eos> We want to assemble a gramophone, Comrade Lieutenant.<eos> Take it.<eos> But the least you need for it is a gramophone itself.<eos> We'll get it.<eos> - Take it away.<eos> - Yes.<eos> What do they write you from home, Glebov?
Well, I will see.<eos> Colonel, with your permission.<eos> Well, what do you think of our new captain?<eos> I feel he thinks he is on some kind of special mission, that is, to achieve spiritual domination of his battalion, thereby symbolising the purity of the great German Wehrmacht itself.<eos> Even when going down in defeat.<eos> If they're the last of us, Stransky and Steiner, then God help us.<eos> Captain Stransky, welcome to the second platoon.<eos> - Lieutenant.<eos> - Meyer, Captain.<eos> I am to show you to your quarters, brief you on our current situation.
Would it be possible for me to give my answer in three or four days, sir?<eos> Did you see Stransky or not?<eos> You may go, Triebig.<eos> What in God's name has got into you?<eos> This is your chance!<eos> You are the only person that stands between Stransky and his Iron Cross. And you could be called as a primary witness against him in a court of honour.<eos> My differences with Captain Stransky are a personal matter.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> You know that I've always shown a great deal of understanding for you, but I'm becoming tired of battling with your superiors.<eos> I never ask you to.
Steiner!<eos> God!<eos> Take the women outside.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go!<eos> All of you get inside.<eos> Now we're even.<eos> And there's one other thing you could do for me.<eos> There's a man here that I would like to get out quickly.<eos> I spoke to you about him before.
Let's say 9.30.<eos> If that's convenient, of course.<eos> I'll see.<eos> Call the police.<eos> Not until I find out what the hell this is all about, babe.<eos> Mr Templeton!<eos> Mrs Templeton.<eos> It's very quiet in here. I...<eos> I've reserved a table.<eos> Look, I want to thank you both very much for seeing me.
- it's your turn now. - No, no, I've spoken enough,<eos> - leave me alone.<eos> - Mateusz, I beg of you, do it at least for me.<eos> This is such a moment that you have to.<eos> Come.<eos> Are you sure everybody knew about my arrival? I've been announcing it all over the factory since the morning.<eos> Everybody knows.<eos> Come, tell them like it is.<eos> Comrade Birkut, the floor is yours!<eos> My dear, thank you so much.
Oh, Grizelda, I can't.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Get out of there.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, get up there. Let's go.<eos> Move it!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey, boys, look what I brought you!
It's not over because the Italians are coming. The Italians are coming because it's over.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> You just write, "Prostrations, as ever, at the sacred foot..."<eos> "Many salutations, Colombo da Priverno."<eos> Hey, that's Theresa!<eos> Quiet.<eos> (yelling in Spanish) Theresa! - What happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I was waiting for you for an hour.
- What?<eos> I thought I heard someone praying.<eos> Must have been just a feeling.<eos> "Most Blessed Father."<eos> From the start?<eos> - Whatever.<eos> "I learned now that the condemned Monti and Tognetti's request for grace has been refused.<eos> And that you were up all night."<eos> "What happened, Holiness?"<eos> "The Holy Spirit didn't enlighten you?
May I please have some water, please?<eos> Excuse me, tell me please, are these black soldiers protecting us or are they collaborating with the terrorists?<eos> I hope they'll protect us. I hope...<eos> That's all I can say.<eos> Please...<eos> -Can't we take off?<eos> -We can't...<eos> Do you speak French?<eos> -No, Greek.<eos> -A little... I'm asking you to cooperate until this is over.
We recorded everything from the practice simulations.<eos> They don't know.<eos> All we need from you is the actual television transmissions during the flight and the Mars landing, that's all.<eos> Just the television transmissions.<eos> That's all?<eos> Just the television transmissions.<eos> We inserted a change in the onboard computer, so the spacecraft will land two hundred miles off target when it returns to Earth.<eos> You'll be flown to an island near that point.<eos> From there you'll be transferred to a helicopter.<eos> The helicopter will fly you to the space capsule and you'll be put inside.
There are so many Wurgs and Keeks in Megropolis 3, I sometimes wonder how my distinguished colleague, Gatherer Pile, manages to keep track of you all.<eos> Indeed.<eos> But how very clever of you to know my name.<eos> -Well, it's here, on your Consumcard.<eos> -Ah.<eos> The cause of your unfortunate experience, of which I trust there are no ill effects?<eos> Oh, not at all, not at all.<eos> Your guards were entirely charming, and so attentive.<eos> I am gratified.<eos> I brought you here, Citizen Doctor, first of all to give you the thousand talmars you requested. And also to apologise for any inconvenience.
You'd better do it, unless you want to ruin Mr Chang's act!<eos> It's that cellar, Mr Jago.<eos> Psst!<eos> Good evening, Mr Jago.<eos> Pleasure to welcome you, sir, and your charming companion!<eos> Thank you. Are you quite comfortable down there?<eos> Oh, I know the value of discretion in matters like this, Doctor!<eos> May I ask if you've come to any further deductions?<eos> - Quite a few.<eos> Quite a few. - I thought as much when I saw you here!
I wish to see my aunt, Agatha Poldark.<eos> You were not invited.<eos> I have not seen her since my return.<eos> - Oh, your return, yes.<eos> - May I see her?<eos> There are notices warning against trespass.<eos> I wish to see my aunt.<eos> You come uninvited, that is trespass.<eos> I came by your gate. I ask you decently.<eos> And I tell you decently that Miss Poldark is well.
I felt it my duty. Your mother's ailing.<eos> Master, the bad pains are coming on.<eos> What's happening, Doctor?<eos> - Sir, I am busy.<eos> - Tell me, man!<eos> - The next stage has begun. - The child?<eos> If there is no issue shortly I shall use forceps.<eos> The irritation of these... - Can you save them?<eos> - You should have called earlier.<eos> I sent for you the moment it happened.
She's not my daughter.<eos> But as she's my wife's cousin, it's not inappropriate to make some gift.<eos> - A generous one.<eos> - N...?<eos> - if the seed is tended. - A nice parable.<eos> - l have no mercenary motive.<eos> - Certainly not.<eos> But it would degrade your family for a cousin to marry and not keep the condition of a lady.<eos> I am f1,OOO in debt.<eos> It is my business to know such facts. - 2,OOO will put you in credit.
- Understood, sir.<eos> - l want him caught.<eos> And taught a lesson.<eos> He is to be treated as a trespasser.<eos> Trespasser, aye, sir.<eos> - And if we do catch him?<eos> - If?<eos> When we do catch 'e, Cap'n Poldark's a powe_ul strong man, sir.<eos> He might not see it same way as we.<eos> I pay you to do a job.
The winner will get my hand.<eos> If someone asks you, say you're the Princess of Zaduan.<eos> This is not true, I can't say it.<eos> - Can you keep a secret?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The Princess is praying for you.<eos> She is sure you will win and God will unite you two in wedlock.<eos> Can you keep a secret?<eos> The Princess is sure you will win.<eos> The Lord will unite you.
You can only think of your glittering scales,<eos> Of falling in love, and your sweethearts' tirades.<eos> The Duchess Alice-Margaret Elizabeth of Cornwall!<eos> On her way to Rome!<eos> I can imagine, dear Duchess, how tired you must be!<eos> Not a bit!<eos> Shall we dance?<eos> With you?<eos> I don't feel like it.<eos> Your fish tail must be hindering you.
Tomorrow you'll meet each other at the tournament!<eos> They're justjoking.<eos> You'll get used to it soon.<eos> My dear, you think I'm the ideal woman.<eos> Actually, I'm a nasty, evil, envious, gossiping brat.<eos> Believe me, I'm the worst gossiper.<eos> And something else. I laugh, dance, make men go crazy about me, but really I'm being tormented.<eos> is it possible that a man is predestined only for one person?<eos> There're so many people in the world...<eos> The Prince loves you!
In rather strange circumstances, to be honest.<eos> But I'm sure Mr. Giulio Laurenti has a cast iron alibi.<eos> I'm sure people who are above suspicion are ready to testify they were with him.<eos> Inspector, I find your irony out of place.<eos> I'm waiting...<eos> I'm hanging from your lips.<eos> - Our client, Giulio Laurenti was at Marchese Rivoli's villa on that day.<eos> This is a list of people who are willing to corroborate this.<eos> Very well.<eos> I'm sorry to disturb you over nothing.
Mayumi is going to marry me.<eos> You want proof?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> She made it herself.<eos> I've got one of those too.<eos> You too?<eos> - It can't be!<eos> - Look!<eos> It's a fake!<eos> She duped you all.
Not a sentimental duel.<eos> But who would ever see it?<eos> Ourselves, I would hope.<eos> I thought perhaps it would take us back to our happiest years.<eos> Of course, I have taken advantage of you.<eos> I have manipulated your conscience.<eos> But was it not worth it? We were so sure and hopeful, so full of reason and happiness. We thought that the happiness of these years would last forever.<eos> Instead it's all about to end.<eos> Away from here it's already very different.<eos> The immortality that I gave you was the only way to prolong these carefree days.
Were you able to bring everything we asked for?<eos> Yes, everything, of course.<eos> I thought perhaps it would take us back to our happiest years.<eos> Of course, I have taken advantage of you.<eos> I have manipulated your conscience.<eos> But was it not worth it?<eos> We were so sure and hopeful, so full of reason and happiness. We thought that the happiness of these years would last forever.<eos> Instead it's all about to end.<eos> Away from here it's already very different.<eos> The immortality that I gave you was the only way to prolong these carefree days.
What's wrong with you?<eos> Mine was born before yours.<eos> Everyone knows, peasants came before their masters.<eos> Masters, peasants, bullshit!<eos> At birth we're all the same.<eos> - All the same?<eos> - Shut up you scoundrel!<eos> Hey you!<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> I told you to drink, you rascals!
- Yes.<eos> - News from the League! - What do they say?<eos> They said we gotta make a move, they're preparing a strike.<eos> - Where? - Everywhere!<eos> What's the matter then?<eos> We all agree.<eos> We'll go on strike.<eos> Strike?<eos> Do you know what strike means?<eos> I asked you if you know what it means.
Little jokes they're making down at Finance these days.<eos> If people are to be convinced... that Stans and Sloan are innocent, then our reporting must be precise... and you can help us.<eos> Who is "P"?<eos> "P" we know, is Porter.<eos> You said, "$25,000."<eos> Is that how much Porter got?<eos> Was it more?<eos> Was it more than $50,000?<eos> Was Magruder the only "M" to receive money?<eos> Who told you about Porter?
I will converse with Petrarch, with Ariosto,<eos> and with you, Torquato Tasso.<eos> My tender friend whose verses come to my mind in this supreme moment.<eos> Where are you ?<eos> Where are you ?<eos> The great Mouna !<eos> The queen of whales !<eos> Everyone can enter. The stomach is still warm.<eos> A female whale.<eos> Look at its mouth, inviting you to go inside.
One could swear it is real flesh.<eos> The right color. It would fool anyone.<eos> It is very late.<eos> Are you still up ?<eos> I hope you will excuse me, Madam, for the liberty I took.<eos> But I so much wish to see what you are, naturally.<eos> You do not protest ?<eos> What sort of mad inventor was your father ?<eos> Certainly mad, but a poet, if he made you so beautiful.<eos> Did he incestuously possess you ?
My macaroni !<eos> I want my macaroni !<eos> I did not prepare macaroni this evening. No macaroni !<eos> If you want, there is goat fried brain.<eos> I clearly said I want macaroni on my plate every evening !<eos> If that is not possible, the count will be informed.<eos> There is polenta, which is almost ready.<eos> I do not want polenta !<eos> I cannot stand that my dinner be disturbed by such people !<eos> Mister Casanova, your agreement with the count dispenses you from eating with the servants and the troops.
Listen, Faulkircher.<eos> Only because of one of life's cruel turn of events, that the two of us met.<eos> You, a butler, and I a librarian.<eos> Respect my solitude and keep away from me !<eos> You are a cheating scoundrel !<eos> You take advantage of the count's absence, but he will find out !<eos> Also that you practice anti-physical attractions with your Viderol.<eos> You disgust me !<eos> Go ahead and speak in your vulgar German !<eos> Who understands you ?
San Francisco's finest.<eos> Mitch.<eos> Roll him over.<eos> He's clean.<eos> Here's the story.<eos> First, we want all the pigs out of here.<eos> Second, we want a car with a police radio.<eos> We're taking two hostages.<eos> Both the women.<eos> You don't do what I tell you, we blow their fucking heads off.
- Jimmy?<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> - Who's got the letters?<eos> - Right here.<eos> - Wait, what's this?<eos> - Some form letters.<eos> So you hand them something for the cameras.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> The Mayor will introduce you, hand you the letters and then move to the left off-camera.
I had to go in overalls.<eos> And pile out slate for a living after I growed up.<eos> Coal out of it and sell it.<eos> And... walk off of that mountain from that mines to school.<eos> And they're all barned up there, not even allowed in it.<eos> I've got Mom's coal oil lamps. I've got her stove irons a-sittin' there for 'em to look at.<eos> And walking' to school and back.<eos> And I know everybody's disappointed we don't have a bigger crowd... and we're disappointed that more people haven't come in, but when you get down to it... in this fight, and like in any other fight, you gotta depend on yourselves.<eos> Nobody in the end's gonna do it for you.<eos> The union's gonna back you, and we're gonna do all we can... but you gotta win this fight yourselves.
If you insist on entering the lion's den, then I want to hear the beasts when they pounce on you.<eos> Test it.<eos> If I give the signal return immediately.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'm glad we can continue our talk that was interrupted before.<eos> I hope music doesn't bother you.<eos> Distractions help me concentrate.<eos> I have thought a great deal about you.<eos> What kind of people are you?<eos> What compels you?
I am here, the ambassador to my right and Dampiere on the left Good?<eos> - Yes, its good...<eos> I have put Dampierre close to me to talk about next week if we will go to Paris with them<eos> Thanks<eos> Tullio<eos> - How are you, Giuseppe?<eos> - Well, thanks<eos> - Tullio, beloved<eos> - Mother, how are you?<eos> You are all alike, you arrive all at once when one least expects you
Get down off your horse.<eos> I'm not gonna have any hesitation from you. Not from a frequenter of whores.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Just back off.<eos> I'm gonna step down at my own speed.<eos> I'm going to lose it right here, in all these blades of grass.<eos> Do I have to come to you?<eos> All right.<eos> - Hold it. - What?<eos> Who asked you to do all this?
- It's in Big Sandy.<eos> No, I mean the Shonkin Sag.<eos> No, I mean Big Sandy. Big...<eos> I was raised up in Big Sandy.<eos> There ain't a teeny-weeny implement business in Big Sandy, and not in Shonkin Sag neither.<eos> Mr Ferguson, I'm really grateful to you for your hospitality and everything, but my line of work is none of your damn business.<eos> I'm sorry, Tod.<eos> I didn't mean to get you all riled up like that.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> Maybe one of these days, I'll get a chance to cook your supper for you. Hah!
Sitting behind that desk is the real Sam Diamond.<eos> My name is Loomis.<eos> J.J. Loomis.<eos> I'm an actor.<eos> I do impressions.<eos> I did the Carson show six times last year.<eos> Diamond hired me for the weekend.<eos> Miss Skeffington is Vilma Norman.<eos> She's a cocktail waitress at the Water Bed Motel in Carmel.<eos> Diamond hated all of you.
Just leave us alone. "<eos> Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.<eos> I want you to get mad!<eos> I don't want you to protest or riot. I don't want you to write to your congressman.<eos> I don't know what to do about the depression, the inflation and the crime.<eos> All I know is that first you've got to get mad!<eos> You've gotta say "I'm a human being, goddammit!<eos> My life has value!"<eos> So... I want you to get up now.<eos> I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
We lie like hell.<eos> We'll tell you that Kojak always gets the killer, and that nobody ever gets cancer in Archie Bunker's house.<eos> However much trouble the hero is in, don't worry.<eos> Look at your watch. At the end of the hour he's going to win.<eos> We'll tell you any shit you want to hear.<eos> We deal in illusions, man.<eos> None of it is true.<eos> But you people sit there, day after day, night after night, all ages, colours, creeds.<eos> We're all you know. You're beginning to believe the illusions we're spinning. You're beginning to think the tube is reality and your lives are unreal.<eos> You do whatever the tube tells you.
Is that your idea of dying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'd think I'd learn.<eos> I've seen enough of it.<eos> I'll tell you something.<eos> I won't go quietly.<eos> Come here.<eos> Bend down.<eos> If I had not met you, think what I'd have missed.<eos> The king will see you now.
I've been dating a girl for a few months and I know you'd be proud if you could see her.<eos> Her name is Betsy, but I can tell you no more than that.<eos> Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Move it!<eos> --bear the burden of suffering for the few.<eos> No more will we fight the wars of the few through the heart of the many.<eos> I hope this card finds you all well, as it does me.
- And they did pay legal fees to the scoundrel.<eos> - Oh, that 'one less worry.<eos> Here are my rules for maintaining Nampara.<eos> Um ... my son ... And a separate agreement for my wife.<eos> - Separated?<eos> - You ', sir, separate.<eos> To pay her for the rest of his life, wherever he is.<eos> You will notice that I have appointed Martin Zacky director of Wheal Grace and appointed you president during my absence.<eos> And finally Here's' the last part of the 2,000 pounds that you have procured me.<eos> - Cosi 'then you said And I thank you again for this.
I will always be near.<eos> Stop doing that, and follow me instead.<eos> Then I will make you fishers of men.<eos> When a man kills another man, he must suffer death himself.<eos> He who kills a cow must re-compensate it.<eos> A living animal for a living animal.<eos> But if he causes another man bodily harm there must be done to him as he did to others.<eos> A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.<eos> Tell me, Lord, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?<eos> What did Moses command you?
It's wonderful!<eos> 'The wife does not have authority over her body;<eos> 'her husband does.<eos> 'Likewise the husband does not have authority over his body; his wife does.<eos> 'Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time 'so that you may devote yourselves to prayer.<eos> 'But then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you.'<eos> You'll get a big one.<eos> I love it.<eos> Give me more.<eos> 'Therefore God gave you over in sinful desires of your hearts to impurity.
'By no means!<eos> 'Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey as slaves, 'you are slaves to the one whom you obey;<eos> 'either to sin or to death.'<eos> It's your turn.<eos> Oh, it's so wonderful.<eos> Wonderful...<eos> I don't want more.<eos> Faster. Now!<eos> I'm coming now...<eos> 'Because of this, God gave you over to degrading passions.
It takes them, and folds them in a white cloak.<eos> And carries them away to the higher regions.<eos> But meanwhile, you haven't told me yet, you haven't told me you love me.<eos> Does that goddess know the words that satisfy burning desire?<eos> She does<eos> Maybe she's unwilling to say them for fear of dying of it, for fear of having<eos> Foolish fear - love does not kill,<eos> but gives life And smiles for heavenly joys As it does now in your almond eyes.<eos> For me you are now the eye of heaven.<eos> And I liked you from the first moment I set eyes on you.
He's a friend of his.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> What's wrong, don't you feel well?<eos> I'm fine. I'm really fine.<eos> I haven't felt this fine in all my life.<eos> But now you go your way and I'll go mine.<eos> - Please don't make a big drama!<eos> - Who's making a drama?<eos> You're a revolutionary, you are committed... you have your duty to do.<eos> But I'm a father who has to work. I have to support you.
Come with me. '<eos> Every star is j ust a cel l i n the brai n of the u n iverse.<eos> 'That is a lovely way to u nderstand it. '<eos> Why have I never tal ked with you before?<eos> ' Because of ti me. 'You th i n k at what you cal I the s peed of I ig ht.<eos> ' I n etern ity, I have no h u rry.<eos> ' I th i n k a thoug ht, perhaps, i n every thousand of you r years.<eos> 'You are never there to hear it. '<eos> Are you... God?<eos> - ' It was good to have known you. '
- F rom what?<eos> - Is the planet inhabited?<eos> No.<eos> Y es.<eos> Not in the way you think.<eos> You must not go near that planet.<eos> Mr Russell, we' re marooned. We can't survive indefinitely.<eos> - You cannot go down there.<eos> - That's our decision to make.<eos> You face power beyond your understanding. It will destroy you.
(STAMMERING) Uh...<eos> I don't know. Uh, I don't know. You always think I know everything, I don't.<eos> -What's her name?<eos> Can I have a go on your chair after, Vic?<eos> -LIZZIE: Can I?<eos> The Prayer of the Little Ducks Who Went into the Ark.<eos> "Dear God "Give us a flood of water<eos> "Let it rain tomorrow and always "Give us plenty of little slugs and other luscious things to eat<eos> "Protect all folk who quack "And everyone who knows how to swim "Amen"<eos> Pick a poem, both of you.
Our mating will be ruthless.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Ruthless.<eos> All of your lifeblood must transfer into me.<eos> This could be your last night.<eos> But what a night...<eos> If I gave the order to dig this grave, it's because we never know.<eos> Thereby...<eos> I declare you united, by link of blood, and by the fire of the salt.<eos> And may the child you'll conceive, be the physical... and spiritual completion of the great passion that binds you.
This is a mortal kind of a joke!<eos> Please, stop it!<eos> Let me alone!<eos> What good does it do to torment me like this?<eos> No good!<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Upstairs, my... checkbook!<eos> Name me the amount it's yours!<eos> Shut up!<eos> And my private plane to take you away!
You have a letter from the young lady?<eos> - That's right, Socha... and I'm his wife.<eos> We want a job in the factory...<eos> To work, tell him...<eos> It's because of Pietrakowa.<eos> What is?<eos> She sicked the dogs on me.<eos> My wife whacked her head against the house then into the manure!<eos> I kicked her black and blue.<eos> When did she burn you out?
- Due to ill health... your brother has decided to take a short vacation in the country- oh, not very long, two or three days at most but he would very much appreciate-<eos> - Just a drop.<eos> - You were saying?<eos> Due to ill health... your brother has decided to take a short vacation in the country- not very long, two or three days at most-<eos> - Sugar?<eos> - Just one, please.<eos> - Yes, yes. Go on.<eos> - Due to ill health... your brother has decided to take a short vacation in the country- oh, not very long, two or three days at most- but he would very much appreciate- very much appreciate-<eos> If you would handle one of his most urgent cases during the time of his absence. - I see.<eos> - All fees going to you, of course.
My brother is a very insecure man.<eos> Now precisely what is it that you want of me?<eos> Well, I have this friend-<eos> - Liar! - Ha!<eos> I'm being blackmailed.<eos> May I offer you some tea? No, thanks.<eos> Exactly who and what are you?<eos> My name is Jenny Hill... and I'm simultaneously funny and sad.<eos> How interesting.<eos> Do you have any idea who's blackmailing you?
By the way, do you mind if I call you Siggy? Sigerson seems so formal.<eos> What was in the letter, Miss Hill?<eos> I said I wanted to touch his winkie!<eos> I see.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> - His what?<eos> Nothing! Nothing! I'll explain it to you later.<eos> - You're leaving?<eos> - Yes, I have to be at the theater by 10:00.<eos> I hope you won't think too unkindly of me... but everything I've told you just now has been a lie.
Good lad! Good!<eos> That's the idea!<eos> I even brought one myself, just in case.<eos> I wonder which is the real one.<eos> Drop your sword or I'll throw these into the river.<eos> Only two left.<eos> This is fun!<eos> Right.<eos> We both know there were four fakes on that prop table.<eos> Now give me the real document you took from Gambetti... or, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
- I've seen the Madonna!<eos> The other people are really sick here!<eos> - Tomorrow you'll settle it with the doctor.<eos> - Unhooded?<eos> # The long, long, long, long shits... # ...run and melt. They need a bedpan... # ...from the sister.<eos> # The long, long, long, long shits...<eos> In the end the doctor gave us such powerful sedatives that we slept all night like pumpkins.<eos> And so, the day after we woke up fresh and rested ready to start again.<eos> Well, at this point...<eos> I warn you:
- Who? - Melandri. There.<eos> There where?<eos> He got in to the villa of Nazi... of the professor.<eos> - I came to sell him an encyclopaedia.<eos> - And then?<eos> And then I saw Melandri's car arrive I hid here and saw him get off in a black suit with a collared coat and a bow tie...<eos> Fulminating God!<eos> He went to tell her husband!<eos> And then?<eos> I called you at once because he's going to ruin himself.
If the Chevalier remarks on your accent, say you are Hungarian.<eos> You served in the war.<eos> You left the Army for medical reasons then served Monsieur de Quellenberg for two years.<eos> He's now with the Army in Silesia, but you'll have a certificate from him.<eos> Good morning, Your Honour.<eos> So you are the young man recommended by Seebach.<eos> Yes, Your Honour, here are my credentials.<eos> Your name is Lazlo Zilagy?<eos> Yes, Your Honour.<eos> Monsieur de Quellenberg recommends you highly.
That, before strangers, he should not know a word of English.<eos> And that he should keep a lookout on the trumps when serving the wine.<eos> Having excellent eyesight and a natural aptitude he was able to give his dear patron much assistance against his opponents at the green table.<eos> Lf, for instance, he wiped the table with a napkin the enemy was strong in Diamonds.<eos> If he adjusted a chair it meant Ace King.<eos> If he said, "Punch or wine, My Lord?" Hearts were meant, and so forth.<eos> The Prince of Tübingen who had intimate connections with the Great Frederick was passionately fond of play as were the gentlemen of almost all the Courts of Europe.<eos> You owe 15,500 frederick d'or.<eos> Chevalier though I cannot say how I believe you have cheated me.<eos> I deny Your Grace's accusation and beg you to say how you have been cheated.
Promise me you won't ride that horse except with your father.<eos> Yes, Mama, I promise.<eos> And I promise you a good flogging if you even go to Doolan's farm to see him before your birthday.<eos> Yes, Papa.<eos> You understand?<eos> Yes, Papa.<eos> You promise me?<eos> Yes, Papa, I promise.<eos> All right, eat your food.<eos> I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Lyndon but I believe Master Bryan has disobeyed you and stolen away to Doolan's farm.
How's the world treating you, Graham?<eos> Oh, not too bad.<eos> Are you comfortable here?<eos> Most comfortable.<eos> Good, good!<eos> Shall we get down to the matter at hand?<eos> By all means.<eos> Mr. Lyndon Lord Bullingdon has instructed me to offer you an annuity of 500 guineas a year for life.<eos> Specifically on the condition of your leaving England and to be stopped the instant of your return.<eos> Lord Bullingdon has also asked me to point out to you that should you decide to remain here your stay would infallibly plunge you into jail.
- That's a hostage!<eos> - Don't fire, don't fire.<eos> Hold your fire. - Hold your fire!<eos> We voted to send him out!<eos> - He's one of the hostages!<eos> - Get away from him!<eos> - What's the matter with you?<eos> - He's a hostage!<eos> He's one of the hostages.<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?
What should I do?<eos> I'm doing everything I can. I can't do that.<eos> I mean, they're —<eos> Look, Sal.<eos> Forget about it.<eos> It's just a freak show to them, anyway.<eos> It don't matter.<eos> Whatever they say, it don't matter.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> What's the matter with you?
You are the only woman ... that I ever loved.<eos> And I re-pledge my love to you ... in this sad moment.<eos> To little Kimmy ... and Timmy.<eos> I hope you remember me, Timmy.<eos> You are the little man of the family now ... and I hope you look after them for me.<eos> To my mother ... I ask forgiveness.<eos> You — You don't understand ... the things I said ... and did.<eos> But I'm me and I'm different.<eos> I want a military funeral ... and I'm entitled to have one, free of charge.<eos> God — God bless you ... and watch over you ... till we are joined in the hereafter.
One beer?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Who plays first?<eos> - Me, I got the six double.<eos> Mate, this one doesn't fit.<eos> Well, let's start over.<eos> Six four.<eos> Come on, play!<eos> This one doesn't fit either.<eos> Today, with a new sacrament, ...Christ will bless your love and enrich and strengthen you for keeping mutual fidelity and accomplishing your duty as a matrimony.
How is Miss Lewly's health?<eos> Well, she's better, but she's still in her room.<eos> Oh, yes. This is the paper she usually takes.<eos> She must've run out by now.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Don't go.<eos> I'll tell her you're here.<eos> - She'll be so pleased to see you. - Ah, yes.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Miss Adele thanks you very much for the paper... but she's too tired to see anyone.
That's fine.<eos> Miss Adele thanks you very much for the paper... but she's too tired to see anyone.<eos> - But she'd like-<eos> - No, it doesn't matter.<eos> - I was only passing and I thought- - Thank you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Sorry to have troubled you.<eos> - Good-bye, Mrs. Saunders. - Good-bye, Mr. Whistler.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My dear parents... it is a trembling engaged girl who writes you.
It was you who took advantage of my father's soirees... to touch my arm.<eos> It was you who caressed me in the hallways.<eos> I gave myself to you.<eos> You have to keep me.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> You have to keep me. You can't be serious.<eos> I knew women before you. I've known women since you, and I'll know still more.<eos> But when we're married, you can have the same freedom.<eos> You can see all the women you want.<eos> You see... I saw you with that woman and her dogs.
- It's finished now.<eos> - Simple!<eos> Anybody can do that.<eos> A round of applause, ladies and gentlemen, for Miss Tillie.<eos> - What is your name?<eos> - Ralph Williams, mounted police.<eos> - Would you mind repeating this? - Ralph Williams, mounted police!<eos> I see. Well, since you are so well mounted, would you mind sitting down?<eos> Make your self at home.<eos> Relax. I will have to put you to sleep, of course, first... since you are willing to experiment with me.
- You must have an appointment!<eos> Who is it, George?<eos> It's all right, Miss Agnes.<eos> There's a young lady who wishes to see the judge, but she has no appointment.<eos> Don't make such a fuss.<eos> I'll go to my father.<eos> I'm sure he'll see her.<eos> I must see him.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> My father will see you now.
We have a guest room and Sylvain can stay with his nephew.<eos> You might even meet a man.<eos> Jack thinks you should remarry.<eos> You're too pretty to be alone.<eos> George has been dead six years now.<eos> You're very tough.<eos> You only say you want to be alone because you don't want to complain.<eos> I often cry when I think about you.<eos> Jack's coming soon and I need to set the table.<eos> Many kisses to both of you.
There are tales that it did work here before we ever came.<eos> Some audacious scholars can even trace it back to the builders of Solomon's Temple. Hm.<eos> Old wives' tales, I suspect.<eos> Yes, in all likelihood, sir.<eos> Well, let's have a look at your lodge brothers.<eos> Right turn.<eos> Halt.<eos> Hats off.<eos> You men are not under arrest... thanks to Mr. Kipling here, who happens to be a genuine correspondent... for The Northern Star.<eos> But both of you richly deserve to be in jail.
All right, then. Some other time, perhaps.<eos> Come over here.<eos> Give it a touch up down here.<eos> - Rifles?<eos> - Martinis, 20 of them and ammunition.<eos> Cost us every sou we squeezed out of the Raj of Degumber.<eos> Good heavens.<eos> - You mean, you went back there?<eos> - Of course, brother Kipling.<eos> Heaven help you if you're caught with those at the border.
Who do you think is running Congress?<eos> Farmers?<eos> Engineers? Teachers?<eos> Businessmen?<eos> No, my friends. Congress is run by lawyers.<eos> A lawyer is trained for two things and two things only:<eos> To clarify... that's one... And to confuse... that's the other thing.<eos> He does whichever is to his client's advantage.<eos> Did you ever ask a lawyer the time of day?<eos> He told you how to make a watch, didn't he?
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I want to thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome.<eos> And I'm sure you meant to share it with... with Bud Hamilton, my son, who's here.<eos> Stand up, Bud.<eos> Isn't he something' else?<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> God bless you, and thank you so much for that warm welcome.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - He's got the entire galaxy on the back of his shirt. - Thank you so much.<eos> And now I'd like to do a special old favorite... the song that got me started in this business... that's been so kind to me... a song you've loved through the years... and one I'm sure you're gonna love tonight.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You gettin' ready, Joe?<eos> Now everybody's goin'!<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Thank you, and God love you.
Delly went with me. One of the stuntmen...<eos> Delly started hittin' on him.<eos> When I left, she stayed on.<eos> What was the stuntman's name?<eos> Marv Ellman.<eos> Is he the one you had the fight with?<eos> Any message if I run into Delly?<eos> Just be drivin' a truck.<eos> Yeah, they really get to you, don't they?<eos> Can I help you with that?
How serious is it you and Ellen?<eos> For me, it's not too serious.<eos> For Ellen, ask her. I'd be guessing.<eos> It seems to me, you're the one it's serious for.<eos> I'm beginning to get you in focus, Moseby.<eos> You know, Ellen talks a lot about you...<eos> About the kind of guy you are, about what a great athlete you were.<eos> But you were different. You were brighter.<eos> Stick with you and Ellen! She told me you were left by your parents when you were very young and brought up by relatives... Knock off the goddamn crap!<eos> I don't wanna know what she told you about me! You should.
Yeah, well we won't know now, will we?<eos> Keep it coming, Marv.<eos> Leave the cars. Get the bag up good and high. Keep firing in the police car.<eos> Hit the smoke, Joe! Hit your smoke, Marv! Smoke!<eos> He flies good. Crazy bastard. He does everything like that.<eos> Guys like Marv make me feel old.<eos> Well, I am old.<eos> I'd say we saw the same movies.<eos> Hey, aren't you the Harry Moseby who played ball for Oakland?<eos> Yeah! I saw you in the pro bowl.
- Then I'll be your tender hubby<eos> - And I'll be your little missus<eos> Oh, to think of future joys<eos> If the gods their grace award us in due time they will accord us a lovely brood of girls and boys girls and boys<eos> - First comes a little Papageno<eos> - Then comes a little Papagena<eos> - Then yet another Papageno<eos> - Then yet another Papagena<eos> We do not need a lucky penny With many, many, many, many, Papagenos, Papagenas we shall befortunate indeed<eos> Your father permits you to visit Tamino in the House of Trials
- He has killed 2 of my men.<eos> - I am not a politician!<eos> That's what cowards say!<eos> In harsh times.<eos> I am not a politician.<eos> I treat the wounded.<eos> Either you leave him here or I go tell Major Doctor Müller!<eos> Mister Dandieu, the war is not over yet.<eos> Do you know what would happen if you were not a surgeon?<eos> I would have brought you to the Gestapo, and you would have been shot.
I wonder why.<eos> No, you don't, Mrs. Van Niekirk.<eos> You know exactly why and I know exactly why.<eos> It's history and not our fault.<eos> We're a civilized Christian minority, and we've got to be able to defend ourselves.<eos> Diamonds. Seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling in clear, uncut diamonds.<eos> Do you know how many Maoist-trained terrorists you can arm for three-quarters of a million pounds?<eos> Do you know how many assault rifles, land mines and rockets Wilby can buy?<eos> And do you know that the first they'll kill will be you? The reformers who are trying to help them because that's the way they work.<eos> You let Shack run so that he'd lead you to the diamonds?
Mister Ambassador, I'm sorry, the Russian officials are here, the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself...<eos> What happened, Mister Minister?<eos> So early in the morning at my house?<eos> I'm very sorry to disturb you at this untimely hour, but your relative, Prince Trubetskoy, spent the night at your house.<eos> If the Prince remains at your embassy, you'll be presented a note.<eos> I have sent for the Prince, but if he doesn't wish to come out...<eos> - It's so awful!<eos> - I hope everything'll be all right.<eos> What can I do for you, gentlemen?<eos> The Emperor wishes to see you.
Oh?<eos> So if you don't love me...<eos> What are you going to do then?<eos> - I'll fight!<eos> - With whom?<eos> With anyone who dares to look at you!<eos> And if it's not only one man?<eos> I'll fight them all!<eos> You'll get killed, and it will serve you right!<eos> I love you like a madman!
District !<eos> We take this.<eos> - You put everything on the bandwagon?<eos> - Yup.<eos> ... Supplies, wheat ... and 'all there'.<eos> He attacks the ox to the wagon and go home.<eos> And do not waste time.<eos> I'll join you later.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, sir, God bless you.
I want to make a toast to the bride and groom.<eos> And when I say a toast and 'what I mean, then stand up, top cups and put them down' when they are empty, all right?<eos> See that no cheating ...<eos> Captain Poldark, I see that your cup is not 'full.<eos> Roy, Roy, make sure the Captain Poldark has a full cup.<eos> Here, well ...<eos> The lighthouse 'short' cause on a day like this you should not waste the time that you can 'go to drink.<eos> Jud has just brought a barrel of brandy that has preserved the cistern rainwater Captain Poldark Without his knowledge And the men of the tax authorities thought we were out looking for sardines.<eos> And 'the best French brandy Two barrels are already 'went where no man of the tax authorities can' trace them And this is going to go in the same direction.<eos> I apologize, Captain Poldark and thank you for the use of your tank.
- Four months.<eos> - In good time then.<eos> - I hope so'.<eos> - I'll put 'out in the sun, I want to begin well.<eos> - Sara 'a boy then, right?<eos> I think of him as a boy, but for me it 's the same.<eos> It's all right at home?<eos> Demelza I saw the other day, brought the egg It is growing fast, such as rhubarb in a bucket.<eos> And now 'the mistress of the kitchen He tells Prudie when to get up and when to go to bed!<eos> It 'sorry that Jim has left you and has returned to work at the mine.
- I was not hungry.<eos> I would come back before, but they called me to visit the dog of a rich girl.<eos> What's up'?<eos> Seven fatalistic, Dwight?<eos> We're going to start a philosophical debate ...<eos> - ... Or you have more reasons' personal for me that question?<eos> - We are the ones to lead the dancing?<eos> - Or do you think we're just puppets?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> What brought you to these questions at this time of night?
- It does not matter!<eos> - You are young, you have the goods ... - mortgaged.<eos> - You have a wife and a child, are respected.<eos> - Doctor, please, you will make me weep for joy.<eos> If it was your cousin Ross, I could understand.<eos> - Undergoes a process that could cost him his life, not to say that he lost his only child, his business went downhill ...<eos> - God damn you!<eos> State zitto.<eos> However it seems to have retained the respect of himself, maybe you lost.<eos> What leads you to say what '?
- Very kind of you, sir.<eos> You can remove it from what I have.<eos> What did you have?<eos> The 30 guineas that we pay, father.<eos> - 15 paid and 15 to pay. - 30?<eos> It 'an expensive investment.<eos> And we must also add the drink.<eos> I hope that others will not cost us so 'much.<eos> The clause of the marriage, so 'as that of any other law and' that as in any contract It must be respected.<eos> ... And I ask you to keep in mind, gentlemen of the jury, before issuing the verdict That a commitment made on word of honor to be maintained.
- No not yet.<eos> I saw one last year in Venice.<eos> The horses were tied to the arms and legs and they quartered.<eos> - Are you Captain McNeil?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> On the night in question, and 'true that you went down' to the beach?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Why?<eos> To prevent the looting of a ship and to disperse the rioters.<eos> And while you were reaching the beach, the accused told you about?

And if you ', you want to tell us what happened?<eos> It ', I was there', sir.<eos> Warn 'the captain that there might be danger on the beach.<eos> It was a friendly warning, intended to avoid bloodshed?<eos> Mr. Clymer, this and 'a question allusive.<eos> Let me rephrase the question, Captain Bray.<eos> - They were fighting?<eos> - And I 'thought, sir.<eos> Thank you, Captain Bray.<eos> Captain Bray The accused has accompanied you at home?
No, these are criminals who live in these crimes.<eos> What can we do?<eos> Immediately put into action.<eos> Friends And another horrible crime 'was committed on the door of our homes.<eos> Grave robbers ... a disgusting practice And it 'accomplished tonight.<eos> They took with it 'the body of the deceased loved Prudie.<eos> I have to point out As members of this village And that 'our duty Not to mention the affection we had for the body And his good lady, here Assemble a search party and go out to find it!<eos> With this purpose I ask you to prepare ...<eos> But there is 'a beastly wind tonight, the' out!<eos> I do not care if the East wind takes you away ...

Meet me at the office of Pearce noon.<eos> We will go home together.<eos> Okay, Ross.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Since you called this meeting, Ross, will speak first.<eos> - Very good.<eos> - The first to talk, but speaks loudly, my boy.<eos> Gentlemen We are all in the business of copper and we all know from experience how this area is precarious.<eos> - Did you bring us here just to remind us of our problems, Ross?<eos> - No, Francis, I asked you to come to talk about the ways in which we could solve.

Lady.<eos> - McNeil.<eos> Sorry to disturb your condolences But I have no choice.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> - Once you have said that we all have duties that we do not like to face.<eos> - Yes'.<eos> Well, I have one hour to deal with, and I will '.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Captain Poldark, arrest you in the name of the King.
- No, no, the wife of Poldark.<eos> A little chap damn shocking.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Warleggan.<eos> Ms. Poldark.<eos> Enchanted, lady.<eos> I see that you are going to ride.<eos> Oh!<eos> A gift.<eos> For my godson.<eos> What brings you to Truro?
It's also in vogue to let kids live out their own lives.<eos> But it seems like no one was interested in Grazia...<eos> Only her brother suggested a name.<eos> Luisa Krammi.<eos> Should I feel flattered or consider it an invitation to call a lawyer?<eos> But what is all this mystery?<eos> Grazia was going out with Giorgio Cournier...<eos> Why doesn't anyone want to say it?<eos> What's so wrong?<eos> Has the silence of their heels infected you?
We need Murat's help.<eos> We need Murat.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> If he doesn't come back for a while, don't worry.<eos> Goodbye mother.<eos> Goodbye Meryem.<eos> Goodbye Murat.<eos> Godspeed, my son.<eos> So long.<eos> God bless you.
I promise I'll send you off.<eos> Now please forget everything.<eos> Time will help... heal the pain.<eos> Only goodness will survive.<eos> Only fairness will live on.<eos> Like love.<eos> And happiness.<eos> May your happiness be sanctified by God.<eos> Take this cross in the name of God.<eos> God'll protect you and bring you happiness today.
He doesn't need this.<eos> Got a big cannon himself.<eos> Man's life-span is only 50 years.<eos> It's food for thought.<eos> We're going out.<eos> Master.<eos> You've been good to me a long time.<eos> If we have to carry this thing, we'd rather -<eos> Roll up your sleeve.<eos> Who feeds you as free men?
Please.<eos> Auntie Vardo!<eos> Auntie Vardo!<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - Papa's been arrested!<eos> They took Papa to the police station!<eos> No, it can't be.<eos> I hope you're satisfied now?<eos> _BAR_'m more than satisfied, _BAR_'m greatly impressed!<eos> The Lord has endowed you with the gift of foresight.
Priest...<eos> I hated Michiko for being loved by you.<eos> I couldn't forgive her for even abandoning her vows to be with you.<eos> I was jealous of her as a fellow woman.<eos> Yet I have slept with you as well.<eos> Yes...<eos> That's true.<eos> But did you ever really love me?<eos> Love? Love is an illusion.<eos> Yet, what was it that kept you alive to this day?
crunch! there go my legs<eos> Snap! snap! my thorax, too.<eos> My head's in a twain, there goes my brain<eos> Swallow, swallow...<eos> It's true, don't you see?<eos> It's true.<eos> It happens, it happens.<eos> Please.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen I do apologize for that last... Well, I hesitate to call it a pram.<eos> And talking of filth I have asked you once about the carpet.
To become the dominant...<eos> Was is der deutsches entwicklungsbund...<eos> Theme. Theme of modern poetry here in germany.<eos> We are not... amusiert?<eos> Entertained.<eos> Entertained.<eos> From now on, ants is verboten.<eos> Instead, it's skylarks, daffodils, nightingales Light brigades and...<eos> Und so weiter. Well, we must away now Or we shall be late for the races.<eos> God bless you, alles.
Humans on the High Council?<eos> Humans are nothing.<eos> They've always been nothing.<eos> Except in storybooks.<eos> - Always?<eos> - How could it be otherwise?<eos> The apes are so much smarter than we are.<eos> Well, except for you two, I guess.<eos> You're different.<eos> That's why they're looking for you.
I mean, I must tell Zaius and the others about you.<eos> You see, I know who you are.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Don't make it difficult.<eos> Your medical knowledge, the things the girl said.<eos> I know you are the two astronauts, and Galen is with you.<eos> Understand, I deeply appreciate what you've done here, what I have learned from you.<eos> - Then how could you turn us in?<eos> - Because you are fugitives.<eos> Zaius wants you, and I am loyal to Zaius.
This way.<eos> Once you have answered my questions you can get some much needed sleep, food, rest.<eos> I've been telling you the truth.<eos> I will make it easy for you.<eos> - Which apes befriended you?<eos> - There have been many apes who...<eos> - The truth!<eos> - That is the truth.<eos> It is not!<eos> There is only one ape that befriended you and that is Galen.
- He can't.<eos> - Why?<eos> You're gonna like it here, Kraik.<eos> You'll get plenty to eat.<eos> Every day?<eos> If you behave yourself.<eos> Alan!<eos> There are two times when you shake hands:<eos> When strangers meet and when friends say goodbye.<eos> God bless you both.
See here, it's a fly.<eos> Well, that's fascinating, Protus.<eos> Leuric, come on, it's your turn.<eos> See that?<eos> This, it'll expand almost anything.<eos> Look. See here.<eos> Look.<eos> See that?<eos> Look.<eos> There's something over there I want to show you and ask you about.
Are they alive<eos> - They're alive.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> Right here.<eos> - No, Bosco!<eos> - Calm down!<eos> Captain, stop him!<eos> So there you are, my children.<eos> You are very much as I imagined.<eos> Yes, I've seen you before.
Yes, I know what will happen.<eos> You will be left powerless against your enemies.<eos> You will be quite defenseless.<eos> But they will live thanks to you.<eos> That's good.<eos> It's nearly dawn.<eos> Leave as soon as it's light.<eos> Try to save yourselves.<eos> They will live!<eos> Your revenge escapes you.
I present now my story, full of mystery and intrigue, rich in irony, and most satirical.<eos> It is set deep in a possible future, so none of these events have yet occurred.<eos> But they may.<eos> Be warned, lest you end as I.<eos> In this tale, I am a fake god by occupation and a magician by inclination.<eos> Merlin is my hero.<eos> I am the puppet master.<eos> I manipulate many of the characters and events you will see.<eos> But I am invented, too, for your entertainment and amusement.<eos> And you, poor creatures, who conjured you out of the clay?
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for flying Columbia Airlines.<eos> Unfasten seat belts.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Quick.<eos> Are we here already?<eos> Are we here already?<eos> No, we've gone to Washington.<eos> - Are we here already?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> The ambulance will take you to the hospital.
Aren't you going with the others?<eos> - We're on arctal ructive duty.<eos> - On what?<eos> Arctal ructive duty.<eos> I see. And you?<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - Very well.<eos> With all these interruptions...<eos> I lost the thread.<eos> I think that everything I just explained to you will help you better understand the relativity of customs and laws.
Daisy!<eos> Daisy!<eos> - Some chocolate cake, madam.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - Sorry we're late.<eos> - OK, hurry up.<eos> - Get dressed!<eos> - Be right back.<eos> I'm going to arrange a marriage between you and Jordan.<eos> I'll sort of fling you together, lock you up in the linen closet or push you out to sea in a boat, all that sort of thing.
You know, there's only one thing I'm sorry about.<eos> What's that?<eos> That you're not playing, knocking heads.<eos> I'm afraid I'm a little too old for that.<eos> No.<eos> You never had the guts to begin with.<eos> You're playing like a bunch of girls.<eos> Every one of you.<eos> Candy-asses.<eos> You know who's beating you out there?
Captain...<eos> I ask you a personal favour.<eos> Let the lady come with me.<eos> It's impossible, only you.<eos> Move this block!<eos> Duce!<eos> Are we going to surrender without even an attempt to fight?<eos> - It would be useless.<eos> - It's true then, you're deserting us!<eos> How dare you say I'm deserting you!
- Just to live in peace, like a church mouse.<eos> I would like to get back to the point.<eos> It's important that I find the witness... whom Mario thinks he recognized.<eos> Who is it ?<eos> So far, I only know it's a woman.<eos> I-I-I don't know anything about a woman.<eos> Yes, I want to call Frankfurt, the Hotel Weber.<eos> Number ? Just a minute.<eos> 347-229.<eos> The-The-The number I just gave you for Frankfurt.
- 26 minutes.<eos> - Your instructions were complicated.<eos> The money has to be counted, stacked, transported.<eos> It just isn't physically possible.<eos> You'd be surprised what's physically possible.<eos> The clock's running.<eos> 26 minutes.<eos> After that, we scratch 'em off one per minute.<eos> Your attention, please!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, it might interest you to know the city of New York has agreed to pay for your release.
All aboard!<eos> ... in the meantime, I ask you to think seriously about your decisions last November.<eos> You have asked for the New Deal that is an ancient deal in all its finance.<eos> You have what you asked for.<eos> I ask you to abide by your decision.<eos> You have been warned a thousand times.<eos> Those who warned you should now bow their heads.<eos> Even though the truth be on their side, you have paid the price, democratic America.<eos> And now it is your turn to bear the burden in silence like men keeping America safe for democracy.<eos> Good evening. God bless you.
What a fuckin' lemon!<eos> Lousy stinkin' proletariat!<eos> We're nice guys!<eos> But you're mean!<eos> Asshole!<eos> Why aren't these bastards stopping?<eos> We'll have to steal another one.<eos> I feel like a Resistance fighter, minus the fur-lined jacket and the beret.<eos> Comrades!<eos> My car fascinate you that much?
I'm Mabel Longhetti.<eos> I live with Nick.<eos> And you - handsome.<eos> - Billy Tidrow. - Can I have some bread?<eos> - Right. Right. - And they call me Mighty Mouse.<eos> - Mickey Mouse.<eos> Mighty Mouse.<eos> Raise 'em.<eos> Here's to everybody. Welcome.<eos> God bless you.
- Okay.<eos> - You do it. Go ahead.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Mama, you want me to do it?<eos> - I'll do it. - Do it.<eos> Stop sweating.<eos> Please, quiet.<eos> - Please, everybody.<eos> - Quiet! - Mama has an announcement. - Hey.<eos> - Now, you know that Nicky loves you all.

Get out of my beauty salon!<eos> Beat it, hon.<eos> And you, Miss...<eos> Davenport.<eos> Dawn Davenport.<eos> I'm a thief and a shitkicker, and...<eos> I'd like to be famous.<eos> I see.<eos> You're quite striking.<eos> We are always curious as to what drew you here... to Les Lipstick.
Hey, can we have two bowls of noodles?<eos> Sure.<eos> Damn it.<eos> You're from Kurokuwa!<eos> Himejiro!<eos> Himejiro!<eos> Himejiro!<eos> Cut off my clothes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Master Shirakubi told us to keep watch on you.
Hang in there, Himejiro!<eos> Sir... When a Bohachi man dies, he goes to Hell.<eos> Himejiro!<eos> I'll tend to the body before I leave. You go now.<eos> I cannot believe the Kurokuwa men... Throwing away their lives without regret.<eos> Bohachi women, because of you, I've lost two of my men.<eos> You will pay dearly for that.<eos> Just kill us!<eos> I've heard that... female Bohachi are women, yet not women<eos> First I will test the truth in that rumor, then I will kill you.
Masa...<eos> Kame...<eos> let him go.<eos> Boss! We shouldn't cpmcern ourselves with trivialities like this all the time.<eos> I appreciate this, sir.<eos> You bastard!<eos> The next time you show up forget being rolled up and thrown into the sea you'll be shredded to bits and fed to the pigs!<eos> You bastard!<eos> Oh?<eos> What brings you here?

I am listening to you, here I am<eos> Precisely at midnight we'll be here to take you away<eos> Now that we have the key you have nothing to fear<eos> - Ouch!<eos> - What is the matter?<eos> There's something in my eye!<eos> Have a look, don't touch<eos> Blow, for pity's sake<eos> Precisely at midnight, I'll await you, my soul Already I wish to hasten the moment when I shall be bound to you<eos> Now I want to warn you, dear one, that your letter so that my disguise would not have been in vain... His disguise?
Ready?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We've lost them good.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello, boss.<eos> This is Bekir.<eos> We brought the girl we caught at the show to the depot up the hills.<eos> Nadja told you to take her to the yacht.
There's a killer among us, who can take the shape of whoever he wants.<eos> Only Professor Krater and his wife can give us the correct answer.<eos> Suddenly, we came here again.<eos> How could this happen?<eos> Ion, candide and andreon beams converted material to energy.<eos> Who converted you to talk this nonse?<eos> - Search around and inform me if you find anything suspicious.<eos> - Yes, sir. - Mr. Tourist, sit there and wait for us.<eos> - There? - Yes!<eos> Ok, I'll park here, sit like a flower pot and wait for you.
Come on, how can that do this?<eos> The light energy will take you through time, back to...<eos> - your home!<eos> - Brother, I don't like this.<eos> Better I go with a cab. Any cabstand here?<eos> Ion beams ready!<eos> - Don't move, Mr. Tourist.<eos> - Oki doki.<eos> Brothers, I thank you all a lot.<eos> God bless you.
It is like a nightmare, it keeps me awake at night.<eos> My uncles, my aunts, my cousins from all over Europe, the kisses, the hand-shakes, the wishes,<eos> You can open your heart to me, Your Majesty. My affection for you is the same as it was the day you called me to Munich.<eos> I have not forgotten you saved me from poverty, welcomed me into your arms.<eos> I took up your invitation right away because I realized you needed me.<eos> Forget what happened in the past.<eos> You can betray friends, even their trust and still love them.<eos> Be magnanimous, try to forgive.<eos> I know that nobody else can advise you like I can because my words are born of a very honest and deep feeling.<eos> What is bothering you, my friend?
"and you will be taken to the glowing beauty "of a valley.<eos> "But you have to cross it very quickly therefore you cannot stop<eos> "where peace reigns."<eos> Oh, Rudolph, royal ancestor of mine.<eos> This is how your descendant will enter the territories of your empire.<eos> "And so you will reach "the highest peaks of the Gottardo,<eos> "where the eternal lakes are glowing.<eos> "They fill themselves "with the water fallen from the sky.<eos> "There, you will part with the German soil.<eos> "With fast course, another river will bring you to Italy,
Ah yes, they left early this morning.<eos> Where?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Of course.<eos> I gave them directions.<eos> You don't want me to come back.<eos> I wanted to be a sculptor ...<eos> an architect ...<eos> I love music ... and I love you.<eos> You better get away ... someone's looking for you.
- Please.<eos> Mrs. Baxter.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - I couldn't find him.<eos> I saw Christine!<eos> - He left.<eos> Find him!<eos> You must warn him!<eos> - Get him back!<eos> She told you to leave.

How old are you?<eos> I don't know. 1 0,000 y ears 20,000, 30,000, 50,000 y ears, I don't know!<eos> Anyone able to giv e information concerning murder suspe ct Aden Re y is requested to contact the police.<eos> Stop, I want to s ee that.<eos> That!<eos> We hav en't got time !<eos> My brethren, hear the message of the Messiah. Crucified a thousand times by your sins, he came for your redemption. You killed him...<eos> The lily of the fields who came down among us to share lov e. H e found nothing but sordidness, treachery and death.<eos> H e could hav e plunged mankind into darkness... Yet he preferred to fall, fall... in order to redeem your sins.<eos> From the bottom of my bleeding heart, I tell you that the holy spirit is forsaking you.
You want to oppose Okubo?<eos> You should not have let him see your weakness.<eos> Look, Tetsu...<eos> I'm in an awkward situation.<eos> You understand?<eos> Nakahara gave me his word... that the bankers will grant me a loan without collateral.<eos> I can't let an opportunity like that slip away.<eos> But Doi needn't know.<eos> Come on men.<eos> Just do as I'm asking you to.
So what?<eos> They won't give us a week to get back.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Besides, they gotta give us all that green, regardless.<eos> Money for you, for me and for him.<eos> Now we run this shit-bird's ass all the way to the brig save his per diem and ours, split it and spend it on the way home.<eos> - Well, let's shag ass!<eos> - You're goddamn right!<eos> Buddusky, you're the honcho.<eos> A driver outside will take you to the bus.
? Now you're here ?<eos> ? May you ?<eos> ? stay and share the joy ?<eos> Now that's the best thing to cheer me up since we got here.<eos> ? Now you're here ?<eos> ? May you ?<eos> ? stay and share the joy ?<eos> Bravo.<eos> Good evening my friends.<eos> Did you think I had forgotten you?
How are you Mr. Conway?<eos> I dreamt for a moment that I was back again.<eos> Back again?<eos> Where?<eos> Where?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I don't know whether I've been mad, and now sane or, I was sane for a time and now mad again.<eos> Mr. Conway.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> The whole world knows your name and wonders what happened to you?
-Watch where you're goin'!<eos> -I'm crazy!<eos> You're outta your mind. Didn't you see that light?<eos> The light was red, right? -Slow down.<eos> Will you slow down?<eos> -What does red mean? I wish you'd slow down your mouth a little.<eos> What is that guy, crazy?<eos> Hey, jerk!<eos> Now's the time!<eos> Good luck and God bless you.
Throw that gun out in front of you.<eos> You know, I get 200 for one of these.<eos> I wouldn't wanna lose it.<eos> Turn around.<eos> You and two others broke out of Saint-Laurent last night, didn't you? - That's right.<eos> - And the others are at the boat?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - And the boat's no good.<eos> Not worth a damn.<eos> Been expecting you.
- Oh, Klucky, you look so silly.<eos> Oh, look. There it is, behind you.<eos> Well, hello.<eos> - Where did you come from?<eos> - Oh, please don't tell Prince John.<eos> Mama said he'll chop off my head.<eos> Oh, don't be afraid.<eos> You've done nothing wrong.<eos> Oh, Marian, what a bonny wee bunny.<eos> Who does this young archer remind you of?
Hey, you guys, not so fast.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> I told Skippy he was shooting too high.<eos> I'm so very glad he did.<eos> Now I get to meet all of you.<eos> - Gee, you're very beautiful.<eos> - Are you gonna marry Robin Hood?<eos> Mama said you and Robin Hood are sweethearts.<eos> Well... You see, that was several years ago before I left for London.<eos> - Did he ever kiss you?
Mama said you and Robin Hood are sweethearts.<eos> Well... You see, that was several years ago before I left for London.<eos> - Did he ever kiss you?<eos> - Well... no. But he carved our initials on this tree.<eos> - I remember it so well.<eos> - You gonna have any kids?<eos> My mom gots a lot of kids.<eos> Oh, he's probably forgotten all about me.<eos> Oh, not Robin Hood.<eos> I bet he'll storm the castle gates, fight the guards, rescue ya and drag you off to Sherwood Forest.
Not so loud, sire.<eos> Remember, only you and I know, and your secret is my secret.<eos> Stop! Stop hissing in my ear.<eos> Secret?<eos> What secret?<eos> Why, the capture of Robin Hood, sire.<eos> That insolent blackguard.<eos> I'll show him who wears the crown!<eos> I share your loathing, sire.<eos> That scurrilous scoundrel who fooled you with that silly disguise, who dared to rob you and made you look ridiculous.
Perreau, I take care everything.<eos> Now, this room cost you each 100 francs a month.<eos> We only earn 200 francs a month.<eos> But this room, we pay half? .<eos> No space in Paris.<eos> Very costly.<eos> No room, you in street.<eos> In street police come.<eos> Ask question.<eos> Send you home.
First stage removal.<eos> Streets prohibited to non-permits in one hour.<eos> Streets prohibited to non-permits in one hour.<eos> This conversation with Governor Henry C.

He was very strange towards the end.<eos> He didn't touch me for months.<eos> And sometimes for no reason at all, he'd start to cry.<eos> I saw him cry more than once.<eos> Old people do that.<eos> Do they?<eos> I can't figure this Simonson.<eos> If I was like him, rich, important plenty to eat real bourbon and a girl like you you wouldn't see me in church.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I've been looking all over the building for you.
If I didn't know you better, I'd swear you had some class.<eos> Johnny!<eos> Luther said you were somethin' to see today.<eos> Alva, I gotta get faster tying up that bundle.<eos> - I give them too much time to think.<eos> - Oh, boushwah.<eos> I used to make that switch with slower hands than you got.<eos> Up and down Broadway was my best game.<eos> Me and Luther didn't make much on it but it wasn't so touchy.<eos> Them marks can beat you up awful bad when they catch you.
Please don't do that.<eos> Not my clothes!<eos> Please, don't do that.<eos> Humiliating such a rich man?<eos> Hey, you! You're a fisherman, too.<eos> I'll finish all of you.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm very angry with the fishermen.<eos> I can't stand the sight of them.<eos> Because I move around with you, they shun me.
- Take your hands off, she's mine.<eos> May I introduce to you...<eos> This is Felice and this is...<eos> The solace of the garrison!<eos> Look at me.<eos> I offer the sum... of 1.000.000 Dollar for the head... of this man!<eos> - Stay out of this lady, Castello!<eos> - Pull down her skirt!<eos> Excuse me gentlemen, but there is an atmosphere here... that doesn't match mine at all.<eos> In your defence, I will assume that that parvenu next door influenced you in an unfortunate way.
Unsaddle him and rub him down!<eos> Your Highness!<eos> Halt!<eos> So i t wasn' t a vain search!<eos> I shan' t let you go now!<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> To find her!<eos> Why did you search for her?<eos> To ask her to marry me!<eos> What prevents you from doing so?
♪ At attention<eos> ♪ Oh, nothing can delight so<eos> - ♪ As does the part that lies between - ♪ Her left toe<eos> - I'd like my supper now, please.<eos> - It won't be long, Sergeant.<eos> Och, you don't want to let them worry you.<eos> Why don't you have a wee drink?<eos> No, thank you, not just now.<eos> I think you all ought to know that I am here on official business.<eos> I am here to investigate the disappearance of a young girl as doubtless, the harbour master has already told you by now.
Those are my shoes!<eos> Going to the bonfire tonight?<eos> What are you playing?<eos> I've composed a brand new tune.<eos> Let me give you a little taste.<eos> Is unique.<eos> It has no rivals.<eos> - Brava, Gradisca.<eos> - Go! Go!<eos> Now, Dad, we'll watch them light the bonfire, then I'll take you home.
Shall we catch it, boys?<eos> What a moron!<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Whas happened?<eos> I'll tell you in the car, Uncle.<eos> Why in the car?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Quite near.<eos> To Aunt Zaira's farm.<eos> A relative's come from America and wants to say hi to you.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...<eos> - One is missing.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Here is the missing one.<eos> He drowned.<eos> He drowned.<eos> This is the ceremony of death.<eos> The grave receives you with love.<eos> Surrender yourselves to death.<eos> Return what was loaned to you.
I was alone at home in bed, and Suddenly she stormed into my room.<eos> I swear I did not do anything!<eos> What will they do to me?<eos> You are in the Bastille.<eos> So what have you done wrong!<eos> You committed treason.<eos> A conspiracy with your wife and the Duke of Buckingham planned.<eos> No, no ...<eos> Do you know your accuser?<eos> Who brought you here?
They locked on and boarded us.<eos> We saw them.<eos> They were Draconians.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That will be all.<eos> I hope you will soon recover from your ordeal.<eos> Well, Your Highness?<eos> These men are your servants.<eos> They are saying what they have been ordered to say.<eos> On this occasion, we have more than our servants to confront you with.
His Highness feels that such an interrogation would help to convince you that they are not agents of Draconia.<eos> I shall have them brought here immediately.<eos> I suggest His Highness joins me here.<eos> We shall question them together.<eos> -On your feet.<eos> -Hmm, why?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Move.<eos> Not unless you give me some good reason.<eos> The President wants you.
I entreat you as a brother<eos> You can trust me.<eos> I owe you much<eos> When my father and my brothers banished me you showed me pity and sheltered me<eos> You reconciled my father to me I was welcomed home and forgiven thanks to you<eos> I am glad that I could help you<eos> It is time to depart<eos> Bless us, holy father.<eos> Bless us for battle<eos> Bless the princes and the armies May God assist you in battle and bring you victory

Has he really come back?<eos> Our father has come back<eos> Who brought the good news?<eos> We were the first The gudok-players?<eos> The gudok-players, father<eos> Prince Galitsky's men?<eos> No, we're not Galitsky's men<eos> Weren't you on the rebel's side?<eos> Others were, not us, we are Igor's men<eos> Well, God bless you.
The delegate from Alpha Centauri has arrived, Your Majesty.<eos> He will present his credentials to you shortly.<eos> Thank you, Torbis.<eos> We wait now only for the chairman delegate from Earth.<eos> Then the discussions can begin.<eos> You will persist then in this folly?<eos> Nothing I can say will deter you?<eos> Hepesh, you have already had your say in the Grand Council.<eos> The question has been discussed and decided.<eos> Decided by you, Torbis, and the fools who support you.
a new and richer world.<eos> -Now, after 500 years of...<eos> -Exploitation. expert scientific and technical aid,<eos> -we have steered you to the verge of...<eos> -Disaster!<eos> To the verge of independence.<eos> Segregation.<eos> ...rights and privileges as citizens of empire.<eos> You, the peoples of Solos, have given us much.<eos> -And we in return have given you...
Right!<eos> confiscate the smutty books, maddox.<eos> Sir phillip, prithee nay!<eos> Listen, mate Don't come that phillip sidney bit with me.<eos> I'm not a bloody tudor at all.<eos> I'm gaskell of the vice squad and this is sergeant maddox.<eos> Where's he gone?<eos> Sir phillip, prithee rest awhile.<eos> Look, this is the last time<eos> I'm warning you.
Take heed, my lord<eos> Kevin and bruce are here.<eos> It's so nice here, isn't it, darling?<eos> Oh, it's beautiful.<eos> It's... it's paris all over again.<eos> Excuse me, do you mind if I join you?<eos> Uh... no, no, not at all.<eos> Are you sure you don't mind?<eos> Uh, yes, yes, absolutely.<eos> You're sure I won't be disturbing you?
Ursula, lift her petticoats.<eos> Unlace her bodice and show her chest.<eos> That's nothing.<eos> We treat others worse here.<eos> A salad of thorns, peppered. or dipped in vinegar, pushed in with the point of the knife.<eos> That's what suits these sluts.<eos> We must tame her.<eos> Let her serve as an altar in her turn.<eos> How can you indulge in such infamies?<eos> Take heed lest Heaven strike you down for your sins!
You should study, Lisa.<eos> Come to the city in August.<eos> I'll get you into a technical school.<eos> That was last year, in 1941.<eos> Have faith, Lisa. Don't give up hoping.<eos> Maybe you will find happiness around the corner.<eos> And maybe it will be tomorrow.<eos> Only I have already turned my corner.<eos> Sonya, read another poem.<eos> I loved you once:
Get ready for the bath.<eos> Take it, Rita.<eos> Section, halt!<eos> At ease.<eos> Break ranks.<eos> - Going fishing, Comrade Sergeant?<eos> - No, swimming.<eos> The water's so cold you'll freeze to death.<eos> It's much better in the bathhouse.<eos> What if a crab grabs you?
Zhenya, were you really afraid?<eos> Not really, maybe only later.<eos> I'd have been really scared without you close by.<eos> You know what they say:<eos> Company in distress makes trouble less.<eos> They haven't left, they're camping.<eos> We must move our position.<eos> Thank God those Germans don't have a professional hunter with them.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I smelled you out long ago.
Galka Chetvertak fell in action.<eos> And Lisa Brichkina has been drowned in the marsh.<eos> With Sonya, that makes three that we've lost.<eos> That's how it is.<eos> On the other hand, we've kept the Germans circling for 24 hours already.<eos> So I propose we drink to our three sisters.<eos> That we drink to their glory!<eos> Why haven't you executed my orders?<eos> What orders?<eos> I ordered you to pull back eastward.
- You keep this paper good, now.<eos> - You want to stay with us a spell?<eos> Sure be obliged.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Now you listen to me, you hear?<eos> You people from Louisiana, ain't you?<eos> Well, there's plenty of work for you back there:<eos> Chopping cotton, cutting cane.<eos> Good jobs with people who know you.

Perfect for what?<eos> Midnight is the optimum time for any summation.<eos> Wait a minute, just exactly what are we summoning?<eos> I think it's about time the wizard came clean.<eos> Oh, time the wizard came clean.<eos> Ha ha ha, you know that's very poetic, Paul, in a prosaic kind of way.<eos> Look, we may not be poets, but we do have a right to know what's going on.<eos> The people speak!<eos> A little democratic action, ay?<eos> Well, let me remind you, my darlings, that this company is not a democratic enterprise.
Sorry.<eos> We had no idea.<eos> So, what's your angle?<eos> A little bit of this and that.<eos> Whatever happened to the Takigawa clan?<eos> They're still around.<eos> The cops are watching 'em, so they act like they're a legit business.<eos> Which means we get nothing from 'em.<eos> He took care of us last year, but not anymore.<eos> He milked what he could outta you, then tossed you out.
Say... pull over, over here, would you?<eos> Okay, whatever you say.<eos> Now what?<eos> Let's get out a spell.<eos> How much money did you make last year?<eos> I reckon about $5,000.<eos> Suppose I give you $10,000 for that truck of yours?<eos> - You serious?<eos> - I am.<eos> And I keep my mouth shut... and I don't say nothing about the truck... and I never seen neither one of the two of you?
You found Paradise in America.<eos> You made a good living, had police protection and there were courts of law.<eos> You didn't need a friend like me.<eos> But now you come to me and say,<eos> "Don Corleone, give me justice."<eos> But you don't ask with respect.<eos> You don't offer friendship.<eos> You don't even think to call me Godfather.<eos> You come on my daughter's wedding day and ask me to murder for money.<eos> I ask you for justice.
Stop it, Tommy!<eos> Granny, where's my da and ma?<eos> Ma's dead.<eos> What does 'dead' mean?<eos> You go up to heaven.<eos> What's heaven?<eos> My teacher says it's a beautiful house up in the sky.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Oh, my poor girls.<eos> What have they done to you?
No.<eos> A license given by the authorities...<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> 008 has three selectors.<eos> One special washing for light clothes... one normal, and one, of course, for heavy washing.<eos> The drier is graduated, but this is normal.<eos> Of course, the trial is free.<eos> You promise nothing.<eos> A demonstrator shows you how it works.
Hello, moviegoers.<eos> This is Mr. Jag... speaking to you for Dreamland Studios.
Just downtown.<eos> Anywhere near Howard Street.<eos> Oh, meeting someone?<eos> Who?<eos> !<eos> My boyfriend and a couple other guys.<eos> Why?<eos> Going to a gang-bang or something?<eos> What?<eos> Hey, what's with you two?
Count, I'm leaving!<eos> But, they're disappeared?<eos> Count!<eos> I wanted to thank you for the delicious... Hey, no one answers here!<eos> I salute you and I'm leaving!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Dr. Rossi!<eos> - Yes?<eos> I hope you have decided not to leave!<eos> And who leaves you anymore! That is, I meant...
- But I couldn't imagine...!<eos> I said it right?<eos> How did I do, did I do right?<eos> It came spontaneously!<eos> This is the first time I harangue!<eos> Danke schön, miss!<eos> Bravo!<eos> - Bitte schön!<eos> Seen?<eos> No legal experience, no degree, I put you all into the trap!
- Order!<eos> - Yes, Mr. President!<eos> The court withdraws to deliberate in closed session!<eos> You'll see now!<eos> - The president doesn't joke ever!<eos> What's up?<eos> Where they going?<eos> The council chamber, if they get there!<eos> - To me, it's a great game!<eos> And I thank you very much for this wonderful evening!
Mistake!<eos> Now I must speak plain.<eos> God is love.<eos> - Love?<eos> - Love.<eos> As water is wet, as jade is hard, as bread is life, so God is love.<eos> Mrs. Pamela Treadwell, can you love?<eos> Can your blood bubble, flesh melt, thighs twitch, heart burst for love?<eos> Your Lordship, I'm a married woman...<eos> Remember the commandment I gave you:
Who was that who cried out?<eos> The prophet, Princess.<eos> The prophet?<eos> He of whom the Tetrarch is afraid?<eos> It's the prophet Iokanaan.<eos> Is it your pleasure that I bid them bring your litter, Princess?<eos> The night is so fair in the garden.<eos> He says terrible things about my mother, does he not?<eos> Yes. He says terrible things about her.<eos> Princess, the Tetrarch prays you to return to the feast!
You know all about my plans<eos> I won't bother you after this Here is 50 taels of gold<eos> It's a small present<eos> I'll take care of the matters for you<eos> You took his wealth, his wife and all that you give me is just 50 taels, is it?<eos> Let's throw in an additional 50, okay<eos> Mr. Li, you've got to show your sincerity<eos> Mr. Lu of Tai Ming Fu is a well-known man I think this job costs over 100 taels<eos> Sir, here's 500 I'll pick up the body tomorrow morning<eos> Mr. Cai, a friend is waiting for you Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you
Hello, you two.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> His nibs wants to see us.<eos> You did well, Overlords.<eos> Now the way to Skybase lies open.<eos> -You don't stand a chance, Varan.<eos> -We're prepared to die.<eos> What good will that do?<eos> Believe me, the Doctor will help you find a cure.
Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Doctor?<eos> Yes?<eos> Lethbridge-Stewart.<eos> Ah.<eos> Is everything all right there?<eos> Yes fine, Brigadier.<eos> Yes, things couldn't be better.<eos> Yates and Benton came to look for you.
No one can succeed who opposes the Daleks.<eos> For every guerilla cell that you destroy, another one springs up.<eos> They have stolen your time machines and copied them.<eos> They steal your weapons, your explosives.<eos> These criminals will be exterminated.<eos> The Daleks will destroy them.<eos> If only you would let me recruit more human security guards...<eos> Humans are treacherous and unreliable!<eos> Not all humans.<eos> I have served you faithfully.
Come, time is short.<eos> My dear man, how can I tell you what I don't know myself?<eos> But you were in contact with the guerillas?<eos> But not through choice.<eos> Look, they were going to kill him.<eos> I know the Doctor would help you if he could.<eos> I am trying to help him!<eos> I've already save his life.<eos> Yes, for your own purposes.<eos> Look, if you do not tell me everything that manager knew about these criminals - where they operate from, what their plans are - then the Daleks will destroy both of you.

Don't resist, cadet.<eos> Now everyone can do everything.<eos> Everybody is running from everything, as far as they can.<eos> Also from the royal chambers, where we met in a sweeter life.<eos> You know me?<eos> The cadet I knew died long ago.<eos> Otherwise we wouldn't be giving performances at his fiancée's wedding.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You said that a king set upon the throne with a woman's help, and looking for pleasure in a woman's arms, was the cause of decadence.<eos> But the King treated you like children.
So the two of you have worked together... to lead me into this deep situation?<eos> You bastards!<eos> Well, it isn't easy to sit by and... watch your own wife with another man.<eos> And, Koman, did you fool me too?<eos> I know you are mad, but there were deep reasons.<eos> Please believe my heart.<eos> Shut up, you stupid woman!<eos> Shut up!<eos> It was my mistake to be bewitched by her, but you are really terrible to try... to rob a man of his property this way!<eos> It's money, not duty that keeps you alive!
And you two started all this!<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> Don't blame Koman.<eos> Your anger is natural, but I did it for him.<eos> We're not even human, please overlook us.<eos> My servant's words moved me deeply.<eos> Koman, I give you up from this moment on.<eos> We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.<eos> Lift your faces.<eos> If you're sincere, drink the saké that I brought you.
I only regret that I let that rascal... Sangoro get away alive.<eos> Sangoro?<eos> That is my son Sentaro's childhood name.<eos> And I've heard his wife was a geisha.<eos> Does that mean?<eos> This is my cloth, so this 100 ryo!<eos> Gengobe is Soemon? !<eos> Sengoro!<eos> Your anger is only natural, but my son left home very young and had never seen your face.<eos> He knew you as Gengobe.
She got ﬁred.<eos> Word got around the clubs in Shinjuku and no one will hire her.<eos> I see.<eos> Mari's unlucky with men.<eos> Choko, Senmitsu.<eos> — Mari's our street sis.<eos> — Well, that's true.<eos> Mari, myself, Choko and Senmitsu, we're all orphans without a home to go back to.<eos> We've all got to stick together and help Mari out.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.
What do you want?<eos> Slash the the head and leave the hide intact.<eos> I will slash what I slash.<eos> Bravo!<eos> I have achieved my aim.<eos> Now I must ask Doña Maria whether she means to love me.<eos> If not then she must die at my sword.<eos> But for that I must asume the voice of my brother Felipe.<eos> Doña Maria, come outside.<eos> He whom you invited for the hour of nine is come and awaits you with burning desire.
You grey doormat, do you to dare threaten me?<eos> I am a young nobleman.<eos> I shall go deep into the woods and perform heroic feats there, asaulting and murdering whoever I meet.<eos> And you, rotten head, stay here.<eos> I have avenged my rage on you.<eos> What a woeful drama to behold.<eos> My father has been murdered.<eos> His blood stains the floor.<eos> Doña Maria, come outside.<eos> He whom you invited for the hour of nine is come and awaits you with burning desire.
Now no one will disturb your rest.<eos> Prof. Walker is dead.<eos> I did it.<eos> And also the woman can't do you any harm anymore, my darling.<eos> Are you happy now?<eos> Are you?<eos> Please speak!<eos> Dear parishioners, let us pray.<eos> Brothers.<eos> Praise the Lord and thank him for the good he does to you.
- They're not here.<eos> I can see that!<eos> What's the matter with'em?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> - Perhaps they've got flu.<eos> Flu!<eos> They should eat more fresh fruit!<eos> Right!<eos> Now, self-defense!<eos> Tonight I shall be carryin' on from where we got to last week... when I was showin' you how to defend yourselves against anyone... who attacks you armed with a piece of fresh fruit.
Like someone who attacks you with a pointed stick.<eos> Pointed stick?<eos> We want to learn how to defend ourselves against pointed sticks, do we?<eos> Gettin' all high and mighty, eh?<eos> Fresh fruit not good enough for you, eh?<eos> Well, let me tell you somethin', my lad!<eos> When you're walkin' home tonight and some great homicidal maniac... comes after you with a bunch of loganberries, don't come cryin' to me!<eos> Right!<eos> And now the passion fruit.<eos> When your assailant lunges at you with a passion fruit, like thus...
Oh, you mean on the sign?<eos> A lot of Yanks are separated from their units.<eos> They're roaming' the woods and they're desperate.<eos> You think Miss Martha is gonna tell 'em about Mr. McB?<eos> 'Course she'll tell 'em.<eos> That's why she went out there.<eos> So, take care, ma'am.<eos> - Captain!<eos> Captain- - Yes, ma'am?<eos> Our prayers go with you.
No, I cannot permit it.<eos> One or two of you would be no protection.<eos> Your presence here might draw attention to us... and provoke the Yankees into burning us down.<eos> Good night, gentlemen.<eos> Thank you for your concern.<eos> I'd be right proud... to pay my compliments to them young ladies.<eos> That is very gentlemanly of you, Captain.<eos> I'll tell them.<eos> Come on, boys.<eos> God bless you, gentlemen.
That shouldn't be hard for you to do.<eos> I've reached a very difficult decision.<eos> I hope it's the right one.<eos> By this time tomorrow, his leg will be starting to mortify.<eos> There's no death worse than one from gangrene... and I cannot let him die... inch-by-inch in screaming agony.<eos> The only way to prevent that is to amputate.<eos> - That mean you gonna cut off his leg?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But you ain't a doctor.<eos> If he lives and blames you for making him a cripple, what you gonna say?
And he forced me to do what he wanted.<eos> We understand, Carol.<eos> He made me do the most terrible things.<eos> Where the hell is everybody?<eos> Edwina, you go sit in my chair.<eos> Hallie, stay by me.<eos> We must give him no provocation.<eos> Well, well.<eos> All the little seminar darlings.<eos> What is the good lady "seminaring" you in now?
Toodle-oo! Bye!<eos> Bye! But you still haven't told us much about him, Polly.<eos> Not even his christian name.<eos> What is it, Polly?<eos> Well, it's, um, um...<eos> Keep it, girls. Here comes madame Dubonnet!<eos> Ah, tiens, tiens, mes enfants!<eos> This is no way to behave.<eos> Now then, all of you to your classroom...<eos> Where mademoiselle Alice is waiting to instruct you in petit pois.
Sir, I mean.<eos> Cut out this clever talk about millicents.<eos> Just because the police haven't picked you up doesn't mean that you've not been up to some nastiness.<eos> There was a bit of nastiness last night.<eos> Some very extreme nastiness, yes?<eos> A few of a certain Billy-boy's friends were ambulanced off late.<eos> Your name was mentioned. The words got to me by the usual channels.<eos> Certain friends of yours were named also.<eos> Nobody can prove anything about anybody, as usual. I'm warning you, little Alex being a good friend to you as always the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself!<eos> What gets into you all?
I was quite enjoying that.<eos> Good. I'm glad.<eos> How many did I get right?<eos> It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to making a complete recovery.<eos> When do I get out, then?<eos> I'm sure it won't be long now.<eos> So I waited and, O my brothers I got a lot better munching away at eggiwegs and lomticks of toast and lovely steakie-wakes.<eos> And then one day they said I was going to have a very special visitor.<eos> Just wait outside for a moment, would you, Officer?<eos> I'm afraid my change of schedule has thrown you.
By the authority of our late Governor, Sainte Marthe.<eos> Assuring me full powers until such time as a new election is held.<eos> Here!<eos> His Majesty's proclamation has been delayed.<eos> The matter of a few days, a mere formality.<eos> Should one more stone be torn from our city walls, you will be dead before it touches the ground.<eos> Stop!<eos> Work will cease from this moment, pending the arrival of the proclamation.<eos> - Well done, Father.<eos> - God bless you, Father.
- Well done, Father.<eos> - God bless you, Father.<eos> - Only you could have done that, Father.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Good, Father.<eos> Good.<eos> We'll always think of you, Father, for what you've done.<eos> - Well done, Grandier.<eos> - Well done.<eos> - God bless you.
- Out you go, pretty little birdie.<eos> - Fly away.<eos> Another Protestant bird for your bag, Richelieu.<eos> Honorably done, Your Majesty.<eos> Bye-bye, blackbird!<eos> "Father Moussault was a very good man.<eos> "It was God's will, but his death leaves us with a problem.<eos> "We need a new Father Confessor.<eos> "I have never met you, Father Grandier,<eos> "but God has often put you into my thoughts lately."
More wedges.<eos> Please, God, don't let this pain make me forget you.<eos> Any confession?<eos> He called on God to give him strength.<eos> His god is the Devil and its own.<eos> Made him insensible to pain.<eos> Pay no attention to these tears.<eos> - They are the Devil's tears.<eos> - Confess?<eos> There are 6,000 Christian souls waiting for you in the marketplace.
Devil!<eos> Devil!<eos> Devil!<eos> Forgive us, O God, who condemned thee and Judas Iscariot, the traitor.<eos> For he presses on thee with perpetual flame, who shall see the end of time to the wicked, cursed into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the Devil and his angels.<eos> For thee, this one and the angels are prepared worms which never die.<eos> Thou art the chief of accursed murder, thou are the author of incest, the head of sacrilege, the master of the worst actions, the teacher of heretics.<eos> I must ask your forgiveness, priest, for what I must do.<eos> But you can make a speech if you like.<eos> And before the fire is lit, I shall strangle you.
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.<eos> The jet must be fueled and ready to go in half an hour.<eos> Skeleton crew.<eos> They must be volunteers.<eos> Tell them the man is dangerous.<eos> I'll read you this note which was delivered at 8:00 this morning.<eos> "To the City of San Francisco.<eos> You double-crossed me for the last time.<eos> I'm warning you to have my $200,000 in a jet airplane ready and waiting.<eos> I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00 and tell you about the hostages who I will be happy to kill if you don't do exactly what I say. Scorpio. "
- Orderly.<eos> - Sir?<eos> Please take the female ape to its quarters. Yes, sir.<eos> We have to get this to the commission immediately.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I've received an official notification from the president, ratifying the recommendations made by this commission in light of the tape recordings delivered to us by Dr Hasslein.<eos> Now, if you'll just be seated, we'll get right down to business.<eos> Now, let me review our conclusions.<eos> One: by a majority vote, the commission finds no solid evidence for hostility by either ape towards humans as at present constituted in this year of our Lord 1 973.<eos> Let me remind you that this was by a majority vote.
Stay right there.<eos> If you move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off.<eos> - What the hell's that?<eos> - What are you doin'?<eos> Turn around.<eos> Who's the boss here?<eos> Who's runnin' this outfit? You are?<eos> What are you doin' here?<eos> - Just runnin' around.<eos> - Who sent you down here?
Outside.<eos> Go take care of him.<eos> Outside?<eos> You were gone so long.<eos> It must have been rough.<eos> The roads to St. Pierre are bad, and with the storm...<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> No, I'm tired.<eos> Poor Fernand came upstairs and fell fast asleep.<eos> Carmen sat by the door, waiting for you.
And I find that it hasn't been torn at all.<eos> - What? - No. Don't smoke in here.<eos> You'll also find that that one isn't torn either.<eos> Sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen, but I think you'll probably find that it hasn't been torn at all.<eos> - Hello, Henry.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I'd like to go for a walk.<eos> Will you take my arm?<eos> Now, ladies and gentlemen, for my pièce de résistance.<eos> I now present to you an empty glass.
Bingo, we got him!<eos> If things change, the majority of people will decide where and when.<eos> This is a democracy, it's not communism.<eos> And we're all going to respect the law or pay the consequences.<eos> As a citizen, you are required by law to aid us in this identification...<eos> Is this Sweetback's body?<eos> I ain't learned to read lips yet.<eos> He lost his hearing.<eos> He ain't able to read lips yet.<eos> I told you one time I ain't seen Sweetback...
Tell it all-- all to God.<eos> God is never shocked.<eos> No, sir!<eos> God will understand all and forgive all.<eos> ♪ Take it to the Lord in prayer ♪ Sweet Jesus, love me.<eos> Glory to God!<eos> And now, beloved brothers and sisters for the glorification of our dear Lord and a continuation of our blessed work here at the haven of the Open Hand we ask your offerings of love tonight.<eos> Now, while the ushers pass among you we come to that special moment in our service when those of you who feel the need may step forward and be anointed by the oil of everlasting youth.<eos> Now, if you will form your line in the aisle, to your right brothers and sisters and leave your gifts in the golden basket here before me.<eos> God bless you, sister, God bless you.
Well, the important thing is, you're out of danger now.<eos> I am?<eos> That's always nice to know.<eos> Wait a minute, Sergeant.<eos> You mean, Ms. Stuart...<eos> I mean, Mrs. Bruckner and-- and myself, we were in danger from this man who loved Ellie Banner?<eos> Yes, from what he said to a couple of people, he was crazy with the idea of revenge.<eos> Of course, he suffered greatly when she died.<eos> Your boys were out of reach, of course, and so he fixed on their mothers.<eos> Uh, he traced you out here.
Invoices, bills, letters.<eos> I must answer that note from the queen.<eos> What will happen to the others?<eos> My dear boy they'll be quite all right.<eos> When they leave here they'll be restored to their normal, terrible old selves.<eos> But maybe a little wiser for the wear.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> What do we do now, Mr. Wonka?<eos> I hope you enjoyed yourselves.<eos> Excuse me for not showing you out.
That's right.<eos> Erm, we'd better get moving.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Programming Charlie to go back to the spaceship.<eos> Well, how far is your ship?<eos> Only a few kilometers.<eos> So no one from your colony survived?<eos> The lizards killed most of them.<eos> The primitives finished off the rest.<eos> The primitives attacked you as well?
- I'm not leaving here without her.<eos> - - Karl, take him out.<eos> Why don't you take us both back to the medical wing?<eos> - At least we could do some good there.<eos> - What's so special about me?<eos> We're saving you for the machine, ain't we?<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Would it surprise you to know that one of your hearts stopped completely?
I want the Doctor in one piece.<eos> - Now, put him in the cell as I told you.<eos> - Come on, open this door.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Good evening, Miss Grant.<eos> What a great pleasure it is to see you again.<eos> Master, what are you doing here?<eos> The Doctor will tell you about it when he's recovered.
But have you thought that as well as the police, you'd have the army against you?<eos> Dogs, troops, helicopters.<eos> Ha.<eos> By morning, you'd all be captured or killed.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> So, you've got a better idea?<eos> I think so, yes.<eos> How would you like a free pardon, unlimited money and a ticket to anywhere in the world?<eos> How would I like it?<eos> Right, pay attention and I'll show you how to get it.
To save lives.<eos> Several people have died already.<eos> Yeah, most of them head cases that were helping you.<eos> Very well then, to save one life.<eos> My own?<eos> Don't listen to him, Doctor.<eos> He's just bluffing.<eos> Am I?<eos> Unless the Doctor does what I ask, Miss Grant.<eos> Mailer will shoot you, here and now.
At ease, sergeant.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> I'd like to come on the assault, sir.<eos> Benton, you're supposed to be suffering from severe concussion.<eos> I know, sir, but it's only a scratch, honest.<eos> And you said yourself, I've got a thick skull.<eos> Anyway, I'd like a chance to get at the blokes who did it.<eos> All right.<eos> If you feel fit, you can take charge of the underground assault party.<eos> - Cosworth will put you in the picture.
Oh, yes.<eos> There.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm going to find the Doctor.<eos> Ah, come to give yourself up?<eos> Now shut up and listen.<eos> If you want to stay alive?<eos> You'll do exactly as I say. - Well?<eos> - You're going to help me get out of here.<eos> Walk out of here and tell those friends of yours that... either I get out or I'm going to chop you down.
Let them stay - don't you see we are playing?<eos> - Look... Didn't I tell you you are not to talk to daddy?<eos> Heddy, Heddy, don't be so hard on me.<eos> It's all your fault!<eos> Next time I'm going to the football - or I'll get drunk again...<eos> We'll settle accounts yet or I'll go to the football and get drunk!<eos> Or I'm going to start running after girls!<eos> Hell and damnation!<eos> That's how you should whistle...<eos> Boys, how often have I told you not to play with the taps in the bathroom?
Okiyo.<eos> It's you.<eos> Glad you're back.<eos> I decided to make your father my successor.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> About that Zatoichi...<eos> You did as I asked, did you not?<eos> I'm asking you a question.<eos> What happened to Zatoichi?<eos> Ichi is not the kind of man who will oppose you, sire.
- The little one is in there.<eos> Everybody in Paris talks about the child in the woods, the Wild Boy of Aveyron.<eos> Public curiosity is high, and my colleagues have permission from the Minister of the Interior Champagny to transfer him to Paris.<eos> The Journal of Debates reports that after attempting escape the boy was caught and is being held at the Rodez police station.<eos> Paris says we must leave this week.<eos> Here, come with me.<eos> He can't go as he is.<eos> He's filthy and he smells bad.<eos> Dirty pig!<eos> Did he bite you?

THE ROAD THERE<eos> II.<eos> THE BALNIBARBIAN TRAP<eos> Should you ever happen to arrive to those parts, you'll spot a little chapel near the main road.<eos> A field road branches off there, continuing to the pond and then climbing from the dike, along an old tree-lined alley, till it reaches a solitary house.<eos> This landscape, this cheerful country landscape, will remind you of something.
Sorry to interrupt.<eos> I'm terribly sorry to interrupt but my tooth's hurting, just around here.<eos> - Get off.<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> I'm not sorry to interrupt,<eos> I'll interrupt anything if it gets people looking in my direction like at my old school where, by a coincidence, the annual prize giving is going on at this very moment.<eos> My Lord Mayor, Lady Mayoress, it gives me very great pleasure to return to my old school, to present the prizes in this centenary year.<eos> This school takes very justifiable pride in its fine record of scholarship and sporting achievement in all...<eos> I'm, I'm afraid there's been a mistake.<eos> The man who has been speaking to you is an impostor.
I mean, it wasn't too cruel?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> It was great.<eos> No, super... well...<eos> I think it shows I'm human, don't you?<eos> - Yes, great.<eos> - Super.<eos> Well, the charabanc's here. Go on, everybody.<eos> Bye.<eos> Timmy Williams' 'Coffee Time' was brought to you live from Woppi's in Holborn.

Walrustitty...<eos> - Silly Party<eos> 32 108.<eos> Well, there's the first result and the Silly Party has held Leicester.<eos> What do you make of that, Norman?<eos> Well, this is largely as I predicted, except that the Silly Party won.<eos> I think this is mainly due to the number of votes cast.<eos> Gerald?<eos> Well there's a swing here to the Silly Party, but how big a swing I'm not going to tell you.
Pepe, do you hear us?<eos> The phone wire is cut off.<eos> It is broken.<eos> We're coming.<eos> My shoe's in there.<eos> - You'll never get in there that way.<eos> - I want my shoe back.<eos> This will never get you inside!<eos> Try and be sensible!<eos> What have I done to you?
- Claudia!<eos> - They were very close.<eos> - What the hell is going on here?<eos> - Silence.<eos> There's been a death in the family.<eos> It's Frank.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Kneel.<eos> Bow your heads.<eos> In this, your moment of need, I will comfort you.
Hold up there, boys.<eos> Now, you can start taking off your duds.<eos> Get them off.<eos> Keep your underwear, that's all.<eos> And your boots, get them off.<eos> Boots.<eos> - Socks too.<eos> - Socks?<eos> Now you're gonna head back out through them hills.<eos> Because if I catch you on a road, I'm gonna kill you.
A planet where apes evolved from men.<eos> There's gotta be an answer.<eos> Don't look for it, Taylor.<eos> You may not like what you find.<eos> Zira.<eos> Cornelius.<eos> Untie me.<eos> What will he find out there, Doctor?<eos> His destiny.<eos> Damn you all to hell!
I am asking you to be the guardians of the principles of science during my absence.<eos> I am asking for a truce with your personal convictions in an hour of public danger.<eos> And you shall have it, Dr Zaius, or I shall hit her again.<eos> Let us have no violence, Cornelius.<eos> - Now, I'm relying on you both.<eos> - And we are counting on you too, Doctor.<eos> If I should fail to return from the unknown, the whole future of our civilization may be yours to preserve - or destroy.<eos> So think well before you act.<eos> Well, goodbye, Dr Zaius, and good luck.<eos> Now we can finish this up and get you out of here!
- Why?<eos> For the same reason as you.<eos> To kill... or to kill myself.<eos> When you're witty, you've got the same sad face as your mom.<eos> In a family like ours and with this confusion it's always better to get rid of a gun.<eos> Listen. I'm trying to defend what is mine. And what will be yours.<eos> If that's for me... then take it. But don't use it loaded, it's better.<eos> And I'll tell you one more thing. Every day I pray God not to end up like you.<eos> - To what end?<eos> I showered you with money. I'm showering you with money.
You, too, Dobbs.<eos> Right, Number 3, let 'em go.<eos> Bastards!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Cut that out.<eos> Those are our men you're shooting at.<eos> Take cover.<eos> This is an MM Enterprises operation.<eos> Number 4 and 5, Number 3 did not get those supply sheds.<eos> I told you men to come in low.
No, but it's brilliant.<eos> I studied ballistics 20 years ago with Marchand, who's now Chief Inspector of Internal Affairs. IAD.<eos> What's that?<eos> The police who investigate the police.<eos> One other thing.<eos> I don't want my cut.<eos> You and Vogel can split it.<eos> You'll need it more.<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> I'll stick with you until you're both in the clear.
Not any longer.<eos> Just one thing.<eos> You are gonna keep your affairs legal, aren't you?<eos> Hell, yes.<eos> The three musketeers, eh?<eos> All set, Mr. Chisum.<eos> Two hitched to horses, the rest to mules.<eos> Just like you said.<eos> Here's the letter of credit for the merchandise.<eos> - The bank in Santa Fe is expecting you.
- Who knows?<eos> To find the truth I will keep him here for a couple of days.<eos> By tomorrow his fast heart and high blood pressure may be gone.<eos> - Look...<eos> - So I suggest you say goodbye to him now.<eos> - Doctor, I've...<eos> - lt was a nice tty.<eos> Come on, Ho-Jon.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> This is brought to you through Radio Tokyo by courtesy of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Post Number 63 of Sedalia, Missouri.
United Press International today voted the Korean War<eos> - the top news stoty of 1951.<eos> - We're in the middle of putting.<eos> My God.<eos> All right.<eos> You men are under arrest.<eos> - l'll have you court-martialled!<eos> - Come off it, Colonel.<eos> You don't have us. We have you.<eos> Your boys blew this case and we bailed you out.
Inform my family.<eos> Bring them to the hospital.<eos> Everyone. Everyone, don't forget!<eos> Even the boys, and Ersilia.<eos> If I die... carry me off with flags, but with no priests.<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> Away with the flags!<eos> No flags allowed!<eos> No one stops you from following the funeral.
An investigating committee came up with one significant finding:<eos> Of the 100 shots fired, 99 were from police weapons... and one from the Black Panthers.<eos> Conclusion:<eos> The action of the police... would seem to justify public doubts about their competence... or, indeed, their credibility.<eos> O star in the sea Thou queen of love For all the oppressed<eos> Stand by me and I shall fear no harm All is blissful<eos> All is well<eos> The ruling classes tell you...<eos> "Everyone is master of his own destiny."<eos> They tell you...
Stand by me and I shall fear no harm All is blissful<eos> All is well<eos> The ruling classes tell you...<eos> "Everyone is master of his own destiny."<eos> They tell you...<eos> "Nothing is denied to those who genuinely strive for it."<eos> I say unto you, these are empty words.<eos> Those who wield power say...<eos> "The ownership of land is part of a natural order."<eos> They tell you, "Property imposes obligations."
There is only one way out:<eos> World social revolution, global civil war.<eos> In place of competition and individualism... we must set our proletarian solidarity.<eos> We must satisfy our needs... which will emerge fully only during our struggle... so that we may become human beings... who take their fate in their own hands... and create their own history.<eos> In place of alienated capitalist labor... we must, we shall set a way of working... that satisfies our human needs.<eos> In brief, it involves the creation... of 21st-century man, as Eldridge Cleaver says.<eos> That is our obligation... and we shall fulfill it, regardless of the cost.<eos> We shall resist.<eos> We shall be human beings... or the earth shall be devastated... in our attempt to live a better life.<eos> Destroy that which destroys you.
- $10?<eos> That's not expensive.<eos> The ten is for me.<eos> The room will cost you twenty.<eos> - Where's the hotel?<eos> - I don't see the $10.<eos> - Here.<eos> Where is it?<eos> - The Ashmont, on 51 st.<eos> Tell Dave that Murray sent you.
Manuel Vargas.<eos> I am from out of town, too.<eos> Cuba.<eos> - Really?<eos> Here on business?<eos> - Just arrived.<eos> I am the new delegate of Cuba to the United Nations.<eos> The first person who's nice to us is another out-of-towner.<eos> Our Cuban Mission is on 66th and Park.<eos> I will get off there and my chauffeur will take you to your destination.
We'll go on a trip to a warm and dry country a naked and gleaming country...<eos> - ...with vigour...<eos> - ...hard tough, transparent, rigid etcetera.<eos> The desert.<eos> In order to get money sell the 'Blue Square No. 234' painting to a museum in the States which was bequeathed to the world by the deceased uncle of Violette.<eos> And to take hold of the picture we'll treacherously murder his niece!<eos> Now we have the poison scene.<eos> DRINK BLOOD<eos> BLOOD = LIFE<eos> If this story bores you, then you're heartless.
Let's go see. Maybe he's still around. - Where was he?<eos> - In the middle.<eos> Calm down, I'll sleep here tonight if you want!<eos> If I want?<eos> You're cute, Andrea.<eos> You arrive at the right moment, rose in hand, fresh and perfumed...<eos> - I never know when you're serious.<eos> - Almost never.<eos> But this time yes.<eos> I love you queers!
She's a scientist.<eos> I'm a security officer.<eos> So there's no possible link, is there?<eos> Did you ever think of becoming a scientist?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I can see that you did.<eos> I read physics at university.<eos> What's that got to do with it?<eos> Simply that her mind process runs along a similar parallel to yours.<eos> Doesn't that strike you as significant?
-Almost finished.<eos> -Good, then we can continue with the drilling.<eos> -At reduced revs.<eos> No, I intend to accelerate again as soon as possible.<eos> -Well, I don't advise it.<eos> -I don't need advice.<eos> Except from that prisoner!<eos> I would have come to the same conclusions.<eos> You may have come to them a bit too late.<eos> I sometimes wonder why I tolerate you, Sutton.
Excuse me, please.<eos> Sir David, I'm again instructed to emphasize that the Fuehrer wishes to avoid further bloodshed.<eos> England is not our natural enemy, and he offers guarantees for the British Empire if you give Germany a free hand in Europe.<eos> Goering and his Luftwaffe would like to flatten London as a prelude to invasion.<eos> It's two lumps you take, isn't it?<eos> What's left of your army abandoned its weapons at Dunkirk.<eos> You're defenseless and just playing for time.<eos> We know the moves you're making in Washington, and we know the Americans won't be drawn in.<eos> Their embassy in London gives you two weeks.<eos> So what's stopping you?
You know the order as well as I do, Major Brandt.<eos> Attacks may only be made on the personal order of the Fuehrer.<eos> I regret, gentlemen, the matter is now out of my hands.<eos> By order of Reichsmarschall Goering you are to report to Berlin.<eos> Please follow me.<eos> Don't they know there's a blackout?<eos> You know what our friend Goering said:<eos> "If ever a bomb falls on Berlin -" "- you may call me MEIER."<eos> You are to report to Colonel Schroeder at 9.00 a.m.<eos> This car will take you to your quarters where you will remain.
It is the end of us, my friends!<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> The end, my friends, is in sight!<eos> I carried little Rupert inside me for 17 months rather than let him out into this wicked world.<eos> Yes, my friend, rubber.<eos> It is the end of us!<eos> Stretch and repent!<eos> It's because of the rubber, stretching his way around the world.<eos> Run, brothers, run!<eos> The rubber will get you wherever you hide!
Now, now!<eos> He wasn't a bad man.<eos> The fire is burning out.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I'm leaving.<eos> - With this cold?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't push me!<eos> Can't you see I'm taking the children out?<eos> Who sent you to do something like this?

God Almighty!
Your daughter, the one I mean to marry.<eos> This is she.<eos> But this isn't...<eos> Have you no other daughter?<eos> Madame, have you no other daughter?<eos> My daughter Anne is not involved.<eos> But you don't understand.<eos> This is not the one.<eos> This is not she.<eos> Monsieur, the contract was signed between yourself and the Lady Renée who loves you dearly.
But, madame, I...<eos> Do not distress yourself.<eos> We do not intend her to take the vows.<eos> The bride of Christ she will not be, but in due course, she will marry.<eos> These things cannot be changed by you, nor by any man.<eos> Not by God, if you had your way.<eos> Do not blaspheme, monsieur.<eos> If you do try to stop her, we will all suffer in one way or another.<eos> But it will be you, monsieur, who will suffer the direct penalty.<eos> As I love you as my son, monsieur, I cannot let this happen to you.
Yes.<eos> And you weep to see it.<eos> No I don't weep for you.<eos> Your weakness made you deserve every punishment you received.<eos> Nor for myself.<eos> My strength can bear whatever befalls me.<eos> I weep...<eos> For whom?<eos> For Renée, who is innocent.<eos> And who loves you, God help her.
Nor for myself.<eos> My strength can bear whatever befalls me.<eos> I weep...<eos> For whom?<eos> For Renée, who is innocent.<eos> And who loves you, God help her.<eos> What if I changed?<eos> You cannot change.<eos> And your promises mean nothing.<eos> The Devil owns you.
You know I must've started off to Mardi Gras six or seven times.<eos> Never got further than the state line.<eos> The governor of Louisiana gave me this.<eos> " Madame Tinkertoy's House of Blue Lights.<eos> Bourbon and Toulouse, New Orleans, Louisiana. "<eos> Now this is supposed to be the finest whorehouse in the South.<eos> These ain't no pork chops. These are U.S. prime.<eos> Out of sight, man!<eos> Oh, I'd like to get over there.<eos> How long did you boys say it would take you to get down there?
Well, your colonel is an old friend.<eos> I will check with the sergeant.<eos> Permission to water horses.<eos> The sergeant, he will talk to the colonel.<eos> It's a nice place you've got here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The presidente himself gave us a commendation.<eos> - It's a big place.<eos> - 200 men.<eos> Does my friend work you seven days a week?
- What means your lordship?<eos> That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.<eos> Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?<eos> Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is into a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.<eos> This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.<eos> I did love you once.<eos> Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.<eos> You should not have believ'd me;<eos> for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it.<eos> I loved you not.
and therefore sweet nature must have her due, to heaven must I and leave the earth with you.<eos> O say not so, lest that you kill my heart, when death takes you, let life from me depart.<eos> Content thyself, when ended is my date, thou may'st perchance find a more noble mate.<eos> O speak no more, for then I am accurs'd, none weds the second but who kills the first.<eos> That's wormwood.<eos> A second time I kill my lord that's dead when second husband kisses me in bed.<eos> I do believe you, sweet, what now you speak;<eos> but what we do determine oft we break, so think thou wilt no second husband wed, but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.<eos> Both here and hence, pursue me lasting strife, if once a widow ever I be wife.<eos> Madam, how like you this play?
Which bewept to the grave did not go<eos> With true love showers<eos> Alas, look here, my lord.<eos> How do you, pretty lady?<eos> Well, God 'ild you!<eos> They say the owl was a baker's daughter.<eos> Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.<eos> God be at your table!<eos> Conceit upon her father.<eos> Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say this:
For dinner, do we got a mess hall or what?<eos> The schedule is here.<eos> You press these buttons to select what you want from the menu, and it will be delivered through there from the central kitchen.<eos> What is this: caviar, rack of lamb, prime rib...<eos> Well, and who you get to prepare this food?<eos> Oh, this is a hobby.<eos> Today the chef is Dr. Ildoro, mineralogist.<eos> Don't worry. You won't find any stones in your stomach.<eos> Goodnight, gentlemen.<eos> I'll see you in my office tomorrow.
No time for testing.<eos> She must be ready within one hour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The signal is stabilized, therefore Okada can not be on the Black Shark.<eos> They have to be on Blood Rock.<eos> No land or island shows at that point.<eos> Plenty of islands have never input on maps.<eos> How can Okada let you know where he is?<eos> We gave him a homing device before he left Tokyo.<eos> Gentlemen, I had planned to return you to the surface today, but it'll have to wait.
He'll be my number two.<eos> You all know Bill.<eos> He's just done three years in Parkhurst.<eos> As honest as the day is long.<eos> You can trust him.<eos> Second, the getaway.<eos> This will be done in three Mini Coopers.<eos> And they will be driven by Chris, Tony and Dominic.<eos> Hello, chaps.<eos> These chinless wonders will get you out of Turin faster than anyone else on four wheels.
Sorry, Colorado.<eos> You know me.<eos> - I drink too much, then I talk too much.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then they had me.<eos> You see, didn't I say Laguna shouldn't go into Hadleyberg?<eos> Colorado, it's a big desert.<eos> It's going to take a lot of eyes to find that old man.<eos> And after that, it's going to be a long way to the canyon.<eos> There's cavalry out after you.
I'm white.<eos> I'm beautiful.<eos> Manaape, you are white. What if you turned black?<eos> What bad luck!<eos> 0nly my palms got white.<eos> Don 't cry.<eos> Better safe than sorry. Let 's go!<eos> Let 's get of f! Spread into the fields.<eos> Let 's get of f! Quickly!<eos> If the Police catch you, they 'Il send you back.
I wasn't wrong then.<eos> Well, now I believe we have something to talk about.<eos> Are they all here?<eos> There are 100 million in gold reales.<eos> All we have to do is to take them.<eos> Fifty for you, and fifty for me.<eos> Do you agree?<eos> Now, it's very simple.<eos> There's an outside gate, then a large door... an inside gate and then the safe.<eos> Now, you enter, you take the gold, you load it onto the cart... and you cross the island to the village of which I told you.
José Dolores takes over the revolution... and organizes a new army that wins some victories.<eos> Three months later, England intervenes.<eos> There's no intervention at all.<eos> Just technical support and instructors.<eos> We have asked for this help, according with Article 32 of the Treaty.<eos> All right, this is a no so important problem.<eos> On the contrary, it is very important.<eos> We are very jealous of our independence.<eos> I wanted to say, Mr. President, that not even with this support, you have succeeded in putting down the revolt.<eos> That was why we've been half way around Europe trying to find you.
And these roots must be cut.<eos> They came out from the fire, naked... covered with flames... like devils, not human beings.<eos> This is where they've crossed the river.<eos> Now they're here... in the marshes in the Sierra Trinidad.<eos> There are five villages in the Sierra.<eos> Five.<eos> Tomorrow we start again.<eos> You well know that it is not we who are responsible for this tragedy.<eos> It is José Dolores who wanted this war.<eos> But the government promises you that the war will end soon. Peace will come.
- and not the other way around.<eos> - There's always José Dolores.<eos> Who knows?<eos> If there hadn't been a Royal Sugar, would there have been a José Dolores?<eos> Who knows, General?<eos> Come in.<eos> Hello, Teddy<eos> You wanted to talk to me?<eos> Sir William Walker, in the name of the Government of Queimada...<eos> Mr. Teddy Sanchez, in the name of the people of Queimada... I declare you under arrest.
Doesn't it get boring?<eos> You get used to it.<eos> Forgive me for asking, but as far as I can tell you're all Swiss citizens.<eos> For the last five years we've lived in Ascona, in between tours.<eos> We've been trying to find out your income over the past three years.<eos> The Swiss tax authorities are, how shall I put it, very reticent.<eos> A colleague of mine called the places where you've been performing. He estimates your annual income to be close to $2 million.<eos> On the surface, your income isn't connected with the case as such but I'd like to have as much background as possible.<eos> Then there's the speeding offence.<eos> The Dutch police caught up with you between Arnhem and Nijmegen.
I have an undefined feeling of fear.<eos> Maybe it wasn't curiosity, I wanted to see the act at a close range.<eos> Maybe from an obscure desire to take part.<eos> Maybe it was a secret need to... I don't know.<eos> I have superiors and subordinates.<eos> I take and give orders.<eos> You may be free, but I don't envy you. It's a ghastly freedom.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> I don't understand what drives you, or your relationship.
reports are sacred<eos> Put everything back in place<eos> And take note of one thing<eos> We have enough enemies.<eos> It's not honest workers we should harry<eos> Why should you upset József Pelikán's peaceful home?<eos> Have you taken leave of your senses?<eos> But he was reported<eos> What do you mean, reported?<eos> What if someone reported you for drug smuggling or bank robbery?
I'll get someone to attend to you.<eos> Mr. Verity.<eos> - Can I help you, sir?<eos> - We'd like to buy a bed.<eos> - A double bed, about 50 pounds.<eos> - Oh, no, I'm afraid not, sir.<eos> Our cheapest bed is 800 pounds, sir.<eos> Eight hundred pounds?<eos> I should explain.<eos> Mr. Verity does tend to exaggerate so every figure he gives you will be 10 times too high.
Not here.<eos> I can see that.<eos> What's the matter with them?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Perhaps they've got flu.<eos> Flu?<eos> They've eaten too much fresh fruit.<eos> Right!<eos> now, self-defense.<eos> Tonight I shall be carrying on from where I got to last week, when I was showing you how to defend yourself- against anyone who attacks you, armed with a piece of fresh fruit.
All right.<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> You found out? Yes.<eos> Who were they working for?<eos> Ask her.<eos> Well, who?<eos> You ask her.<eos> Who were you working for?<eos> Who sent you to spy at Viriel?
I figure that damn general will try to take this load without paying for it... and shoot us in the bargain.<eos> The only thing to change his mind is if something happened to these guns.<eos> I'm gonna make sure something could happen.<eos> Pike, take a look at this.<eos> Think you can handle that?<eos> What I don't know about, I sure as hell am going to learn.<eos> My people are here for their guns.<eos> Where the hell were you when you were supposed to be guarding us.<eos> I never heard them, didn't even see them.<eos> They apologize and ask you to forgive them for their lack of trust.
The gentlemen must know.<eos> Washing her hair.<eos> - You're confusing it with something.<eos> - No.<eos> - So what is it?<eos> - A girl washing her breast.<eos> - A girl washing her hair.<eos> - I finally found you.<eos> Hello, Mr. Hanzlik.<eos> - I searched for you a long time.
And now for something completely different.<eos> A man with three noses.<eos> He's not here yet!<eos> Two noses?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, wasn't she just great?<eos> Wasn't she just great?<eos> And she can run as fast as she can sing.<eos> And I'm telling you because I know.<eos> No, only kidding.<eos> Seriously now, ladies and gentlemen, we have for you one of the most unique acts in the world today.
Why you let a woman speak for you?<eos> Well, why not?<eos> Only if she's right, of course.<eos> And I am.<eos> We always fight in small groups, far apart.<eos> That's why they don't catch us.<eos> Aye, and that's why you're getting nowhere!<eos> We are free men.<eos> We do anything we want to.<eos> You are hunted fugitives and they'll pick you off one by one unless you join with us.
I wonder if you wouldn't take this against a loan of three ryo?<eos> Three ryo?<eos> If I lose, I'll give you free massages for the rest of your life.<eos> You're joking.<eos> I hardly need to be massaged for the rest of my life.<eos> A masseur's cane isn't worth three coppers.<eos> I suggest you go home before you get hurt.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'll lend you the money.<eos> I don't know who you are, but thank you very much.
Don't worry.<eos> I'll be all right in a few days.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I'm sorry for you, Mitsu.<eos> I'll get a doctor.<eos> I've sent for the famous doctor from Bancho.<eos> We can't afford him usually.<eos> I am really obliged.<eos> You ought to know the doctor is beyond our means.<eos> The master is helping you.
You don't have to apologize.<eos> I'm happy with you now.<eos> I want you to take me.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> But I can't treat you as a woman until this work is finished.<eos> Nagasaki Magistrate's Office<eos> Christianity is banned here.<eos> You pretended to have been shipwrecked and entered our country to propagate Christianity.<eos> The Government assigned me to question you strictly.<eos> I will torture you first.
Damn that Barret...!<eos> A noted criminal, an assassin for hire... and yet look at this magnificent heritage he has left behind for us!<eos> Two or three million pounds?<eos> That's at least eight million dollars.<eos> ...Put your hands down!<eos> What's so funny, idiot?<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> One moment, wait!<eos> Goodbye, my friends.<eos> Maybe, in a year or two an archeologist will find you and confuse you both for two ancient Romans!
If we hope to succeed, we must save this woman quickly.<eos> She will be the first one to benefit from the antidote.<eos> I need a sample of skin.<eos> Take a sample.<eos> Yes, quickly!<eos> Go on.<eos> I think I've managed to isolate the bacteria.<eos> I won't keep you long.<eos> I sent for you, so I could ask you a question.<eos> I shall help you in any way I can.
Nor were his murderers ever brought to book.<eos> They walk the streets as free as you and I.<eos> But their Maker knows who they are.<eos> They can't escape from Him, and He will punish them.<eos> Now I say to you, mend your ways.<eos> Your feet are already on the downward path.<eos> Stop!<eos> Before the fires below devour you.<eos> Amen.<eos> May God bless you all.
Prison?<eos> We're honest citizens, can't you see?<eos> You'll find it.<eos> The fourth was called Tuccio, but I don't know his surname...<eos> He worked with his father, Dell Piero...<eos> One day, by chance, he found his father's stash of guns.<eos> I can keep quiet, if I want.<eos> How much does my father pay you?<eos> -10,000 a week, not much for an apprentice.<eos> I'll help you out now.
It's 300 Lira a bullet.<eos> Torino, 06:00 on the day of the last robbery.<eos> What is it?<eos> -Nothing, go back to sleep.<eos> You didn't have to wake up so early.<eos> Don't worry...<eos> If something goes right today we'll be set up for life.<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> -Early...<eos> I'll take you to the cinema.
Get out of here!<eos> Line up over here!<eos> Come on!<eos> - All right, everybody out.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Make a straight line.<eos> Come on, get out.<eos> All right, baby.<eos> Come on.<eos> I called you 15 minutes ago and they still aren't here.
Mr Aron?<eos> Good Lord.<eos> - Nicholas!<eos> - Rex!<eos> - Hello, Simon.<eos> What a wonderful surprise.<eos> We must apologise for breaking in on your party like this, Simon.<eos> Oh, it isn't a party. It's just a meeting of a little... astronomical society I've joined.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, let me introduce you to the members.
He didn't come back..<eos> You said that sometimes he doesn't return..<eos> You weren't worried then...<eos> So why are you worried now?<eos> It's been four days.<eos> Marshal, let's get someone to look for this Nicolosi.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> But where should we look?<eos> Far away or here nearby?<eos> - Has someone threatened you?
Well perhaps he disappeared for another reason?<eos> And if so Rosa, for once, tell me, ok?<eos> - It appears that she has a lover.<eos> - Says who?<eos> Don Ciccio the barber, he told Corporal Torres.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I have to go. My daughter's alone at home.<eos> Very well.<eos> - Captain, promise me you'll look for him?<eos> - We'll look for him.<eos> God bless you.
Give something to this good woman, she has a young girl.<eos> Give them one of our hens, ok?<eos> Wait, Rosa.<eos> Ah, give it here!<eos> Here.<eos> Eat it tomorrow, ok.<eos> Wait, I'll give you some jars of marmalade too.<eos> Take these.<eos> - Now, go back home and don't worry, ok?<eos> - God bless you.
What a clown you are..<eos> If he comes back, he'll come back from Palermo you can't send money and letters to the family from heaven!<eos> But I think that someone else sent that money to Rosa.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Someone's who's alive. You my dear!<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - I might have given her some money.<eos> I bought her the money personally, because I 'had' her in her house, if you will..<eos> So if you're Rosa's lover, then you killed Colasberna out of jealousy and the husband because he discovered you both.
- No!<eos> Like the others, you did what I told you to do!<eos> You did nothing of your own will!<eos> But I still managed all the same.<eos> Even though I only got silence from all of you instead of help.<eos> Well, what is it Rosa?<eos> Are you also thinking that I'm, as all the others say, 'arrogant'?<eos> Go on, say it!<eos> What do I know?<eos> Who knows you?
Heave-ho!<eos> Here is the tree! They brought it at last!<eos> Bonze!<eos> The Prior of the temple said, today they brought that good material, which the deceased Shigetomo found.<eos> He said you're the successor of the master.<eos> Set about the work on the goddess Kannon immediately.<eos> But I... What do you say?<eos> I completely lack the experience for such an important work.<eos> Never mind.<eos> The deceased Shigetomo has always praised you.
Where?<eos> It is an herb.<eos> I believe it grows somewhere hereabout.<eos> Here's the herb.<eos> A medicine.<eos> There's a lot of it here!<eos> Really. And here, and here.<eos> Miss Yuki. Are you in a hurry to leave?<eos> Couldn't you stay in our house, until the mistress gets well?<eos> Someone is waiting for you, probably.
Forgive me, please!<eos> - Such impudence!<eos> - Mistress!<eos> - Take that!<eos> And that!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Mistress!<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Yosaku.<eos> I once asked you for permission to fell a tree.
It won't move.<eos> It's a cave alright.<eos> Now, let's find those people.<eos> - Right.<eos> Alright, step back. I'll shoot.<eos> It's no good.<eos> Welcome. I'm glad to see you all again.<eos> And now, you will follow us to our base.<eos> What's that?<eos> I lured all of you here today, because I want to tell you something.
It was a section inhabited mainly by... labourers, office workers, storekeepers and above all... government employees.<eos> The sign outside the building was almost bigger than my office.<eos> But thanks to Teresa, who signed promissary notes to the tune of half a million lira, the office had everything on it.<eos> Poor Teresa, for years she sacrificed for me.<eos> Her dream was to become the wife of a doctor, better yet, a medica della mutua.<eos> There they are, my future patients.<eos> If, like mamma read, it's true and there are 46 million citizens in Italy eligible for free medical care... then that means that out of every 100 that pass, 88 have somewhere... in their pocket, their purse, the back of their dresser drawer... a little mutua booklet and according to statistics... the Italian welfare patient is the world's most diligent visitor to doctor's offices<eos> and without a doubt unmatched in his consumption of prescriptions.<eos> Medical welfare had become kind of a game become doctor and patient... and for me it was important to get into that game. Friends, Romans, countrymen, let me take your pulses.<eos> Dr Guido Tersilli, medico della mutua is waiting for you and your ailments.
So the slicer serves no further purpose?<eos> No.<eos> Listen...<eos> I've got something that's a little boring to tell you, if you don't mind.<eos> Something heavy?<eos> Yes, quite heavy.<eos> Take these and put them in.<eos> No, I've got my own, you see?<eos> Don't be offended.<eos> Let's open the parenthesis... I bet you haven't understood anything, even if it's obvious. You just need to look around you, next to you, or two rows in front of you, or behind your backs... there he is, spying on you, your Giacobbe.
His destiny.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm back.<eos> I'm home.<eos> All the time, it was...<eos> We finally really did it.<eos> You maniacs!<eos> You blew it up!<eos> God damn you!<eos> God damn you all to hell!
Comrades!<eos> How is it when you are drunk?<eos> When one is drunk, he is in a good mood.<eos> The alcohol makes you happy.<eos> That's the mood of a drunk person.<eos> If you want to have a girl, you must know how you must know how to take her for a walk at night, on "Stefan the Greatest" street and to make her drink rum.<eos> Comrade Prosecutor!<eos> What have you done?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> What have I told you?
Because we hit you.<eos> Because you are younger.<eos> But you must forgive us.<eos> You two must forgive me.<eos> I am not doing you any harm.<eos> Why should you two go to jail?<eos> The Prosecutor is human.<eos> We are all humans.<eos> Forgive us, we are young.<eos> I forgave you.
Ask her to forgive me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - You too, forgive me.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Which way to Rome from here?<eos> Let's see.<eos> No, wait.<eos> 15 km from here, there's a boat that goes to Port Alexander.<eos> Ask for Vasco.<eos> - The village women will go with you.
Let's build a big fire and protect the village together.<eos> Together?<eos> Bordos and the others have already regrouped.<eos> Those who want to join us may come to my house.<eos> Hilda weakens the people who listen to her.<eos> Because of Hilda, Hols was lost.<eos> You aren't the real Hilda!<eos> Hilda divided you all.<eos> You're the one who divided us!<eos> Hilda divided you.
Give me some water-<eos> From the well.<eos> I like my water fresh.<eos> When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground.<eos> A sound?<eos> Like what?<eos> Like that.<eos> He not only plays, he can shoot, too.<eos> Morning, Mrs. McBain.<eos> -What brings you to town?
The only way out of here is to find out who really killed George Corley and we've only got 24 hours to do it.<eos> Interesting face.<eos> Let me get right to the point.<eos> I got you here so that we could move fast, in case you decide that you wanna move at all.<eos> The only thing at stake here is one man's life.<eos> He happens to be a friend of mine.<eos> We'll be improvising all along the way according...<eos> - Jim, we're wasting time.<eos> - Understand, Barney.<eos> Could be dangerous as anything I've put you through.
- Walk, walk, walk!<eos> - Think of Rivera.<eos> Guards!<eos> The guards are coming, and the comandante.<eos> Hey, look at that, huh?<eos> Hey!<eos> These people are from the Red Cross.<eos> They will ask you questions.<eos> You will answer them fully and honestly.<eos> You may keep the gifts the lady will give you.
Senorita Bailey.<eos> It's been quite an experience, comandante.<eos> Senor Valesquez.<eos> - Thank you, comandante.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Are you all right, miss?<eos> I'm terribly sorry.<eos> I didn't see you.
I remember, he had on a light raincoat with a pink form like from the tax department pinned to it.<eos> It said, "Last warning before execution."<eos> A pink form?<eos> Yes! Right here!<eos> "Last warning before execution"?<eos> Must be Richard.<eos> Turn right to get to the river port.<eos> Gentlemen...<eos> I've called you to this offshore location in the middle of the night because we're safer here than elsewhere from police interference.<eos> Thank you for answering my call so quickly.
10 seconds.<eos> Here's the hanged man.<eos> What is it?<eos> He's not there!<eos> He's not in the picture.<eos> Then it was a ghost.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> And Lord MacRashley dead on your bed?<eos> A ghost.<eos> Sorry to disturb you for ghosts.
- This is very bad.<eos> - That's why we're here.<eos> - We must take action. - Absolutely.<eos> There's only one thing to do.<eos> We'll have to form a united front against Fantomas.<eos> How?<eos> By contacting Lord MacRashley and his friends, fellow victims of that villain Fantomas.<eos> I'll try.<eos> Come in.<eos> Lord MacRashley will see you now.
Sorry, I mean Sardinia.<eos> Marat?<eos> The name sounds Jewish to me.<eos> Perhaps derived from the waters of Marah in the Bible.<eos> But who listens to him anyway?<eos> Only the mob down in the streets.<eos> Up here Marat can be no danger to us.<eos> Dearest Duperret you're trying to test me, but I know what I must do.<eos> Duperret go to Caen.<eos> Barbaroux and Buzot are waiting for you there.
Revolution, it's more like a ruin...<eos> They're all stuffed with glorious food...<eos> They think about nothing but screwing...<eos> And we are the ones who get screwed...<eos> Pick up your arms!<eos> Fight for your rights!<eos> Grab what you need and grab it now!<eos> Or wait a hundred years and see what the authorities arrange!<eos> Up there they despise you, because you never had the cash to learn to read and write.<eos> You're good enough for the dirty work of the Revolution but they screw their noses up at you because your sweat stinks.
We can talk about it to our grandchildren if we have any grandchildren.<eos> Marat, Marat, it's all in vain.<eos> You studied the body and probed the brain.<eos> In vain you spent your energies for how can a man cure his own disease.<eos> Marat, Marat, where is our path?<eos> Or is it not visible from your bath?<eos> Your enemies are closing in.<eos> Without you, the people can never win.<eos> Marat, Marat, can you explain how once in the daylight your thought seemed plain.<eos> Has your affliction left you dumb?
It's too late, Marat, forget your call, it contains only lies.<eos> What do you still want from the revolution?<eos> Where is it going?<eos> Look at these lost revolutionaries.<eos> Where will you lead them?<eos> What will you order them to do?<eos> Once you spoke of the authorities who turned the law into instruments of oppression.<eos> But how would you faire in the new rearranged France you yearned for?<eos> Do you want someone else to tell you what you must write?<eos> Tell you what work you must do?
This moment hands tied behind the back, feet bound together neck bared, hair cut off, knees on the boards head already laid in the metal slot looking down into the dripping basket.<eos> The sound of the blade rising and from its slanting edge the blood still drops and then the downward slide to split us in two!<eos> They say that the head held high in the executioner's hand still lives that the eyes still see that the tongue still writhes and that down below the arms and legs still shudder.<eos> Charlotte, awaken from your nightmare.<eos> Wake up, Charlotte, and look at the trees gaze at the rose-coloured evening sky in which your lovely bosom heaves.<eos> Forget your worries, abandon each care and breathe in the warmth of the summertime air.<eos> What are you hiding? A dagger?<eos> Throw it away!<eos> We should all carry weapons in self-defence.<eos> No one will attack you, Charlotte.
We tried restraining her with peaceful sleep and with the claims of a passion still more deep.<eos> Simonne as well as best she could she tried but this girl here would not be turned aside.<eos> That man is now forgotten and we can do nothing more Corday is focussed on this man.<eos> No.<eos> I am right and I will say it again.<eos> Simonne, fetch Bas.<eos> It is urgent my call.<eos> Marat what are all your pamphlets and speeches compared with her?<eos> She stands here and will come to you to kiss you and embrace you.<eos> Marat an untouched virgin stands before you and offers herself to you.
-Thank you.<eos> -Thank you, Amálka.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Oh, a big knife, what for?<eos> -Thank you, Auntie.<eos> It's for killing.<eos> For the meat, Julia, the meat.<eos> Only formalities before God remained.<eos> God bless you.
What irony!<eos> Once I was able to assemble great things.<eos> Not these miserable tiddlers.<eos> -What a shame!<eos> -You're not just a fireman.<eos> You're also a cook.<eos> That insult helped me to come up with fantastic idea,<eos> That doesn't come to mind every day.<eos> Now I was sure that Julia was finally finished.<eos> When I saw you for the first time you had it on, Frydrych.
- Guys, there's a night guard, what shall we do?<eos> - Let's stay calm.<eos> - It's forbidden to write over these walls.<eos> - Ah, really?<eos> Strange.<eos> - Write whenever you wish, but not here.<eos> -Why?<eos> Cause the Socialist Party is subscribed to the surveillance service.<eos> - You can write over those walls, I don't care, but not over this one. - Interesting.<eos> If you don't want me to denounce you, cancel what you've already written.
Ladies, would you be seated?<eos> Too bad you're just getting over the flu, Ogden.<eos> I thought we might go on somewhere this evening and take the ladies along.<eos> But then the night air might be dangerous for you.<eos> Oh, I think if I wrap up well it'll be all right.<eos> Where are the girls?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think they went to the ladies room as soon as you left.<eos> I must have inspired them with the same idea.<eos> Let me tell you about these ladies.
You married them.<eos> Nevertheless, they want to see the lady's passport.<eos> She doesn't need a passport to go ashore in Honolulu.<eos> She's married to an American citizen. But if her papers of identification are missing... then a marriage at sea is not recognized.<eos> She's an alien and will have to go before an Immigration board of enquiry.<eos> The purser's asked to see you, sir. Yes, of course.<eos> I'll see him right away.<eos> Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> It's time for me to disappear. Why?<eos> The Captain married you, and that's a legal fact.
I'm sorry. I was fully occupied getting myself ashore.<eos> No mind.<eos> We managed.<eos> Some of these books are very heavy though.<eos> Saved all your books, I see.<eos> - Yes, most fortunate.<eos> - You lost all my dresses.<eos> Yes, most unfortunate.<eos> I saw your trunk floating amongst the wreckage.<eos> However, the outfit you're wearing this morning... is the nicest thing I've seen you in since you left England.
The riddle had to be solved, who was to solve it?<eos> You, famous man, prophet?<eos> It was solved by me and you made me king<eos> Envy hates the fortunate<eos> There is one who wants my place<eos> Creon wants the king's place<eos> You have been bribed, Tiresias!<eos> I shall lay bare this plot!<eos> Creon would be king<eos> Who freed you from the riddles?
Kevin MacDonald.<eos> Howdy, Roy.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Doc Miller said to tell you Bart Jason hired himself a gunhand.<eos> Cole Thornton.<eos> He rode out there about an hour ago.<eos> Doc wanted you to know.<eos> He said be careful.<eos> Thanks, Roy.<eos> Tell Doc I'm much obliged to both of you.
FAVOR: Why lie to ourselves?<eos> Hell? A little bit of Hell, maybe?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> There is Hell.<eos> DORIS: By dark, she'll be dead.<eos> DORIS: Isn't somebody going to do something?<eos> RUSSELL: All right. If somebody wants to go down there, go ahead.<eos> Just one thing:<eos> You walk down there and you won't walk back.<eos> Leave the bags, start up with the woman, they'll kill you both.
Get out!<eos> At ease!<eos> Girls, I would like to point out that the one that is elected beauty queen will be given the honorary task of presenting this gift to our former chairman, who will be eighty-six years old.<eos> Eighty-six.<eos> Continue.<eos> Well, I'll... I'll show them how they should walk, yes?<eos> Look here girls, so that you don't stroll in like a herd...<eos> You understand, yes?<eos> Well, like that.<eos> People will be watching you, five hundred people will be watching you.
Must've been something important to bring you back.<eos> I had to see my sister in Fort Scott.<eos> -To get money she was holding for me.<eos> -Did you get it?<eos> -She moved away.<eos> -Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How far is it from Kansas City to Fort Scott?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How long did it take you to drive there, one hour?
- Thank you.<eos> I was with Ellis.<eos> It was about 10:30.<eos> See, he was our electrician, and we were discussing various ways in which to light the new statue.<eos> All of a sudden, I got this... Well, it was just a frightening feeling.<eos> Ellis laughed at it, but I left.<eos> It couldn't have been a minute later when I heard the scream and then a crash.<eos> I ran back here and I found him.<eos> - And then?<eos> - I ran to my office and I called you.
Perhaps.<eos> But there's a little matter of artistry too, you know.<eos> Yes.<eos> If you're dealing with a Rodin or a Brancusi.<eos> But not a primitive.<eos> Why, it's almost their lack of artistry that proves that they are primitive.<eos> Oh, I think any half-baked artist could imitate one.<eos> I'll bet those experts felt like fools when they found out that Etruscan was a fake.<eos> What do you think of this one?<eos> Well, what did Mr Trimingham tell you?
Friends indeed<eos> Friends indeed<eos> Easy, lads. Steady. Watch it!<eos> We'll keep you safe in the jungle<eos> Forevermore<eos> That's what friends<eos> Are for<eos> Bravo. Bravo.<eos> An extraordinary performance.<eos> And thank you for detaining my victim.
Excuse, you're going too far!<eos> - Me?<eos> Ok, darling, excuse me.<eos> Let's start everything from scratch again!<eos> No! Let's play a bit of music.<eos> A bit of music, please.<eos> - Din, din, din?<eos> Yes.<eos> - I'll play a record.<eos> Now I'll lead you over the bank vault, ok?
Oh my!<eos> They are shooting over there!<eos> - Where are Sphinx and Kobaski?<eos> What do I know? I've seen them falling down, perhaps they are dead.<eos> Dead?<eos> - Fine, we will divide the loot with their widows.<eos> - Let's clear off quickly!<eos> Come!<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> Quick, professor, I saw a car following you from high on!
He'll talk.<eos> Let him talk.<eos> He'll say yes. I'll say no.<eos> It'll impress reporters.<eos> If I can be of help, Mr. Arsene, you have to remember.<eos> Remember!<eos> Remember...<eos> He was there, facedown in the water, his legs thrashing.<eos> I'll say I was in the woods, that I saw you both.<eos> He insulted and attacked you.
May the love of God be always with you.<eos> Amen.<eos> Whatyouarenow watchingisthelargeststaging ofnationalism in the history of Great Britain<eos> Now is the beginning of Christian Crusade Week and praise be to God!<eos> Led by a section of the Durham Queen's Scouts detachments of Christian bodies from all over the country pulse with ear-tingling music and breathless precision into an unequalled expression of national solidarity.<eos> We calculate that the gate money from each of these performances will gross on average approximately £135,000.<eos> The coalition government of Britain formed because of the complete lack of difference between the policies of the Conservative and Labour parties has given both its blessing and a state subsidy to the mounting of Christian Crusade Week because, as the official pamphlet states<eos> "we need no longer have any disturbing political differences<eos> "When we are all of one faith and believe in one God and one ﬂag."<eos> This black card will be issued to you as you leave the Stadium tonight.
We gotta get out of this place.<eos> This self-denial is killing me.<eos> I'm sorry you were not able to sample our restaurant last night.<eos> So were we.<eos> Particularly when we have to charge you an all-inclusive price... - as you see. - Beg your pardon?<eos> High season.<eos> Our price includes dinner and breakfast always.<eos> Always.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think the inspector is waiting for you outside.
So longs as some remains when I signal the attack.<eos> The time has come, captain.<eos> I see you mean business, marshal!<eos> Your advice always was good for nothing!<eos> What is there to advise, pedlar?<eos> You lead your regiment like cattle from shed to shed.<eos> - Some heroism!<eos> - The king needs the law upheld. The king entrusted the captain's mace to me.<eos> I travel the land waging a merchant's war.<eos> While your noble words lead you to the mortuary, one gabbles on, the other murders.
- No, thanks.<eos> I have just ordered Kaffee.<eos> Are you coming out from behind this desk or not?<eos> - Not!<eos> - Cowards!<eos> Miserable, cringing cowards!<eos> Clinging to life!<eos> Watch!<eos> Watch and remember!<eos> Franz Liebkind will show you how to die like a man!
We live in an age of lies and false prophets, a cruel age, in which there is little love in the air, but much hatred and contempt.<eos> There is plunder and killing.<eos> Men are sorted out from among other men, as if God was unable to separate the wheat from the chaff.<eos> Leave that to him.<eos> His scales are not our own.<eos> And when he sent us his son, he made him the shepherd of all sheep, including those who wear a star on their foreheads.<eos> Beware the short-lived words. The Christian's choice is an easy one.<eos> He must be on the side of the oppressed, whoever the oppressor may be.<eos> Here's an example:<eos> If Christ chose to be a Jew rather than a Roman, at a time when the Roman legions occupied Judea, he must have had good reasons, on which I ask you to meditate.
Look out! The thieves!<eos> We got them.<eos> It's a dead end.<eos> Get the big one first!<eos> Charge!<eos> Meaulnes!<eos> Behind you!<eos> Get the map!<eos> Now we'll know his secret!<eos> That map won't take you far.
How did they take over the house?<eos> After they kidnapped Wilson,<eos> Gort took his place, dismissed the staff, and brought in his own people.<eos> Could Wilson possibly still be in the house?<eos> No, we've had the house under surveillance.<eos> He was taken out and never brought back.<eos> So while you're playing Gort's role, we have to break him?<eos> Yes, Gort must talk.<eos> That's the key to the whole operation.<eos> You'll have Dr Drake to help you.
You need them and I can get them.<eos> Now, have we got a deal or not?<eos> Jara,<eos> I think we can work with Mr. Rogers.<eos> - Do you agree?<eos> - Most assuredly, Your Majesty.<eos> Stop!<eos> Turn around.<eos> You cannot enter the Holy City.<eos> I told you to turn back.
- lt is a deal.<eos> - Fair enough.<eos> - How about you, Maharis?<eos> - l'll take my product now.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Taxi.<eos> That will be all, gentlemen.<eos> Your merchandise will be shipped out immediately.<eos> I trust we will all be doing business together again very soon and that we will keep in touch.<eos> And if anyone tries to pressure you to buy from them, I want to know about it, huh?
So you're just a little man after all, Doctor, like all the rest.<eos> You disappoint me.<eos> You disappoint me.<eos> I didn't think a man of science needed the backing of thugs.<eos> Take care, Doctor.<eos> Your life is in the balance.<eos> You mean you haven't told your own people what's in store for them?<eos> Are you afraid, Zaroff?<eos> I have made a mistake.<eos> If I had not interfered with the temple sacrifice, the sharks would have torn you apart.
Can you hear me?<eos> Listen, you're the last.<eos> There's no one else left. The organisation's finished.<eos> Everyone's dead, or in prison.<eos> You'll have a proper trial.<eos> Surrender!<eos> National Liberation Front (FLN). Communiquè N.1 .<eos> The time has arrived to emerge from the long night, and from the misery we have suffered under 130 years of colonial oppression.<eos> The battle draws nigh. The aim is independence. To avoid a bloody conflict, we propose honourable discussions with the French recognizing our right to self-government.<eos> Algerians, unite! Be prepared! The National Liberation Front calls you to arms.
We'll do something, as soon as we remake contacts.<eos> -How do we move?<eos> -We'll change methods.<eos> Who're you?<eos> Quick, hide us, we're being followed.<eos> Where, my boy?<eos> The house is small.<eos> -They'd find you.<eos> -In the well.<eos> God look after you.
- I don't see no castle.<eos> That's because you're not looking, idiot!<eos> Alright - you've had enough argument.<eos> Get the women out!<eos> Get 'em out!<eos> You'd better do as he says.<eos> Leave it, Charles.<eos> He's a highway robber.<eos> I'll be back here 2 hours after dawn tomorrow.<eos> If any of you are here then, I'll take you on to Carlsbad.
Yep.<eos> Wake up!<eos> You can thank your lucky stars you're working with me, can't you?<eos> All right, one more.<eos> And let's smile now.<eos> Come on.<eos> Smile.<eos> Smile.<eos> God.<eos> I asked you to smile.
Bill Carson!<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> Please, Carson... answer "present."<eos> What are you, deaf?<eos> Now suppose you say "present," Carson.<eos> I like big fat men like you.<eos> When they fall, they make more noise... and sometimes they never get up.<eos> Wallace... that's enough.<eos> Sergeant!<eos> The captain wants to see you right away.
-Mary.<eos> -Nobody dance, I dance by myself.<eos> -Mary.<eos> Mary.<eos> Honey, you're drunk.<eos> And nobody's gonna dance with you when you're all tanked up.<eos> So why don't we just go upstairs and lie down and sleep it off.<eos> You'd like that, wouldn't you?<eos> No, sir, loving husband, I don't close my eyes.<eos> This portion of the news, Spotlight on Texas, is brought to you by....
Horace.<eos> You know, we mustn't spoil this lovely kite. Must we, my little Horace?<eos> Or else when we want it to fly, it won't work.<eos> Will it?<eos> Well, it's rather late, but please accept this little offering.<eos> And - Let me kiss you and wish you every happiness with this old devil George...<eos> - because, by Jove, you deserve it!<eos> James, bring the drinks in.<eos> Well, you see, Marion thought that a really useful present like this -<eos> Just let me show you.
Your name's Utsugi. You were at the Shimada school.<eos> Please come in.<eos> This man is like my real father.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't stand on formality.<eos> So you two know each other from Edo?<eos> No, we only met once.<eos> Just once?<eos> I had to come to Kyoto on business.<eos> I was surprised when I saw you here unexpectedly.
May it be long, healthy and productive.<eos> Productive as a breeder?<eos> Hang me.<eos> This is your house. Come, come.<eos> Well, visit at any time, dear neighbour.<eos> No obligation to buy, just come in and browse. Senex!<eos> Come away from that house of shame.<eos> I was only just standing here and saying "Shame, shame."<eos> For your own good, Hysterium, look after Hero.<eos> - What brings you up here?
Intermission...<eos> It was not me, it was not me!<eos> It's me!<eos> Ah then it's me.<eos> Pretend you are our prisoner.<eos> No, go left.<eos> The gates of Hell?<eos> No, an underground river under the Opera.<eos> Where does it exit? According to Victor Hugo, nowhere.<eos> God bless you.
We are to ask the Pope to dispense with his dispensation, also for state reasons?<eos> I don't like plodding, Thomas.<eos> Well? Then, clearly all we have to do is to approach His Holiness and ask him.<eos> I think we might influence the decision of His Holiness.<eos> By argument?<eos> Argument certainly. And pressure.<eos> Pressure, applied to the Church?<eos> The Church has its church property.<eos> Pressure.<eos> No, Your Grace, I'm not going to help you.
Be seated.<eos> No courtship, Thomas.<eos> You're my friend, are you not?<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Thank God I have a friend for my chancellor.<eos> Readier to befriend, I trust, than he was to be chancellor.<eos> My own knowledge of my poor abilities--<eos> I will judge of your abilities.<eos> You know that Wolsey named you for chancellor?<eos> Before he died, Wolsey named you, and Wolsey was no fool.
It is a deadly canker in the body politic, and I will have it out!<eos> See?<eos> You see how you've maddened me?<eos> I hardly know myself.<eos> If you could come with me, there's no man I'd sooner raise yes, with my own hand.<eos> Your Grace overwhelms me.<eos> What's that?<eos> Eight o'clock, Your Grace.<eos> Lift yourself up, man.<eos> Have I not promised I'll leave you out of it?
No, not yet, Rich, not yet.<eos> If I might hear the charges.<eos> - The charges?<eos> - I understand there are certain charges.<eos> Some ambiguities of behavior I should like to clarify, hardly charges.<eos> Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?<eos> There are no charges.<eos> The King is not pleased with you.<eos> I am grieved.<eos> And yet, do you know that even now, if you could bring yourself to agree with the Church, universities, the Lords and the Commons there is no honor which His Majesty would be likely to deny you?
They take their heads in their hands and blather,<eos> "Oooh, I just love Bessie Smith."<eos> They have no clue what she's singing about.<eos> "Here's my big fat black ass."<eos> She's not singing about love.<eos> What, then?<eos> It's not about desire, not about sorrow.<eos> Nothing like what you think.<eos> Want me to tell you?<eos> Her big fat black ass is telling you to fuck off.
I didn't know her, inspector! You, too, know nothing, haven't seen or heard anything?<eos> You all have the same answer!<eos> Look, you can't fool me!<eos> Why such reluctance?<eos> What keeps your tongue tied?<eos> Is it fear maybe?<eos> Fear from what?<eos> Tell me! From what?<eos> An amulet!<eos> An amulet! That's what's keeping you from talking.
- What on earth is he doing?<eos> - It's called bulldogging, ma'am.<eos> That's Bulldog Burnett.<eos> He works for my outfit.<eos> It's a perfectly silly way to handle cattle, if you ask me.<eos> My name is Charles Ellsworth.<eos> I can tell by your speech that you're from England.<eos> May I ask what has brought you to our fair shore?
Life out here is hard, laddie.<eos> Yeah, well, don't do anything to make it any softer.<eos> What are you referring to?<eos> Like maybe you could build some sheds for the stock... and lay in some winter feed and repair this godforsaken place?<eos> You've been listening to that wee lassie.<eos> You bet.<eos> And it's the first sense I've heard in all this part of Texas.<eos> I'm serving tea at 4:00 this afternoon.<eos> You may bring Miss Evans if you care to.<eos> The master will join you presently.
- Go where?<eos> back to get the rest of the women.N<eos> - He volunteered.<eos> Chris.<eos> Too bad the others couldn't have seen this.<eos> We'll remember them in our prayers.<eos> Chico.N<eos> - Chris.<eos> Chico.<eos> - Adios.N - God bless you.
That does it. That did it.<eos> I'll punch him in the jaw. I'm holding you responsible.<eos> As commander of the civilian forces in this emergency, I'm charging you with treason.<eos> Gimme that thing!<eos> You see that?<eos> That's the Dexter F. Meadows Memorial Sword.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You traitorous fink!<eos> Keep out of it!<eos> What's the matter with you?
Please.<eos> Professor Armstrong, Miss Sherman, may I present Vice Rector Gutman.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Welcome to Karl Marx University.<eos> We are very happy to see you.<eos> May I introduce Professor Winckelmann...<eos> How do you do?<eos> And Professor Shrader.<eos> We're very happy to be here.<eos> Professor Winckelmann will show you to your rooms.
I've been telling you...<eos> - Mama, are you asleep?<eos> - No, my darling, I'm frightened.<eos> I know I won't sleep anyway.<eos> I never felt like this before!<eos> That girl is such a treasure...<eos> She's such a rare girl.<eos> I'm asking you, don't try to rationalize, have no doubts, marry her, and I'm sure that there will never be a happier man.<eos> - But how about her?<eos> - She loves you.
Why talk when you can't express with words what you feel?<eos> - Do you love me?<eos> - Oh yes, yes...<eos> - What is it?<eos> Is something wrong? - I feel so happy.<eos> Now, Prince Andrei no longer felt the same love for her as before.<eos> Something within him had changed.<eos> There was none of the former poetic charm of attraction, only a kind of pity for her feminine and childish weakness, a sort of terror before her devotion and trustfulness.<eos> Although this new feeling was not as poetic as the old one, it was stronger and more serious.<eos> Did your mother tell you that we cannot be married for a year?
Put the Count's things over here. The young ladies' - on the left.<eos> You've grown plumper and prettier. Phoo!<eos> How cold you are!<eos> Maria Dmitrievna, my Countess has gotten ill. Our house isn't heated.<eos> I took an opportunity of your invitation, and here we are.<eos> High time you did.<eos> I'm so glad you could come.<eos> The old Bolkonsky's in Moscow. His son is also expected any day.<eos> You really should make his acquaintance.<eos> His highness cannot see you, but her highness, the Princess, asks you to come up.
One can see they're engaged.<eos> Drubetskoy has made a proposal.<eos> I heard so today.<eos> How long have you been in town, Countess?<eos> I have some business here, too, and I've brought my girls with me.<eos> They say, Semyonova's acting is superb.<eos> Here he is, Kuraghin!<eos> I can't call on you.<eos> Does it mean I'll never see you again?<eos> How madly I'm in love with you!
-What if he and your fiance find out?<eos> - I have no fiance.<eos> I've broken up.<eos> Makes no difference.<eos> He'll find out.<eos> Do you think he'll keep quiet?<eos> He might even challenge that scoundrel to a duel.<eos> Will you leave me alone?<eos> Why did you have to meddle?<eos> Who asked you to do that?
They know what you want, and so there you're within your rights.<eos> They're as well armed as you with the same experience of debauchery.<eos> But deceiving a girl whom you've vowed to marry... kidnapping her...<eos> Have you never been told that it's just as cowardly and infamous as killing an old man or a child?<eos> I wouldn't know and I really don't care to know.<eos> But you used certain words, like cowardly and so on, that I cannot condone as a man of honor.<eos> Although there are no witnesses, still I'm not going...<eos> You want satisfaction?<eos> You might at least take back your insults, if you want me to comply with your wishes.<eos> I take back my words and ask you to forgive me.
In a manner of speaking, Miss Easton, that kimono is mine.<eos> Half yours.<eos> Half mine.<eos> Very well.<eos> If that's the way you want to play it, then.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Stay!<eos> There's something I want to explain about the morning routine.<eos> Since she's my landlady, I'm your landlord and that puts you in third position.
Those are all fine dishes.<eos> Domo arigato.<eos> Everything's arranged.<eos> Here's the menu:<eos> Octopus, tempura, chicken teriyaki seasoned seaweed, boiled eel.<eos> Delicious.<eos> - from United States of America.<eos> Cheers!<eos> To Russia.<eos> I hope we beat the pants off you.
Been in Japan long, Miss Easton?<eos> Shut up!<eos> And after college, a girl I knew recommended me to a firm and they offered me a job.<eos> But I decided to go it on my own.<eos> Work on the kind of design I believe in.<eos> I devised this plan for reciprocal tariff agreements which, needless to say, caused a stir at the embassy.<eos> I'll bet it did.<eos> What about her?<eos> What about who?<eos> The girl who recommended you for the job.
Three, four.<eos> Leave.<eos> Come here.<eos> - How am I ?<eos> - Not bad.<eos> Attention.<eos> Three, four.<eos> Bind and straighten your leg, and hop!<eos> Stop.<eos> What on earth has possessed you ?
But if we both fail to kill him, what then?<eos> There must be men in town who feel the same way.<eos> Rumors say that there are.<eos> Are they true?<eos> The domain is being closely guarded because of these rumors.<eos> We must be doubly careful.<eos> I will go first and get in touch with the others.<eos> Wait until then.<eos> Yes, that is best.<eos> If anything happens to you, all our hardships will have been in vain.
I know it wasn't a nice welcome.<eos> Nothing like that has ever happened to me. It's completely thrown me.<eos> We'll have to talk together later.<eos> It really wasn't nice.<eos> I like jokes, but that was too much. Beating up a man...<eos> No-one beat me up.<eos> But they harassed you.<eos> What about human rights?<eos> Come off it, will you? Shut up.<eos> So they harassed you.
We're going to make a rescue attempt.<eos> Elaborate, well-timed, ingenious, I hope.<eos> We get all the way in, but we'll fail.<eos> Normally, Sparrow's information will be disbelieved and written off.<eos> But since we're going into a maximum-security prison to rescue him, how will they buy the unbelievable fact that Janos Karq is a traitor?<eos> And later, they let Sparrow live.<eos> We'd try to negotiate his freedom.<eos> All this water, you know.<eos> I'm not so sure my system can stand the shock.<eos> I haven't met all of you until today.
- No, I changed my mind.<eos> Why?<eos> It's my fault, Colonel.<eos> Women, sir.<eos> We were going to Radesk.<eos> She has some stupid idea that I have a lady acquaintance there, and she refuses...<eos> I don't believe a word of this.<eos> I think you're all thieves.<eos> Performers, yes, but petty thieves as well.<eos> I intend to keep my eye on you from now on.
- Yes.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> Look, I have been in the business for 30 years.<eos> And right now I have a feeling that something is very wrong.<eos> I am getting strange phone calls and I know I am being watched.<eos> Colonel Shtemenko... Must be getting very tired.<eos> He's not that young and the three of you have been keeping late hours.<eos> - The three of us?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Haven't you seen Shtemenko following you?
So what do you want to do?<eos> He's a blind fool on his own.<eos> What chance does he have if two strong swordsmen fall on him? Right.<eos> Take him by surprise and he's ours.<eos> A fire.<eos> Just what I needed.<eos> Hey, blind man.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Ichi.<eos> I don't know who sent you, but you only get one life.
Love their little red suits<eos> I was asked last night to the Ebisu Feast - To the Ebisu Feast -<eos> I forgot the words.<eos> Sea bream in the soup and sea bream on my plate<eos> Wasn't that it?<eos> You know it?<eos> I used to sing it often when I was your age.<eos> One bowl, slurpy-slurp A second bowl, slurpy-slurp<eos> What's wrong?<eos> May I ask a favor of you, Otsuru?
Wait a second.<eos> There!<eos> Take this, you sons of bitches!<eos> Hurry!<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Capture him!<eos> Master Ichi, forgive us, we beg you.<eos> Please spare us.<eos> I want both of you to come with me out in front of the Chojiro.<eos> There are some people waiting for you there.
It's not serious.<eos> What do you mean, it's not serious?<eos> What am I going to do now?<eos> Just walk.<eos> But I was going on a holiday to Italy.<eos> Go by plane. that's faster.<eos> - But I'm not in a hurry.<eos> Well, I am in a hurry.<eos> Here's my business card.<eos> My insurance agent will contact you.
And your tie, sir.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - I'll take a bath with you, sir, if you like.<eos> Listen, doll, I'm a big boy.<eos> I can find dames all alone.<eos> Now get lost.<eos> Be polite to the ladies, Mr. Johnson.<eos> Shit.<eos> Now what?<eos> This kid doesn't please you?
Where? Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where the sky's as blue as the South Seas.<eos> Florence, where the sky's as blue as the South Seas.<eos> Or in Nueva York.<eos> Where the winter...<eos> Broadway glitters in the snow like a fur coat.<eos> You see, you do know the Outlands.<eos> Your father was chased from Nueva York in '64.<eos> He brought you here, so you are not from here.
-Zounds, will they not rob us?<eos> Give me my horse.<eos> To thy tasks.<eos> If they shalt escape your attack, they shalt fall unto our trap.<eos> 8 yards of uneven ground is 70 miles a foot with me.<eos> I have removed his horse.<eos> If I travel further, I shall break my wind.<eos> I'll starve, are I'll rob a foot further!<eos> Whew!<eos> A plague upon you all!
-Go to, stand aside.<eos> Let it go which way it will.<eos> Sir, I have three pound to free Mouldy and Bullcalf.<eos> Mouldy, stay at home till you are past service.<eos> Bullcalf, growtill you come unto it.<eos> -But they are your likeliest men.<eos> -Will you tell me howto choose?<eos> Wart, he shall charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's hammer, and this half-faced fellow, he presents no mark to the enemy and for a retreat, how swiftly will this Feeble, the woman's tailor, run off.<eos> O, give me the spare men, and spare me the great one Fare you well.<eos> -Sir John, Heaven bless you.

You know... you are a sugarplum.<eos> You better watch out.<eos> There are lots who are as depraved and cowardly as they think they are.<eos> And one of them, one of these days... is gonna eat you right up.<eos> Evening, ma'am.<eos> Air and moonlight sets the bulls to talking for sure.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wondered if we was staying the night.<eos> I'd take off my boots before going to sleep.<eos> I helped you before.
-You're still here?<eos> I just wanted to explain that that those cuts would significantly ruin the film. -Don't waste your time.<eos> You've the right to appeal and you can appeal.<eos> But please, stop having people call me that..that know you.<eos> Because this kind of pressure, this pushiness has no effect.<eos> It won't change my mind.<eos> Do you understand, dear Director?<eos> No one can change my mind for me!<eos> I'll change it...<eos> Massimo Tabusso here speaking to you live from Moscow.
- I am?<eos> - You are.<eos> To hell with them all!<eos> We're going to have a ball!<eos> Have a ball.<eos> To hell with them all!<eos> "Ashes to ashes.<eos> "Dust to dust."<eos> Yes, there's nothing dreamier than Cupid Chocolates.<eos> Those fairy-tale centers take you out of this world... into a land of make-believe come true.
Let's try a take for the Prince.<eos> Good afternoon, sir. Hello.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Excuse me... don't you think the house would be much better seen from this angle, here?<eos> Yes, sir, but you see, it's a question of the lights.<eos> The lights.<eos> Scene 2, take 3.<eos> Action.<eos> "Yes, there's nothing dreamier than Cupid Chocolates.<eos> "Those fairy-tale centers take you out of this world... "into a land of make-believe come true.
No, I actually like them a lot, but then, once you get to that point, it becomes impossible.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To work.<eos> To the temple of Venus.<eos> What happened?<eos> She's doing the interview with the other guy.<eos> Well, then it really is an interview and has nothing to do with the hunt.<eos> In the end, your hunter really was the one shooting at you.<eos> Be on guard, Marcello.<eos> I kept an eye on you all evening.
- Your Honor...<eos> - Yes, we'd better be off.<eos> You know, you often look at me as though you knew me.<eos> I have seen you.<eos> Four years ago, Christmas Eve.<eos> Were you there?<eos> No wonder you look at me.<eos> - Did you know Victor Komarovsky?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> - That young man who took you away...
This is disinfectant.<eos> Use it.<eos> - "In this wagon is a detachment of Voluntary Labor."<eos> - Liar.<eos> "You're required by the Military Committee to show them all assistance.<eos> One carriage is occupied by sailors of the heroic Kronstadt Sailors' Soviet."<eos> - So you'll be in good hands.<eos> - They're idiots.<eos> "Attention comrades. In approximately 11 days' time, you'll pass through the Urals Province... where White Guard units, aided by foreign interventionists... and other criminal reactionary elements have recently been active.<eos> The Military Committee assures you... that the criminals have been routed in that area by Red Guard units... under the command of People's Commander Strelnikov."
You mustn't. Had you been funny, it would...<eos> But you are my bride, a real bride.<eos> I love you, Anca.<eos> I love you too.<eos> The next day we were to buy the multiplicator.<eos> You know that happened.<eos> I had to meet her on Sunday.<eos> That was all.<eos> Will you meet each other?<eos> What's the matter with you?
But I'm not a gentleman. I'm a woman.<eos> Indeed you are.<eos> Then say it. What's expected of me?<eos> I'm an emancipated woman and you're an emancipated man.<eos> There are things that should remain implicit between men and women.<eos> Why?<eos> It's been this way for years and I see no reason to change. - I am a creature of habit.<eos> - All the more reason.<eos> Now you're using your female attractiveness as a weapon.<eos> Equality, real equality of the sexes bothers you, doesn't it.
Hezekiah, see Miss Dubois to her horse please.<eos> You're afraid! You're afraid of a real woman!<eos> I'll show you!<eos> Professor, dinner is served.<eos> I wish to see Professor Fate.<eos> I'm a reporter. For The Sentinel.<eos> Beat it, little girl, or I'll sic the dogs on you.<eos> Who was that?<eos> - Kids, just kids, more kids. - Stupid kids.<eos> You want me to feed you?
Or would you prefer an engraved invitation?<eos> - I might consider an apology.<eos> - An apology?<eos> For what?<eos> It's twenty miles back to Boracho.<eos> - You'd never make it. - Well, that's your fault.<eos> My fault.<eos> I warned you. I would not be left behind in Boracho.<eos> You left me no choice so I had to stow away in Fate's car.<eos> And he cast you adrift.
They're there, I swear it. Come on, save the professor.<eos> They're there. Cross my heart.<eos> Terrific.<eos> What's more, do as I tell you. Stay down.<eos> Shut up, Professor.<eos> They're there.<eos> Here comes the Marines!<eos> Good evening, Baron. Well, Mr. Leslie.<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> I half expected to see you again, but not with a sword in your hand. Do you prefer the foil?
I have to knock him around or I won't be able to calm down.<eos> Yamano's known for being even more slippery than a lawyer.<eos> You're strays, strangers. So you're easy targets for him.<eos> It's not funny!<eos> Where is he?<eos> We don't know.<eos> He told us he had five wives in Manchuria, Korea and each of those mainland countries.<eos> You idiot!<eos> That's a lie, of course.<eos> Mister, what did he get from you?
And yet I love you.<eos> You think your nonchalant attitude impresses people.<eos> But it's just an act.<eos> You're weak.<eos> You don't really know what to do yourself.<eos> Well, well, Miss Know-It-All.<eos> - Besides, I just saw you dancing.<eos> - God, so I danced!<eos> And you? - I danced just like everyone else. - Right.<eos> I saw you both.
You're disgusting!<eos> You hear me?<eos> You're disgusting, like a beast:<eos> Go away, please!<eos> Go away:<eos> I don't want to see you anymore:<eos> Girls, look:<eos> A girl's honor isn't just talk:<eos> It really exists:<eos> If you keep treating it the way you do, don't be surprised if boys treat you badly:

There was a huge town-plan hanging on the wall in the studio.<eos> Everything that had been destroyed was marked in heavy black crayon, and we often listened while doing homework at Grandfather's drawing-table, as he and Grandfather and other men stood in front of the map.<eos> They often quarrelled, for he always said:<eos> "Away with it -- blow it up!"<eos> And he drew an X next to a black spot.<eos> And the others would say: "For God's sake, we can't do that, "there are the remains of a lintel from the sixteenth century,<eos> "and there's part of a chapel from the twelfth!" And he threw the black crayon down, and said:<eos> "All right, do as you wish, but without me, then."<eos> And the others said: "But dear Mr Fähmel, "you're our best demolition expert, you can't leave us in the lurch."<eos> And he said: "But I will leave you in the lurch "if I have to worry about every chicken-run from the Roman Age.
If you say Velasquez was also involved , I won't believe it.<eos> Yes .<eos> This heretic caused us a lot of trouble and we are putting our hopes in Rebecca's hands .<eos> I n this book is everything you saw and experienced .<eos> Maybe I can put it all in some order at last.<eos> The rest you can write yourself.<eos> May Allah send the dew of happiness on your head .<eos> Kiss him , Zibelda .<eos> I will be happy seeing him in your arms .<eos> Whenever I see you , I am always afraid I won't see you again .
And this is your desk.<eos> And this is where your clothes go.<eos> I didn't bring any clothes.<eos> Oh, well, we'll pick them up for you.<eos> This is your study kit and this is how it opens.<eos> You work with that for a while and I'll go get your bedding.<eos> I'll be back in a minute.<eos> The background is still quite unclear to me. But what I know of it thus far isn't good.<eos> I advise you to keep him on a very tight leash.<eos> I saw you through the window and decided not to interrupt.
You sure?<eos> Positive.<eos> I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of blaming me afterwards.<eos> Or you either.<eos> Good night.<eos> Night.<eos> Well?<eos> They're... They're reverent.<eos> Oh, you're joking.<eos> Does the word offend you?
They're mostly his.<eos> When are you going to take this war seriously, Mr Anderson?<eos> Now let me tell you something, Johnson, before you get on my wrong side.<eos> My corn I take serious because it's my corn.<eos> My potatoes and tomatoes and fences I take note of because they're mine.<eos> But this war is not mine and I take no note of it.<eos> You'll take notice when the Yankees drop a cannonball in your parlour.<eos> I might as well tell you now, I can't think of another thing I wanna hear you say.<eos> You have six sons, don't you, Mr Anderson?<eos> Does the size of my family have some special interest for you?
Mr Carroll, everybody in the county knows they're just sitting out the war.<eos> I think what Mr Tinkham means is that he figured anybody too yellow to fight wouldn't mind making a couple of dollars off the war.<eos> - "Yellow"?<eos> - I apologise for my son's manners.<eos> He was taught to have more respect for his elders.<eos> I accept your apology, sir.<eos> Jacob, I don't know what gets into you every once in a while.<eos> You know you shouldn't hit this gentleman, as long as I'm around to do it!<eos> I'm not in the habit of making promises to strangers, but you have my word.<eos> If you don't get off this farm this minute, I'm gonna shoot you stone dead.
No stragglers back there!<eos> All right, keep moving.<eos> Go on inside.<eos> Keep those men moving back there.<eos> All right, move along.<eos> The Boy couldn't be with them, could he, Pa?<eos> - I've a note for Captain Richards.<eos> - You Anderson? - I'm Anderson.<eos> There's nothing I can do for you.<eos> I don't recall asking you to do anything for me.
What am I saying?<eos> Sometimes, I don't know any longer what I'm saying.<eos> What I am saying?<eos> What do I say?<eos> Father.<eos> Bless Pelagie, she is yearning for children.<eos> We will see if this sweety gives birth properly.<eos> I bless you too, beloved Brother you are poor of wealth and spirit.<eos> Don't bless me like a goat!<eos> I estimate you, I love you.
By now they're used to it.<eos> - Another one? - Uh-huh.<eos> In that case, I give up.<eos> - Sophia. Turn around.<eos> So ended the 1910 air race.<eos> - The winner's time: 25 hours, 11 minutes.<eos> Today the same distance can be covered by supersonic jets in seven minutes... but it can take longer.<eos> May I have your attention, please?<eos> We regret to announce that the departure of all planes from London to Paris... - have been delayed again, owing to bad weather.<eos> Buses are waiting outside to take you back to your hotels.
The Russians are in the pastry...<eos> You fool!<eos> What?<eos> The Russians?<eos> We've managed it so far.<eos> - Good afternoon!<eos> Welcome!<eos> - Good afternoon!<eos> You got over it luckily.<eos> God bless you, dear warriors.
If you meet them, just tell them that you saved him.<eos> You're not a dumb boy!<eos> You mislead me.<eos> Relax. It's okay.<eos> Fekete, take care of him.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Halt!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - We've taken over the mansion.<eos> - Who told you to do so?
How long have you been in the front line?<eos> None of your business.<eos> You point a gun to veteran?<eos> Throw it!<eos> Run!<eos> Come on!<eos> Leave!<eos> Go home while you can!<eos> Everybody go home!<eos> God bless you for what you did.
Still haven't wrapped your present.<eos> Everything's going to be OK.<eos> You'll see.<eos> That looks nice.<eos> - Leg or breast?<eos> - I told you not to bother.<eos> Breast, then.<eos> It's the best bit.<eos> There you are.<eos> How much did that set you back?
What have you decided?<eos> Hmm. - Are you taking me?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> With Chrissy.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Do you know what he did?<eos> Do you know why he's in prison?<eos> He's a murderer.<eos> So?<eos> That's why I told you he was dead.
Not much.<eos> I don't really remember you.<eos> That's OK, you were small.<eos> I remember you, though.<eos> Kicking the ball, riding your bike, mucking about in the paddling pool.<eos> You'd keep going all day.<eos> Made me tired just watching you.<eos> We used to say you had rocket fuel in your veins.<eos> - Me and Mum.<eos> She left you.

He's paid his debt to society.<eos> OK.<eos> But what about James, the man he killed? What are your feelings for him?<eos> I didn't really know him.<eos> But you remember him, don't you?<eos> He looked after you with your mum when you were young.<eos> So you forgive your father, then?<eos> Forgive my dad for what?<eos> He didn't do anything to me.<eos> He abandoned you.
He looked after you with your mum when you were young.<eos> So you forgive your father, then?<eos> Forgive my dad for what?<eos> He didn't do anything to me.<eos> He abandoned you.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> If anyone abandoned me, it was my perfect mother out there, with all her lies, pretending he was dead and not letting me have him.<eos> You don't think he knew that by killing James, he would go to prison for a very long time?<eos> That's what I mean when I say he abandoned you.
There we are.<eos> Let me look at you.<eos> - Lovely.<eos> - Yeah, I'm good at funeral wear.<eos> Sorry, that was childish.<eos> What time will you be back?<eos> It's not as if you knew the woman.<eos> Go and wait for me in the car.<eos> All right, Dad.<eos> You know it was the nurse, the nurse that looked after you so well.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> It was good of you to come.<eos> Well, I know that she nursed my gran.<eos> Most people are cowards at funerals.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I know you've been through a lot.<eos> Chrissy, I know you really like
But Sam doesn't know that.<eos> Are you sure he doesn't?<eos> Where's he living?<eos> Could he have taken her there? I<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Oh, come on, Jenny, are you protecting him?<eos> - Huh? Both of them.<eos> - Protecting him?<eos> Why, why?<eos> I'm the one that told you what he did!
- He doesn't want you, Sam.<eos> - He wants me.<eos> - I'm not coming back to you!<eos> I'm staying with Dad.<eos> He understands me.<eos> - He loves me.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> - Well, you've got that wrong. - Sam...<eos> Dad...<eos> I knew she'd come after you.
Yeah, she hates it when she drops that.<eos> He's actually a little boy, but thank you very much.<eos> Did she just think I was a girl?<eos> Why would she think that?<eos> I don't know, maybe she saw you try to throw that feather in the yard yesterday.<eos> Hey, don't watch me when I'm doing stuff.<eos> What are you doing, kid?<eos> Those aren't free!<eos> Oopsie-poopsie!<eos> Aw, God bless you.
Excuse me?<eos> You brought down one of the biggest drug rings in Quahog.<eos> Above and beyond, Swanson.<eos> Well, sir, I... I'm just like any other cop.<eos> My wife puts on my pants one leg at a time.<eos> I appreciate your modesty, but nice work.<eos> It's hard to believe you did that all by yourself.<eos> Yep, did it all by myself, I did, I did.<eos> My little lonesome, says I.<eos> That's weird phrasing, but I'll tell you this, Swanson, you keep up this kind of work, there'll be no more grocery runs for you.
A concussion?<eos> You do me an honor, Lieutenant, but my dance card is full.<eos> Officer Swanson, as you requested, here's a big stack of all the cases you cracked.<eos> Now I'm gonna go ahead and brood over a photo of the girl whose case was the one I couldn't solve.<eos> Your '70s sweater and feathered hair let people know this is a cold case.<eos> Well, hello, Officer Swanson.<eos> Peter?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're not supposed to be here.<eos> I saw you on TV, hogging all the credit for my police work.
Oh, you didn't know this. I never told you this.<eos> I used to, uh, be a travel statistician.<eos> You were a temp.<eos> Yes, I... at a... a travel statisticiary.<eos> Sorry, Tandy, not doing this.<eos> Yeah, Lewis, wait.<eos> W-Wait. Look.<eos> Melissa's sick, Todd's a mess, and, like, Carol and Erica... they're freaking out now about C-sections.<eos> And how does me flying make any of that better?<eos> If we get you up into a plane, there's a chance that you could find someone.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Oh... we've got a cricket in the house, it's driving me crazy.<eos> I told you, we need screens.<eos> You're the building manager, put 'em in.<eos> You know the procedure.<eos> You need to submit a written request.<eos> And exhale.<eos> Okay.<eos> Call me back when you stop feeling dizzy.<eos> Wendy actually called you for guidance?
Just don't stare too long.<eos> Good one.<eos> I'm gonna use that with my sponsees.<eos> Kind of rude.<eos> You know, instead of kicking yourself for not taking action then, be grateful that you're sober now and you have a voice.<eos> I really hate this disease.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Me, too.<eos> That's right, I'm still here.<eos> I know you're dealing with your own crap. I'm sorry she dragged you over here.
I am not being weird about the maid of honor thing, I'm being weird because,<eos> I don't know, I just thought maybe we'd grown close over the past couple years.<eos> What?<eos> We're-We're friends-ish.<eos> I like you just fine.<eos> What a ringing endorsement.<eos> Happy...<eos> Are you even listening?<eos> No, the other gondola's grip is loose.<eos> Hey, Sly, does that look normal to you?
Now I just need to focus on finding their wedding song. Wait.<eos> What?<eos> The bride and groom pick their song.<eos> Well, Toby and Happy couldn't decide on one, so I designed a program that studies the melody, structure and lyrics of thousands of love songs to find the mathematically perfect one.<eos> Mathematically perfect love song?<eos> It'll be the hit of the wedding.<eos> Gallo.<eos> Good news.<eos> We're heading home.<eos> Big success. I'll fill you in later.
There you go, there you go.<eos> Aimed right for the middle of the coil, perfectly done.<eos> I like his approach.<eos> He's not rushed.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> There it is.<eos> He's got 60 points now, and he's on the last obstacle of Level 1, the Mag Wall.<eos> Here he goes.<eos> For a rock climber, this should be right in his wheelhouse.<eos> Oh, here you go, the psychology behind those magnets falling off around you.

I'm gonna finally skin myself a crocodile.<eos> [Whoosh] There's just one problem.<eos> My son's not the only one looking out for his family.<eos> [Door opens, closes] - Mom.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Let me guess, you're here to talk me out of going up against the Black Fairy.<eos> No.<eos> I'm here to tell you you're doing the right thing.<eos> Really? The Final Battle...<eos> It's why I brought you to Storybrooke in the first place.
The Queen, the Queen, the Queen.<eos> It's the Charmings.<eos> They cast a spell so everyone breaks into song.<eos> They plan to use it to stop my curse... the curse you gave me.<eos> Ha. Which means you're going to tell me how to stop them.<eos> Now sing!<eos> [Giggles]<eos> Sorry, dearie. Do you think the Dark One sings?<eos> I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a rusty fork.<eos> And I didn't chose you to cast my curse so you could come crying to me at every itty-bitty sign of trouble.
I wonder what our sorry excuse of a teacher would say if he could see us now?<eos> Gold: How about, "Thank you"?<eos> Now, this was made to freeze the curse.<eos> I wonder how well it's gonna work on people.<eos> So, have you finally come to your senses and decided to surrender?<eos> Hardly.<eos> Why wait for the curse to hit?<eos> Let's start the Final Battle now.<eos> Funny, I was thinking the same thing.<eos> I was planning to wait for my curse to separate you from your family, but they ended up doing my work for me.
Or should I say, listening?<eos> Do you know what I hear?<eos> A little girl who's all alone in this world.<eos> A girl who's weak, without hope.<eos> I used to go to sleep to the sounds of misery like that every night in the mines.<eos> I'll show you misery.<eos> [Giggles] What did you do?<eos> I didn't do anything, just made you face the truth.<eos> You can't do this alone.<eos> What did she do to you?

You're getting those boots.<eos> You follow Emmy on Instagram?<eos> I follow everyone on Instagram.<eos> - Also, it's rude to unfollow.<eos> - Oh. When's the last time you saw her?<eos> Uh, seven months ago.<eos> I should go.<eos> Hey, listen, thank you so much for taking the time to sign with us today.<eos> I really appreciate it, sir. Have a great afternoon.<eos> So if they clone you, does that mean your spit has the same DNA?
Go on, Mallory.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's Valerie.<eos> All right, democracy in action. Listen.<eos> Thanks, Megan.<eos> - You have yourself a nice day.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Are you re...<eos> Sir.<eos> Do you ever think about maybe shutting down your phone and just tuning in to the world around you?
All right, democracy in action. Listen.<eos> Thanks, Megan.<eos> - You have yourself a nice day.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Are you re...<eos> Sir.<eos> Do you ever think about maybe shutting down your phone and just tuning in to the world around you?<eos> Once.<eos> Yeah, but then I realized I was standing in a parking lot and it got too real too fast<eos> This is all a big joke to you, huh?
What do you think these signatures are for?<eos> Clean energy initiatives.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Uh, research, subsidies...<eos> What kind of subsidies?<eos> Fuel-efficient cars.<eos> - $3 billion worth?<eos> And who do you think benefits from that?<eos> Everyone?<eos> Who's paying you for these signatures?
I just... I can't get that soufflé out of my mind.<eos> - Can we just put one in?<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> We'll still get the cheese plate.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> I know.<eos> Exes are awkward enough, but add in a pregnancy and it fucks with you.
Of course.<eos> Oh, wait, shit, it's your first day.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Are you nervous?<eos> - I'd be nervous.<eos> - Nervous?<eos> I'm so fucking nervous.<eos> I haven't been a wage slave since my 20s.<eos> Do you think they'll haze me?<eos> No, I'm sure they'll just stick to pre-formed social groups and subtly isolate you.
Rae is hosting a costume party.<eos> There are multiple strangers with foam weaponry tramping around my living room.<eos> Fireball, fireball, fireball, fireball!<eos> They're chanting.<eos> Mm. Here, that still needs to be canvassed.<eos> So I'm going to have you do this.<eos> And Jim made copies of all the names, and then we'll just...<eos> Laura?<eos> Casey warned us.<eos> Said she poached you from the bowels of corporate corruption?
She's been working the phones since 6:00.<eos> It's unclear whether she eats or sleeps or just absorbs energy from the lies of elected officials.<eos> I'm Todd, by the way. Everyone calls me Harvard.<eos> - You call yourself Harvard.<eos> - All right, Katrina.<eos> All right, Laura, field team.<eos> Field team, Laura.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So how much did Casey tell you?
I want to order French fries.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> I just got fired.<eos> For missing a few houses?<eos> For fucking you.<eos> Do you think I need protection? - Sorry.<eos> - We're adults.<eos> If you're gonna fire him, then fire me too.<eos> Todd was your direct supervisor.<eos> He removed you from your post and took advantage of you.
You've been in a tank for ten years.<eos> A few things have changed.<eos> So it appears.<eos> You wrote a book, and you're now absurdly rich.<eos> And I'm famous.<eos> So, what, you grew up in her fancy penthouse?<eos> Till I went to go live with Grandpa.<eos> Grandpa?<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> When you were leaving Pangaea, and I was getting gored to death by razorbacks, did Abe perchance relay a message to you?
Uh, sorry, I can't.<eos> The hybrid was destroyed in an explosion.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What's this about?<eos> I don't know if you've seen the news, but Reiden has taken children.<eos> Isaac is one of them, I'm trying to get him back.<eos> I saw that.<eos> I was hoping that Isaac wasn't one of them.<eos> - I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> - No, no, it's too dangerous, with the Shepherd hunters still looking for you.
The program, it was shut down 13 years ago.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me about "Blue Diaspora."<eos> The Shepherds that pulled me out of the tank, they kept asking me about it.<eos> "Blue Diaspora" that was, uh, the name of the project that created the hybrids.<eos> All right? That's all that I know.<eos> I swear.<eos> Please.<eos> Please! I have no idea how that thing got inside you.<eos> Why would they ask you about Blue Diaspora?
I'm in.<eos> ♪ Thought you was a savage, now you... ♪ I know exactly where we can get some extra cash.<eos> Sam's going after King's distributor, too.<eos> Shut this thing down for good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Two birds and one stone.<eos> Let's finish it.<eos> Do I sense an attitude?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I was just... thinking about Asakeem and the thousand ways I would crush him for what he did to you.
It's too dangerous.<eos> There may be another way.<eos> You must feel like Rip Van Winkle, waking up in a different world.<eos> Humanity sterilized.<eos> The West Coast fallen.<eos> Packs of monsters roaming the streets.<eos> But the IADG, they think that you can help.<eos> They think you know how to stop the hybrids.<eos> Do you remember anything about how you ended up in that tank?<eos> Who put you there or why?
And that's why we're here. But we need your help.<eos> We need you to remember.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> I've tried.<eos> There's nothing.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Well, it looks like your gamma frequencies are still lagging behind.<eos> I got some meds that should be able to help with that.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Whatever he gives you, don't take it.
Can we go now?<eos> If this works.<eos> Let's go, let's go.<eos> Isaac, come on.<eos> We have to hurry. Go.<eos> Go, go, go, go.<eos> You're working with the Shepherds now?<eos> Teaming up with them was the only chance I had at getting you back.<eos> I did what I had to.<eos> Why would they bring you along?
Dad.<eos> I didn't know you had it in you.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You're gonna tell me everything about Blue Diaspora.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Nice beard.<eos> She called me.<eos> That bitch called me.<eos> Who called you?
Don't worry, Dad.<eos> Not going anywhere.<eos> So... how did you end up with the plane?<eos> Well, we saved the world on this thing, I thought I should keep it in the family.<eos> What happened?<eos> Last thing I remember is, teeth and claws, ripping into me. Whoever saved my life, they...<eos> They didn't do it out of the kindness of their hearts.<eos> You were in Siberia.<eos> At the edge of the world.<eos> Whoever put you in that tank, they didn't want anybody to find you.

Her oxytocin levels are rising in response to what she's seeing in the stitch.<eos> I'll have what she's having.<eos> If you want, we can leave you there for a little while, come back later.<eos> - Memory hotspot comin' up.<eos> All right, you're on the move, Sally.<eos> I'm... on a street somewhere. It's... It's in New York, I think.<eos> It's... it's foggy.<eos> Sabine!<eos> Weather foggy or brain foggy?<eos> I told you, please don't worry about me.
Previously, on Stitchers...<eos> It's foggy.<eos> Her oxytocin levels are rising in response to what she's seeing in the stitch.<eos> What was up with you in the lab yesterday, your hands were shakin' pretty good.
Ballistics came back on a slug, and it was a match for bullets collected from an unsolved murder case 12 years ago.<eos> Victim's name is Jameel Clark.<eos> You shot at Shinwell, because 12 years ago he murdered your brother.<eos> Tell me I'm wrong.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why are you sorry?<eos> Well, you care about Shinwell.<eos> You've been nothing but kind to him.<eos> Learning he's not the man that you thought he was, it must be disappointing.<eos> And you believe everything that Damon Clark told you?
I saw no indication.<eos> And keep in mind, he didn't come to me.<eos> I went to him.<eos> I was looking for confirmation of a theory based on my interpretation of his brother's case, and the recent attempt on Shinwell's life.<eos> 12 years ago, Shinwell murdered Jameel Clark.<eos> It's the only thing that makes any sense.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or maybe there was another reason that Damon wanted to hurt Shinwell.<eos> Watson...<eos> You said it yourself, you went to Damon... Maybe Damon told you what you wanted to hear.
Yeah, I, I heard he got out and started rolling with SBK like nothing ever happened.<eos> I owed it to Jameel to try again.<eos> But I missed.<eos> And after that, I threw the gun into the East River.<eos> I guess I'm no killer.<eos> But Shinwell sure as hell is.<eos> Damon Clark's story rang as true for you as it did for me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Pretty sure I'm the one who should be apologizing. I let a killer into our lives.<eos> It's not like I haven't exposed you to the occasional killer.
Do tell.<eos> 12 years ago, you made a mistake.<eos> Now obviously, you regret it.<eos> Or you wouldn't have become an informant for the department.<eos> You wouldn't have devoted yourself to dismantling SBK.<eos> You're not the man you were.<eos> That could not be more plain.<eos> But the truth must out.<eos> So tell me what happened that night?<eos> What drove you to take Jameel's life?
- Well, your sex addiction...<eos> So you had lunch with Jack and you told him what I told you?<eos> I didn't think it was that big a deal, and then I just... it...<eos> it just, like, slipped out.<eos> -<eos> I just got fired.<eos> Do you think I need protection? - Sorry.<eos> - We're adults.<eos> Todd was your direct supervisor.<eos> He removed you from your post and took advantage of you.
I mean, I suppose a good speech<eos> - does a little of both... - Alex.<eos> You're not my best man.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I'm happy just to be a groomsman.<eos> I'm not a groomsman?<eos> It'll be a small wedding party.<eos> - I introduced you to Leia.<eos> - Valerie introduced me to...<eos> I introduced you to Valerie.
$450?<eos> How about I give you $500 for the table?<eos> It's worth at least $2,000.<eos> No, it's worth what someone's willing to pay for it.<eos> Which, at the moment, is $500.<eos> Table's not for sale.<eos> Okay. $200 for the lot.<eos> Take it or leave it.<eos> Take it.<eos> The sound bothering you?
- Mm-hmm. - Bring me some.<eos> - Strawberry rhubarb?<eos> - Curate a selection.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey. - Hey.<eos> Stop ignoring me.<eos> What? I'm not.<eos> I left you an actual voicemail.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> What do you want me to tell you?
The Red Sea parted. - I slid right through.<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> - I'm so happy for you though.<eos> - Thank you. Thank you for that. I appreciate that.<eos> I'm gonna go back out here.<eos> Join me? I feel an impending Macarena coming on.<eos> Uh, let me think about it for a second.<eos> You sure?<eos> I'm very mediocre at dancing.<eos> Leon's always been the kind of bloke to console you during a break-up, to throw back a stubbie with you when you're feeling blue, and to hold your hair back when you're just a little too pissed.
All right.<eos> maybe it doesn't matter.<eos> No.<eos> Don't forgive me.<eos> Do not let me off that easy.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Am I supposed to punish you?<eos> Am I supposed to walk out and disappear for a week?<eos> What? maybe that's what I deserve.<eos> Do you know why I called you?
Do you know why I called you?<eos> Do you know why I asked you to lunch?<eos> 'Cause I thought we could be fuckups together.<eos> I thought we could have roof sex and... incoherent fantasies.<eos> This is just... this is... this is... this is real.<eos> This is just real.<eos> and it's... boring.<eos> Sorry. mostly okay guy.<eos> Even your addictive tendencies are basically under control.<eos> I cheated on you because I wanted to be with someone that could just drag me down as far as I could go.
Previously on "Somewhere Between"...<eos> The killer called your show.<eos> He said he had Serena<eos> Then the next day in Black Pine Cove, they...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> For one to live, one must die.<eos> Mommy's coming, angel.<eos> I came back to eight days before.<eos> Is it really you?<eos> Sometimes it's like you're asleep and something wakes you up.
Can we talk about it when I get home?<eos> Is Serena okay?<eos> What the hell, Laura?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> How's Serena?<eos> Well, you lied to me.<eos> You said you were going to the station.<eos> Daddy...<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> Hey, what's, uh... what's bothering you, honey?
Come on.<eos> I'll have an officer take you home.<eos> I want you to take Mimi home.<eos> I'm sure the Captain has officers she can throw on that.<eos> I only trust you.<eos> Please.<eos> We can't change anything if we don't keep her alive.<eos> Be careful.<eos> You too.<eos> Any idea why a killer would put you on his list?
- Hello, officer.<eos> - Ma'am. Ma'am.<eos> Is this Mimi's room?<eos> - She can't have visitors, ma'am.<eos> - I'm a friend.<eos> I'd like to be there when she wakes up.<eos> Well, you're welcome to wait out here.<eos> Please tell me if she opens her eyes.<eos> And one was fired from the police for the brutal beating of a citizen.<eos> You're just picking on me 'cause Mrs. Price is too scary for you.
This is pretend, right?<eos> No, angel, this is real.<eos> I am going to find you a school with trees and frogs and eggs to gather.<eos> And maybe just a little bit of math, because you do need that, too.<eos> But... not too much, okay?<eos> It's Auntie Mara. Can I say hello?<eos> Of course.<eos> I miss you, Auntie Mara.<eos> I miss you to smithereens, little one.<eos> Are they torturing you to make me do an interview?
This time, the horse comes back, he's got a blond that's like 10 times hotter than the brunette, right?<eos> And the bandit's like,<eos> "Okay, cowboy, you got one more wish, then you die."<eos> And the cowboy's like, "I think I better talk to my horse again."<eos> He goes, grabs him by the ears, and he goes,<eos> "You dumb lousy animal!<eos> I said posse!"<eos> Well, I guess what happened is what every reporter dreams of... being in the right place at the right time.<eos> Or the wrong and the wrong, in this case.<eos> And will the police be questioning you as a witness to the murder?
- A yellow envelope.<eos> You know, like this.<eos> The kind he always gets from the office.<eos> Okay. I'll be right back, okay?<eos> Why is the door locked? Sorry.<eos> Reflex.<eos> Hey.<eos> That was the man who shot Haskell. - Who was?<eos> - The messenger who was just here.<eos> - What'd he bring you?
That was his helmet and his jacket.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not following.<eos> Ils there a reason an assassin would be delivering packages to me at home?<eos> He was here, so you tell me.<eos> III will take this as some kind of a reaction to the trauma of what you saw, and I will ask you...<eos> Did you see the man's face at the shooting?<eos> No.<eos> - Did you see it today?<eos> - No, he was wearing a helmet.<eos> Was there something distinctive about that helmet or that jacket which tells you it was the same man?
Sweetheart, I have to talk to Auntie Mara about some boring adult stuff.<eos> Would you go upstairs and download all the information about the vigil?<eos> We got to get the time, parking, address.<eos> - Print it all out, okay?<eos> - You got it.<eos> And, um, play Jesse's new single.<eos> Loud enough so we can hear it down here.<eos> You want to hear Jesse's new single?<eos> Loud enough to make the floors shake.<eos> I will never figure you out.
He'll have to resign as D.A.<eos> Tom's greatest fear is being nobody.<eos> Second only to his fear that something will take the shine off his perfect, shining little girl.<eos> It's too bad his concern didn't extend to his second child.<eos> Such a tragedy.<eos> The D.A. watches in horror as his girlfriend blows the top of her head off in front of his flawless angel.<eos> He's not worth that.<eos> One munchkin, destroyed.<eos> It's an even trade for mine.<eos> Call him, or I'll do it now, and I'll take you with me.
As the details of the murders emerged, Nico,<eos> - the picture changed.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And a sworn promise to a grieving family, what's that worth, Tom?<eos> - Stay away from my wife...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Stay away from my daughter...<eos> - Okay. And away from me, or I will make your life - a living hell.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Someone beat you to that one.
Next to Jesse, that's Susanna.<eos> Your fiancée. Who died.<eos> This was taken the day it happened, in Spanish Harbor. Ten years ago.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Look at the flag.<eos> It's July 4th, the day Susanna was killed.<eos> And that's the yellow scarf she was wearing.<eos> The one she was strangled with.<eos> That's Jesse Reid. Who are the others?<eos> One of them killed Haskell DeBray, blackmailed your husband, tied you up, almost killed me and showed up to his old friend's wake.
What?<eos> Where the hell did you go?<eos> I'm leaving. I'm taking Serena with me.<eos> Whatever you're messed up in - is putting our daughter in danger.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So I'm the one who got her poisoned on a flight to Hawaii?<eos> I'm the one who left her alone in the loft?<eos> I didn't leave her alone.<eos> I was attacked.<eos> By the same man who's blackmailing you with pictures of Mara.
Yeah, okay.<eos> We're good.<eos> Go.<eos> All clear.<eos> He's got one guy for protection.<eos> With some serious firepower.<eos> It looks like Rebecca's portfolio.<eos> They say art's a good investment.<eos> Hey.<eos> Zanya told me she saw you in the storeroom.
(footsteps) HETTY: It wasn't money, Mr. Hanna.<eos> It was gold.<eos> $1 million worth when we came home in 1978.<eos> Today, those gold bars are worth a cool $40 million.<eos> Minus the one I sold to Yaniv.<eos> Mm, and I'm assuming he has it all now.<eos> Once we were stateside, I was in charge of it.<eos> Kept it here in this electronic safe.<eos> SAM: Okay, so... how did Yaniv know where it was?<eos> His goons didn't beat it out of you, right?
Yeah.<eos> I just kept thinking about my son.<eos> My husband.<eos> I came so close to losing everything.<eos> I've actually had the... "lying in your own pool of blood" moment, so I get it.<eos> I also nearly caused you to lose Kensi.<eos> No, no, you didn't, that psycho Ferris did.<eos> I mean, obviously, it'd have been nice if you would've come around sooner, but that stubbornness is what makes you a good cop, so....<eos> Thank you.<eos> Which brings me to why I really asked you out here today.
This is about me.<eos> It's the mole?<eos> Did we miss somebody?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But this all starts with Zhrov.<eos> He's the one that exposed Michelle.<eos> Oh, so now you only talk to us when they have guards in the room?<eos> What's up with that?<eos> What do you need?<eos> Who paid you to contact NCIS?
He's the one that exposed Michelle.<eos> Oh, so now you only talk to us when they have guards in the room?<eos> What's up with that?<eos> What do you need?<eos> Who paid you to contact NCIS?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Did everything I tell you check out?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> My wife was kidnapped.<eos> Who told you to ask for her?
Nobody.<eos> Did everything I tell you check out?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> My wife was kidnapped.<eos> Who told you to ask for her?<eos> I ask for her 'cause I knew her.<eos> I spent months with her when she was undercover.<eos> She questioned me when I was arrested.<eos> We're gonna ask you this one more time.<eos> Who paid you to bring CIA Agent Michelle Hanna to this prison?
It was not. I'm telling you the truth.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Get off him!<eos> Maybe you didn't know where this was headed when you signed up.<eos> You give us a name now, it's gonna make a huge difference how this plays out for you.<eos> If something happens to my wife, you're gonna be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life!<eos> Get me out.<eos> You feel that?<eos> That's your larynx getting crushed.<eos> I crack it, it's 50-50 they get a trach tube in you in time.

Ticktock, Sam.<eos> SECNAV has just authorized Tahir's release.<eos> I want my time with you and my children.<eos> We just passed hour eight. There's still no word from Tahir's people.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> LAPD is on top of it.<eos> You okay?<eos> No, not even close.<eos> I got a flight to take you to Kamran and Aiden.
He's been working with a bunch of Middle Eastern and North African criminal organizations.<eos> Only reason why feds haven't shut him down is because he's providing them with a wealth of information on the financial structure of those groups.<eos> He just doesn't know it.<eos> Well, Tahir's obviously getting help.<eos> Somebody's got to be bankrolling him.<eos> Yeah, it could be Aimon Shah.<eos> And even if he isn't helping Tahir, he probably knows who is.<eos> This is all because of his sister?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, what I think is, this guy Tahir truly hates you.
In this country?<eos> Um, but why do you think I know this guy?<eos> The "criminal" part.<eos> Your friend, he insults me.<eos> Who says he's my friend?<eos> You boys seem pretty jumpy.<eos> Might want to cut back on the tea.<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, that?<eos> That is a transcript of conversations and e-mails that tie you to a bunch of criminal organizations.
No.<eos> Guys!<eos> Okay, go for it, Eric.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> This is Sam.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What do you what?<eos> I have your wife.<eos> I'm holding her wedding ring right now.<eos> I'm surprised she agreed to marry you.
It's not about you.<eos> If it's about you, it's about me and everyone else on this team.<eos> Tell me where he is!<eos> Sam.<eos> You gonna shoot me now?<eos> Please just let us help you.<eos> Sam, please.<eos> Please.<eos> Tahir has Michelle's body.<eos> They hijacked the coroner's van, he's gonna meet you at the corner of Hollywood and Highland in ten minutes.
Yeah, for a little while.<eos> What about his dog?<eos> She'll be in her crate;<eos> it's not a big deal.<eos> I suppose that's acceptable.<eos> Well, Sheldon's getting a little better with dogs.<eos> He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland.<eos> If real dogs gave me buttons, I'd like them, too.<eos> Well, I think it's very nice that you're helping out our friend.<eos> I think it's nice that you're taking whatever medication Amy's clearly giving you.
I spoke with Leonard's mother, and she made me feel better.<eos> I don't know who you talked to, but that wasn't my mother.<eos> Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems.<eos> It used to be me.<eos> Now it's Raj and his attack Tribble.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry for everything.<eos> Oh, and FYI... if you cry while they're fighting, they'll take you to McDonald's.
We'll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come on, I'll get you some sheets.<eos> Then we'll see if I can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine.<eos> Never should've had all these kids so close together.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Beverly believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.<eos> Is that bothering you?
Fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Love you. - Love you, too.<eos> - Love you more.<eos> Okay, you won.<eos> Can I finish what I'm doing?<eos> Sure, sorry.<eos> Something on your mind?<eos> No, no, nothing.<eos> Okay, well, maybe I'm just feeling like something's bothering you.
- Love you more.<eos> Okay, you won.<eos> Can I finish what I'm doing?<eos> Sure, sorry.<eos> Something on your mind?<eos> No, no, nothing.<eos> Okay, well, maybe I'm just feeling like something's bothering you.<eos> Nope, all good.<eos> Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.<eos> No, what is wrong with you?
No, it's always him.<eos> So, Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?<eos> Right.<eos> I wasn't getting any responses, and then I added,<eos> "Recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner", and five minutes later,<eos> I met my soul mate.<eos> I was wrong. You can come back in.<eos> So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?<eos> I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didn't really work out.<eos> I'd say she's copying you again, but... I'm getting tired of sitting in the hall.
Why unless it's Raj, in which case, we'll probably get a person of color.<eos> You guys are nice, but I'm just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.<eos> I feel bad for Bert.<eos> So he's using his money to attract a mate.<eos> Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy?<eos> Or Leonard using his power of groveling to get Penny?<eos> It's totally different.<eos> Bert's money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.<eos> All that and he's shorter than me.<eos> Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?
- 'Cause he's scared of you? - Terrified.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm with Leonard, this isn't cool.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I disagree.<eos> Penny is a strong, independent woman.<eos> The more you try to control her, the more she'll push back.<eos> So you think it's okay?<eos> Oh, no, she's gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with.
All right, just come here.<eos> Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don't want you to be uncomfortable.<eos> Well, thanks.<eos> And I don't want you to be stuck at a job you don't like.<eos> Then what do we do?<eos> Well, I don't love it, but if you really want to take this job, I'll find a way to deal with it.<eos> No, I know you'll try, but it'll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and... I'm just gonna stay where I'm at for now.<eos> No, no, no, no, you're-you're unhappy there and then you're gonna blame me for making you stay, and it's fine, I'll just... I'll suck it up.<eos> You don't need to do that, it's okay.<eos> Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I'm being selfish and holding you back.
She said it wasn't my best work.<eos> Man, Ms. Kelley really has it in for me.<eos> I don't remember her being that tough when Molly had her.<eos> You got to catch her in a year she has a boyfriend.<eos> She said I could redo it if I want, but I think I should just cut my losses.<eos> Really? That's what you think?<eos> Ken, you want to step in here?<eos> Gladly.<eos> Dave, don't redo it.<eos> It's obvious this angry spinster doesn't get you.
He was my attending physician during residency.<eos> Brilliant cardiologist, but intimidating as hell.<eos> I used to wonder how someone could know so much about the heart without having one.<eos> Why is he here?<eos> To torment me?<eos> Is it not enough that you almost failed me out of residency? !<eos> That was 20 years ago.<eos> You're not a resident anymore. You're a full-on doctor and a really good one.<eos> You're not wrong.<eos> Come on, Ken, there's no way he's gonna treat you the same now as he did back then.
But it is near the beach.<eos> Of course, you can't get there... 'cause of the traffic.<eos> Right. I got to get some paperwork done to...<eos> Really, the only thing Gary and I had in common was "Game of Thrones."<eos> Dr. Park! Do you watch "Game of Thrones"?<eos> No, so I guess I'm the wrong person...<eos> Oh, don't be silly. There are only six seasons.<eos> I can fill you in real quick.<eos> Okay, season one... fade in.<eos> What's with you?
I knew I should've punted him to another doctor the minute he came in.<eos> Well, I've surrendered to writer's block.<eos> Anyone up for some "Boggle"?<eos> No, you have to get that paper done.<eos> What's the point?<eos> Ms. Kelley's always gonna be against me.<eos> You know what, Dave?<eos> I've been thinking about this.<eos> This is a golden opportunity for you to push back against a teacher who doesn't think you have what it takes.<eos> This is the best thing that ever happened to you.
- Uh, you start with a glaze b...<eos> - Yeah, uh...<eos> I'm actually feeling kind of sad now, so...<eos> I'm gonna go clean some brushes... possibly with my tears.<eos> You can put dogs' ashes in it, too!<eos> Why are you... so weird?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Are we strangers again?<eos> You can not tell Ben what Dora is up to.<eos> You do that, she gets busted, and she will hate you.
You promised.<eos> The whole idea is to keep her safe.<eos> - At the lake with boys... That's not safe.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no.<eos> Operation No Secrets From Daddy... over!<eos> Operation No Teen Pregnancy is on!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Way to go, Agent Double- "O" -Dum-Dum.<eos> If only someone had warned you this would happen!
You crushed it today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> So here's something new...<eos> When you kiss Ben, my armpits tingle and not in a good way.<eos> Okay, you're busy, but this is something we need to discuss!<eos> She taking her punishment okay?<eos> - I mean, I can't not ground her.<eos> - She understands.<eos> Sorry I put you in a weird spot with this mole business.
Andy is the lead!<eos> Andy is the lead!<eos> Hey, Alice.<eos> Do you have any cigarettes?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> That's a silly question.<eos> I just watched the movie again, and at the end, she smokes and gets a boyfriend.<eos> Oh, well, that movie is pretend, and smoking is bad for you.

And this is your favorite shirt in the world.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That is not... that is not for me.<eos> Is it for me, Dad?<eos> Not only this, but I also got us tickets to his meet-and-greet at the Fry Your Face Off Fest this weekend!<eos> Stop!<eos> Come on in, the oil's fine.<eos> That's really great, Ben, but he can't make it.<eos> He has his audition this weekend.<eos> Oh, boy, I put you in a tough spot, didn't I?
I didn't like it as much as the real "Grease."<eos> - But you liked it?<eos> - I guess.<eos> What was your favorite part?<eos> I liked that Andy wore a dress.<eos> That was funny.<eos> Oh, and I also liked the girl forgot her lines and cried.<eos> That was also funny.<eos> But you... you, like, get what I was going for, right, Bunny?<eos> What do you want me to tell you, Dora?
It's just crazy.<eos> You know, - I was just driving down the...<eos> - Mm-hmm. Sounds crazy.<eos> - Reagan.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I worked all day. We haven't seen each other.<eos> Don't you want to catch up?<eos> Yes.<eos> Fine, what?<eos> What happened to you today?
- Two-Shoes, yeah.<eos> But then, in certain shoes that I have, I have three of them, so... so I'm just gonna stick with The Bish.<eos> Come here.<eos> Thank you, The Bish.<eos> Thanks, Winston.<eos> Hey, you know what? Why don't you come on inside...<eos> Very weird. Strange man.<eos> I love Wednesday nights.<eos> And this one's even more special, 'cause I got my name back.<eos> I love you, Cece.
New york or chicago?<eos> It's akron.<eos> That's handy.<eos> Knock, knock, knock.<eos> Hey.<eos> Tortilla chip delivery.<eos> They're scoops, of course. Carol.<eos> I don't need anything special.<eos> Copy that, gail.<eos> You may have noticed that I called you gail? Rather than mom.
I do hope you can accept my apology.<eos> We've all been through so much.<eos> Juliet, and now Rosaline...<eos> I plan to speak with the Prince... offer to help in the search for your beloved niece.<eos> Count Paris, I didn't realize how much I missed you.<eos> I just wish there was some way you could still be part of our family.<eos> As do I.<eos> I never expected you to come back here...<eos> We'll need a story about how we first met.<eos> When I ask Lord Capulet for your hand in marriage, I can't very well tell him the first time I saw you. You were pouring hot oil on me in his basement.
I tell him stories, we play chess...<eos> He's imprinting on me.<eos> As if one Jim Kirk wasn't enough.<eos> Thirty-one years.<eos> Twenty-seven parsecs of of NOTHING!<eos> Jim, it's all right.<eos> We'll break through.<eos> We'll get you home.<eos> It's just a matter of time.<eos> McCoy would have told you...
You don't realize how rich your life is until all the comfort, structure, family, friends are ripped away.<eos> It's like being thrown into prison.<eos> You know you'll never see your shipmates again.<eos> Never find someone to love.<eos> Someone to have your back.<eos> Find a way home.<eos> Years go by and you finally realize...<eos> Are you even a captain when you have no crew?<eos> Are you a leader if no one is following?<eos> You know your crew wouldn't leave you.
Hurry, up here!<eos> Everyone, get up here quickly!<eos> Hurry!<eos> In accordance with Elimination Ordinance 3, Clause 2, Elimination Level has risen by three.<eos> Requesting authorization to use Gravitational Beam Emitter.<eos> You are a body that was stolen from us, the Safeguard.<eos> A body.<eos> Do you intend to return?<eos> Answer immediately.<eos> In accordance with the Ordinance... I will destroy you here.
I'm sorry, I mangled it, I know.<eos> I'll make us some breakfast.<eos> Betsy, would you take this out and put it in the trunk of my car, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I was hoping you weren't serious about this.<eos> A painter. Really?<eos> It's for a friend.<eos> Well, that's a relief.<eos> I'm surrounded by too many artists as it is.<eos> You know, Rose, I always thought of you as more of a people person.
This is not who I am.<eos> But today it is.<eos> Today you are Adelle in the world of this scene.<eos> You can do that.<eos> Soften that light, Charlie.<eos> Max, tilt that top light down.<eos> When you're ready.<eos> Make sure everyone has a drink, and come find me if there are any problems.<eos> Our first guests.<eos> Wait till they see you on screen.
Turns out it's not that smart.<eos> It's fine, just be glad it was another false alarm.<eos> Oh, by the way, I guess we need a car seat to take the baby home from the hospital.<eos> Yeah, I read that in a pamphlet when I was just flashing my vagina to 12 med students.<eos> Oh, we're on it.<eos> But, do you think I could borrow your credit card?<eos> I think I might've misplaced my wallet as well.<eos> Hey, did you hear that?<eos> Now I know exactly what to get Riley for her push gift.<eos> Dude, I'm tellin' you right now, a car seat is a horrible idea.
- Pants.<eos> - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Yeah, we're on the second floor.<eos> Babe, you can do this.<eos> You hang down, stick the landing.<eos> We're really gonna need a new system to avoid your kids. Yeah.<eos> Or you meet 'em.<eos> At worst, I'd break an ankle.<eos> Okay, listen, the truth is I want you to meet them.<eos> I want us to take the next step 'cause you are absolutely amazing, and I love you.
Kind of weird to already give her a nickname, but that's a yes.<eos> - Who else?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Not said with a lot of enthusiasm, but still a yes.<eos> This is happening!<eos> So this is happening.<eos> Totally happening.<eos> Okay, let's do a rundown on the kids.<eos> First, Andy... he's the oldest.<eos> He is very excited to meet you and will come on too strong, so we need some kind of a signal - in case he, like, corners you.
Work emergency.<eos> Some... public-relations guys need my help with some PR stuff.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Love you.<eos> Bye. Hasta luego, beardy.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're running from me?<eos> Okay, now you're just being rude.<eos> No hug. No kiss.<eos> This is not how I raised you.
Look, I get it.<eos> You're meeting my kids.<eos> It's scary, especially for you.<eos> He's on to us!<eos> Kick him in the nuts and run!<eos> Me?<eos> Scared of kids?<eos> I don't even hide when people bring them in here anymore.<eos> I mean, I close my door, but that's just because I have my candies.<eos> All that matters is I love you, and we're in this together.
- I'll pass.<eos> - I'm good. - Okay.<eos> Look, if you're open to it, I would love a redo of our night out.<eos> ♪ Don't go breaking my heart... ♪<eos> How is this winning us over?<eos> So this is Alice today... ruining our duet, but finally taking a chance on love.<eos> What you want is never gonna happen.<eos> ♪ Oh, yes, it's gonna happen ♪<eos> Good thing I have her back 'cause she clearly has no idea what she's doing.<eos> This doesn't mean I totally forgive you.
Thanks for letting me borrow your car.<eos> All right, Mom and Dad'll be here any minute.<eos> Dad's been avoiding me all week about going to the doctor, but I know he can't resist brunch.<eos> That man would walk into a hail of bullets for a plate of bacon.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I turned the exhaust fan on high so the smell wafts outside.<eos> He's gonna float in here like a cartoon bear.<eos> You guys might get along better if you stop nagging the old man.<eos> Hey, I'd much rather be the fun son, like you, but someone has to step up and deal with things.<eos> And that kind of attitude is why he doesn't invite you to go mall walking with us.
He's saying that you look young, and you look old. It's... ah, that's classic ribbing.<eos> Hi. I'm Allison.<eos> Allison, come in! Oh!<eos> Oh, oh. I've heard such good things about you.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> Must take a special lady to be married to a goofball, like this guy.<eos> Yeah, it's funny.<eos> Literally everyone says that.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> So, what brings you around?
What?<eos> Why?<eos> Look, he thinks you're not warm enough, you're too socially formal, and you have an odd way of talking. I have an odd way of talking?<eos> Me?<eos> Really?<eos> No worries, mate.<eos> Put another shrimp on the barbie. Put a koala in your billabong.<eos> Okay, that's more Australian stuff, and he's actually pretty sensitive about that.<eos> Well, thank you very much, Ken.<eos> I mean, I ask you to put in a good word for me, and now my head's on the chopping block.
But this summer was our last chance to be together before I go to college.<eos> I know, but then this came up.<eos> When did you apply for this?<eos> - Two months ago.<eos> - Two months ago?<eos> And you didn't tell me?<eos> How could you be so selfish? Selfish?<eos> Oh, so it's okay for you to leave to go to Stanford, but when I do the same thing, it's selfish?<eos> Stanford was a pre-existing condition.<eos> I'd already applied when I met you.
He would not be treated as a P.O.W.<eos> As a Jew, his fate would be sealed.<eos> [man] The first half of the mission is over.<eos> The easy half.<eos> Now to get home.<eos> Fighters at six o'clock.<eos> This is what a gunner sees:<eos> a speck in the sky.<eos> That's a fighter.<eos> And then a blink. That means he's firing at you, 2,300 rounds a minute.
Toland was one of the most sought-after cinematographers in Hollywood, a status he cemented with his work on Citizen Kane two years earlier.<eos> [Greengrass] Ford knew that Toland wanted to direct, and I think he believed that he could, and he went out of his way to make it possible.<eos> Well, of course, when Ford got out there some months later, what he found was that, far from Toland making, effectively, a small documentary film about what had happened and the aftermath and the destruction and the rebuilding and all the rest of it,<eos> what Toland was actually doing was making a full-on movie.<eos> [narrator] Toland's feature-length film made extensive use of recreations and miniatures.<eos> He had cast Walter Huston as Uncle Sam, and angrily indicted the United States as a sleeping giant that had failed to see Pearl Harbor coming.<eos> The film also was full of the anti-Japanese racism that Lowell Mellett was working to avoid.<eos> Toland exploited that, made that a big part of it, the sort of racial stereotyping.<eos> Watch out, US.<eos> Someday, one of these "incompetent, stupid little children of the Orient" will choose you, and when they get ready to square off, they won't worry about offending you.
With the added strength of his visual compositional acuity, his painterly art became more painterly.<eos> [narrator] In 1960, he won his third Academy Award for Ben-Hur.<eos> He never lost contact with the crew of the Memphis Belle.<eos> [Spielberg] It doesn't make any sense that It's a Wonderful Life wasn't as big a popular smash as The Best Years of Our Lives.<eos> Because it wasn't.<eos> It was a flop when it came out.<eos> But that, for me, is the best Frank Capra movie ever made.<eos> [del Toro] The tragedy of It's a Wonderful Life to me is that the film fails, not only at the box office, but critically.<eos> [Capra] The critics are notoriously unsentimental.<eos> Of course it affects you.
Kathleen Moore.<eos> I heard a joke today.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> The doors open. Suddenly, in walks Hitler,<eos> Mussolini, and Louis B. Mayer.<eos> You've got a gun with two bullets in it. What do you do?<eos> I don't know, what?<eos> Easy.<eos> You shoot Mayer twice.<eos> I hope that dinner wasn't completely intolerable for you tonight, dear.
Uh, no.<eos> Why?<eos> Self-preservation.<eos> Does anyone out there think she's seeing you?<eos> No.<eos> Are you seeing anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Were you seeing Dex?<eos> My goodness, he was married.<eos> Mm, just the way he looked at you.
And I don't need your help with Mayer.<eos> Quiet on rehearsal.<eos> Props, we need props, please.<eos> Mr. Mayer apologizes for the wait, Mr. Brady.<eos> You know how involved he gets with screen tests.<eos> Oh, that's quite all right, Susan.<eos> It's good to see you again.<eos> How you been?<eos> Just fine, Mr. Brady.<eos> Mr. Mayer been treating you okay?
I never will be.<eos> I'm actually more of a Plain Jane.<eos> When people disappoint you, you, um... well... why don't we just see each other at the restaurant now and then.<eos> It's safer that way.<eos> Good luck with the picture.<eos> He'll be out in a minute.<eos> Mother, nobody at Bennington was talking about this at all.<eos> Well, that's because everyone at Bennington is an idiot, darling.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wish my father could've seen you tonight, standing up for justice.
I'll find another lender.<eos> Let's go, son.<eos> Glove salesman.<eos> You know somebody who can spare $2 million?<eos> I can turn Angels into a smash, Pat.<eos> We rush it into theaters, could buy us some time.<eos> No, we don't have time.<eos> Or a bank.<eos> Ah, what do you care?<eos> Every studio in town will be calling you by morning, trying to steal you away.
Yeah, only after I knew you were out of there.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Babe, I've just... I've just been feeding these guys bullshit until I could find my way back to you.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> - You're a liar.<eos> - Teresa, listen.<eos> I did what I had to do... but nothing's changed.<eos> I told you. I'd give my life for you.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Camila finds out about the DEA, she'll kill you.
Don't get comfortable, Teresita.<eos> Now,<eos> Camila needs to see you.<eos> The Cartel races are run by La Mano Poderosa.<eos> That is the five most powerful families in our business.<eos> Every year, each race is hosted by a different one.<eos> Millions exchange hands.<eos> We need cash for product, and we're gonna steal it from them.<eos> This year, the honor goes to our good friend Manuel Jimenez.<eos> And out of the four other bosses, I don't have to tell you about Aurelio Casillas.
Let me go!<eos> I want to talk to her.<eos> Alone.<eos> I understand you because I've felt that pain too.<eos> But it disappeared.<eos> I was told he was dead.<eos> I had to run for my life.<eos> I did things I thought I never would, things I'm ashamed of.<eos> But I was only trying to survive, just like you.<eos> I know he hurt you.
I know he hurt you.<eos> I can see that.<eos> But you don't want him dead.<eos> Otherwise, the soldiers that you called would have done it at the bar.<eos> If we don't make this deal with El Santo,<eos> Guero's going to die.<eos> My boss is gonna kill him.<eos> If you have any feelings left for him, you have to help us.<eos> We deserve better than him, Teresa.<eos> El Santo... has a guy who has to vet you before you meet him.
His palate is without question.<eos> And I'm sure he'll find our product unlike anything you can find available anywhere.<eos> For Epifanio, you're a number on his ledger.<eos> To me, you're family.<eos> And I will protect you and yours like I protect my own.<eos> _<eos> Well, looks like we're in charge of some high-level shit here.<eos> You get promoted?<eos> You should.<eos> I mean, you did do everything Camila asked you to.
- Same room, same time?<eos> - I'll be there.<eos> Not to talk business, though.<eos> Devon, thank you so much for coming.<eos> From here on out, you'll be reporting to me.<eos> With his injury sustained in the raid on the trawler, it's unclear when Agent Finnerman will return.<eos> Or if.<eos> It is important work that Garrett was doing.<eos> The best way we can honor him is to finish that work.<eos> Which is why I'm assigning you as the head of this task force.
What's mine?<eos> Guero.<eos> That's why you asked James to kill him in Bolivia?<eos> He's a snitch, Teresa.<eos> It doesn't matter how many times he bats his blue eyes at you.<eos> He can't be trusted.<eos> I've given you my loyalty.<eos> You don't have to kill him.<eos> I don't have to consult you or anybody else on these matters.<eos> You know, Guero, he still sees you as a morra on his arm.
Why are you telling me all of this?<eos> I'm a notorious over-sharer.<eos> I just wanted you to know that we ain't perfect.<eos> There's a lot of skeletons in these walk-in closets.<eos> What's yours?<eos> My skeleton?<eos> How much time do you have?<eos> I think your boss, Camila, is sleeping with my husband.<eos> So that's why you asked me here?<eos> I know the position that puts you in.
Go now.<eos> We got a long drive ahead of us.<eos> We should get moving.<eos> Thank you, Pote.<eos> I'll start tomorrow.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> If the tunnel is still active, it'll be surrounded by Epifanio's men.<eos> You know he still wants to kill me.<eos> You escaped my husband's wrath since you fled Culiacán.<eos> I have no doubt your wits will keep you safe once more.
Put the gun down!<eos> Hands behind your head!<eos> Where's the girl who was with you?<eos> What girl?<eos> Hey.<eos> Wake up, asshole.<eos> David Lee Autrey?<eos> My ass.<eos> You're just some puto.<eos> Is that what they call you down in Mexico?
I can send my plane along with my bodyguards to escort you.<eos> Well, how can I say no to that?<eos> Boaz will be pleased.<eos> He wants to personally thank you for rescuing him from the DEA.<eos> How is your brother?<eos> Well, to tell you the truth, Boaz is a pain in my ass.<eos> If my mother weren't alive, I would have made you put a bullet in his head.<eos> It would have saved me a lot of trouble.<eos> Family's family, Manuel.<eos> What can I tell you?

_ Okay?<eos> Wait for me in the den.<eos> I'll be right there. Mi'ja.<eos> The people who did this are rabid dogs.<eos> And they are going to be killed that way.<eos> And if I'm right?<eos> If it was Camila?<eos> Then she'll meet the same fate.<eos> Are you all right, mi'ja?<eos> When you became governor, I thought we were through with that life, through with having to worry that someone was gonna kill you in the streets.
That part of my life, of our lives, is over.<eos> Andale.<eos> I'm just a governor now.<eos> I had to wage war on the cartel and rid the streets of their violence once and for all.<eos> And as a result, there are people who want nothing more than to see me dead.<eos> And someday,<eos> God forbid, if they succeed, I pray that you remember me not as the man I was, but as the man that I aspire to be, the man who wants nothing more than to make his daughter proud.<eos> I am, Papi.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Manuel's bodyguards are waiting downstairs for you.
Salud.<eos> A word from Senora Vargas.<eos> In good times, as in bad times, never lose sight of what's important.<eos> Just remember this love is just...<eos> Epifanio.<eos> You know, we were not expecting you.<eos> A toast to the newlyweds.<eos> May your marriage be filled with laughter, with fond memories, and with healthy children.<eos> May you never forget the way she looks tonight.<eos> And may you never forget the way he's looking at you.
No. Take the gun.<eos> No.<eos> We can do this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's your girl.<eos> Doesn't look like you're gonna get the chance to say good-bye.<eos> Teresa!<eos> Don't move.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I saw you with them.
I just have one question for you, Teresa.<eos> Did you know he was alive?<eos> No.<eos> Then we only have one hole to dig.<eos> You led the DEA to my warehouse.<eos> Everything I gave the DEA was a dead end.<eos> Every name, every location was already burned.<eos> And it's because of this you think I shouldn't kill you?<eos> No, I think you shouldn't kill me 'cause you need me.<eos> The Jimenez brothers, they screwed you over, and we both know they were the last cartel in Mexico that was willing to supply you.
_<eos> What is this place?<eos> Who are these people?<eos> They are the believers.<eos> El Santo?<eos> Yeah. Some people call me that.<eos> But it is a name that can never be taken.<eos> It must always, always be given.<eos> Why are you here, Teresa?<eos> My soldiers had to pull you from the jaws of my enemy.
She doesn't know who you really are, but I do.<eos> You don't deserve her.<eos> Do you?<eos> I've been around people like you my whole life.<eos> Selfish. No loyalty.<eos> You saved me.<eos> Why?<eos> You kept her alive when I couldn't.<eos> She kept herself alive.<eos> Hey, I'm not saying I'm not gonna kill you.
Would you like to ask me a question?<eos> Or would you like to deport me?<eos> Or maybe you would like to parade me around the party so you can show everyone that you're not racist because you have a friend who looks like me.<eos> You are nicer than last time.<eos> I wasn't drinking last time, was I?<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I thought that Sharia law didn't let you drink or wear that dress... or talk to men.<eos> I'm not religious. My sister is.<eos> And you can't possibly be that ignorant.<eos> But, of course, you only believe the lies that your fascist boss feeds you.
It's not the alcohol. I...<eos> Let's just be married, enjoy being married.<eos> I mean, we can have a wedding for everyone else, but let's elope for us.<eos> We can't do that. I mean, I'll...<eos> I'll talk to my mom... No.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I want to be married to you.<eos> And I could do without the wedding and the weird, I don't know, "my dad gives me away" wearing a white dress "conveying a virginhood I clearly don't have."<eos> But you don't want to elope because it's romantic.<eos> You just want to put a wall between you and whatever's pulling you away from me.

I'm Maggie Phelps.<eos> How's it feel?<eos> Better.<eos> Swelling went down.<eos> Those savages know about coneflower?<eos> They call it tuka natsu.<eos> Well, look at you, speaking their tongue.<eos> Well, you can forget all that nonsense now.<eos> You made it out.<eos> Those Lamanites won't lay another finger on you.
_<eos> _<eos> Pedro!<eos> Maggie:<eos> I think you're ready.<eos> For what? You and me is gonna ride into town tomorrow.<eos> It's time for you to return to civilization, to your people.<eos> I told you, I don't want that.<eos> I promise. Just loan me your horse. I'll be back in a month with three for you.<eos> You leave, I'll never see you again.

I'll be back in a month with three for you.<eos> You leave, I'll never see you again.<eos> I don't forget friends.<eos> You gotta trust me.<eos> My tribe needs me.<eos> I need to go back. Your tribe.<eos> Those Lamanites did a number on you, didn't they?
I don't care.<eos> You should.<eos> Your... Your oldest son... He's gonna die when he's still a child.<eos> Your middle son will betray you.<eos> And your youngest, your favorite...<eos> You're gonna do something so terrible, you'll lose him forever.<eos> Good luck, Maggie.<eos> Eli!<eos> That act of treachery will poison your bloodline!<eos> I curse you, Eli McCullough!

N-No, that's not a good idea.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Pedro, you need to let me in.<eos> - I don't think so. - We need to talk.<eos> You're all in danger.<eos> What is it?<eos> My father found oil on your land.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I heard.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out why your father sent you to say this.
They've got no control here.<eos> Maybe the U.N...<eos> My second call.<eos> I spoke to the secretary general and the African Union, but they said it's too dangerous.<eos> Which brings me back to you.<eos> If you were still my employee, I wouldn't let you go.<eos> Respectfully, ma'am, that's one reason why I left State to work for an NGO.<eos> I think the rebel leaders will listen to me.<eos> Global Relief Guild is well-regarded here.<eos> Yesterday, they pointed an AK-47 at you and stole your grain.
Your assistant said you had news on the VFF.<eos> We hope to make arrests this week.<eos> That was fast.<eos> An anonymous tip about several shipments of hospital-grade medical equipment led to an abandoned blood work lab near Baker City, Oregon.<eos> And you think that's where Dr. Zanner's planning to finish their biological weapon.<eos> Another tipster claimed he saw three VFF guys at a gas station off Interstate 84.<eos> We're waiting for video confirmation, but the Portland field office is preparing to raid the lab.<eos> Well, I'm glad I was wrong.<eos> I'll start working up the interrogations.<eos> Thing is, Henry... we're taking you off the case.
Not without Jamie.<eos> Come on. You know she didn't kill anybody.<eos> She cares about one thing: Hunting Shepherds.<eos> I never should've let her into Reiden. Let me talk to her.<eos> She's a criminal.<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You'd like that, wouldn't you?<eos> The way I hear it, you've had it out for Jamie ever since she dumped you.
I'm just thankful we didn't trade Clem for Isaac.<eos> I mean, how could I look into my son's eyes knowing that I put another man's child in danger?<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The deal is off.<eos> Do not touch Clementine.<eos> Let her go immediately.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> See, we had a deal in place. With Reiden?<eos> Whatever they told you, it isn't true.
This is impossible.<eos> She can't be pregnant.<eos> There's blood on her shirt, from when she was shot.<eos> How quickly can you test this?<eos> How long is his break?<eos> 20 minutes.<eos> Formaldehyde.<eos> Smells like home.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> What's disgusting is you arresting Jamie because your badge and gun didn't woo her back to you.
Coming up after the break, we'll have highlights of the playoff game between...<eos> Streaking.<eos> Unrelated.<eos> Yep, her leg is fractured.<eos> We should get her to the hospital.<eos> My only medical training is to say "walk it off."<eos> Can you walk it off?<eos> No! Oh, well, that's not good.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go fake-use the phone in the dugout.<eos> Peter, what the hell got into you?
The reason I didn't bring my friends is 'cause I didn't want 'em hogging the spotlight.<eos> And then when I saw everyone giving you all that attention, I-I guess I kind of lost it.<eos> You did a little.<eos> But of course I forgive you.<eos> I just don't understand why you went so crazy.<eos> Well, ever since I was little, I was always the fat, uncoordinated kid that nobody wanted on their team.<eos> And I was excited that for one weekend, if I could just step on that field and get a hit at Fenway park, I could erase all that and feel like a champ for the first time in my life.<eos> But I'm not a champ, I'm a fat loser.<eos> No wonder nobody ever picked me.<eos> I picked you, Peter.
- incredibly sensual.<eos> - Oh. - Not sure where to go with it, you know.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> - It was me, wasn't it?<eos> Be careful, be careful.<eos> I'll dial "nine-one" now, and if you need me to, yell, and I'll dial the last "one."<eos> _<eos> John. Where were you?<eos> The neighborhood watch meeting was today.<eos> I texted you that I couldn't come.
Agent Prentiss, you know as well as I do, every piece of this must be checked out thoroughly.<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> And that's gonna take time.<eos> Which is something he doesn't have.<eos> Help!<eos> Let's go.<eos> You're gonna need to grow eyes in the back of your head.<eos> Hey, hey, sit down.<eos> They're gonna beat you again.<eos> Might even kill you.
But the parents are calling in now.<eos> Every kid with a conditional offer for next year.<eos> - The department's in freefall.<eos> - The initiative was mine.<eos> It existed outside Solasta.<eos> And I was behind you, Jude, you know that.<eos> I wanted the scheme to work.<eos> I was fighting for those girls to realise their full potential.<eos> But it didn't work out like that, though, did it?<eos> The press are calling you a pimp for your brother.
I didn't do this.<eos> She's dangerous, Al.<eos> So come and help me.<eos> Get down here and help me.<eos> 'Jude...'<eos> Jude?<eos> What did you give her?<eos> She might have overdosed.<eos> There you go again, still feeling responsible for her weakness.<eos> That was the saddest part about seeing you again.
I'm not going down that road again.<eos> I've worked way too hard for you to undo my progress.<eos> Progress?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Those people... Snow White, Prince Charming, Captain Hook... none of them are real.<eos> My parents are not fairy-tale characters.<eos> No one in Storybrooke is.<eos> There's no curse.<eos> This is just a regular town.<eos> Mom... what happened to you?

You're the one who's supposed to be getting better.<eos> - Don't go back.<eos> - But it's true.<eos> Henry, you were not saved by a kiss.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> You were saved by medicine, by Dr. Whale and by... hospital.<eos> It's time.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You can't take that. You can't take anything.<eos> It might be how the Black Fairy is keeping you from remembering.
I don't care what kind of magic it takes,<eos> I'm getting Henry and Emma back.<eos> Henry?<eos> What the hell? How'd you get in here?<eos> Dr. Hopper really needs to keep an eye on his wallet.<eos> - Come on. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You serious?<eos> A jailbreak, kid?<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> And no matter what the mayor says, she's never letting you out.
This is where you married your true love yesterday.<eos> My true love? Sorry, kid.<eos> That's not the way the world works.<eos> It does, and it did for you.<eos> You married Captain Hook right here.<eos> Captain Hook?<eos> Who officiated... Tinker Bell? No.<eos> Jiminy Cricket.<eos> It was amazing!<eos> The aisle was right here... where your parents gave you away.

No.<eos> Jiminy Cricket.<eos> It was amazing!<eos> The aisle was right here... where your parents gave you away.<eos> The only time they gave me away was when I was a baby.<eos> Mom, stop it.<eos> They walked you to the altar.
Or what's left of it.<eos> No way.<eos> My mom would never burn it.<eos> Oh, but she did.<eos> Whatever last bit of belief she clung to went up in smoke, just like the pages of your precious book.<eos> Not even you could destroy her belief completely.<eos> If that's so, then why is she packing for Boston at this very moment?<eos> I'll stop you.<eos> Oh, haven't you already tried that?<eos> Look where it got you.
Please, no!<eos> Please, no!<eos> Please, no!<eos> No.<eos> You found me.<eos> Did you ever doubt I would?<eos> Truthfully, the beanstalk that fell on me gave me pause.<eos> Snow, we're gonna be fine.<eos> Darkness never wins.<eos> It just fools you into thinking it does.
Time to go to work, Gideon.<eos> Hello, Mr. Gold.<eos> I was just here to pick up my watch.<eos> No, you weren't...<eos> Mother.<eos> Of course.<eos> You know, I only separated you from Belle for your own good.<eos> She's my wife.<eos> And a terrible one.<eos> She would convince you to go against your dark instincts.
Mother.<eos> Of course.<eos> You know, I only separated you from Belle for your own good.<eos> She's my wife.<eos> And a terrible one.<eos> She would convince you to go against your dark instincts.<eos> I couldn't let that happen.<eos> But once the Final Battle is won, the curse on Belle and Gideon will be lifted, and I will have unchecked powers.<eos> Not even the laws of magic will apply.<eos> I can make them love you without you having to give up being the Dark One.
You know, the dregs of Purgatory.<eos> So, when Shorty's was declared abandoned and needed a new owner, I thought of you.<eos> I can respect that, even if it is lazy as shit.<eos> You got the cash to pay the taxes to get her up and running or not?<eos> I am a man of means.<eos> I will find a way.<eos> - So many layers.<eos> - God.<eos> It's disturbing how happy you are right now.<eos> Though it is more of a Jeremy thing. So why is Lucado sticking you in here with this when you should be out sticking it to supernatural nasties?
- Doc.<eos> - I said I'd be back.<eos> And I said I'd call you.<eos> I didn't come to fight, Rosita, merely to inquire on my proposition.<eos> - You think you need more time... - I don't.<eos> It's too expensive for your sorry ass and damn near<eos> - impossible. - I've been "damn near" many things in my long life and still, here I stand.<eos> Where did you get the goods?<eos> I know they're not legal.<eos> Frankly, that's what I thought might entice you.
They're coming.<eos> They're coming and they're gonna kill me!<eos> This is really gonna effup your property values.<eos> - Do you still smok?<eos> - God, no.<eos> - Let's get you somewhere safe.<eos> - Stay with her.<eos> - I'm gonna pok around. Okay?<eos> - I'm such a shit, Wynonna.<eos> People used to make fun of you when you talked about what happened to Willa.
Catholic school. Right.<eos> - It's calling to me.<eos> - You like this?<eos> I know a cathedral in France that'll blow your skirt up.<eos> You're not worthy of its glory.<eos> If I had a nickel for every guy who said that before we danced.<eos> Stupid Earl.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> ! I don't know what's behind door number one, but I'm pretty sure it's not a SeaDoo.<eos> I'm not leaving you alone to face...
But that I know how to do.<eos> This is scarier.<eos> Good.<eos> Then get your head out of your ass and just be the person you are inside.<eos> Ugh. That sounds like a nightmare.<eos> Why do they ask me for advice?<eos> Still texting with Ivy?<eos> More like to Ivy.<eos> How many times did you text her without a response?<eos> Linus, when a girl doesn't text you back right away you don't just keep... Are you kidding me?
Okay.<eos> All right, heads it is.<eos> You go, I pay.<eos> That was fast.<eos> Yo.<eos> Hey!<eos> You saw James Miller today.<eos> What did he tell Who?<eos> I don't know who you're talking about.<eos> - What did he tell you?
'You've reached Georgia Cunningham.<eos> 'I am unable to take your call right now...'<eos> - 'Hey, Holly.'<eos> - George. - Hi.<eos> Yeah, it's me.<eos> Hi.<eos> - 'What's up?<eos> I just...<eos> I just wanted to check in.<eos> I don't know if anyone told you about...
She's fucked up.<eos> She's fucked up like Fay.<eos> You were there too.<eos> What were you doing?<eos> I looked after her.<eos> All right?<eos> I did my best. - Wait.<eos> - You're getting on my tits, McStay.<eos> Hi, fuck-face.<eos> What's got into you?
I think...<eos> I think I know where he's gone.<eos> They had a place, Fay and James.<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> Don't go over.<eos> I need to know.<eos> I need to know.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You never gave them the things I was sent.<eos> The things I handed over to you.
Oh, I realize I'm saying this to a man who once referred to Rudolph as an affirmative action case.<eos> You know, first, Rooster doesn't want to be part of this ranch.<eos> Now he doesn't want to be part of this family.<eos> Fine by me.<eos> He'll come back.<eos> Colt did.<eos> Colt didn't come back.<eos> He was kicked out of the rest of the world.<eos> Okay... I can see this is going nowhere.<eos> Think I'll just leave you alone so you can be visited by your three ghosts.
- Since my parents got here.<eos> - What? I thought they were meetin' us at midnight Mass.<eos> I know, but my dad wanted to stop by and take a look at the furnace.<eos> - I just fixed your furnace.<eos> - Yeah, that's why he wanted to stop by.<eos> This is the last thing I need right now.<eos> Listen, don't be nervous.<eos> All right?<eos> Yeah, they don't like you.<eos> And, yeah, them talkin' about how much they don't like you is the reason why I'm on cigarette number four.
I assume so.<eos> Hey, Chief. Sorry about that little intrusion earlier.<eos> - Won't happen again.<eos> - What was the issue?<eos> One of my constituents, looking for me.<eos> What'd he want?<eos> Name it, it's a different complaint every time.<eos> Last month, he asked me to do something about Daylight Savings Time.<eos> Guy's a crackpot.<eos> The prevailing wisdom among council members is guys like him you just gotta keep at arm's length, otherwise they'll never leave you alone.
- and doesn't know how to let go of her p...<eos> - No need to continue.<eos> Amin's not a real member of this team, just a glorified mascot.<eos> You didn't ask about Shelby Wyatt.<eos> An orphan.<eos> She's worked hard to craft her own identity and now cares way too much about how the world perceives her.<eos> Think I'm pretty well-versed on her weak points.<eos> Here's to long days, short nights, and wondering if you're saying the wrong thing every time your new boss talks to you.<eos> Really?<eos> Ignoring me for some townie who's not even making eyes at you?
All right, I'll get us some food.<eos> I'm sorry, Malory.<eos> We won't be able to fulfill our promise to you.<eos> What?<eos> You said you'd protect me, that I could get some kind of a deal.<eos> Unfortunately, it turns out I don't have the authorization I thought I did to make that offer.<eos> But we want to help you get out of town.<eos> Out of town?<eos> What do you... What do you mean?<eos> The people who are after you, they may not stop.
I owe you.<eos> Well, how about you buy me dinner?<eos> I don't pay for stories.<eos> Okay, so I'll buy you dinner.<eos> Okay, but it can't be expensive.<eos> I have a very strict code of ethics.<eos> Oh. Friday night, pick the worst restaurant in town.<eos> You're on.<eos> León, it's Shelby Wyatt.<eos> I was just thinking about you and thought I'd call and see how you were.
Great news.<eos> I just got us tickets to "The Bodyguard."<eos> Mom, I know you're a little pop-culture challenged, but that's not in theaters anymore.<eos> No, not the movie... the musical.<eos> At the Pantages.<eos> That's nice of you, but why?<eos> We don't do enough things together as a family.<eos> I begged you to let me choreograph something for all of us.
Come on!<eos> Get out!<eos> Come on, hurry!<eos> Undo the stupid rope! Hurry!<eos> I'm trying! I'm going!<eos> ­My God!<eos> Come on.<eos> YYou still have your old place, right? Yeah.<eos> Most of my stuff is still there.<eos> Go there tonight, aaand I will pick you up tomorrow.

Yeah.<eos> Most of my stuff is still there.<eos> Go there tonight, aaand I will pick you up tomorrow.<eos> - Listen!<eos> - ­What?<eos> What? I'll pick you up in the morning - and take you to the salon. ­
You're so sweet to give me a lift.<eos> Des is messed up about Roller.<eos> I believe she truly cared for that boy.<eos> Even though she probably told herself it was just about the boning.<eos> In my experience, those lines get blurry, fast.<eos> You tell yourself that you're just fulfilling your deepest carnal appetites, that deep need we all, as humans, share for connection ­and interpersonal friction.<eos> For pussy.<eos> Right. And you swear to yourself that your head's on straight and it's just gonna be in and out, and then boom... you're knocked up by a minor Kennedy.<eos> Remember croissant lady?<eos> That freakazoid who was waiting for you in the car?
Please, you're gonna hurt your hand.<eos> Daddy, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Please, please, please, please don't.<eos> Daddy, look at your hand.<eos> Shh.<eos> He's got him.<eos> Dean, I'm home.<eos> Here.<eos> II kept something warm for you.
Of course.<eos> How psycho you trying to be?<eos> Shit.<eos> Don't run, bitch!<eos> Virginia!<eos> Come on, get back here!<eos> Girl, I...<eos> Aah! What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Get your ass up.<eos> How do I know Uncle Daddy didn't send you?
Hint, hint.<eos> Damona, Damona.<eos> You know, Clark?<eos> Maybe the idea of me marrying Damona isn't so crazy.<eos> Despite how complicated things got between me and... - Tiffany?<eos> - Hmm, there you go.<eos> Not really sure why that last part sounded like a question. Hmm.<eos> Tiffany.<eos> Wh-What are you doing here?<eos> I e-mailed you, but I never heard back.
Yes. But she did it for me.<eos> Can't you see that if you hurt her, you are hurting me?<eos> I will help you stop her, but I will not let you hurt her.<eos> Now, I need you to look me in the eye and tell to me you won't harm her.<eos> I can't do that, Elizabeth.<eos> Then you can't come up.<eos> I haven't laid eyes on Agnes since the night I helped you escape.<eos> So big.<eos> Whatever are you feeding her?<eos> You risked your life for our family and he shot you for it.
I did it for Agnes.<eos> I can protect my own daughter just fine, thank you.<eos> Like you did today?<eos> What if I was one of Raymond's enemies that would do anything to get at him?<eos> Please, do what your mother never had the courage to do until it was too late,<eos> walk away from Raymond.<eos> Uh, hello?<eos> Bronwyn, hi.<eos> It's Alexa.<eos> I'm the one who hit you with my car.
He's listening to sundown. The strum of the guitar. The voice of a man who's seen too much sorrow.<eos> You know, there is a chance this music was on before Reddington got here.<eos> And I think you're right, I think the cleaner is a woman.<eos> Comes here, she cleans the turntable, she cleans the album.<eos> But did she clean this?<eos> A record cleaning brush.<eos> It's full of prints. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Well, partner, we're finally gonna nail Reddington.<eos> A skinny mocha latte.<eos> I'm not stalking you, I swear. Well, I kind of am.
PTA, rotary club.<eos> Pure vanilla.<eos> Why would Philomena have anything to do with her?<eos> Well, she isn't interested in her, she's interested in her brother.<eos> Alexa Feist's maiden name is Gerard.<eos> As in Marvin Gerard.<eos> Reddington's lawyer.<eos> Kaplan's using Philomena to go after his closest allies.<eos> Boo!<eos> Marvin. This is Bronwyn, the woman I was telling you about.
We're headed to her place now.<eos> No. First secure Marvin.<eos> I'll call to alert him you're coming.<eos> Once he's safe you see to the sister.<eos> Write down this address...<eos> Look, I can't represent you in court, but I can draft up some briefs that you can bring to any attorney.<eos> And your ex-husband, he won't know what hit him.<eos> I don't...<eos> I can't thank you enough. Both of you. I...<eos> It's the least I could do after what I put you through.
I'll let you two talk.<eos> Like hell. Stay put.<eos> I'm contacting homeland security, then we'll come up with an action plan.<eos> Together.<eos> Excellent work, agent Keen.<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> How'd you change the fingerprint?<eos> The fingerprint?<eos> Don't play dumb.<eos> The one Gale and Ressler found that connects you to the death of Diane Fowler.
Nick is always dumb.<eos> He's the dumbest boy in school.<eos> I had no idea you cared so much about what happens to Nick and Jess. I've been watching these idiots do this dance for the last six years.<eos> He's rough and tumble.<eos> She's sweet and sassy.<eos> It's the moon and the tides, it's the push and the pull.<eos> I know, it just makes so much sense.<eos> I'm gonna go tell him that she loves him. I'm gonna go tell him that she loves him,<eos> I'm gonna burst in the door, and I'm gonna say,<eos> "Nick, she loves you," and then...
Be brave.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, babe, I'm back.<eos> Whew!<eos> What's, uh... what's happening?<eos> I'm pregnant. - What?<eos> - I mean, you're pregnant.<eos> We're pregnant.<eos> Sadie called you, and-and Jess picked up, then she called again and Winston picked up,
People usually bring their kids.<eos> Oh, we're kids at heart.<eos> Captain Ewan Allenbach.<eos> What do you think of our house?<eos> We were just admiring the symbol out front.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Um, if you're interested, we're always looking for new volunteers.<eos> Oh, by the looks of it, y'all do too many sit-ups for my taste.<eos> Name is Wynonna Earp.<eos> Mean anything to you?
I thought you were staying at Nicole's? Yeah.<eos> No. I, uh... I needed to pick something up in town.<eos> Wynonna, um... when the demon jumped back into me, it was different.<eos> It told me things... - about you.<eos> - So what, now you know all my secrets?<eos> I'm not sure even you know this one yet.<eos> You OK in there?<eos> You know, I'm here for you... now and forever.<eos> Wynonna?<eos> What exactly did Mikshun tell you?
I'm gonna go find that seal!<eos> Anyone want a snack?<eos> Doc, do you want a snack?<eos> I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get you a snack.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, uh, Wynonna.<eos> You wanna grab coffee with me?<eos> There's something I wanna discuss with you that's... personal.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - How about she meets you there?
Yeah, we've got stuff we need to discuss.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> The diner. Half hour.<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Ow! You realize Dolls is about to tell you he wants to be more.<eos> - More than a dragon?<eos> - More than your Boss.<eos> - What?<eos> - He asked you for coffee to discuss something personal.
Henry's a big part of this whole situation you got going on, isn't he?<eos> Yeah, and now Dolls is...<eos> going for it.<eos> I mean...<eos> You hiding this is not fair, to either of them.<eos> Tough shit.<eos> It's my decision who to tell and when and it's my situation, and nobody gets to decide how to handle it but me.<eos> So stop pushing me, and while you're at it, stop judging me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Your girlfriend's looking at you like you're the fudge to her sundae.
Classified Intel on vulnerabilities in U.S. passport control.<eos> But she hasn't put any of it to use yet.<eos> So, for the first time, we have a chance to get ahead of a collaborator before they act?<eos> Exactly.<eos> She accessed the cache this morning from her phone, bounced her IP off a sole server in Riyadh.<eos> Shelby, thank you for offering to utilize your asset there, but we were able to trace it to Rebecca.<eos> Who's your asset in Riyadh?<eos> I thought I could reach out to Samar.<eos> Samar?<eos> The woman who conned you into believing she was your sister for 15 years, Shelby?
You have to choose.<eos> Do you need them more than the world needs you?<eos> We're up.<eos> You know what to say?<eos> I always know what to say.<eos> Wyatt in position.<eos> Any word from the reporter on who talked? No.<eos> She's protecting her sources.<eos> According to my experience, Russian women stand their ground with the best of them.<eos> Why did this one help you with our mission?
We were so close.<eos> Now we're nowhere.<eos> Call her first before you do anything else.<eos> She won't speak to me.<eos> Well, I can tell you what she's thinking.<eos> You tricked and betrayed her.<eos> Everything you said was half a truth, which makes it half a lie.<eos> Are you trying to help me or...?<eos> Look, this is what happens.<eos> People don't understand at first, but she knows you.
So tell her that.<eos> Tell her how disappointed you are in her.<eos> Tell her how you wish things were different.<eos> But you can't cut her out of your life because she's not the person that you want her to be.<eos> You told that reporter about Sean Gregory.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she put together who I was, followed me to Brookwell.<eos> So you gave her an exclusive.<eos> And, in exchange, she helped you with Rebecca Sherman.
I used to think so.<eos> No. He is.<eos> His father and brother, not so sure.<eos> His mother?<eos> Well, the verdict is still out.<eos> But Clay?<eos> I mean, he's the one.<eos> He's the one that they got right.<eos> Okay, so you've come all this way to tell me to trust him and accept him and this double life.<eos> I know what it's like when the people you care about lie to you.
So she already went out with the rebound guy, and if I would have asked her out like I wanted to, then she'd be crushing on me now?<eos> Dude, you're missing the bigger picture.<eos> My rebound theory completely works.<eos> You're gonna up there right now, and you're gonna dump her.<eos> You got it.<eos> Can I do it next week, though?<eos> She got us tickets to my favorite band.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> How are ya?<eos> Haven't seen you all day.
I see his stupid hat.<eos> Jen.<eos> Jen, give me your hand.<eos> You're almost there.<eos> Slowly.<eos> You okay?<eos> Tired.<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> Okay, just catch your breath.<eos> If only someone had warned you about putting the soil supply up on that loft.
Out here, the fog should dissipate in a few minutes.<eos> That means the only place the fog being generated inside the tank can go is through the vent in the dome.<eos> It should start pouring out faster. It's starting to.<eos> That looks really bad, and you don't have a good mask.<eos> Hurry up or you won't be getting enough oxygen.<eos> Because you're not getting enough oxygen.<eos> I know I can't be what you need.<eos> I know I can't be emotionally present the way that you deserve, but I always thought that, that eventually, that you'd want to...<eos> you'd want to be with me.<eos> That's why it hurts... because I love you.
What did she say?<eos> Walt, just hold on.<eos> We're gonna figure out a way to get you down.<eos> You guys lied to me!<eos> I know what happened!<eos> Paige told me she loves me in space!<eos> Oh, man. Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - Oh, crap.<eos> Hey, Walt, uh, look, it's not Princess and the Pea quality, but it should stop you from breaking most of your bones.
You upset about Paige and outer space?<eos> Everyone knew?<eos> I poured my heart out to her, and everyone knew?<eos> So all this time, I'm walking around the office unaware, like an imbecile, and...<eos> I'm disappointed in Paige.<eos> She lied to me.<eos> She didn't lie to you.<eos> You were suffering hallucinations.<eos> She helped save you.<eos> She didn't tell you what happened because she probably thought you'd be embarrassed.
I think he needs his space.<eos> Okay, thank you. Well, Kapper's been hit with over a million in environmental fines.<eos> NASA won't work with him.<eos> Man, this party sucks.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> I have a surprise coming.<eos> While we're on the topic of surprises, saw Happy unloading a wrapped gift from her truck.<eos> Can only assume it's for you, Doc.<eos> This party just got better.<eos> Oh! Happy, let me help you with that.
I mean, what if she does something crazy?<eos> Like what?<eos> Like... give me a bad Yelp review.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Come on, Elliot.<eos> You need to lie down.<eos> Oh, Alan.<eos> You take such good care of me.<eos> Oooh, have you been working out?<eos> The drugs they give you when they take out your wisdom teeth must be good.
- No.<eos> There isn't, Gabi.<eos> Okay, because she wants it to be about something dramatic and exciting, and I go to work, I come home, I play online Yahtzee, and I go to bed.<eos> Where is the drama and excitement in that?<eos> I'm really sorry, but can we talk about this later, because Josh is here, and we're gonna have like a bunch of s...<eos> Yeah, sex, I know, I get it, you're having sex.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Sorry it took me so long, I was a Marissa's for hours.<eos> Oh... yeah, sorry I stuck you with her.
Hi.<eos> Are you Marissa's boyfriend?<eos> I... was.<eos> You need to get back together with her.<eos> Thank you so much for asking us in, Vinny.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Who are you again?<eos> Oh, uh, I'm... I'm Gabi from Gabi's Box.<eos> Thanks for your... order, by the way, make sure you like us on Facebook, so why the hell did you break up with Marissa?<eos> I mean, she loves you so much, and she thought that you loved her.
Tucker Dobbs?<eos> I've heard some very impressive things about you.<eos> Really?<eos> Impressive enough to hire me?<eos> Well, all I can say is, your mother is hysterical.<eos> My what?<eos> Hello, son.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I told you, you are not my plus one, y... you're not even my minus one.<eos> Ben felt bad about your mother not loving you enough to show up, so here I am.

John, may we have a moment?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want my mommy.<eos> Well, your mommy wants you here.<eos> Now take a big, deep breath of this, and you'll feel much better.<eos> Hello, John.<eos> How's rehearsal coming?<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> Uh, what-what brings you here?
Stay on Aubrey.<eos> Hello, all.<eos> So late.<eos> How was work, darling?<eos> Yes, maybe you'd like to tell us how it feels to be humiliating your father by working in the wardrobe department?<eos> I'm not above paying my dues.<eos> How else can I learn the business?<eos> Whoever wanted you to learn the business?<eos> You don't see Louis Mayer's daughters working in the sweatshop.<eos> If it's the conditions in there that worry you, Daddy, I can tell you how...
I'll level with you.<eos> Would you like to sit down?<eos> I was brought out here at age 16 by a song-plugger.<eos> The only thing he didn't let people put into my mouth was music.<eos> That's why I do this.<eos> For every girl stepping off that train in Pasadena, hoping to be Paulette Goddard.<eos> This is for her.<eos> We are not just objects.<eos> See?<eos> I'm sorry that happened to you. Mm-hmm.
You mean like the directors you keep waiting outside your office for days at a time?<eos> Or the writers you fire, who then end up flying off a catwalk?<eos> Or the actresses Pat bends over his desk?<eos> You mean that kind of respect?<eos> This is just a machine you're running.<eos> And we're all just part of it.<eos> Even Minna, as exalted as she was, was a cog to you.<eos> And I am going to call your attention to that fact every fucking chance I get, until the people who make your movies begin to mean as much to you as the movies themselves.<eos> After all, you'd be pretty hard-pressed to produce one without us.<eos> Now get out of here before I tell you to drop your pants.
This is...<eos> Harris Thornton.<eos> Your trainee for the day.<eos> Great to have you with us, Harris.<eos> We'll take good care of him, Chief.<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.<eos> So, you are to observe only.<eos> That means you don't touch anyone, you don't hand out medical advice.<eos> You just stand to the side.<eos> You let these very capable ladies tell you what to do.
She wanted to be kidnapped?<eos> She wanted to be drugged without her knowledge?<eos> What she wanted was to get away from you,<eos> - so badly that she died! - Erin.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It was just supposed to be fun.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Why are you in a hospital gown?<eos> It's a really long story.<eos> We got the guys who attacked you, so they're never gonna hurt anybody ever again.
How 'bout filling these out?<eos> Hey, what do we got?<eos> You've really gotta retrace all your steps.<eos> I don't understand why the network isn't constantly backing itself up.<eos> Hard drives are so cheap these days.<eos> Hey, Dr. Charles says, um, they're looking to fill the open residency in the E.D.<eos> That's great news, isn't it?<eos> - Why?<eos> - 'Cause now you can take it.<eos> Isn't that the position that you wanted before Dr. Charles pulled you into psychiatry?
So you're saying that Assistant Director Weller was absent... for the biggest FBI tragedy in recent memory?<eos> He was lured away by someone claiming that the mother of his unborn child needed him at the hospital.<eos> Assistant Director Weller... still made it in time to save Nas and Reade.<eos> I'm well aware of his heroics after the fact, but why do you think the same terrorist group that killed so many other agents work to keep him out of harm's way?<eos> What makes Assistant Director Weller so valuable to them?<eos> All right.<eos> I'll go through the front.<eos> You guys cover the back just in case he runs.<eos> This guy's a music teacher, right? You really think he's gonna run?<eos> Well, sometimes people surprise you.
You hear that?<eos> Go around the back.<eos> Eli... we're with the FBI.<eos> We're here to help you, not hurt you.<eos> I just want to ask you some questions about your foster home.<eos> I didn't kill Amber.<eos> They did!<eos> Who's they?<eos> - Hey. - Hey.<eos> What brings you to paradise?
I can't bring myself to watch it.<eos> You know, when I came back from my last tour,<eos> all my buddies who died over there, they kept visiting me in my sleep.<eos> I couldn't figure out... how to make 'em leave me alone.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> This shrink made me look at their photos, photos of what happened to them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When you watch this tape, whatever's on it becomes real, but it also becomes contained.<eos> You mind can stop trying to fill in the blanks.<eos> If you spend your life running from this, it's gonna eat you alive.
I alone made the decision to send Jane in as an undercover operative.<eos> I alone let Nigel Thornton, aka Robert Borden, undermine this entire operation, and I alone made the call to send FBI agents into the Sandstorm compound, which resulted in multiple casualties,<eos> and I alone deserve to suffer the consequences.<eos> - I know what you're doing.<eos> - Telling the truth? Taking the heat off of everyone else by jumping in the fire yourself.<eos> Look, you're smarter than this, Matthew.<eos> You know that if you drag this team in front of a Congressional subcommittee, you'll have a fight on your hands.<eos> Yeah, a fight I can win.<eos> A fight you might win. But if Weller brings Shepherd in tomorrow, he'll be the hero and you'll look like a fool.<eos> What I'm offering you is a sure thing, a guaranteed win.
The privilege has been all ours.<eos> You sacrificed your entire career for us.<eos> I lost a battle so you could win the war.<eos> I'll drink to that.<eos> My people just sent this.<eos> The accounts where Sandstorm are holding their funds.<eos> You cut them off from their money, you back them into a corner, maybe force them to make a mistake.<eos> Or derail their plans altogether.<eos> That is one hell of a going away present.<eos> I gotta say, none of us wanted you here... when this all started,
You fix it while we go and check the Ravager hideout.<eos> Drax, stay and give me a hand.<eos> Groot ain't gonna be much help.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> Try and keep up, will you?<eos> - Be patient with him.<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> "Everybody be patient with Groot!"<eos> No one was half this nice when I got into roller disco.<eos> Groot's behavior is selfless, nurturing, and irritates the krutack out of you.
Your behavior suggests otherwise.<eos> Don't tell me what to do!<eos> Why is a nearly-adult Rigellian so unable to control herself, or her telekinetic abilities?<eos> You sound just like my dad!<eos> Your father sounds like a wise man.<eos> Well, he's not, okay?<eos> And I don't care what he says.<eos> I won't do the Centering.<eos> Just... Just let me go.<eos> You could say I knocked you out.
Pain!<eos> It is unsportsmanlike to crush your friend when he is down.<eos> Whatever, Grandpa.<eos> - Tana!<eos> - Whoo! Why would you endanger your life like this?<eos> I'm having fun.<eos> Lighten up.<eos> Whoo! I would never allow my daughter to behave so irresponsibly.<eos> I am not your daughter!<eos> - This geezer bothering you, Tana?
Fire up the proton drive!<eos> Here's an idea, Quill.<eos> Why don't ya steer us out of the line of fire?<eos> Look!<eos> Order will be maintained.<eos> Neutralize the rebels.<eos> Drax, what would you want for Camaria?<eos> Wouldn't you want her to be able to make her own choices?<eos> Help me!<eos> You may not be my daughter, but I will protect you as if you were.

See?<eos> You almost made me say it.<eos> Well, guess it's up to us...<eos> Again. I am Groot!<eos> That the best you got, furless?<eos> You couldn't handle my best, rodent!<eos> No!<eos> Ha! Now I have you!<eos> Sorry, Nebs.<eos> I'm shutting you down.
Rocket, open the door!<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> Groot, close the door!<eos> Great.<eos> We're trapped in a supply closet!<eos> Beats being trapped in a hallway!<eos> Funny how your "friends" didn't put up much of an argument when you said you were staying behind.<eos> They respect my decisions.<eos> And someone had to keep an eye on you.<eos> Or maybe they didn't really want you on the mission.
- I am Groot.<eos> - Got that right, bud.<eos> Ain't every day a princess invites you to a party for helping avert a war.
No!<eos> She deserves much more than seven, don't you think?<eos> Oh, I've left my laptop at work!<eos> Do you need it?<eos> I said I'd e-mail my reports in the morning.<eos> I still have half of them to do.<eos> Go in early, I'll do the kids.<eos> I've too much on in the morning.<eos> I'll get it done tonight.<eos> - Will someone let you in?
Eyes up, Jane.<eos> I know that look.<eos> And I know that look, too. It's piney Rafael.<eos> I haven't seen him in years. I'll see you soon.<eos> - Take care.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Mm, the lawyer I hired to represent Anezka.<eos> You're helping your sister?<eos> The same woman who paralyzed you and tried to steal your life?
What's on your mind?<eos> _ Think of something, quick, Jane!<eos> Lina.<eos> Okay, this is just ridiculous.<eos> Wiping your nose is never cute.<eos> Perhaps I spoke too soon.<eos> Oh, right on time.<eos> And I pushed back our dinner so we can make love first.<eos> Well, can we actually just... talk?<eos> And I love you and want to be with you, but I just don't want to make the same mistakes again.
Oh, I have to call Rafael, get the P.I. to head out now.<eos> Ah, screw Rafael.<eos> Let's not wait on him.<eos> Let's you and me drive to Pensacola, find this J.P. guy ourselves.<eos> But why?<eos> Rafael has a professional.<eos> Oh, Solano, don't make me spell it out for you.<eos> You never need help, woman.<eos> And now you do.<eos> And I want to be the guy that helps you.
_<eos> Ah, the joy of telenovelas.<eos> Can I hide out from Fabian with you guys for a minute?<eos> _<eos> Why won't they have a real wedding?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> _<eos> Sorry. I know I'm being selfish. I just want to celebrate.<eos> You do?<eos> We didn't think you'd want another big Rogeliwedding because it would remind you of Michael.
You can stay over if you want.<eos> I think I'm ready to head home, actually.<eos> So if you're still asking, can a non-casual dater start dating casually?<eos> The answer is...<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> I did it!<eos> I had casual sex with Fabian, and I didn't feel guilty about it.<eos> I know this is a really weird thing for me to call you about.
They had her tied to a toilet for two days?<eos> And they drugged this poor, little girl. How 'bout that?<eos> I'm gonna tell you something...<eos> These the same people who killed my boy.<eos> They are soulless animals.<eos> Was your boy beefing with someone?<eos> Good Lord.<eos> You got mayo on your face there, Chip.<eos> Least I hope that's mayo.<eos> Does the name "Titus" mean anything to you?
Titus.<eos> "Tit" with an "us" at the end.<eos> Does it mean anything?<eos> Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> Hey, I'll look into it.<eos> Well, you do that, and then you bring me these lowlifes, you hear me, 'cause I'm gonna castrate 'em.<eos> And then I'm gonna hang 'em up by their intestines.<eos> Then I'm gonna eat their stillbeating heart, 'cause they gonna pay.<eos> They gonna pay dearly for what they done.<eos> AAnd they kept you on a toilet?
I'm investigating Roller Husser's murder.<eos> I would love to ask you a few questions.<eos> That's fine, Detective.<eos> Come on, right in my office.<eos> Just Virginia.<eos> II, I don't...<eos> She's a little fragile right now, so I should probably be there.<eos> I'll be gentle.<eos> Saigon, Saigon.<eos> So, when you got out of wherever those Titus guys had you, what road were you on?
I'm trying to get out of this mess, not further in.<eos> Well, I'ma beg you.<eos> Please don't.<eos> - Please.<eos> - No.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> - No.<eos> It's only temporary anyway until they find the guys who got Roller.<eos> No. I'm not gonna do it.<eos> Who snuck you into New Edition concert?
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ooh, you have money, don't you?<eos> Girl, what made you say that?<eos> My uncle fought the Chinese, and one of his, you know, lady friends, taught him how to read palms.<eos> If George Washington hasn't winked at you yet, trust me, he will.
Why don't you hire a nurse?<eos> And risk him leaving her all his money?<eos> No.<eos> Sally... what on Earth is that?<eos> What is happening?<eos> It's my Kegel ball.<eos> Trying to keep my kitty tight.<eos> Wait, for Ed?<eos> Or my secret Cuban hottie that I roleplay with every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.<eos> So, how much did Otto leave you, anyway?
What about the family fortune from creating ketchup?<eos> Who was I about to open my guesthouse to?<eos> Me.<eos> I'm just a little girl from Saluda, North Carolina.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> My dad worked in a factory that makes car interiors, and my mother, she taught learningdisabled children.<eos> I may not be a blue blood from Hilton Head or whatever, but that doesn't mean I don't deserve a piece of the pie, right?<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> You and I are no different, Sally.<eos> No, I worked you for your friendship three years ago just like you worked that granddaddy of a husband you have inside.
You know I got on heels!<eos> When I saw you in that swamp, Mr. Emerson, I knew you were special.<eos> It's like the fates intervened and manifest my dreams.<eos> My very own English suitor dropped from the sky.<eos> Look at you now.<eos> Lady, my chest hurts.<eos> You're like a gift from heaven,<eos> Mr. Emerson, and I'm your guardian angel.<eos> We're going to be like those couples in Italian movies. Let me go, please.<eos> We're going to have little porcelain plates with tiny ham and cheese sandwiches that don't fill you up, but make you feel rich.
Go over there and tell me what they saying.<eos> For the last time, they're Korean, I'm Vietnamese.<eos> We are not the same, okay?<eos> Desna.<eos> Desna's stripper sidekick.<eos> Careful.<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that unfortunate plumbing incident at Glint.<eos> We know you were behind it.<eos> Paranoia is not a flattering shade on you.
Y'all are so nasty.<eos> Ann, stop it.<eos> The man said he wants to take me on a real date.<eos> Polly, give her a full Brazilian.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> All of it, off!<eos> Listen, there's gonna be a lot of romance tonight, but a classy guy like that?<eos> No nookie till the second date.<eos> A full bush will protect you from succumbing, like that thorn bush outside of Sleeping Beauty's castle.
I gotta go.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Gregory.<eos> Gregory, this is Quiet Ann and Polly, and they were just leaving.<eos> Wow, you are as scrumptious as a Georgia peach pie.<eos> Okay.<eos> Eat him up!<eos> Lick the filling!<eos> My friends are crazy.<eos> Listen, thank you for giving me a second chance.
I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> I got a job.<eos> Baby, you know you need a break from all that Uncle Daddy shit.<eos> I know I do.<eos> And you do, too.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> He's got some heavy hitters coming down to check out the pill operation.<eos> Why don't we go out this weekend, huh?<eos> Seriously, I'll take you to that place you like, and...
The event manager at the, uh, Palmetto Surf Hall is not a dependable man!<eos> Uh, that's a... that's a shame.<eos> Had my anniversary party there tonight, and renew with my sweet angel Juanda, he has a little fire and cancels the whole shebang!<eos> Happy anniversary.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Did I tell you boys to cessate that activity?<eos> I believe I did!<eos> I need this shit like a frog needs titties.<eos> I know some people who do events.<eos> If, uh... if I help you out with the party, c-can we maybe talk later?
Get off me!<eos> Please, let me explain.<eos> You were my best friend, and you destroyed my family to save yourself.<eos> I only wanted the Coombses arrested.<eos> Yeah, well, Roller's dead, and Bryce is a murderer.<eos> He is gonna be haunted by killing those people for the rest of his life, and what about my girls?<eos> You're the only one who hasn't paid a price for what you did!<eos> If you tell Uncle Daddy or Bryce any of this, Jenn, they will kill her on the spot!<eos> Well, maybe I will, or maybe I'll do it myself!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Solo.<eos> This is bullshit!<eos> Got a crackhead here that thinks - he's more reliable than me.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Don't I always get shit done for Uncle Daddy?<eos> Apparently not.<eos> Roller, it's okay.<eos> Listen, boy, you ain't got the stomach for this shit.<eos> You have no idea what I have the stomach for.<eos> I took out those dealers who shot you. - The Coombses...
Taking the Russians out ain't it.<eos> It's for the best.<eos> Last thing we need is the DEA sniffing around with us moving all that high volume.<eos> There he is!<eos> Hey, Brycey, I don't know if you heard.<eos> We got to get our hands dirty in our business.<eos> I didn't get my hands dirty?<eos> You shot the wrong people, genius.<eos> What good are some dead Realtors?<eos> I'll kill you for real!
She knows that me and my brother don't speak.<eos> She knows about the shit with my parents.<eos> She doesn't care that I was in prison.<eos> And what I told her what I had to do to survive in there, she didn't judge me.<eos> We even talk about having a kid.<eos> Desna has done more for us than our own family.<eos> I know, I know, I know.<eos> Whose couch did you sleep on when you couldn't pay rent?<eos> Who gave you a job when no one would hire a felon?<eos> And most importantly, who nursed you back to health when that crazy bitch stabbed you?
Roller, please.<eos> Okay, you... we...<eos> We don't have to go. W-We can...<eos> We can leave together, baby.<eos> We can... We can start our own hustle.<eos> Laundromats, car washes...<eos> You could be the king again.<eos> Please.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> How 'bout I cut you, hit you upside your head?
Okay, you... we...<eos> We don't have to go. W-We can...<eos> We can leave together, baby.<eos> We can... We can start our own hustle.<eos> Laundromats, car washes...<eos> You could be the king again.<eos> Please.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> How 'bout I cut you, hit you upside your head?<eos> Shoot you, choke your ass, burn you alive... unsuccessfully.
But I'm back.<eos> And better.<eos> I'm just ready to jump right back on that horse.<eos> Then why'd you buy a bike?<eos> Oh, Amy?<eos> Jason.<eos> And you must be Benny.<eos> Amy's the head of forensic psychiatry.<eos> Ah, tough job. Given our country's current mental state, I will never be out of work.<eos> How's the private sector treating you?
I'll give you a call when we're representing a biker gang.<eos> Troy and his dad have been coming here since he was a kid.<eos> I have no idea what got into him.<eos> Those cameras... did they record the murder?<eos> Yeah, but they all show the same thing.<eos> Troy killed his father with a four iron.<eos> Is anyone disputing that?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Would you mind sharing a copy of all the footage?<eos> Uh, sorry, man. I don't know you, so, not without a warrant.
Ah, I've been watching the box office numbers on Angels.<eos> Looks like your boy genius has done it again.<eos> It's a Brady-American Picture, Louis, and it has allowed me this.<eos> Your loan.<eos> $2 million, paid in full, plus interest.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Let's just say I don't like being in debt.<eos> To me.<eos> I know what Angels made, Pat, and I know what your operating costs are.<eos> A check this big leaves you with nothing in the bank.
And as of this morning, 72% of the American public is ready to grab their pitchforks and drive you out of this house.<eos> Polls only exist so that the media has something to talk about.<eos> They're not real.<eos> You're quoting me to me?<eos> Yes, and you were right when you said it, just like I'm right now.<eos> You need to get your team out there and figure out what to do next.<eos> What team?<eos> I-I mean...<eos> I've got two members, Ryan Booth and Shelby Wyatt, who are too radioactive to leave The Farm because they've been named in the press as potential lieutenants of yours.<eos> Raina Amin is still pretending to be her sister, who, I remind you, is being held at an undisclosed location they won't even tell you about.
You're a smart man.<eos> Why do you believe in him so much?<eos> He does many good things for the Hispanic people of America.<eos> And he does terrible things for everyone else.<eos> You agree with his Muslim registry and rounding up other immigrants?<eos> Or do you not care because you're not in danger yourself?<eos> I have a green card.<eos> Which can be taken away.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You're privileged. You've probably never been in a room where your family's reputation didn't precede you.
Why are you worried about him?<eos> Well, because everything he cares about is a mess right now.<eos> His mother's career is in jeopardy, the country is at risk, and he thinks that I slept with Caleb.<eos> Well, that last one was not quite on par with the other two.<eos> To him it might be.<eos> Clay doesn't open up to a lot of people, and I just slammed the door on him when he needs me most.<eos> Well, you can help him and 300 million other people by doing what's right for the mission.<eos> What's right for Clay, it's up to him.<eos> You know, when I talk to Alex, she's a lot less judgmental.<eos> Yeah, she doesn't judge you 'cause you might turn around and tell her the truth.
- Is that Ryan? - Here.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'm probably going to jail anyway.<eos> No, just hold on!<eos> Why is he with you?<eos> You can't do anything now.<eos> We can't let them kill more people.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> More than that, we have to.<eos> Whatever they brought you into the FBI to do needs to happen.
What you made her do goes against everything - that I know about her!<eos> - Okay, you may disagree with my decisions, but they were my decisions, Ryan!<eos> No one made me do them!<eos> Maybe you don't know her very well.<eos> She made the right call.<eos> And you... can you stop talking about me as if I'm not here?<eos> Well, I don't know that you are here.<eos> The Alex that I know would have pulled the fire alarm.<eos> She would have saved people!<eos> I did everything I could to make sure everyone in that building was safe, and I saved you.
He wouldn't do that to me.<eos> If you heard anything concrete, you'd tell me, right?<eos> You have to ask? Yeah.<eos> Ah, it's hell, having family.<eos> You know who we should hire?<eos> Norman Krasna.<eos> Oh, heck of a writer. But I thought you hated his work.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> He's brilliant.<eos> What turned you around?
Just a bit of Vienna.<eos> Pity about Irving.<eos> So young.<eos> Were you close?<eos> I wish we'd been closer.<eos> My, but you are a clever one.<eos> You've been in town three days, and you're already living with an international movie star, Fritz.<eos> You must be pretty clever yours...<eos> Your wife stayed in Germany, didn't she?<eos> Traded you for a Nazi pin and married the party.
Fritz.<eos> He's such a perfect director for this.<eos> Monroe was so right about him.<eos> Yeah, Monroe doesn't know everything.<eos> Well, what's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means Fritz is a noted pervert. Did he...<eos> He didn't lay a finger on me.<eos> And where am I gonna learn things if not out in the world?<eos> In here? I don't know.<eos> I don't think we did so badly by you, darling.
Goddamn matinees.<eos> Call me with an update later. Yeah.<eos> Merry Christmas to you, too.<eos> Nobody's coming out.<eos> Not even the hayseeds.<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> We spent a fortune marketing this thing.<eos> Can I get you anything, Mr. Brady?<eos> Ads in all the major newspapers.<eos> Billboards, posters, you can't even take a piss without Leslie Reeves grinning back at you.
Yes?<eos> I'll connect you now.<eos> All right.<eos> Milton?<eos> Hi, Ma.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> No, no, I just wanted to say hello and, uh, Merry Christmas.<eos> Merry...?<eos> It's 1:00 in the morning here. I know, I know, I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I realized I hadn't asked you about your hip in a while.
Ah, work's fine.<eos> How's everything else?<eos> Are you seeing anyone?<eos> I am, actually.<eos> A very nice girl.<eos> Before you ask... before you ask what you're about to ask, no, she isn't, but she can cook.<eos> Hmm, wonderful.<eos> I hope you enjoy a lifetime of ham sandwiches with mayonnaise.<eos> I think you'd like her.<eos> What does she call you?
I think you'd like her.<eos> What does she call you?<eos> What, Ma?<eos> This...<eos> this girl, does she call you Milton?<eos> Or that other name?<eos> She calls me Monroe like everyone else out here.<eos> Then I'm not so sure I'd like her.<eos> Darling, it's late.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry to wake you.
They're right down the hall.<eos> I don't like chasing you, it's demeaning.<eos> And we're partners, right?<eos> Things have gotten... complicated.<eos> Complicated?<eos> How?<eos> Monroe.<eos> Then they're not complicated at all.<eos> We fell in love.<eos> Monroe doesn't love you, he doesn't even know you.
Things have gotten... complicated.<eos> Complicated?<eos> How?<eos> Monroe.<eos> Then they're not complicated at all.<eos> We fell in love.<eos> Monroe doesn't love you, he doesn't even know you.<eos> He's in love with a character you're playing, the reminder of his dead wife.<eos> That's why this worked, you're a good actress.<eos> If he loved you, you wouldn't be here on Christmas doing circus tricks for a pig like Lang.
Look what Daddy brought.<eos> Lark's favorite.<eos> Strawberries.<eos> No.<eos> Mommy. What do you want her for?<eos> She's not that great.<eos> Hey, there you are. Will you tell your daughter you're not that great?<eos> Are you wearing my perfume?<eos> It was next to my cologne, and I accidentally grabbed it and spilled some on myself.<eos> Uh-huh. Did my necklace spill on you, too?
A triangle sitting on top of a sphere?<eos> I mean, that broke all the rules.<eos> Well, that's kind of his thing.<eos> That and having a bunch of kids with a bunch of women.<eos> And dodging his taxes living at sea.<eos> Got a lot of things.<eos> Well, that's another one of his things.<eos> - Oh, Daddy!<eos> Ah! There's my favorite!<eos> Well, I'm the only one that still talks to you.
It says Prince died and all I got was this lousy hat.<eos> It's not really you.<eos> What about now?<eos> Take the hat off, Jill.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Now that this thing is starting to get real, I'm totally freaking out.<eos> I don't even know what she should call me.<eos> I mean, I'm not her mom, "Jill" sounds too familiar, and "Mama Jill" sounds like I run a whorehouse.<eos> You were a foster kid.<eos> What'd you call the people who took you in?
I want you to stay very much.<eos> I'm just so bad at this.<eos> I think you're doing okay.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you hear what she said?<eos> She thinks I'm doing okay.<eos> I have never once heard that from my daughter.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> Hey, Violet, it's your mother.<eos> Just checking in, haven't heard from you in awhile.
Don't worry.<eos> Let me show you what we got on that fentanyl bust.<eos> Got to be around here somewhere.<eos> Yeah, nothing ever changes.<eos> Sloppy ten years ago, sloppy today.<eos> How do you work like this?<eos> I do have a system.<eos> But you're wrong.<eos> I haven't changed, but you have.<eos> When I first met you, you were a punk kid who thought he knew everything.
Cooper's body, the gloves-- like it's tied up in a bow for us.<eos> Well, that's just Richard being sloppy.<eos> There's more.<eos> Come on.<eos> Patton ran financials on Kelly and Cooper.<eos> Both of them had an infusion of cash recently, but Marino... flat broke.<eos> That's just him being careful.<eos> Is he sloppy or is he careful?<eos> Think about it.<eos> That's the man who taught you how to be a cop.
They were buying back drugs that were confiscated here and redistributing them in new territories.<eos> Yeah, we essentially uncovered a drug recycling operation.<eos> Well, it takes cash, planning.<eos> None of our suspects fit the bill.<eos> There must be a bigger player involved.<eos> Mitchell has no idea who's in charge, but we did look into his bank account information.<eos> Yeah, a company has been wiring him payments.<eos> Uh, some offshore corporation called Audubon Industries.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> That name mean something to you, King?
We got to find Spencer now.<eos> And they're off. Yeah.<eos> We do all the work, they have all the fun.<eos> Kind of makes you want to tag along for the takedown.<eos> Nah, we'd just get in the way.<eos> Give Pride one more thing to worry about.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You locked up in Orleans Parish is no good.<eos> Too many people know you here.<eos> Got permission to transfer you to St. Charles till this gets figured out.
I was at the hospital seeing Roger. Yeah?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He'll be good, eventually.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Pride and I was just wrapping up the case.<eos> Listen, I...<eos> If you're gonna apologize, don't.<eos> You got nothing to be sorry for.<eos> You did your job, and you saved my life.<eos> Still, what I put you through... No, Chris.
We just need to tie Hamilton to Audubon, and I got a couple ideas how.<eos> What do you say we hash 'em out over breakfast?<eos> And then what?<eos> You rush off into the night again, while I wait here?<eos> Well, you're safe here, Rita.<eos> I'm a prosecutor, Dwayne.<eos> I lead the charge.<eos> I don't stay back and keep the home fires burning.<eos> Well, Hamilton's different than any case you've ever had.<eos> And I'm not gonna let anything else happen to you.
- Yeah.<eos> _<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Yeah, I get it, Marmaduke's a big boy.<eos> No.<eos> No. That-That virtual health care company I wanted to invest in years ago just went public.<eos> If you would have let me invest that money my parents gave us, we would be rich, and not in the stupid way that you're supposed to say with, like, friends and health, but in the good way, with money.<eos> Virtual health care?<eos> I never told you that you couldn't invest in that.
Okay, I guess we're just having this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Life-changing.<eos> Barrett is an incredible chef.<eos> She is self taught, makes everything from scratch, even wove these place mats.<eos> I can't wait to see what you've done with the Heritage Turkey that I sent.<eos> I love me some turkey, and stuffing, potatoes.<eos> Let a gravy tsunami wash over me.<eos> Brooke, I donated that turkey to the soup kitchen.<eos> As I told you, we are having a traditional Thanksgiving meal.
I can't talk now.<eos> My car just arrived.<eos> I'll call you when I get there.<eos> Liz: You heard me.<eos> Selma Orchard.<eos> Kaplan sent Krilov to Orchard?<eos> I don't like the connection. To me?<eos> Now you do think this is about my memory?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Not long ago, the idea that Kate would hurt you as a way to get to me was unthinkable.
Were you able to get the list of bodies Julian Gale ID'd?<eos> Yeah. Mr. Cooper did. Um...<eos> What is Mr. Reddington gonna do with it?<eos> Agent Ressler. I think it's time that we had a heart-to-heart.<eos> Raymond, the list of victims.<eos> Hans.<eos> Kate.<eos> You made good time.<eos> I assume you know why I'm here.<eos> I told you the bodies I unearthed would destroy you, that each one would tell a story.
Since when does he have so much security?<eos> Since today.<eos> Nikolaus. How are you, my friend?<eos> Very well, Mr. Reddington. Thank you.<eos> If you don't mind, we need to wand you and your man.<eos> A change in protocol, I see.<eos> Orders of Mr. Von Hauser.<eos> Werner.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to hear me out.<eos> I promised to meet with you.
Since today.<eos> Nikolaus. How are you, my friend?<eos> Very well, Mr. Reddington. Thank you.<eos> If you don't mind, we need to wand you and your man.<eos> A change in protocol, I see.<eos> Orders of Mr. Von Hauser.<eos> Werner.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to hear me out.<eos> I promised to meet with you.<eos> I never said I would listen to you.
I promised to meet with you.<eos> I never said I would listen to you.<eos> Our relationship is built on a lie.<eos> A tragedy.<eos> The fact that you walked into this room confirms you know nothing about me.<eos> You severely underestimated my love for my son. Then and now.<eos> And for that you will pay with your life.<eos> I deserve to pay.<eos> But I can't.<eos> I never underestimated you, Werner.
She told me everything.<eos> Listen to your partner, Agent Ressler. You're ill.<eos> You need help.<eos> You're not ill.<eos> Your memory was manipulated by Dr. Bogdan Krilov.<eos> We have him in custody.<eos> No, I know what I saw, trust me.<eos> Liz:<eos> No, you need to trust me.<eos> The detective who reached out to you.
You're the victim here.<eos> He's the victim. I'm...<eos> Yes.<eos> And you're a murderer.<eos> And one day we're gonna prove it.<eos> Every part of this little drama, Kate, is playing out as grand tragedy.<eos> Family Feuds always do.<eos> Werner's dead.<eos> Oh, Raymond.<eos> You may have bitten the hand that feeds you this time, dearie.
What memories?<eos> Let us say you had uncovered certain truth about Raymond Reddington,<eos> and he couldn't have that.<eos> You're lying.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> And I think you know that.<eos> So, let's make a deal.<eos> Full immunity.<eos> I walk, in exchange for the memories I took from you.
Please, no!<eos> Please, no!<eos> Please, no!<eos> No.<eos> You found me.<eos> Did you ever doubt I would?<eos> Truthfully, the beanstalk that fell on me gave me pause.<eos> Snow, we're gonna be fine.<eos> Darkness never wins.<eos> It just fools you into thinking it does.
Wonderful.<eos> Time to go to work, Gideon.<eos> Hello, Mr. gold.<eos> I was just here to pick up my watch.<eos> No, you weren't... Mother.<eos> Of course.<eos> You know, I only separated you from belle for your own good.<eos> She's my wife.<eos> And a terrible one.<eos> She would convince you to go against your dark instincts.
I'm sorry, Emma.<eos> I was hoping you'd save us both.<eos> I failed you, belle.<eos> I failed our family.<eos> I made the right choice.<eos> It just didn't work out.<eos> Hey.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I love you, too!
You... you know, uhm...<eos> - Eve's pregnant?<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No warning.<eos> Just meet your blob of a sibling.<eos> There's literally no room for me there.<eos> My room's gonna be a nursery.<eos> I'll sort it.<eos> Call your dad, we'll get you back down to London.
What you on about?<eos> - I just want your feedback.<eos> The door's locked.<eos> Nana's got the key.<eos> Out the back.<eos> You know you have to stop.<eos> They're too young to be dealing with all this.<eos> All what?<eos> It's good job there isn't man in this house.<eos> You know, they wouldn't allow you through, the state that you're in.
"No, don't do that..." It's just, this school is not what I'd expected!<eos> And it's not fair!<eos> It's not fair on me, but no-one's thinking about that, are they?<eos> No!<eos> Well, life isn't fair.<eos> But in this house we don't feel sorry for ourselves!<eos> And I don't want the teacher phoning me again.<eos> I am not having that boy ruin this place before we've even got going.<eos> I know something's going on.<eos> I've seen the way he looks at you.
It's all right, love, we'll sort it out. We'll sort it out.<eos> - You don't want me here.<eos> - No, I do. I do!<eos> Course I do.<eos> Thought you weren't coming.<eos> Course I am, you're Missy Booth!<eos> I just thought we could hang out.<eos> Just hang out?<eos> Sure.<eos> I didn't call you for that.
Nasreen!<eos> Nasreen!<eos> Where are you bloody going?<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't bloody "what" me, I'll give you bloody thappar.<eos> And you.<eos> Go, chal.<eos> Well, you can't stop me.<eos> You wear dupatta and now I wear this.<eos> Who told you to wear this thing?
It were kind of my fault that.<eos> I think they overheard me before and...<eos> Yeah, and what were that about?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> I'm sorry, though.<eos> I suppose I just thought it were a bit of a laugh.<eos> - Cory!<eos> Stop, you slimy, seedy, lying...<eos> - What?<eos> After school is what I told you, I didn't think you were going to do it.
Miss Keane, a word please.<eos> Everything all right, Mr Qucreshi?<eos> Yeah, so everything all right with you?<eos> You know, after Boobgate.<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> I did have some cheek off Alya, but don't worry,<eos> I put her in isolation. Nawaz?<eos> Our sponsor's daughter?<eos> Am I meant to be giving her special treatment or something?<eos> After he backed you up after you flaunted yourself online and when this school is hanging by a thread, yes!
With all that head gear and doing this.<eos> I just thought it would make us feel more like myself.<eos> You're like yourself already.<eos> You can't be not like yourself.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Fine, don't talk to me.<eos> I get you hate me after the Cory thing.<eos> - It were...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sorry he kissed you and that.
I told her you'd meet her.<eos> I erased the call.<eos> I took your phone.<eos> I met her outside the Fluff 'n Fold.<eos> I told her you didn't owe her a dime of child support.<eos> Child support?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> She was pregnant?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But what she did to you...
I take it by your presence here that your sister's still alive.<eos> That's right.<eos> If I call for a scout, she'll be executed right now...<eos> But what fun would that be?<eos> You really think she can win, don't you?<eos> I wouldn't count her out if I were you.<eos> She's survived harder things than this.<eos> Before she dies, I'll tell her she's lucky to have you as a brother.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> After she guts you and before you die, you tell her I was the lucky one.
I want out.<eos> Whoever's gonna run this thing has to be able to think creatively, crack codes and stand up in the face of danger.<eos> Two of you are about to walk away with the world's most valuable classified documents.<eos> But first, someone in here is lying... about who they are.<eos> One of you is a cop.<eos> _<eos> Those things baffle me.<eos> The smarter they get, the dumber I feel.<eos> He's your father, isn't he?<eos> The captain who ordered you to work the overnight shift?
Jane and Weller just made contact.<eos> They're safe.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Did they get the documents?<eos> They're en route with the files as we speak.<eos> Sorry, I have to take this.<eos> Just let me know when they're in the building.<eos> - Yeah, you got it.<eos> - Josh, kind of a busy day.<eos> - Can I call you back?
Everything needs to be done right and we can't afford to make any more mistakes.<eos> What we can't afford is having you burn out.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Patterson, wait.<eos> I know this just isn't a case anymore.<eos> This is personal for all of us.<eos> We have to start looking after ourselves and each other.<eos> Otherwise, we don't stand a chance against them.<eos> So I booked an appointment for you tonight to see Dr. Sun, so, please, don't miss it.
My man.<eos> - There he is!<eos> - Hey.<eos> Denny, how are you?<eos> - You look good.<eos> - You too, brother.<eos> Little bit older.<eos> Yeah. Maybe a little more than a little.<eos> You're buttering me up.<eos> Look at me. Looking to borrow money, my layabout brother-in-law - beat you to it.
I tried to make a beef against him for knocking me around in the district. But that went nowhere.<eos> Big surprise?<eos> But Woods, yeah, he found me after. And he told me to my face that he'd settle the score.<eos> Is there anyone who can back that story up?<eos> No.<eos> Hell no.<eos> You bring somebody else in here.<eos> Look, I'll talk to them, but I ain't about to trust your lying ass.<eos> My friend took a bullet in the forehead over $122.<eos> You're lucky they didn't pull you out of the...
- How did it end?<eos> I told him it was Senior Spring and I wanted to be free.<eos> How'd he take that?<eos> Freaked out.<eos> What did you do when he started posting the photos?<eos> I begged him to stop, but he didn't.<eos> Then he started posting them again the other day, which is why I called him.<eos> Do you have any idea who might've killed Richie?<eos> No.<eos> You don't think it was anyone who was upset about what he did to you?
- Hey, boss...<eos> Hey.<eos> Someone's here to see you, Hank.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You might wanna get that door.<eos> I've got a theory.<eos> You wanna hear it?<eos> Sure.<eos> You fell in love with the tight-bodied school teacher 20 years younger than you.<eos> First woman you been with since Camille died. And she throws a hump into you.
I'm sorry it's been so long.<eos> A lot of Nick's friends sort of faded away<eos> - after he got killed.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I guess they didn't want to be reminded he's not here anymore or whatever.<eos> What do you need?<eos> I'm actually looking back into his case.<eos> Why?<eos> I think we may have put away the wrong guy.<eos> Listen, I remember catching the tail end of you talking to my partner when he told you that we caught the guy who did it.
Look, Eric, as far as we know, you were just defending Jo Jo's honor.<eos> I mean, you don't have a record.<eos> You probably didn't mean for anything to happen.<eos> I mean, we're thinking you went home, you dug up one of your dad's guns and you went to see Richie.<eos> And that's when things fell apart.<eos> Okay, so, now here's the problem.<eos> This is your dad's gun, right?<eos> All right, so see, him and your mom they're responsible for providing a weapon that was used in the commission of a crime.<eos> Just because it was in the house, where you could have access to it.<eos> Unless they drove you to see Richie and they put the gun in your hands and they said, "Go kill him."
No.<eos> Come on.<eos> The 50 grand we found at your girl's place matches serial numbers on missing cash from the banks.<eos> That's bad news for you.<eos> You're facing a murder for hire charge.<eos> And you're 17 years old.<eos> That's close enough for the state to charge you as an adult.<eos> But we don't need to go there.<eos> You can tell us what we already know.<eos> Lavar Spann hired you to kill Bobby and Darren Wilkes.
Yeah?<eos> What about Spann?<eos> Are you guys friends, too?<eos> 'Cause from where we're sitting, it sure as hell looks like he set your ass up.<eos> I want a public defender and a juvenile advocate.<eos> I'm not saying a word till I get them both.<eos> Why do you want to protect Spann?<eos> For money you're never gonna get to spend and a double murder charge you will not beat?<eos> Come on, Ray.<eos> We know he put you up to this.
She's alerting the State's Attorney as we speak so that she can witness the written statement signed.<eos> - Well played, brother.<eos> - Good job, man.<eos> - Good work.<eos> - How'd you get him to turn?<eos> I mean, he saw his best friends shotgunned.<eos> That hit him pretty hard. And, I told him we'll take care of him.<eos> We got Spann.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> You know why I brought you down here?
That's what you do, isn't it, Sergeant?<eos> You were banging co-eds in law school when I was in the Gang Unit, so I understand how this works.<eos> That kid snitches, he's dead.<eos> So, his testimony's not an option.<eos> Well, we killed one, one wouldn't talk, and you got the other two.<eos> That's a hell of a theory. But I only had two years left on my sentence when I was paroled.<eos> Even if I'm violated, and they make me do every day, it ain't gonna be nothing but a vacation for me.<eos> I'll be out in 18 months.<eos> Yeah, and I'm gonna have a unit sitting on you every second.<eos> They're gonna be waking you up and tucking you in, and when you... when you spend the first dollar of that bank's money... and you will... you'll see me again.
We ran Pettigrew for any criminal history.<eos> No record, never been arrested, but his name was run through. LEADS by an officer and a detective in Detroit three years ago.<eos> Here's a printout of the inquiries.<eos> We got the officers' names and gave them a call.<eos> The lead detective told us that Pettigrew was the person of interest in a kidnapping and murder of a tender age victim that was sexually assaulted.<eos> They brought Pettigrew in, but could never arrest him.<eos> They didn't have enough physical evidence.<eos> You're thinking this guy is a pedophile?<eos> Detective in Detroit thought he was good for it.<eos> Said it's one of those cases that'll haunt you your whole career.
What did happen in Detroit, Jeremy?<eos> I was coaching a youth hockey team, and there was this boy, Joshua, who had a lot of raw talent, but he was in foster care.<eos> It was a terrible situation.<eos> And so I took him under my wing.<eos> His death was a total shock to me.<eos> It was awful.<eos> I miss him to this day.<eos> It says in here that you were in foster care.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Did someone hurt you there, Jeremy?
Jay, he's gone, man.<eos> He's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Well, I spoke to the ME.<eos> He'd been dead at least two hours.<eos> Erin.<eos> Come here a second.<eos> They want to see you at the review board at 9:00 a.m.<eos> Remember what I told you when you were 16, and you first came to live at my house?
I mean, I figure you got the inside track with you two shacking up.<eos> So, why don't you tell me right now: What was he into?<eos> Who would've gone looking for him at your place and done this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He was good to me, Hank.<eos> I would tell you if I knew.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's get real specific about this morning.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Who saw you there?
You think I didn't want to find him?<eos> I don't know what you want, Mom.<eos> I never have.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll take my chances with the actual police.<eos> - I want a doctor.<eos> - You'll get one, Vince, the second you tell us how Johnny Martelli wound up getting killed.<eos> Doctor!<eos> Eighteen overdoses.<eos> Two kids ID'd you as the guy who sold them these pills.
I don't know what you want, Mom.<eos> I never have.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll take my chances with the actual police.<eos> - I want a doctor.<eos> - You'll get one, Vince, the second you tell us how Johnny Martelli wound up getting killed.<eos> Doctor!<eos> Eighteen overdoses.<eos> Two kids ID'd you as the guy who sold them these pills.<eos> Cell tower history puts you at the scene of the truck robbery.
They're charging me with a felony: Drug conspiracy.<eos> The FBI, Erin!<eos> Because they found you in a truck full of drugs.<eos> I... I had to move them.<eos> I messed up.<eos> - Messed up?<eos> - I tried to tell you.<eos> You did...<eos> You didn't tell me.<eos> And you didn't tell me that Martelli beats you.
I messed up.<eos> - Messed up?<eos> - I tried to tell you.<eos> You did...<eos> You didn't tell me.<eos> And you didn't tell me that Martelli beats you.<eos> Would you believe me?<eos> Would it have changed anything?<eos> You feared for your life.<eos> He forced you to hide his narcotics for him.
I don't deserve this.<eos> Yeah. You're right.<eos> You don't.<eos> How long you been here?<eos> Long enough.<eos> They want me in New York, like, yesterday.<eos> What I'm saying... I mean, you know about this.<eos> You know about everything, right?<eos> I knew I needed to do something.<eos> I mean, they told me in no uncertain terms they're coming after you.
You're here.<eos> Otis, keep the light on.<eos> Guys?<eos> Marvin, hey.<eos> Listen.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> We had to come in disguise.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here, take you someplace safe, okay?
I hear you, Jason.<eos> Listen.<eos> I have to ask you something.<eos> 50 feet, right?<eos> From the rig to where you were standing with the meter?<eos> I think.<eos> Give or take.<eos> Jason, that's impossible.<eos> As soon as we got on the scene, we were monitoring LEL levels.<eos> They were growing fast, but no way they could've gone from safe to saturated in the time it took you to run and grab that tool.
- And fries.<eos> - Bring it here!<eos> You really do love me, don't you?<eos> I do.<eos> And I love you.<eos> All right, all right. Enough of this schmlatzy crap.<eos> - Can I eat now?<eos> - Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> It's good, isn't it?<eos> They got you on something new?
I want these tanks topped off at 4500 PSI, test your regulators.<eos> Good morning, Lieutenant.<eos> I just wanted to say thanks for taking a chance on me.<eos> - I won't let you down.<eos> - Yeah, I hope not.<eos> I also wanted to extend my condolences.<eos> Your visor's filthy, Kannell.<eos> There's wipes on the dash.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Joe Cruz, Chief wants you in his office.
When were you gonna tell me about this conduct unbecoming charge?<eos> It's a total scam, Lieutenant.<eos> It's just this stupid incident that happened when I was on this bouncer gig.<eos> Mouch says I'm not gonna get suspended or anything. If something like that happens, you gotta come talk to me.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I should've, I...<eos> I just figured this is the last thing that you need to deal with right now.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jerry, Mouch again.<eos> Haven't heard back from you and it's a time-sensitive matter, so give me a call. Please.
This is a good measure.<eos> It would actually make a difference in people's lives.<eos> You don't have to convince me, Matt.<eos> It never occurred to me somebody would try to characterize it as self-dealing.<eos> Well, that's 'cause you're not as cynical as most politicians.<eos> Blakeslee is gonna warp public perception of this thing before it ever gets the vote.<eos> You know, a good friend of mine knows him.<eos> I'll bet she could get him to take a call from me.<eos> That is if you don't mind me sticking my nose in... No, no.<eos> I-I don't mind at all, but what makes you think he'll listen to you?
I don't even know if I'm gonna have a job waiting for me when I get back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> You gotta know Mouch did his best.<eos> Yeah, you're gonna feel a lot better if you just forgive him.<eos> Yeah. Right.<eos> Wish he had decided to storm out before I made him a fresh beer.<eos> First, they'll send you to the home office in Fort Wayne for a couple days training, get familiar with the product.
Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> You gotta know Mouch did his best.<eos> Yeah, you're gonna feel a lot better if you just forgive him.<eos> Yeah. Right.<eos> Wish he had decided to storm out before I made him a fresh beer.<eos> First, they'll send you to the home office in Fort Wayne for a couple days training, get familiar with the product.<eos> Then they'll pair you up with an experienced rep, and you'll start going on sales calls right away. - That quick?
He's had mitral valve regurge for, like, the last ten years.<eos> Man, faulty valves are tricky.<eos> Yeah, and I don't like what Jay's describing.<eos> I gotta get to the L station.<eos> Why doesn't your brother bring him in?<eos> Dad hates doctors.<eos> Did I mention he's stubborn?<eos> - Well, don't you have a car?<eos> - I sold it.<eos> Hey, look, man, waiting for the L train's just gonna slow you down. Why don't you take mine?
He has a couple sitters.<eos> The neighbor's kid, the woman upstairs.<eos> It's possible they're not as firm as they ought to be.<eos> I can't afford daycare.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm gonna send a nurse in to draw blood for one more test.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Gallagher, I need to get Elliot up to pre-op holding.<eos> The eye surgeon will be calling for him any minute.<eos> We'll be in the waiting room.<eos> I'm guessing your parents told you they wouldn't approve the chemical castration.
Okay.<eos> Hazelnut.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Hey, um,<eos> I know you're helping my brother with his case, and I really appreciate it, but could you maybe go a little easier on him?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - You know, just lay off the gas a little?<eos> Where's this coming from?<eos> Did Noah ask you to talk to me?
Offenders don't usually behave that way.<eos> Any other leads?<eos> Allison's comprehensive tox screen detected trace amounts of triazolam in her blood.<eos> That's a benzo, right?<eos> Yeah. A sedative hypnotic with amnestic properties.<eos> The stepdad's an accountant.<eos> I don't see him getting his hands on that.<eos> Unless maybe he was prescribed it.<eos> I mean, it is sometimes used for insomnia.<eos> Yeah, it definitely puts you out.
- What?<eos> Beyond.<eos> Would you be happy to see more of me?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Darius offered me a job.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He has this think tank where he brings together authors, artists, philosophers, and he said that I would make a great addition.<eos> I thought you'd be happy.<eos> Don't you find it strange that he would pluck you from obscurity, fly you here, offer you a job...
Now I need to make mine.<eos> Hey, thanks for coming.<eos> - Yeah, you still look...<eos> - Terrible, I know.<eos> Work's been, uh... it's been rough.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I really am. Uh...<eos> A job offer from Darius is an opportunity.<eos> If the job excites you, you should take it.
High treason?<eos> I'm not the one who's high here.<eos> Take him.<eos> No lawyer, no Miranda, no water.<eos> You really know how to make a guy feel welcome.<eos> Darius, we have ten hours to get the probe back online.<eos> This is no joke.<eos> If you have an alibi, now would be the time to speak up.<eos> I'm not a dog. I don't bark on command.<eos> Six foreign corporations have sued you for industrial espionage.
I know the uranium wasn't for the EmDrive.<eos> I never move a piece on the board unless it's for a good reason.<eos> I'm not a pawn you can sacrifice; this isn't a game.<eos> I didn't do this, Grace.<eos> What reason would I have?<eos> Only you can answer that.<eos> Counterintelligence confirmed the hack came from Tanz Industries.<eos> Now who's lying?<eos> Our analysts found a mimic signal and traced it back to a dish at Tanz.<eos> Now an interrogation expert is on his way from Langley, so I suggest you start talking, because right now, the only thing between you and waterboarding is me.
It's been... 15 years.<eos> Uh, this is, uh, Grace Barrows, a work, a work colleague.<eos> Grace, this is<eos> Theresa.<eos> Lazlo's sister.<eos> Oh, well, congratulations on all your success.<eos> It's pretty hard not to keep tabs on you.<eos> And-and you're married, two girls?<eos> Yeah, seven and two.<eos> Laz probably bored you with photos of them.
She's great at what she does, and I'm great at what I do.<eos> See, when you find the right person, you don't worry that their success takes away from you. You worry that you're not doing enough to help them be successful.<eos> - Why don't you screw the respect and speak your mind.<eos> Okay. I'm you in this narrative,<eos> - and she's...<eos> - Exceptional.<eos> Then why send me to The Farm?<eos> Why would you put me in there if you knew she was "exceptional"?<eos> Quotes aren't helping your case, son.<eos> You want to know why I sent you in there?
How is it you know what's best for me?<eos> Oh, it's because I'm smarter than you.<eos> I know more words than you.<eos> I have more emotions than you.<eos> I have them.<eos> I just don't let you know I have them.<eos> I'm having one right now.<eos> It's a complicated one.<eos> It's like 10 at once.<eos> She really left you?
Breathe.<eos> Let your mind rest.<eos> We won't see anything if you're all wound up.<eos> I'm not wound up.<eos> I'm just sober, finally.<eos> Yeah, well, you still need to take a moment.<eos> And if I'm being honest,<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry I made a pass at you.<eos> I'm sorry Maxine left you.
Go, quickly. We are on Cat's clock now.<eos> We only have 3 1/2 hours left.<eos> I know what the secret is.<eos> You do?<eos> Why else would you put me through all this? Ooh.<eos> Phrasing it in the form of a question.<eos> That way it doesn't count as a guess.<eos> Very smart, doctor.<eos> I'm gonna walk you through a scenario and your face is gonna tell me how close I am.<eos> From the moment I arrested you, you watched and waited for the right time to take your revenge.
All right.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> You, uh, call me anytime.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right. Thanks.<eos> I don't think King would've much liked the way you talked to her.<eos> Don't much like the way you talked to me.<eos> She acted like this was nothing more than an inconvenience.<eos> That didn't bother you?<eos> Oh, I forgot, nothing's bothering you.
Karen, Karen, come on, come on.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Don't blame me, Dwayne. Your agent brought this on herself.<eos> I'm just doing my job.<eos> Yeah, more like doing Hamilton's bidding.<eos> Didn't realize that you were in the mayor's pocket, too.<eos> You know that's not true.<eos> Do I?<eos> Bottom line: your agent screwed up, and Hamilton pounced.<eos> I warned you what would happen if he found out about the wire.
"Dear Don, between us,<eos> "you're my favorite Burns brother.<eos> Lisa."<eos> Why would she send me this if she doesn't want me at the meeting?<eos> Great question.<eos> Lowell?<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> It's because she appreciates you.
So, um, listen, about the other day... we weren't saying anything bad about Wes.<eos> I did a profile on him.<eos> A deep dive. I checked everything.<eos> - Because of what Allie said?<eos> - He's not the type that gives gifts.<eos> Well, maybe you... you changed him.<eos> Maybe?<eos> Danny James, are you becoming a romantic?<eos> No.<eos> I just know that any guy with half a brain would not cheat on you.
On the ground!<eos> On your knees.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, The Jules Show deserved a satisfying ending.<eos> You hungry?<eos> I am.<eos> On your feet.<eos> Check me out.<eos> Well, Jules, there is an upside.<eos> Now you know Lauren loved you back.
- I learned from the best...<eos> - Thank you. - Lorelai from "Gilmore Girls."<eos> - Okay. - I guess being a daddy just comes naturally to me.<eos> Die!<eos> - Hitchcock, no!<eos> - Die!<eos> - How's it going?<eos> Ah, I noticed your pupils have stopped pulsating.<eos> - Yeah, because I found the perfect antidote to your little prank.<eos> Sure, caffeine speeds you up, but half-and-half slows you down.
What are you doing?<eos> I said stop hurting me.<eos> What? I thought you were in character.<eos> No, no, I don't have health insurance.<eos> - This could bankrupt me.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just very confused.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get us the money by Friday or I'll break more than your ribs.<eos> Jake.<eos> How many times have I smacked you - in your face?
Don't lose.<eos> Thought that was gonna be longer.<eos> - I loved it.<eos> - It was perfect.<eos> Hey, Boyle.<eos> How you doing there, bud?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm great.<eos> Well, I hear your mouth say that, but the rest of your head is telling a different story.<eos> Feels like the stress of the upcoming trial is starting to get to you.
How?<eos> Among my many, many, many skills, I'm fluent in face.<eos> I can tell you what the jury's thinking at any given moment.<eos> I see an eyebrow twitch, I'm like, "Oh."<eos> If their cheek has a certain tension, okay, that leads me a different way.<eos> Watch this.<eos> Scully, you're wondering if anyone can smell your fart.<eos> The answer, my brother, is yes.<eos> She's a witch.<eos> What'd I tell you, boy?
Well... but, hey, that's what the bee said.<eos> Boom.<eos> Melissa, would you mind wandering around like a zombie somewhere else, please?<eos> Yeah, Jasper and I are having the... talk.<eos> Hey, don't be scared, she's not a zombie.<eos> You probably don't even know what a zombie is.<eos> Well... you know when someone dies?<eos> Well, a zombie is a corpse that comes back to life.<eos> And they're terrifying.<eos> I mean, they have an insatiable appetite for human flesh, and they just keep coming after you and after you, till they get you.
I know you're in a tough position, but this has got to be done.<eos> His parents are so proud.<eos> How's he gonna feel if I tell him that I don't want him to deliver the baby?<eos> Just blame it all on me;<eos> tell him I forbid it and that I'm being a massive "B" about it.<eos> No.<eos> He's my husband and I'm his wife.<eos> This has to come from me.<eos> So, this just in.<eos> Gail forbids you from delivering our baby, and she's being a massive "B" about it.
You're not good at most things.<eos> Name one.<eos> Math, jokes, basic hygiene, ideas, knowing what others think about you.<eos> You named five... fail.<eos> Name's Gail.<eos> You can have your "F" back.<eos> Sometimes I get my "F"s and my "G"s mixed up.<eos> So why don't you fo guck yourselg.<eos> No matter how much Carol protests, you are not delivering this baby.<eos> You've never seen me in an operating room, but I've seen you in one, and it did not go well.
You got a job to do.<eos> I'm only here to blend into the background and make sure everything goes exactly right.<eos> Hey, I don't want thanks any more than the common angel from heaven.<eos> So what are all these things?<eos> All the little curveballs, you know.<eos> Cord stuff, hemorrhaging, God forbid C-section, that kind of stuff.<eos> Whoa, looks like there's a lot of pages.<eos> Don't worry. Most likely we won't even need those.<eos> Since we have a few hours till showtime, you know, anybody want any snacks or drinks?<eos> Todd, what can I get for you?
And it's recordings of people laughing.<eos> This track is called. "Girls Night Out."<eos> But my favorite is "Church Giggles."<eos> So, did it happen?<eos> Not yet.<eos> It's taking too long. Something's wrong.<eos> Everything's fine, Carol.<eos> Look, I was just trying to see if Jasper could hang out with you. I wanted to try to keep him away from the...<eos> You can hear it up here, too.<eos> Did that sound normal to you?
Bleeding couldn't be stopped.<eos> But what went wrong was that we made you think that you two had to stop it alone.<eos> And I'm not gonna let that happen again.<eos> Now show me what the book says.<eos> Okay, so all you have to do is coat the sleeping bag in vegetable oil, and then use it like a magic carpet down the slide.<eos> Like this?<eos> Let me help you out.<eos> See, in the oil-sliding game, you never skimp on the glug-glug.<eos> Now, isn't this more fun than hanging out at home with all that yelling and screaming?<eos> They just didn't want you around.
Just coax and cajole.<eos> Coax and cajole.<eos> Coax and cajole.<eos> I got this.<eos> Hey, little stinker.<eos> I got a present for you out here, but it's only for born people.<eos> It's kind of a Born Ultimatum.<eos> That's kind of fun.<eos> Is it gonna bug you guys if I do some off-kilter commentary?<eos> You just do you, Carol.
Sorry, Lois, can't leave the eggs till Quagmire gets back.<eos> We're having sloppy joes.<eos> Well, I guess I haven't seen that mongoose in a while.<eos> We're having sloppy joes.<eos> Yeah, I heard.<eos> Please say you got the onion bun...<eos> We're having sloppy joes.<eos> Mongoose!<eos> Mongeese!<eos> Hey, just a heads-up, my dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire, is gonna say a lot of stuff to you, and it's all gonna be disgusting.
No, fight louder!<eos> Call her a bitch!<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> Why did you come here today?<eos> 'Cause that call last night gave me a scare.<eos> I figured if I do have a kid out there, I want to make sure they're not giving out my information.<eos> They're not supposed to;<eos> I signed a form.<eos> Hold on, Peter.<eos> I'm sorry I tricked you, but if you do have a child out there, isn't it only fair to let him or her meet you?
You're in such great shape.<eos> Well, I do have tiny blue weights in my garage.<eos> Oh, hi, Larry.<eos> Hi, Lois.<eos> Is Peter here?<eos> Larry, it's only 2:00 in the afternoon.<eos> Peter's still sleeping off last night's party.<eos> Then why... why are you still in your pajamas and bathrobe?<eos> Oh, that's because I'm depressed.<eos> Is that why that sad Shel Silverstein blob is following you around?
I thought you and him were girlfriend and boyfriend.<eos> He was not my boyfriend, Peter.<eos> And I wasn't about to stand by and watch him kick your ass.<eos> I was holding my own there.<eos> You were getting beat up.<eos> No, no, I meant I was holding my own nuts so he wouldn't kick them.<eos> But if he's not your boyfriend, why'd you kiss him?<eos> He kissed me.<eos> And I should've told you.<eos> I'm sorry if I hurt you, Peter.
"Afraid"?<eos> I love doing that.<eos> It's like bubble wrap you get to have sex with every now and then.<eos> I got a pretty good one going right now, Peter.<eos> You always do, Lois.<eos> I love you.<eos> Fromthatdayforward,Peter and Lois never again...<eos> Ooh, nope, sorry, there's still another scene left.<eos> Well, Peter, turns out your initial instinct was right.<eos> You never should've let any of your children contact you.
I'm not sure what the wireless situation is like, but if you can call me with any updates... and I'm not talking every minute.<eos> Maybe... maybe every five minutes you could...?<eos> Okay, how 'bout if I just phone you, uh... if his situation changes.<eos> Okay, that works.<eos> That works, too.<eos> And, also, I talked the nurses into letting you use their on-call nap room.<eos> That way, you don't have to leave here.<eos> So... So when he gets up...<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Honestly, Rosie, if you want to do right by Slade, just take care of the kidney he gave you.
So... So when he gets up...<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Honestly, Rosie, if you want to do right by Slade, just take care of the kidney he gave you.<eos> Okay, I'll keep you in the know.<eos> I promise.<eos> Promise?<eos> Promise.<eos> - All right?<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> - Appreciate you, man.
- Autopsies?<eos> Forensic accounting.<eos> You know, even messy divorces have their silver linings.<eos> What do the numbers tell you?<eos> That Jeff Groves was telling the truth. Marshwood was in trouble, but Orson wasn't stealing funds from the town. He was depositing his own money into the city treasury to try and save it.<eos> So if Orson wasn't embezzling the money, then who was?<eos> The same person who wanted Sandy dead.<eos> You were right. Orson wasn't the one stealing from the town.<eos> And we think you know who did.<eos> And we also think that they tried to poison you to protect their secret.
You're the one that's throwing down the death stare.<eos> Because it's her fault!<eos> Before he saw you two weeks ago, Orson and I had a plan.<eos> I was gonna leave Earl. We were gonna be together. I...finally got what I wanted.<eos> Orson.<eos> And I wasn't gonna let you take him from me.<eos> We had lunch.<eos> N-Nothing happened.<eos> I'll tell you why... because even if nothing happened at that lunch, seeing you made him think he and I weren't meant to be together.<eos> All right, last time I checked, Sandy, your boyfriend breaking up with you isn't an excuse to kill him.
And anytime I try to say something, it just makes it worse.<eos> I'm afraid one day, I'll come home, and he'll be...<eos> Have you told him that last part?<eos> I can't.<eos> Because... I'm afraid if I do, he'll just... run away again.<eos> Listen, Marcos has to get his head on straight. And you can't do that for him.<eos> But what you should know is, it's not your fault.<eos> I know.<eos> So... when are you gonna realize that whatever happens to Slade isn't yours?<eos> Hey, hey. Remember what I told you.
You've seen me for years before the wedding.<eos> Come on, it's tradition!<eos> I-I'm taking a shower.<eos> You're the one marrying him.<eos> So, we all know that wedding traditions are stupid, but Toby won't shut up about them, so, the dudes of honor have covered the "four somethings."<eos> Your dress is the something new;<eos> The violets waiting at the venue in San Jose are the something blue...<eos> And I covered the something old.<eos> You sure do.<eos> I meant the brooch that I gave you.
We just need to push it by... two hours.<eos> But,ma'am...<eos> Look, you are not a cheap venue, and we are paying you a lot of money, so just entertain the guests until we get there.<eos> Hold on, this might be the Justice of the Peace on the other line?<eos> Hello? Hi, Miss Dineen. It's Vance from Health Wellness.<eos> Noticed you're not in the office today and was checking to see if you're under the weather and if we could get you anything.<eos> No, I'm fine. It's just a personal day.<eos> Very well. Would you like lunch delivered?<eos> Raul made a lov...<eos> I'm so sorry. Elia provides you with a personal chef?
I need you to tell Paige something.<eos> Tell her I'm sorry.<eos> That I was wrong.<eos> You listen to me, son.<eos> One... you're gonna get out of here!<eos> And two... If you've got something you need to tell Paige, you need to man up and tell her yourself!<eos> Happy, where are we on a solution?<eos> I think we've got something.<eos> The chief's firehouse covers the airport, which means it carries a tank of high-expansion concentrate for jet-fuel fires.<eos> We're going to remove the nozzle from the hose. Cabe slides it in through the cracks in the rocks. You need to tie a knot at the bottom of the hose and put it underneath the rocks that are pinning you down.
Sly and Walter are working on the rescue radio as we speak.<eos> This radio is never gonna work.<eos> What do you care?<eos> I thought you accepted we're all gonna die.<eos> That was before you found the radio.<eos> Our survival percentage jumped a few points.<eos> I'm cautiously optimistic, but not if we can't get this transistor box humming again.<eos> We can, we just need a capacitor.<eos> Oh, great, I'll just run to the store and grab you one.<eos> No need-- just pass me one of those pieces of gum that Paige is always sharing with you.
Easy-peasy.<eos> The point is, Mr. Mitchell is, regrettably, one small piece of a very large, very complicated web.<eos> I understand that, but do you know if there's any truth to the rumor that Sudan is looking to make a deal for him?<eos> You don't have the clearance to know what I know.<eos> But thanks for stopping by.<eos> What about him?<eos> Do I have the clearance to know what you know, Pete?<eos> You seventh-floor types.<eos> Every few years, Bono reminds you the Sudan exists and you're in my ear.<eos> Did the Sudanese government reach out to you about Colin Mitchell?
Hey, is what I think is going on with you going on with you?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Really.<eos> Well, if it is, congratulations.<eos> They devour your life.<eos> I mean, they're the best.<eos> I better go.<eos> So, how long are you gonna be in Buenos Aires?<eos> Six weeks.<eos> That's why I texted you back so fast.
How's that music program for inner city kids going?<eos> Damn it. - No, that was good.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> You got good aim.<eos> I'm not done getting where I'm going.<eos> It's a journey.<eos> Isn't that what you used to say?<eos> That-that sounds really trite.<eos> I just want you to be happy.<eos> And I want people to really know you.
- Am I gonna get a spanking<eos> - Just listen. 'cause you know I...<eos> I don't know if you realize this, but... whenever you're between projects, you tend to get a little insecure.<eos> - Oh. - A little clingy.<eos> I know and I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop.<eos> I love when you're affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place.<eos> Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?<eos> I signed us up for ballroom dance class.<eos> Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?
She's right here.<eos> Sh-she's what?<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> So nice to meet you.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Hello.<eos> A little late, Leonard.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?
Are you crazy?<eos> But his mom told him about the freezer.<eos> Yeah, and he got a bag of peas.<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> But now that we're sober, aren't we supposed to be rigorously honest?<eos> Not when it comes to money.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> Got a trial coming up.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What'd they get you for?
"And then I spent... the rest of my life thinking<eos> "I must've done something wrong, or you would have wanted me.<eos> "Do you know what that does to a person?<eos> "I drank... because of you.<eos> "I almost lost my child because of you.<eos> "I went to jail because of you.<eos> Because of you, because of you, because of you."<eos> I can't keep doing this.<eos> You have been the great excuse of my life.<eos> I blamed you for everything.
- I will.<eos> All right, so I'm gonna ask the question that's on everyone's mind, how bad was your date last night?<eos> It was actually really good.<eos> - So, did you guys... ?<eos> - No, he was a gentleman.<eos> Eh, well, I just tuned out.<eos> It was weird...<eos> He asked me all these questions and listened to the answers and then remembered them and mentioned them later.<eos> Gay alert.<eos> - So where'd he take you?
I lost my virginity at a funeral.<eos> It was great.<eos> Hey, this is the part where you guys tell me I'm being insane and have nothing to worry about.<eos> Bonnie, you're being insane, and there's nothing to worry about.<eos> Don't just repeat it back to me.<eos> Okay, how's this?<eos> Adam and Danielle may be sharing an emotional experience.<eos> Near a big, shiny, black coffin.<eos> But he asked you to take care of his furry, flatulent, 16-year-old dog who has a taste for underwear.<eos> - It does show that he loves you.
And if someone hadn't helped me, I would've lost them.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Talking about Marjorie, Mom.<eos> Fine, help Natasha.<eos> And when they take Emily away from me and that woman puts her through hell and she gets stuck in another foster home, you can feel real proud of yourself.<eos> You were in rehab over and over, and we never gave up on you 'cause we don't throw people away!<eos> For the record, I'm not storming out.<eos> I'm just leaving 'cause she's my ride.<eos> Okay, so here's where you write down everyone you resent in your life.<eos> And then, you write everything they did to you.
- It's time to call Ray.<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I want to meet your big shot half-black half-brother.<eos> Calm down, he's gay.<eos> You sure he's not half gay?<eos> He's half everything else.<eos> We're trying to keep my mom out of jail.<eos> You can try and flip him later.<eos> I told you I'm not calling him.
Of course I did.<eos> Name one character.<eos> Bill Flar... gus.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - (scoffs) Bill Flargus, Esquire?<eos> Okay, fine, I didn't read the book. - Oh!<eos> - Greg!<eos> Greg, come on, man!<eos> You are the only reason that we did this.<eos> Yeah, I mean she dedicated the book to you and there are, like, six characters in there named Greg.
Bald and chubby, just like me.<eos> Here, you want to know what?<eos> - Just a, just a small, little thank you.<eos> - Aah. For your patience with our little angel.<eos> Thank you, that's very kind.<eos> Cookies.<eos> I love cookies.<eos> What?<eos> Will you stop worrying so much about what people think about you?<eos> I mean, the world hating you is what having a kid is all about.
- Greg.<eos> - Making it right!<eos> Seems my husband is riddled with both Jewish and Catholic guilt, even though his family is neither.<eos> Man, this sucks.<eos> I could be in Cabo making love to some bomb-ass carnitas right now.<eos> Well, look, I'm gonna be quick okay?<eos> I'm just gonna give him these chocolates, then I'm gonna do a very respectful, traditional Japanese bow that I saw in a kung fu film, okay?<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Hey, Lark.<eos> Remember what I told you about old people.
I am so proud of all of us.<eos> We came together to save Ralph and-and Scotty, and to make this signal with virtually no time.<eos> And that is what Scorpion is all about.<eos> So, no matter how long we have to stay here, as long as we are family, we are gonna be okay.<eos> The plane's coming back!<eos> Thank God, I couldn't stand another minute in this hellhole.<eos> Hey!<eos> He tipped his wing at us, he saw us!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Let this be a lesson to you, dear reader.
Shell casings, blood.<eos> Who got shot? Hamilton.<eos> Whoa.<eos> I mean, at least, according to NOPD crime scene techs, but I, I can't believe that Pride did it.<eos> We couldn't believe he threw that guy off the roof, either.<eos> Hey, we don't know that he did that.<eos> You were just with me at autopsy, Percy.<eos> Doc Wade said that Stone was forcibly thrown off that roof.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What is it with you, Lasalle?
No, I wouldn't call it kidnapping.<eos> Yeah, I would.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> You can't let anybody know that we're talking.<eos> Is Hamilton okay?<eos> Hamilton is not okay.<eos> He's got a bullet in his upper arm.<eos> He's bleeding fast, even with pressure.<eos> He needs a doctor.<eos> No, that's why I called you.
Even you are not that good a liar.<eos> Then why don't you come in?<eos> Come on in, then!<eos> And you tell your version and I'll tell mine!<eos> And who do you think they're gonna believe?<eos> Some... fugitive federal agent or the respected mayor of New Orleans?<eos> You got no moves left here.<eos> I got one.<eos> I wasn't expecting an epiphany.<eos> Just betting on the only motive that's ever mattered to you.
- Pick your moments!<eos> - I'll tell you what.<eos> Why don't we play tomorrow during lunch?<eos> If I win, your "storage room" goes back to being my office.<eos> - Ha!<eos> Steve! - Ha! If you win, you can turn it into a unicorn stable for all I care because that's a fairytale!<eos> Ha! Oh, snap!<eos> It is on!<eos> Hey, Teddy.<eos> What wizard did this to you?
Fine.<eos> Van's ready to destroy you.<eos> Do you enjoy being his little bitch?<eos> It's called a squire, Emily.<eos> Van!<eos> Are we gonna do this or what?<eos> And now... please welcome the one, the only...<eos> Vanderveer "Bring the Pain"<eos> Wayne Junior!<eos> Wa-bow! I hope you said good-bye to your loved ones because I'm gonna skin you alive and wear you to your own funeral.
Emily... I've been thinking.<eos> Even though you lost the match and the office is mine to do with whatever I want, I'm going to give it to you anyway.<eos> Because that's the kind of guy I am.<eos> Did you hear that, gang?<eos> I love you, Van.<eos> Kay, Lee, Malcolm,<eos> Zoey, Simon...<eos> Puffy Haired guy.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Now normally we just roll over and he leaves us alone, but I guess the real trick is to put up a fight but ultimately let him humiliate you.
You know what?<eos> Maybe I should call Hannah. Yeah.<eos> Get her some flowers.<eos> Nice.<eos> Hey, does this look straight to you?<eos> Van, I want a rematch.<eos> No, he won fair and square.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No!<eos> Emily, all a rematch would do is rob you of what is clearly a much needed lesson in how to lose with a little class.
At Von Weber, we believe that price is what...<eos> During the crisis, other brands slashed their prices, but at Von Weber we have a saying,<eos> "When they go low, we go high."<eos> I came up with that.<eos> I'm absolutely positive you did not.<eos> No I mean, in this context.<eos> My work is a comment on the hypocrisy of the uniform.<eos> At once imbuing the wearer with monolithic power while simultaneously rendering him impotent as an individual.<eos> Jill.<eos> Larry, thank you so much for this opportunity.
Enough with the "we".<eos> There is no "we" in Von Weber.<eos> Quite literally there is.<eos> It's not a collective "we," it's more of a royal one.<eos> Brooke, I am capable of a lot more than you think.<eos> It's time you started to recognize that.<eos> Now is not that time.<eos> Today is about Brooke Von Weber not Devon Von Devon.<eos> The last six years have been about Brooke Weber.<eos> When I first hired you, you lived in a fourth floor walk up in Astoria.
Brooke, I am capable of a lot more than you think.<eos> It's time you started to recognize that.<eos> Now is not that time.<eos> Today is about Brooke Von Weber not Devon Von Devon.<eos> The last six years have been about Brooke Weber.<eos> When I first hired you, you lived in a fourth floor walk up in Astoria.<eos> I still live there!<eos> Brooke, I love you, but it is getting cold here in your shadow.<eos> I need to know I have a future with you...<eos> And I need you to do what I hired you to do.
I found years of annual reports of Fred Kirby's time on the board of NYOOPI.<eos> Why would you want that?<eos> Because I hope to find evidence of embezzlement or fraud.<eos> Let's see how many people pay for that preposterous silver star when it becomes a mark of corruption.<eos> NYOOPI helps people find detectives.<eos> Why do you have a problem with that?<eos> Because I want people to be able to find detectives who've earned the right to be called detectives.<eos> Well, if it were up to you, there'd only be four or five people like that in the whole world.<eos> Your point?<eos> If NYOOPI offends you so much, why don't you just quit?
- You're the biggest liar.<eos> - No.<eos> - You're a piece of--<eos> - Spitzer, he's a great guy?<eos> First of all, Alex, this ain't your fucking show.<eos> And, Roger, it surely ain't your fucking show!<eos> Blowjob! Blowjob! Blowjob!<eos> Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!<eos> You're a hatchet man.<eos> I don't know why anyone in the media takes you seriously.
I just need more time.<eos> See, you can't fight fire with fire.<eos> That's exactly what they expect.<eos> I mean, you gotta fight it with kittens or mercury or... or the concept of time.<eos> What was waiting inside that café?<eos> A Russian, the FBI?<eos> I have more emotions than you.<eos> I have them.<eos> I'm having one right now.<eos> She really left you?
Stop.<eos> He's not pathetic.<eos> What the hell's going on here?<eos> ! I'm...<eos> I had to keep you out of the final part of the plan because I needed your reaction for... believability.<eos> - Well, how'd I do?<eos> - You did so good, baby.<eos> Come here.<eos> We're here.<eos> The car's waiting to take you to the plane.
I am not the one for you, Clay.<eos> You might care about me, but you are still in love with her.<eos> Apologize for underestimating her.<eos> You've got cash, a few passports, a couple of names that... you're gonna need better burner phones once they start to ask questions about your death.<eos> Yeah, okay. I got it.<eos> I know.<eos> You always have.<eos> Yeah, I'm annoying like that.<eos> You ready?<eos> There's an empty plane waiting for you.
Be nice.<eos> He helped get us out.<eos> It's nice to see you two together.<eos> I really just wanted confirmation you were twins and not just Nimah with a head injury.<eos> It's nice to be together.<eos> I'm grateful to be out of custody.<eos> And we're glad the others are free.<eos> Don't get me wrong, but being in prison and...<eos> I don't know...<eos> It changes you.
So, we don't say "autistic kid." We say "kid with autism," person before diagnosis.<eos> He doesn't know that because it's just, we don't do that at our house.<eos> So, it's really my bad.<eos> We probably should.<eos> No, it... I mean, I know it, but I just...<eos> Anyway, it doesn't matter.<eos> No. Go, Doug.<eos> You know, the whole thing really threw me off because we'd been getting along well. And he's been seeing a therapist lately.<eos> And I felt like he was getting better.<eos> Oh, so sorry to interrupt you again, but, um, there is no getting better in autism.
Nope. They were all out of that at the market.<eos> It's tomorrow night, so be there or be square.<eos> Sam, how's your arm?<eos> Is it okay?<eos> Yes, and you've asked me that six times.<eos> It was fine then. Why would it be different now?<eos> Honey, he seems okay.<eos> Stop beating up on yourself.<eos> You know?<eos> Jesus! What's the matter with you?
What do you mean, "Cigarettes?<eos> No."? You been smoking something else?<eos> Dad.<eos> I'm sure it was someone else.<eos> I mean, everyone at that school smokes.<eos> It's like an episode of Mad Men.<eos> Maybe it's a little... a little doobage?<eos> Huh?<eos> Blunt? Kush?<eos> Since it's clearly, like, bothering you, why don't we just honey?
I had to.<eos> It's cool. I get it.<eos> And, um, I'm sorry about Meatball.<eos> He sounds lovely. I mean, he must have been if you cared about him so much.<eos> Well, I'm just glad you were there... even for a little while.<eos> Nick, we have to end this.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're not just a distraction or a-a hobby, like bowling.<eos> You're a good person, and you deserve to have someone in your life, really in your life, someone that cares about you and can be with you, and that's not me.
No, I've got eyes, Dwayne.<eos> It was anything but fine.<eos> Loretta...<eos> I'm good.<eos> Chaplain Morgan was trying to reach you.<eos> What'd he say before he died?<eos> "Trust in the Word."<eos> That's all.<eos> Trust in the Word?<eos> Anything bad, whatever happened, he would just look at you sort of matter-of-fact and tell you to trust in the Word.
That's all.<eos> Trust in the Word?<eos> Anything bad, whatever happened, he would just look at you sort of matter-of-fact and tell you to trust in the Word.<eos> You knew him well?<eos> He was the pastor at Clearwater Baptist.<eos> You're from Clearwater?<eos> Chaplain was your pastor.<eos> He was more than that. He was like a father.<eos> And not just to me.<eos> I'm guessing he taught you how to fight.
I came in here to set up for a memorial.<eos> I see Boone standing in the middle of the sanctuary, like he's proud of the mess he made.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> I only wish you would've came a few moments later, I would've finished the job.<eos> And then what?<eos> You'd be up on a murder charge.<eos> Jeopardizing my case, your navy career... Come on, Rudd.<eos> I've known you all of ten minutes, you're no killer.<eos> If you push a man far enough...<eos> That what Chaplain Morgan taught you?

Come on, Rudd.<eos> I've known you all of ten minutes, you're no killer.<eos> If you push a man far enough...<eos> That what Chaplain Morgan taught you?<eos> Eye for an eye?<eos> "Trust in the Word." Right?<eos> That's what he used to tell you.

The data card.<eos> Yes.<eos> Right now, only way to turn this thing around is to work the case.<eos> Get the data card, find those suspects.<eos> They lead us to Hamilton.<eos> Where's Rudd?<eos> Up in the conference room.<eos> Okay. You and Sebastian, try to pick up where Patton left off, get IDs on the other suspects.<eos> Christopher, with me.<eos> Last night, around the time Morgan ejected the data card from the camera, he called you on your cell.
He called from the sanctuary.<eos> Which was... weird. Because Chaplain Morgan never allowed phones in the sanctuary.<eos> There's a chance that's where he hid the data card.<eos> Suspects turned the place upside down.<eos> We ran through it with a fine-tooth comb.<eos> Worth another look.<eos> Let's go sweep the church again. Come on.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Pride called you, right?<eos> Told you about my little suspension.
According to the director, the only way to save my team, to keep us in New Orleans, is to drop the case.<eos> Which means let Hamilton go.<eos> And I can't do that. I won't do that.<eos> Which is also what Hamilton wants, because the more you go rogue, the more ammunition he has to use against you.<eos> You're your own worst enemy.<eos> I'm not gonna let him get away with this.<eos> And I'm not gonna let another innocent person die.<eos> How can I?<eos> So why are you here?<eos> So I can politely listen, nod, tell you you're right?
You're your own worst enemy.<eos> I'm not gonna let him get away with this.<eos> And I'm not gonna let another innocent person die.<eos> How can I?<eos> So why are you here?<eos> So I can politely listen, nod, tell you you're right?<eos> Because if that's what you want, then you sure as hell don't know me as well as I thought you did.<eos> Look, Dwayne, as far as I'm concerned, after what Hamilton threw at you,<eos> I don't blame you for being pissed.<eos> But I'm telling you, the more personal you make this, the more difficult it's gonna be to see your way through.
[Langford] With the photo that's taken of Hannah, it was innocent, but an unflattering photo out of context, posted by a guy with a particular rep, or saying something, or spinning the story some kind of way can destroy someone.<eos> And when Bryce takes the photo from Justin and sends it round the school, it's the beginning of the end for her.<eos> It does irreparable damage to Hannah's reputation.<eos> She can't go around and personally remedy it for everyone.<eos> [Boe] It's definitely a generational thing because my whole middle and high school, when we got home, all we would do is hop on, either it was Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.<eos> So, that's our whole world, is our school, and then social media.<eos> So, that's why when you're being cyberbullied, you're being attacked by so many people who are hiding behind, you know, a computer screen.<eos> [Dr. Hu] Adults don't realize how much cyberbullying is hurtful because it didn't exist when people my age were younger, and cyberbullying doesn't end when the school bell rings.<eos> Once something is online, it's just there, and a picture can say a million different things.<eos> And people come up and conjure up their own story, or what they think is right, and it affects you, it hurts you.
She pushes people away, people that we know would have been there for her.<eos> You know, she could have been more open.<eos> But in a way, she kind of sets up Mr. Porter to fail.<eos> I think it's okay to recognize that.<eos> She wasn't perfect, she didn't do everything she could.<eos> And she should have done more.<eos> So, what happened, Hannah?<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Just... one thing on top of another.<eos> [Mr. Porter] If I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific.
Okay, everybody with sticky hands, stand up...<eos> We're washing.<eos> Mine are the stickiest.<eos> Oh, come on, Mateo!<eos> I got him.<eos> Talk to her.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Oh, um, yeah, sure.<eos> About?<eos> Oh, stop it, I know he told you about his big... declaration.
Thanks to the trainer I became a very good rider.<eos> I love horsies.<eos> And, friends, it felt like one of those twists of fate you only find in fairy tales.<eos> Or telenovelas.<eos> And do you still know the horsie trainer?<eos> Oh yes, we go riding at least once a month. Wow.<eos> Because, as it happens,<eos> I am in the market to rent some white horses just like that one.<eos> That's great.<eos> My friend will help you out for sure. Oh, thank you.
Be careful with the frown face.<eos> You are too young to get lines.<eos> What's bringing you down?<eos> I just got some pretty heartbreaking news.<eos> His shirtless scene was cut.<eos> Jane told you, huh? Uh-oh.<eos> I get it.<eos> Breakups are hard.<eos> But there are other fish in the sea, and... with a chest as powerful as Poseidon himself, you can catch any of them.<eos> So Jane told you she was going to break up with me?
- It's him or me.<eos> - It's him or me.<eos> Girls, come on, hurry up.<eos> We don't want to be late for your performance...<eos> When did you get here?<eos> Uh, just now.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yep, fine.<eos> I'm not fine. You know what?<eos> I don't care if I turned you down.
You remember that Rose had just threatened to kill her if anyone figured out their scheme.<eos> Oh, you have a twin or something?<eos> It was her or Scott.<eos> So she ditched him.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do not touch the prisoner.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Time's up.<eos> I told you you could trust me.
Rafael, I'm sorry. That was a mistake.<eos> It didn't mean anything.<eos> We've been back together for a week.<eos> I know!<eos> I was just feeling very insecure, and-and he was saying all the right things, and it just happened.<eos> Insecure about what?<eos> You and Jane.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You're going to say you're just best friends, but that's not it.<eos> She looks at you like...
And never doubt that all I want, forever and always, is for you to be happy.<eos> Jane.<eos> Adam?<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Jane's first love.<eos> I did say we'd get back to him.<eos> I used to live in that apartment.<eos> I found the letter.<eos> I didn't know it was yours.<eos> I never thought I'd see you again.
I got it!<eos> - Is Dora home?<eos> - Dora!<eos> Some dork is at the door!<eos> Oops, I forgot to use my inside voice.<eos> Gabe?<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Three, four.<eos> ♪ Hold on, little girl ♪<eos> ♪ Show me what he's done to you ♪
That's your biggest regret?<eos> I've seen you eat a hot dog you dropped in the subway.<eos> I've seen you punch a bird.<eos> I didn't punch the bird, the bird flew at my face and I gently shooed it to the ground.<eos> This is gently shooing.<eos> This... Ah! ... is a bird slap.<eos> But whatever.<eos> You should talk to Dora.<eos> I'm gonna go talk to Dora.<eos> So no one asked you to prom because you punched a bird?
I can hear you.<eos> I'm rolling the window down now.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> I will never forgive you.<eos> Hey, Clara.<eos> What's shakin', bacon?<eos> Well, you texted me the word "porn," then broke my window, and also wrote, "Clara, do me," on the street.<eos> Hmm. Well, someone's full of herself.<eos> So... are you asking me to prom or what?<eos> Yes, he's asking you to prom.
All day.<eos> Flavor's my middle name.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's Lurleen.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Okay, you're super angry.<eos> Me?<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Well, maybe because you stormed out, and now you're furiously slathering mayo on what's shaping up to be a multi-decker hate sandwich.<eos> Well, it's just, I told you I didn't want Dora to go to prom, and you forced it to happen.
And third, you need to break your foot off in Cameron's ass.<eos> I thought that was the first.<eos> - You got two feet, girl.<eos> Where's Amanda?<eos> So, Maggie moved Kirsten's mother?<eos> It's not like I knew what she was going to do with that information.<eos> She ordered me to tell her.<eos> I had to.<eos> Of course.<eos> Otherwise, she'd shoot you.
Who wants to look at this on their TV?<eos> It's a little too much reality.<eos> I'm so sorry, Mike.<eos> - I was so messed up back then.<eos> - Yeah, no, I-I knew that... or why else would I, like, push your buttons?<eos> It's fuckin' reality TV.<eos> You need drama.<eos> And it was great.<eos> Loved it, the ratings.<eos> Well, I think about what I did to you, all the time, and how much I fucked up your life.
Nuh.<eos> No, I'm really sorry, but, um, just please don't call me again.<eos> Hey, Mr Strathairn, can I<eos> - talk to you about some...<eos> - Subpoena for the Begley file.<eos> You've got 20 minutes to get that to the Registry.<eos> Yeah, I'm on it.<eos> And then that.<eos> One, two.<eos> - Keepin' you up, are we, darl?
The other prisoners attacked Ferguson.<eos> - She just defended herself.<eos> - Why didn't you step in?<eos> Oh, and get my neck broken?<eos> Nuh, you don't pay me enough.<eos> Get out!<eos> I warned you this would happen.<eos> If you constantly have to defend yourself, you've proved my point. - You have to go into Protection.<eos> - No.<eos> Then, I can't be responsible for what happens to you.
A message?<eos> It must be from him.<eos> Oh, my God...<eos> The screen test for The Patriot came up with Mel Gibson, who's the biggest Australian movie star.<eos> That was one of his idols, and he loved, you know, Mad Max and...<eos> It was a huge, huge thing for him.<eos> It was an actual screen test and costume on the set with the main star.<eos> I was halfway through the second scene that I had to read for them, and words were just bluhblbl, coming out like this, and so I just stopped and stood up and I said, "I'm sorry.<eos> Heath called me and said,<eos> "They're not calling you on this one.
The cameras were a part of him.<eos> Heath and I had mutual friends, so it was a setup.<eos> We met, and that was it.<eos> That was it.<eos> There were always cameras around... a video camera, or a Polaroid camera, or the film camera.<eos> I was amazed when I saw all of the stuff together... and how many photographs...<eos> I mean, he was documenting everything.<eos> He was just surrounded by all of those moments he was in, and then surrounded by them, but then he'd be capturing the next moment and the next moment, you know, and the next moment.<eos> It never stopped... and the way he was able to be in the moment and then capture the moment on the camera...<eos> He just got you in your most authentic self.
He'd shown me some snippets of him as the Joker, and, I mean, I was blown away.<eos> I couldn't believe it, and I just said to him, you know,<eos> "This is amazing.<eos> This is, like, taking it to the next level.<eos> Like, you're going to be nominated for this, I'm telling you right now,"<eos> and he just smiled.<eos> Heath was over the moon about the role of the Joker in The Dark Knight.<eos> He was very pleased with the way it was going and the input that he had into that character.<eos> It was after the dinner, and he kind of, like, leaned over at one point and said, "Oh, by the way,<eos> I'm taking you back to London with me,"
Raven's Home was filmed in front of a live studio audience.<eos> Yes!<eos> First!<eos> I finally beat you to the bathroom.
Levi's first.<eos> This must burn, Booker.<eos> This must burn bad.<eos> That's my body spray.<eos> The burning lets you know you're fly.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Levi can be here.<eos> We're like brothers.<eos> I use the bathroom in front of him all the time.<eos> Which I repeatedly told you I'm not comfortable with.
Booker, back off!<eos> It's Nia time.<eos> Continue, sweetie.<eos> Go on.<eos> Say, hon, are those the same pants you left in this morning?<eos> - They are not.<eos> - Yeah. Been there.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> The craziest thing that's ever happened to me happened, and I can't get anyone to listen.<eos> Just have another vision. Then everyone will believe you.
Well, sounds like you have things under control.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Oh, okay. Yeah. He probably just needs a nap.<eos> Now, where can we find...<eos> I am Groot.<eos> That's what I call a light sleeper.<eos> Peter Quill, what did you do with that Cocoon?<eos> Hey-hey, Nova Prime!<eos> Which Cocoon was that now?<eos> The one all of Xandar just saw you with before it opened up, and the Believers' broadcast cut out.
No. No, no, no, no, don't do that.<eos> No... Don't...<eos> Clearly the child requires a more constructive form of destruction.<eos> Drax, what are you doing?<eos> Making fungus and entrail pudding.<eos> A good chef cannot destroy all of existence, for then he would have nothing left to cook.<eos> Ugh! Let's clean you up before you destroy all of existence with that stench.<eos> Mm. Needs more entrail.<eos> Come here!<eos> Thanos may have feared you, but I don't, so stop fidgeting.
How's that for a headcase?<eos> Hi.<eos> Jesus Christ, Franky.<eos> How can this happen to you?<eos> Well, I was tryin' to help someone out, someone who I thought had a bit of a shit start.<eos> - That's not right.<eos> No matter how much you help some people out, they keep makin' dumb-arse decisions.<eos> I hope you haven't. What?<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> That item I took from you outside the court... it was used on someone the other day.
What's it to you?<eos> Ferguson's obviously got someone on the outside.<eos> - When's your board meeting?<eos> - It's this afternoon, and I am not looking forward to it.<eos> What's with Vinegar Tits?<eos> It's not like she hasn't been dicked around by Ferguson.<eos> Governor Bennett.<eos> After Bea's death, she won't be sticking her neck out for anyone.<eos> Yeah, I got that.<eos> I believe you, by the way.
- Poovey?<eos> Now we'll see how you like getting your tits screwed off for a change.<eos> Wh... what?<eos> Remember?<eos> 'Cause you screwed his wife's tits off.<eos> - Damn it, Poovey!<eos> - What? Figuratively!<eos> Well, either way, I can tell you right now i...<eos> Wait. Did you say "a change" or just "change," as in spare change?<eos> Huh! What change? They'll be passing you around for half a pack of smokes.
Usually people just blubber and beg, and those big gloobs of snot run outta their nose, but you... if you don't get a shot of factor-K every 12 hours, you will die.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - Which... and that's fair,<eos> - but... - Let me guess. You're only gonna make enough for one injection at a time.<eos> Well, I am now.<eos> - Goddamn it!<eos> Yeah, - So, like an insurance policy.<eos> - How long does it take you to make it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> An hour? Well, then, I guess I'll wake you up in about 11 hours.
Ew!<eos> Right?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look, tonight your brother is going to drop the ransom money at the Griffith observatory.<eos> Archer is going to retrieve it and bring it to me.<eos> And if nobody screws up, once I have the money, you're free to go.<eos> Well, but that's my whole point.<eos> Go where?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe a handsome young Nazi scientist will take you in.
- Hold this.<eos> Gonna do your armpits?<eos> That's not very Casper-y.<eos> Do... do you think it's Trexler's?<eos> Oh, please!<eos> With your luck?<eos> Oh, sweet mother of Christ!<eos> Wh-what the hell is happening?<eos> - And why the hell are you here? - That's it?<eos> No "sorry I shoved you out of a moving frickin' car"?
Until I get outta here, Gidge, I don't wanna see or hear from you anymore, okay?<eos> Just stay away.<eos> - Eh?<eos> - Hey.<eos> I bet you can't wait to get out of this place, hey?<eos> I'm kinda jealous.<eos> Oh, love, you've only got another six months.<eos> You'll be back with your boys before you know it.<eos> - Mmm. - Hey? Canteen is now open to H Block.<eos> When are the cops calling you up?
I'm going to put a rocket up everyone.<eos> - Yes, Governor.<eos> - And talk to Proctor, she's anti-drugs.<eos> She might be able to help.<eos> - Yep, will do. All women to report to assigned work duties.<eos> - Compound.<eos> So, why'd you see Shayne Butler this morning?<eos> - You been checkin' up on me?<eos> - Well, you won't bloody talk to me!<eos> I told you to stay away.
- Yes, Governor.<eos> - And talk to Proctor, she's anti-drugs.<eos> She might be able to help.<eos> - Yep, will do. All women to report to assigned work duties.<eos> - Compound.<eos> So, why'd you see Shayne Butler this morning?<eos> - You been checkin' up on me?<eos> - Well, you won't bloody talk to me!<eos> I told you to stay away.<eos> Hey, listen, I know a lot of people have let you down, but I'm not one of them.
Are you serious?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Are you fucking stupid?<eos> Because someone nearly died today.<eos> She couldn't handle her shit, not my problem.<eos> I am asking you, because I know you're not stupid!<eos> Just lay off the gear for a couple of weeks, okay?<eos> Or what?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'll find out how it's coming in and I will shut you down.
Well, why don't you try believing' me?<eos> Or maybe that's it.<eos> You never really trusted me, I'm just a bit of rough trade.<eos> - Franky, you know that's not true.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> Maybe this is where I belong.<eos> Behind bars, like a fuckin' bad girl.<eos> - Ugh! - Fuck off!<eos> - Franky...<eos> - Or maybe that's what turns you on?
Myself included.<eos> There's going to be a cell toss any minute. Shit!<eos> If you're holding, you'd better get rid of it.<eos> There's not much left after Proctor cleaned me out.<eos> I lost big time. You have to write it off.<eos> You'll have to bring in more gear.<eos> No, not now.<eos> It's too hot in the kitchen.<eos> Well, I can't leave work unit now.<eos> So get pinged. Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Are you gonna escape?<eos> - Listen... you can't...<eos> - Fuck, Franky, that is crazy!<eos> - I gotta clear my name!<eos> - You will get caught!<eos> _<eos> - ♪ You're imperfect ♪ - _ ♪ You're all over the place ♪<eos> Shit!<eos> Fuck!<eos> What did I tell you about bringin' your filthy fuckin' shit in here?
What did I tell you about bringin' your filthy fuckin' shit in here?<eos> The only shit I see is you. Ho-ho.<eos> Get that stupid grin off your stupid fuckin' face, Chinky-Chonk,<eos> - or I'll wipe it off for ya!<eos> - Back off, Bamm-Bamm!<eos> Bamm-Bamm?<eos> - Fuck, fuckin'...<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Huh?<eos> - What did I tell you?
Yeah, right.<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> !<eos> Give me one good reason why I shouldn't report you?<eos> I'm a good root.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> !<eos> Oh, you think this is funny do you?<eos> Not to mention, getting Novak to do your dirty work.<eos> What if someone else had caught you with my card?
If you're lying about your age, Doreen, what else could you be lying about?<eos> - Oh... oh, shut up!<eos> - Ooh, good point.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just ignore them, keep goin'.<eos> How am I supposed to talk with them carrying on?<eos> Well, that's the whole point!<eos> - We're desensitising ya.<eos> - Why?<eos> 'Cause when you can get through your speech with people hanging shit on you, which is basically your worst nightmare, then, tomorrow, you'll cream it.
- No.<eos> Come on, what do you say?<eos> I'm... nuh, um, I have to think about that.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Yeah, no pressure. - N...<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> - What?<eos> - I saw you buy it.<eos> I dunno what you're talkin' about.<eos> You reckon Red'd want to see you back on the gear?
Lucy Gambaro.<eos> - Someone cut her tongue out.<eos> She was seeing the dentist.<eos> Nurse Radcliffe went to get him.<eos> When she came back, Gambaro was gone, there was blood everywhere.<eos> Who did this?<eos> - Could it have been Liz? - Li...<eos> Birdsworth?<eos> She came to me this morning, and she was in a state, and she said that Lucy knew that she was Witness X.<eos> Who did this to you?
See ya, Bridget.<eos> If you wanna have a girls' night - I won't be offended.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> I really don't.<eos> Attention, compound. Attention, compound.<eos> H Block are now called for breakfast.<eos> Now, we need the department's final approval today, so, I want everyone on their absolute best behaviour.<eos> Or I'll punch your tits in.<eos> What'd I tell you about positive reinforcement?
Where's my gear?<eos> That's ten times the going rate!<eos> - Ah... - Tell her to give me my fucking gear!<eos> Now, you've been holding out on me.<eos> You've got something far more valuable to trade than someone else's money.<eos> - Where did you get that? !<eos> - Ah-ah-ah... eh.<eos> You said that I could have anything from your cell that I wanted.<eos> Not that.<eos> Warned you the price would be high.
We took his product.<eos> He'll come to us.<eos> I'm gonna go get a drink.<eos> Pote, let's go.<eos> I have Chicago handled.<eos> If you had it handled, you wouldn't be here, Professor.<eos> Makes me feel like someone else had the keys to the house I built and locked me the hell out.<eos> You know I don't ring doorbells.<eos> I kick the shit in for you.<eos> You ever known me to let people put you out in the cold like that?
Esta bien.<eos> Inches from death and you're still a charming son of a bitch.<eos> You risked being arrested by coming here.<eos> And on your birthday, no less.<eos> A heart attack isn't nothing.<eos> It's a flea bite. Mild.<eos> Leave it in.<eos> It's not a good look for me.<eos> No, but living is.<eos> When I lost you, I thought my heart would break.
Pote says James needs a few more days to recover from the beating Cortez gave him.<eos> So they're gonna stay in Chicago until he's ready to travel.<eos> It's really not good for me to be alone, especially if things go south with Devon Finch.<eos> You're only gonna make a deal. You don't need muscle.<eos> You seem very certain of that.<eos> If we strike the deal, are you sure El Santo will provide us with the product we need?<eos> If he doesn't, I'll have to go back to Bolivia.<eos> Without your boyfriend?<eos> I sent him away in Chicago, like you told me to.<eos> Guero was an irritating little mosquito, draining you from your spirit, Teresa.
I'm sorry about this morning.<eos> I know now how I've hurt my daughter, and I know that working for me has caused you pain.<eos> Reynaldo.<eos> Epifanio.<eos> It wasn't like this when we were starting out.<eos> All these ridiculous displays of wealth and excess.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You've always been a man of your word, Epifanio.<eos> I never thanked you for paying me for the loss of my goods in your tunnel.
Small price for your loyalty and trust.<eos> _<eos> It's a tragedy for a son to mourn the death of his father.<eos> And for a father to bury his son...<eos> Would you trade your success in the business to have him back?<eos> In an instant.<eos> As long as we're in this maldito business, we must soldier on.<eos> You are worried about your daughter?<eos> More than anything in the world.<eos> We know Cortez sent you.
I could say with certainty that the person we're looking for is left-handed.<eos> I'll get CSU over here to dust for prints.<eos> Think maybe you should leave the firearms to me?<eos> It's not real.<eos> It's plastic.<eos> Ooh, check this out.<eos> Stop stealing other people's tricks. Or else. Anubis.<eos> That's got to be another magician, right?<eos> It's Chantal.<eos> I asked her to tell me when the guy who filed the complaint against you was giving his statement at the D.A.'s office.
Yes. How charming.<eos> It was, actually.<eos> In its own way.<eos> See, he was terrified that he would fail.<eos> Just like you're terrified.<eos> Only difference is, you tend to throw up on other people, which seems ungenerous to me.<eos> He'd walk out of that bathroom, and onto the stage, and give the world the finest dance numbers it will ever see.<eos> Just like you're going to direct the best picture this studio has ever made.<eos> Not despite your fear, but because of it.<eos> Is it the language that's unnerving you?
Where you going?<eos> What are you so scared of, kiddo?<eos> I would never let you go.<eos> But maybe I should.<eos> Kathleen!<eos> Monroe?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> He attacked me.<eos> Monroe, I'm gonna tell you everything.<eos> But first, do you know that I love you?
Good, you two deserve each other.<eos> No, I don't want him, I want you!<eos> You cost me Minna!<eos> You're not gonna do it to me twice.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> Hell of a con.<eos> No, no.<eos> It was easy.<eos> I just taught her an accent, you did the rest, as I knew you would.<eos> I tried to warn you, honey, he didn't love you.
I thought that was just a once-off.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> What's the favour?<eos> I need you to tell the Governor about Stewart.<eos> - What, and be a fucking lagger?<eos> - It's not lagging he's a screw.<eos> He's the Deputy Governor!<eos> - Fuck knows what he'll do to me! - Sh... sh...<eos> - Jackson will have your back.<eos> - Oh, wait, so... Mr Jackson put you up to this?
- What, and be a fucking lagger?<eos> - It's not lagging he's a screw.<eos> He's the Deputy Governor!<eos> - Fuck knows what he'll do to me! - Sh... sh...<eos> - Jackson will have your back.<eos> - Oh, wait, so... Mr Jackson put you up to this?<eos> Forget it I'm not helping any screw.<eos> This isn't about screws, Allie.<eos> But why now, suddenly.<eos> I begged you to do something.
- Yes you do.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Look... who are you afraid of?<eos> No one.<eos> Then tell her.<eos> - I can't remember.<eos> - Tell her!<eos> Mr Jackson!<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Has someone been threatening you?
Has someone been threatening you?<eos> No.<eos> Because we can protect you.<eos> Sorry, Governor, I can't remember.<eos> - You don't want a moment? Yeah.<eos> - No.<eos> Ah, thank you, Mr Jackson, you can take Novak back to her unit.<eos> Um, if anything jogs your memory you know where I am.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What'd he threaten you with?
You were suspended for a positive drug test, Will.<eos> That test...<eos> - that had nothing to do with Jake.<eos> - Who do you think gave me the eccy?<eos> And... and you gave him my job.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Well, he's only acting in the position.<eos> Vera... he's a snake, okay, you don't know him.<eos> Well, I think I know him better than you.<eos> He'll use you and then turn on you too,
Derek.<eos> I wondered when you'd show up.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, the prison's in a shambles.<eos> All down to poor management skills and an utter lack of leadership, I'd say.<eos> Well, at least it's not on fire.- -<eos> How do you know Mike Pennisi?<eos> Who?<eos> These are my posts. How did you get them?<eos> I got permission to access the net to prove that chick provoked you.
But hearing her actual confession, fuck, that was something else.<eos> And she went into all the friggin' details, too.<eos> Poor Don!<eos> - Liz, I don't know what to do.<eos> - You have to get the police involved, Ms Bennett.<eos> You gotta get 'em in here now and I'll sign the statement.<eos> I'll make a statement. Do you really want to go down that rabbit hole again?<eos> What's the rabbit... rabbit hole?<eos> What the he... What do you mean?<eos> Claiming that Sonia confessed another murder to you.
- No, no, you tell him Turk said, pay up or he's a fucking dead man!<eos> Vera?<eos> Vera?<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> I had a visit from a man called...<eos> - Turk.<eos> I don't think he was Turkish.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> He didn't hurt you, did he?
I just...<eos> I... - What?<eos> Oh, God, don't tell me you've fallen for her.<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> - Oh, Jake.<eos> Jake.<eos> But no one deserves the shit we're putting her through.<eos> How would you know what Vera deserves?<eos> I lost everything when she betrayed me.<eos> Everyone betrayed you. But not you.
And you'll always be a brothel-owning pimp masquerading as a regional manager...<eos> Derek.<eos> You must be a real hoot in the yard.<eos> I bet you're first picked at basketball, too.<eos> Ah, enough of the small talk.<eos> Franky Doyle's lawyer wants her out of isolation.<eos> Now, you know how insistent these lawyers are when, uh, bangin' on about their clients' human rights, so I've got no option but to, ah, release Doyle back into General.<eos> I'm certain she'll be gunnin' for you, given her accusation, so it's probably in your best interests to go into Protection.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I'd hate to see anything bad happen to you.
- in their eyes, that gives you motive.<eos> - Get the proof!<eos> There is no proof.<eos> Just an empty wall.<eos> So I'm fucked?<eos> Kaz is convinced that she can take down Ferguson with your help.<eos> I can't believe you'd just do nothing.<eos> I'm not doin' nothin'.<eos> I'm getting out of here.<eos> But you're letting her get away with what she's done to you.
No, not that well.<eos> Well, he was very charming.<eos> Sure, if you think immaturity is charming.<eos> I thought he seemed quite mature?<eos> Trust me, you don't want a Muslim boy.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because... just trust me, they...<eos> They got together with Norwegian girls just to take advantage of them.<eos> And as soon as they want to get serious,<eos> When they really want... a proper woman in their life they marry a Muslim girl and ditch you.
HI! WE CAN COME LOOK MARI'S BUS ON FRIDAY AT 15:00<eos> MOST OF THE BUSES HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOLD<eos> SO THIS IS OUR ONLY CHANCE!<eos> THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE DREAMT OF!<eos> GOOD!<eos> Why not?<eos> Am I distracting?<eos> I can't study at home when you are there!<eos> When you look at me...<eos> I promise not to look at you. FACEBOOK:

SANA IS THE BOSS. RIGHT, SANA?<eos> MONDAY 12:11<eos> 300.000 KRONE. APPLY ON FINANCIALAID.NO TODAY<eos> YOUSEF<eos> - I'M HURT BECAUSE YOU NEVER REPLIED TO MY MEME<eos> THE KIDS AROUND YOU ARE HURT BECAUSE YOU ARE CHATTING DURING WORK TIME
!<eos> You?<eos> !<eos> So this is your doing after all.<eos> I saw through that wickedness from the start.<eos> Liar!<eos> You're just a dirty old geezer!<eos> Now your dojo's reputation is ruined.<eos> That's the end of your dojo.<eos> Serves you right!
Don't look!<eos> Yurin's witchcraft has lifted!<eos> Yes.<eos> Now!<eos> How could this happen?<eos> I went as far as to learn witchcraft.<eos> I can't stand it!<eos> That's enough.<eos> Wh-What?<eos> Don't forget this, three-eyed baldy! I'm going to train even more, and grind and tear you apart next time!
Make it weekly.<eos> Call your friends.<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I can't help you girls.<eos> Wrong answer. Excuse me?<eos> "I can't help you girls."<eos> You think you're talking to your puta daughter?<eos> You're dead now, bitch.<eos> Looks like somebody fucked you up, esa.
And their failures are my own.<eos> You are far too hard on yourself, compa.<eos> You once called Camila my weakness.<eos> And you were correct, Colonel.<eos> Had anyone else done the things that Camila did on our socalled war, the solution would have been obvious.<eos> Get rid of her once and for all.<eos> My heart didn't let me do this.<eos> But apparently your sicarios in Dallas had no such obstacle.<eos> The word I received is that they tried to take her life.<eos> So you think I defied you by ordering this. Oh, no.
Listen to me, okay?<eos> As soon as my friend is done, you're gonna come with me.<eos> I will keep you safe.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Why would you do that for me?<eos> Because I know how to survive.<eos> Nice shot for a gabacha.<eos> I need you to watch her for me.<eos> I have to speak to Camila about this paperwork.<eos> You think she set you up.
She found paperwork on some of your companies in a safe in Cole's office.<eos> He put everything in your name.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he was just trying to protect himself, in case the DEA came after him.<eos> Did she say anything else?<eos> Anything about the trawler company?<eos> No.<eos> That's all she said.<eos> I know that's the thing that would put you in prison for life.
I'm from Mexico, not the Moon.<eos> Well, hell, I don't know what kind of cultural references are gonna make sense to a girl from Culiacán.<eos> Culiacán... it sounds so picturesque.<eos> What was it like growing up there?<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> You gonna answer that?<eos> Teresa, it's me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I know you spoke with James.<eos> Whatever Cole told you, it isn't true.
You're gonna need to drop the charges before it's too late.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> I'm suggesting...<eos> That you do what's right.<eos> Loya.<eos> Thanks for the cigarette.<eos> We got a hit on the BOLO.<eos> Kelly Anne's ID was used at a gas station outside of town.<eos> Let's go.<eos> These are the last of the documents implicating you as the owner of that trawler company.
That's a big maybe.<eos> Do you remember when we met?<eos> You told me you had to flee Mexico because the cartel murdered your boyfriend.<eos> Yeah, you thought I was making that up.<eos> It's ironic, isn't it?<eos> 'Cause now here we are, you and me, on the run.<eos> How the hell did it come to this?<eos> We're gonna get through this, okay?<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> I won't let anything happen to you.
You don't know what it feels like.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> You can't depend on anyone, okay?<eos> Not even me.<eos> You need to do whatever it takes to survive.<eos> Isabela.<eos> They told me I had a visitor.<eos> - I was just not expecting...<eos> - I had to come.<eos> Um, when Cortez took you away,
- I had to come.<eos> Um, when Cortez took you away,<eos> I thought I'd never see you again, and that broke my heart.<eos> That's why I came.<eos> To tell you that and to tell you that you were right.<eos> About everything.<eos> You were right, and I was so stupid.<eos> - Isabela...<eos> - Let me finish, please.<eos> I wanted to believe Dad's lies so bad that I betrayed you, that I turned my back on you.
- Mansdale?<eos> - Look.<eos> The coward son of Oz.<eos> Talk again and I cut your eye out.<eos> This is what I've been protecting you from.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Protecting me?<eos> Why do the Shepherd hunters think you're in Asia?<eos> Who scrubbed your photo from every server on the planet?<eos> The only thing keeping you on this side of a cage or worse is me.
I'm neat.<eos> I cook.<eos> I'm crazy about you.<eos> Come on.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Mornin'.<eos> Hey.<eos> You all right?<eos> It probably sounds dumb to you that I care what anyone else thinks, but my dad kinda dumped on my job today.
Thanks, Mr. Brady.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Smile, Kathleen.<eos> All right, here we go. And five...<eos> Last night, it was an education, yes, Mr. Miner?<eos> Yes.<eos> Three people went into that house, only two came out.<eos> I know you know why.<eos> Silence is good.<eos> Silence keeps you alive.
And you start acting like a magnate's wife.<eos> No more creeping around hospitals looking for mercy cases.<eos> There's nothing wrong with dinner parties and charity balls and country clubs!<eos> Or Mahjong!<eos> I want a wife!<eos> You want a wife? Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> Go find one.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means I'm kicking you out.
Mm, I suppose it is.<eos> Good night, Pat.<eos> Good night, Margo.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You can't win, for all your damn genius, because I always have the final say.<eos> And what's more, I'm gonna outlive you.<eos> Probably.<eos> But I would have stayed loyal to you until the end.
I'm headed there now. I just have to pack a bag.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - We found his place.<eos> This guy, Liz, he's a special kind of strange.<eos> Take photos. I wanna see everything.<eos> Hey, let me call you back when I get to the safe house.<eos> Bye.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Just be still.<eos> I'd like to ask you to turn around... very slowly.
Right now.<eos> One shot.<eos> No.<eos> They've got over-watch.<eos> I count three.<eos> Everyone, hold your positions.<eos> Hello, Raymond.<eos> Said the fly to the spider.<eos> We go where our hearts take us.<eos> Yours took you to Elizabeth.
Thank you, Raymond, for proving my point better than I ever could.<eos> You underestimate yourself, Kate.<eos> The deaths you've caused in the name of crippling me have been more than adequate to prove what you've become.<eos> I've watched you hold Elizabeth emotionally hostage.<eos> I never thought you'd hold her physically hostage as well.<eos> I wanted her here to bear witness.<eos> I regret any hardship it caused her, but I believe, in the end, she'll agree it's a small price to pay for the truth.<eos> I was your friend.<eos> I protected you.<eos> I comforted you.
I can assure you the passage is safe and the documents are clean.<eos> I've got Rice on the line. He's--<eos> Your only risk is if you step out now and your clients end up with inferior material or worse yet, end up in custody.<eos> Fine.<eos> He hung up.<eos> - Well, what did he say?<eos> - Cancel the order.<eos> It appears the Frankfurt and Bagan accounts are both gone.<eos> I thought Kaplan was removed from the account.<eos> She must be trading on your trust, saying she still represents you.
I ID'd the body and I was able to ID the friend.<eos> - You know where to find them?<eos> - I already did.<eos> He's standing right in front of me.<eos> This is Mako Tanida.<eos> He killed some of the Bureau's best men and women.<eos> And then Reddington goes and kills him.<eos> Why would Reddington do that?<eos> In exchange for your protection.<eos> I followed you to the woods.
Mario Brandon Dixon is a thief who specializes in high value targets-- jewels, art, cars, nuts--<eos> - Probably macadamias.<eos> When stolen, uh, by truckload, they're actually quite lucrative, so...<eos> Uh, fun fact.<eos> Any known associates?<eos> He has a kid brother in prison.<eos> Mecklenburg Correctional.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I told you, we're gonna need him--<eos> Reddington hired the Debt Collector to kidnap you.
Allowed you to be drugged by a deranged sociopath.<eos> He did, and if he's in trouble, then so are we.<eos> I'm convinced we either rise together or fall apart.<eos> Navabi, you and Keen get to Mecklenburg.<eos> See what the brother has to say.<eos> _<eos> If you're here about Mario--<eos> No, we're here for you, Dino, what you threw away for him.<eos> You graduated high school with a 3.8 GPA and a soccer scholarship to Clemson.<eos> Mario saw the life you wanted and he dragged you into his, into this.
I trust there's a back room.<eos> Now this is more like it.<eos> Where might we find Mr. Dixon?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Honestly, I-I don't know who that is.<eos> You ever have one of those days when nothing goes right?<eos> People give you the runaround, everything seems to take twice the effort.<eos> The kind of day you'd kill to get your mojo back.<eos> I'm having one of those days.<eos> So... you can either be honest with me about Mario Dixon or I can get behind the wheel of this fine automobile and run you over.
I will, when you tell me where to find her.<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> I know about your immunity deal.<eos> That means I'm dead no matter what I tell you.<eos> Ratting Kaplan out gets me nothing.<eos> She had you steal that agreement.<eos> Must've had a plan to bring it to her.<eos> You can tell me where and when, or you can tell him.<eos> One way or another, the truth will come out.<eos> We don't know each other, so I'll forgive you for not knowing that I don't scare easily.
But anybody holding this thing is a target.<eos> I don't wanna keep it any longer than I have to.<eos> I can meet you later today.<eos> We're all set.<eos> I'll serve her up on a silver platter if you hold up your end of the deal.<eos> You got Dixon to talk. How? You know what?<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> I honestly don't wanna know.<eos> I didn't touch him.<eos> - But he told you how to find Kaplan?
Where the hell is he?<eos> Where did Kaplan tell you to meet?<eos> Where's what you promised me?<eos> A box?<eos> I'm supposed to believe that my escape plan and my future survival fits into a box?<eos> This is no mere box.<eos> Inside, you'll find travel vouchers, security codes, boat keys, and ownership papers for a private 96-acre island off the coast of Brunei.<eos> It's a self-sufficient turnkey property with a desalination well, a solar and wind farm, full-time waitstaff, a grounds crew, security team, and a property manager, all paid for in perpetuity by a very healthy trust fund.<eos> Paradise with no extradition treaty.<eos> And what's to prevent you from kicking me off this island once I move in?
I believe she has another one in mind.<eos> A direct appeal to kaplan.<eos> Who was relying on the grand jury to separate us.<eos> I fear kaplan's backup plan may be more extreme.<eos> The number.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Mr. kaplan?<eos> Hello?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I swore an oath to your mother I would protect you with my life.
We were undercover in Montreal having dinner. He said that everything I thought I knew about myself was a lie.<eos> It was intimate and weird.<eos> And when he thought we were made, he snuck out the back. And I palmed his scotch glass.<eos> But when the envelope came back, I was scared it would confirm the devil was my father.<eos> I didn't look at it.<eos> I threw it away.<eos> Elizabeth, I'm sorry, if you don't want to know...<eos> Mr. kaplan was my nanny.<eos> Somehow I'm not surprised.<eos> She loved you so much.
Dig in, huh?<eos> Hot dogs and rice... where's the bun?<eos> Well, just roll it around in the rice. It'll make its own bun.<eos> Looks like it's giving me the finger.<eos> We're just doing a little belt-tightening since Adam's between jobs.<eos> Yeah... what, no, I'm not between jobs.<eos> I just finished one job and I'm about to start another.<eos> So between jobs.<eos> In front of jobs.<eos> Boom and bust... that's what I warned you about when you started that business.
What's the name of this place, again?<eos> The Over My Dead Body Bar.<eos> That's it.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I mean, what kind of degenerates hang out in a bar at 11:30 in the morning? (chuckles)<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Well, that answers that.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I'm in the dart league that I talked you into sponsoring.
"Whoever did this"?<eos> Really?<eos> You're talking like there's some mystery to solve.<eos> We all know who did it.<eos> Roy Booker did it.<eos> Marcus, let's just slow down.<eos> He tried to jam me up, it blew up in his face, so he took it out on her.<eos> Let's-let's take a walk.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Captain's instructed you to sit this one out.
After I hang up, I'll burn it, quite literally.<eos> Meet me at my home in one hour.<eos> We have much to discuss.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So it's confirmed.<eos> His... right tibia is fractured.<eos> He'll be prohibited from air travel for 48 hours.<eos> What the hell did you do tonight?<eos> Stopped you from doing far worse, if my read was right.
Did your father strike her frequently?<eos> Not just her.<eos> How did you know?<eos> There have always been signs.<eos> Almost always are when it comes to victims of abuse.<eos> Sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> Seeing signs? No, no.<eos> Lying to you this morning.<eos> I told you I thought that working the case would be the best thing for you, but, you know, the truth is...
She's, uh, she's conscious.<eos> Talking a little, sleeping a lot.<eos> It's gonna be a long road, but it looks good.<eos> Doctors are running some tests, so I figured I'd give them some space.<eos> Look, I just came by to say thanks, for being my eyes and ears the last few days.<eos> And to let you know that I'm... I'm gonna talk to someone.<eos> About all this stuff that came up, that I obviously hadn't been dealing with.<eos> I'm not sure who, but I'm asking around.<eos> I don't presume to know the details of what your father did to you and your family. But, um, I-I've seen enough parental abuse to know that one thing's always the same.<eos> When someone whose job it is to nurture you hurts you instead, it-it can't help but have a profound and-and lasting effect on your sense of who you are.
She gets that, okay, the person feels that way, but it's not real.<eos> What is being a woman?<eos> My mom, for example, says it is giving birth.<eos> I asked her why andshesaidthat'swhereshefelt closest to an idea of being a woman.<eos> It was her biggest accomplishment, existentially.<eos> -But that would leave you out.<eos> -Yes, it leaves me out.<eos> I have no illusions about that.<eos> She doesn't think I'm a woman.<eos> But how do you think she sees you?
I gave up my homosexuality for much less.<eos> My desire for men was something so shocking to me that it, probably, made me want to be a woman.<eos> I instantly wanted to be a woman.<eos> I think this is a sort of transgender desire I had in my teenage years.<eos> I recognize that as something that happened.<eos> It's true.<eos> I don't know if it's the same thing that happened 50 years later, or 40 years later.<eos> I think that people change their motivations too.<eos> But this certainly happened to me when I was 17.<eos> But you say that homosexuality frightened you so much that in the end, you...
LOVE. n. A feeling that drives souls towards what seems beautiful, true and fair to them, constituting the object of our affection.<eos> MAYBE GOOGLE IT?<eos> I still haven't had the experience of being desired by a man in a way that is similar, or in a way... mixed with how he would desire a woman.<eos> Have you fallen in love?<eos> I am not sure.<eos> I am not sure if I fell in love and wanted a relationship, or if the idea of having one...<eos> This is a powerful thing about love too.<eos> There is a country called Love.<eos> And sometimes you see yourself inside of it and you don't know who you're with very well.<eos> You don't even know who is accompanying you, but the country is beautiful, it's interesting, there is beautiful scenery, there are moments.
Especially by you, Star-Lord.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I think she'd wanna know.<eos> About the Symbiote-infested comet you're chasing?<eos> I assure you, we have that situation well in hand.<eos> The comet will be destroyed as soon as it is within range.<eos> We already tried that.<eos> If you blow up the comet, it'll just rain down Symbiotes all over Spartax.<eos> No offense, but the Spartax Imperial Fleet is far more sophisticated than a single derelict ship manned by a ragtag band of pseudo-pirates.<eos> Why do people always say "no offense" right before they offend you?
So how do you save an empire with no one else on the ship?<eos> By deliberately smashing this ship into the comet.<eos> - Why are you still aboard?<eos> - I'm sorry. I thought you just said, "Smash this ship into the comet."<eos> Wait. You're really gonna smash this ship into the comet?<eos> Vicky, do not smash the ship into the comet.<eos> You were right, Peter.<eos> Blowing it up won't work. But the fuel on this ship should bring enough massive heat to incinerate every last Symbiote on that comet.<eos> What about the part where we incinerate with it?<eos> Why do you think I ordered you to abandon ship?
Past experience.<eos> This stupid plan of yours better work, Quill!<eos> Why does nobody trust my plan?<eos> Yes!<eos> Told ya!<eos> Now let's get off this rock.<eos> Aw, krutack.<eos> Excellent.<eos> We've upgraded from being a flaming inferno to being covered with Symbiotes!<eos> No wonder Father left you with pirates.
I've got a seal's willy bone!<eos> - Jonjo...<eos> - Is it a boy monster or a girl? Ssh.<eos> I heard something.<eos> Oh, is it the Feds?<eos> Why did you let me drink so much?<eos> You're off tomorrow. Relax.<eos> - Do you think Leighton fancies you?<eos> - Leighton?<eos> Do you not see the way he looks at you?
Apology accepted.<eos> Your plane ticket arrived. I printed it.<eos> Cheers, big ears.<eos> Evie.<eos> The heart on the shore, could Jonjo or Kieran have put it there without you seeing?<eos> For a second I thought you were going to say something nice.<eos> You realize that if we don't catch the killer, you can forget about Australia?<eos> - Are you joking?<eos> - No.<eos> D.C.I. Quigley released you on condition that you stay in the area.
Willa had put Mr. Rabbit out there, knowing that the ice was thin.<eos> That... even if she was watching, she wouldn't pull me out.<eos> That she hated me.<eos> Now I know why.<eos> I remember when you came home from the hospital, Wave.<eos> I picked out your name myself.<eos> You know they wanted to call you Welcome?<eos> Welcome Earp, think about that!<eos> God, I tried so hard, but nobody ever celebrated my birthday, or... ordered copies of my school photos, ...noticed my report cards.<eos> Mama used to call you her angel.
God, I tried so hard, but nobody ever celebrated my birthday, or... ordered copies of my school photos, ...noticed my report cards.<eos> Mama used to call you her angel.<eos> Mama left.<eos> And Daddy wouldn't even look at me.<eos> I don't know. Maybe because I wasn't his.<eos> I didn't realize how hard it was for you. But it doesn't mean you're not an Earp!<eos> Come on, or you're going to be late for your appointment.<eos> Waverly!<eos> - What?<eos> Who did pull you out... of the ice?
If you'd rescued Doc, everything might have been different, Bobo.<eos> Bobo?<eos> Why are you calling me that?<eos> My name is Robert.<eos> Bobo will be your name.<eos> When you're resurrected from Hell.<eos> As a demon.<eos> Peacemaker!<eos> I know that gun.<eos> It's the one that killed you.
Okay.<eos> Do you want a tea, coffee?<eos> Kettle's just boiled.<eos> Let's just keep it formal.<eos> Y-Yeah, sure.<eos> You know this has to be daily until we catch... Of course.<eos> It's a bit early for that, isn't it?<eos> That was last night.<eos> Leighton...<eos> What's happening in this town is bound to remind you of...
How did women used to do this?<eos> I can't believe we're driving slowly past Eric's house.<eos> I must be insane.<eos> You know what?<eos> This is stupid.<eos> Sir, can you please turn around?<eos> Sir, can you please ignore everything my friend just said? Mm-hmm.<eos> You're getting closure.<eos> Yes, and we're on a bridge.<eos> This is gonna be really good for you.
he didn't mean the weekend.<eos> He meant all of it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Really?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not fine.<eos> I was never taught how to handle this kind of stuff.<eos> I mean, between three brothers and no mom,<eos> I didn't exactly get the instruction manual on how to deal with it when the guy you love leaves you alone in a train station on your birthday, so...
They could send her to jail forever, or worse, and it is completely my fault.<eos> Hey, it is not your fault. Yes, it is.<eos> I gave her the vibrators.<eos> It was my idea to smuggle them in, all because I...<eos> I just... I... I need to fix this.<eos> No, what you need to do right now is just scream.<eos> When I was a kid in Colorado, I used to just hike up to the mountains and scream.<eos> Just let it out.<eos> Well, that is a beautiful story, Jane, but unfortunately, this is not Colorado.<eos> This is New York City, and there is literally nowhere in this entire city where people aren't always on top of you!
I got to go. You know what?<eos> If she wants to go through this alone, let her.<eos> Hello, Jane. Jacqueline.<eos> I'm so sorry, I didn't realize you were in here.<eos> I'll get out of your way.<eos> I just wasn't feeling these shoes sent over for the gala, but it seems like you need this closet a lot more than I do.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Uh, don't wear shoes you don't like because of me.<eos> Just forget I was here. Jane.<eos> What is going on with you? Um, nothing.
I mean, my friend was able to put some pressure on, let 'em know that we're watching, but Adena's the one who refused to sign that paper.<eos> She's a brave girl. Yeah.<eos> And I know that not sending that tweet was not easy.<eos> But it was the right thing to do... this time.<eos> But not always.<eos> Adena's a brave girl.<eos> But so are you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So I read your article.<eos> Let's see, "How To Get Over It" "When the Guy You Love Leaves You Standing in a Train Station."
Wait. Aren't these the pliers that we use to open the closet?<eos> No, no, those are the pliers that we use to turn on the oven.<eos> Yeah. Rae, I think we have a problem.<eos> You're right. I need to buy more pliers.<eos> Why can't we just call the landlord?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Who am I?<eos> I live here!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Oh no, Chels, I just had a vision that the landlord saw you in our apartment.
Are you joking?<eos> Listen up, fun size.<eos> There's two things I don't joke about, and one of them's witches.<eos> What's the other thing?<eos> Who cares, yo?<eos> We're talkin' about witches!<eos> I have to get my drone.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Aaaaah! Tess, what are you doing?<eos> I came in here to keep you from being witched like all these other kids.
You comin', Nia?<eos> I'm just waiting for Tess.<eos> So?<eos> How'd it go when you told your ma you didn't wanna sleep on the couch anymore?<eos> - I didn't tell her.<eos> - You gotta say something!<eos> I'm not like you, Tess.<eos> I can't just say, "Yo, I got mad love for you, Ma, but I ain't about that couch life."<eos> Yo, I don't sound like that.<eos> I got mad love for you, Mia, but I ain't about that impression.
We didn't realize when we first met you that, prior to your career in television, you spent 15 years as a Texas Ranger.<eos> I assume it was that background that helped you win the job as host on Moving Targets.<eos> Before you put in your papers in Texas, one of your last assignments was to serve on the panel that chooses the gear for all of the state police, correct?<eos> It's public record.<eos> What's not public record, yet, is that while you were on that panel, the CEO of Alpha Hawk Industries, Clint Washburn, paid you hundreds of thousands of dollars to convince you to buy pistols from his company, - and his company alone.<eos> - You pocketed enough money to quit the Rangers and roll the dice at a TV career.<eos> But you knew that if the truth ever came out, you'd be looking at some serious prison time.<eos> We're guessing you found out about Vlasik's investigation into Alpha Hawk when you helped the producers vet her for the show.<eos> Are we right about that, or did you find out some other way?<eos> The saddest thing is, if you had known the U.S. Attorney's office was onto you, you might've let her live.
Yes, sir.<eos> We're less than 48 hours from the launch of the TXgas, which the Noah Objective promises will safely eliminate the mutated animals.<eos> Don't believe everything you hear on the news.<eos> Abigail.<eos> Something you need to see.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Blue Diaspora.<eos> You can't work on this out in the open.<eos> I can do what I like.<eos> The council forbade you from continuing your father's work.
- I'm so sorry.<eos> - You had her kidnapped!<eos> How does that even compute as right to you? !<eos> It's not.<eos> A parent has one job in this world, right?<eos> She was just doing hers.<eos> I kept telling myself that I did what any mother would do.<eos> I just wanted my son back.<eos> I'm so sorry, Clem.<eos> A few months ago, I would've punched you in the mouth and never talked to you again.
It's just outside the door.<eos> You owe me so many massages.<eos> The lock-picking worked!<eos> Thank you, YouTube!<eos> Should... should we have a safe word?<eos> Like if I say "tacos are tasty" send in the back-up?<eos> Sure.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Hey, remember, you're there to drop off your bartender application, but you got lost.<eos> Anyone finds you, just smile and play dumb, got it?
Let's go.<eos> I can't.<eos> And neither can you.<eos> Super.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> Next time, book a spa day.<eos> You blew my cover.<eos> There were gunshots.<eos> Like I was gonna hang in the van.<eos> Lucado called you in? !
Likes to speak in riddles, more sass than sense.<eos> Yeah, he had a nice truck though.<eos> He also said that something's been broken?<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Your phone's blowing up.<eos> _<eos> And I thought that pizza sucked.<eos> Tucker Gardner, how can I help you?<eos> My sisters. Acting weird.<eos> Well... I mean, I'd take the weird because they saved you from being charged.
Where was the bus when you first saw it?<eos> I didn't see a bus.<eos> Clay was looking at me.<eos> He looked...<eos> He looked at me and then he...<eos> Did the driver make any attempt to stop?<eos> - I mean, did you hear brakes?<eos> - No, no.<eos> He stepped right in front of it and was hit. Thanks, Janet.<eos> We'll keep you in the loop.
Well, the Devils were part of a chain of betting spikes.<eos> They're suspected of match fixing.<eos> A man with powerful criminal connections is associated with the club.<eos> Pax Car Rentals have invested huge money in them staying in the top four.<eos> So, in that environment, it's entirely possible players like Tyler were doping.<eos> Well, that's ASADA's problem, not ours.<eos> No, it is ours. If Tyler was taking something, the whole team could have too, which means someone is cheating on a massive scale.<eos> Oh, that's a long bow, with your father clearly the target...<eos> Which falls clearly within our purview.<eos> And the events of this morning have in no way steered you towards this particular line of enquiry...
- Won't you, Em?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> And I wanted to run at Zone.<eos> Well, maybe it'll be better by zone.<eos> Anyway, it doesn't matter if...<eos> Ah, Liam, that's enough screen time for tonight, all right?<eos> Bianca.<eos> Yeah, I'm with the kids.<eos> Yeah, he's all right.<eos> Thanks. Look, can I call you back?
'Cause I'm telling you I'm not going to tell anyone.<eos> You gotta trust me, though, right?<eos> What's that face for?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Kill me?<eos> No. No, mate, I'm not gonna kill ya.<eos> I mean, the last thing we want's a murder investigation on our hands.<eos> Who needs that kind of hassle?<eos> But, Clay, you've been under a lot of pressure lately.<eos> I mean, all that guilt over Oliver, it must be really eating you up, mate.
Well, whatever the reason, it's great to be talking now.<eos> You still haven't arranged for me to meet the twins.<eos> I'd love to get to know them properly.<eos> I mean, what are they into?<eos> What do they like doing?<eos> Well, they're very keen on athletics.<eos> You'll be happy to know that Emma's got the zone trials this Thursday, and Liam would have been there, but he hurt his ankle, so...<eos> Sports stars in the making?<eos> Well they didn't get that from you.<eos> I'm free to meet them whenever it suits you.
Call me.<eos> You've got my number.<eos> The NCC must be looking at my phone records.<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> You!<eos> You bloody told me you'd get the charges thrown out!<eos> Actually, my precise words were,<eos> "I will do my best to have them thrown out."<eos> And I could do much better if I had your full and frank cooperation. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Rhys and Dale told you what they saw.
Ask when that was.<eos> Did you ever hear him discuss betting tips with anyone?<eos> Only the entire team.<eos> Those boys'd bet on anything.<eos> What about the sponsorship money from Continuum?<eos> Where did that go?<eos> Go back to the contract. It's important.<eos> Any idea?<eos> That's important.<eos> Has Janet ever talked about her father with you?
So, are we running the same race?<eos> I'd need a copy of Nate's contract with the Devils.<eos> Why?<eos> Secret NCC business.<eos> I don't suppose there's any point me arguing client confidentiality.<eos> Not when I can get a subpoena.<eos> Come on - let's not faff around, alright?<eos> I help you if you...<eos> I'll have it sent over.<eos> Is this the address Richard gave you? Yep.
How's that fair?<eos> It's a common strategy.<eos> It helps prevent the accused person from potentially incriminating themselves.<eos> So, it protects him?<eos> Well, we call it a right to silence.<eos> A right to...<eos> He was arrested.<eos> How does he have any rights at all?<eos> We, the prosecution, have to make our case against him.<eos> We have to prove he did these things to you.

I'm sorry.<eos> No, it had to be that Hook Up thing.<eos> There's no other grounds for acquittal.<eos> Don't forget, we've still got Flynn's connection to the Oxycodone we found at Clay's house. We can use that to shake him up a bit.<eos> Yeah, but a guilty verdict would have made our life so much easier.<eos> What do you mean, made your life easier?<eos> Bianca, I've got to go.<eos> You put me through all this shit for something to do with your work?<eos> The NCC does have an interest in Flynn over another matter.<eos> Look, but first and foremost, I wanted to see him convicted because what he did to you was wrong.
Actually, you know what? You're right. Yeah, it's me.<eos> And what did you do after that?<eos> Went to a mate's barbecue. Well, he needed gas.<eos> I certainly didn't burn down any houses.<eos> This isn't helping you, Mr Foster.<eos> The only way you'll help yourself is to cooperate, otherwise I will keep you locked up, indefinitely.<eos> Who ordered you to threaten Clay Nelson's child?<eos> Induce Mr Nelson to suicide?<eos> But, Clay, you've been under a lot of pressure lately.<eos> I mean, all that guilt over Oliver, it must be really eating you up, mate.
- Fold.<eos> - Yeah, man.<eos> Actually boys, grab a drink or something.<eos> I'm done. I'm gonna take a break.<eos> Hey, Richie?<eos> You fold pretty easily, don't ya?<eos> Haven't seen you bluff once.<eos> I don't have the face for it.<eos> You don't play at all, do you?<eos> And, yet, when I called you, you made it sound like you played all the time.
I'm trying to perform a beautiful act over here.<eos> We know this planet.<eos> We've been hiding in these tunnels for eons.<eos> You'll need us to help you get around.<eos> Besides, us off colors stick together.<eos> We'll get to Earth another way.<eos> We'll find an alternate route.<eos> But you've got to go back.<eos> But it doesn't feel right to just leave you here.<eos> You said yourself that everyone on this planet is out to get you.
The-The man of whom I speak, he was, he was not an addict, but he was attempting a recovery of sorts.<eos> In many respects, he just didn't try hard enough.<eos> It just, it-it reminded me that, uh, that I need to try harder.<eos> Would anyone else like to share? Hi.<eos> My name is Taylor, and I'm an addict.<eos> Hi, Taylor.<eos> Sherlock?<eos> I'm sorry about your friend.<eos> Thank you, but he wasn't my friend.<eos> Well, the thing is, I've known you a good deal longer than that lot.
What's that?<eos> You're selling out one of your people to tie this thing off.<eos> You think that Tall Boy's gonna take the fall, and we'll take the win, and we'll stop looking deeper. But you're wrong, because Shinwell is dead because of you.<eos> And we're not gonna stop until you're behind bars.<eos> That's all right, that's all right, fellas.<eos> Just 'cause she wants to get hostile doesn't mean that we have to.<eos> I think it's time for y'all to go.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> I'm Joan Watson.<eos> I work with the detectives who brought you in here.
I work with the detectives who brought you in here.<eos> I was friends with Shinwell.<eos> You're here because earlier tonight, a switchblade was found that was consistent with the type that was used to kill him.<eos> It had your fingerprints and traces of his blood on it.<eos> We know that you killed him.<eos> I'm talking to you because I think that's what he would've wanted.<eos> A long time ago, SBK had him kill a friend, too.<eos> He never got over it.<eos> The pain that you're feeling right now? I don't think he would've wanted that for you.<eos> In fact, if he were still here, I think he would forgive you.
Excuse me.<eos> You're... shrugging.<eos> We just paid you $5,000 and you're shrugging.<eos> I'm shrugging at what she said.<eos> Except it's not a question. It's a fact.<eos> What? What did I say?<eos> "You don't plant drugs at your competitor's sister's house if you don't want to make noise"?<eos> But the drugs they found at Cecilia's have already been traced back to the Silens.<eos> Okay, now I'm shrugging.<eos> When you trace a stolen item, it doesn't necessarily take you to the thief.

Yeah.<eos> You should have Gary sign those.<eos> There she is, buddy.<eos> Go get her.<eos> Mom!<eos> Peter?<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> I'm glad you made the call.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Told you I'd take care of you, sis.
What about when you see her?<eos> It's time to go, ladies.<eos> Ready when you are.<eos> Still... not a lady.<eos> I'll keep that in mind, Princess.<eos> Beautiful day for immunizations, don't you think?<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm not here for vitamins and vaccines.<eos> We don't have supplies for that.<eos> I might've slipped some into the Humvee.<eos> Just 'cause people tell you what to do doesn't mean you gotta do it.
I finally think, fingers crossed,<eos> I've figured out the answer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look...<eos> I made these apologies before...<eos> - Annie, you don't have to.<eos> - No, I-I do.<eos> You don't have to apologize.<eos> No, I really do, because this time, it's real and honest.<eos> I hated you because T.C. loved you.
Do you know how many of these cases I've seen?<eos> It's so frustrating.<eos> It's always one step forward, two steps back.<eos> It never ends.<eos> And these families don't have clean water.<eos> And without infrastructure and education...<eos> So in your mind, we shouldn't have saved him?<eos> You're insufferable.<eos> Are you like this with everybody?<eos> No wonder they kicked you out of Texas.
Clean-up day? Yeah!<eos> Toilets!<eos> It's my... it's my place.<eos> If I want it clean, we're gonna clean.<eos> Shukran.<eos> Ask her what she told them.<eos> What was it?<eos> The truth.<eos> - What does that mean? - I don't know.<eos> This is what I was warning you about.
- Buy whatever you want.<eos> - What's this?<eos> A little something from the Avendaños.<eos> I don't get you.<eos> Those two are ready.<eos> You have enough money, but you go and do this. Trying to fuck with the Avendaños.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They know nothing about this.<eos> Stop complaining and help me. Put the money in the bag.<eos> You want revenge because they belittled you.
Later, when they stop playing.<eos> Need a hand?<eos> Asshole.<eos> For you.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello?<eos> Congrats, Chapito.<eos> - Ramón?<eos> - Yes, who else?<eos> Benjamín told me to invite you to Ismael's birthday party.
Nobody move!<eos> We just want to talk.<eos> Your boss is in jail, yes or no?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> - And you want to keep working?<eos> Shh.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Stay on the losing side and keep working for Miguel Ángel, or come work for me on the winning side.<eos> I'm sorry, boss, but I can't ditch Miguel Ángel that easily.<eos> - Are you afraid he'll kill you?
Do you?<eos> Why are you afraid to ask them for it?<eos> Anything you discover is protected under attorney-client privilege.<eos> Are you afraid of what you're going to discover?<eos> I like to know who I'm working for.<eos> Well, I know who you're working for.<eos> You're working for me.<eos> And here's what you need to know: I like to win.<eos> And I don't sense you're helping me to do that right now.<eos> Well, finding out what's really going on here isn't gonna stop you from winning.
We have a right to privacy;<eos> It's in the Constitution, Bull.<eos> There's nothing in the Constitution that says if you know who killed someone, you have a right to keep that to yourself.<eos> I hate it when Mom and Dad fight.<eos> Really?<eos> That's what you think this is about?<eos> Some higher principle that puts your client above the greater good?<eos> Well, I'm sorry, neither of those guys reminds me of Thomas Jefferson.<eos> Really?<eos> And who appointed you to the court, Mr. Bull?
There's nothing about them on the Internet.<eos> They have cameras out front and a handprint reader, so it's not like I can just walk inside, you know?<eos> Sounds serious.<eos> You know those little transmitters that you stick on Bull in court so Marissa can hear him?<eos> Bingo.<eos> I want my coat back.<eos> I make no promises.<eos> Thanks for dinner.<eos> Well, I think we did all we could jury wise.<eos> So what turned you around?
I think...<eos> I was just upset.<eos> I was mad at Heptex 'cause they wouldn't help figure out who hurt my friend, and I was mad at you for helping Heptex.<eos> And then Marissa explained to me that you were mad at Heptex, too.<eos> You were frustrated.<eos> You wanted to get to the bottom of it, and the only way to do that was to see what was on the server.<eos> She have any luck yet?<eos> Not the last time I checked.<eos> Would you like me to go to the office?<eos> Maybe take over while she helps you out here?
I don't think you're a dick.<eos> Some people do, but not Steve! No!<eos> Steve, it's not for me, it's for my dad!<eos> Oh. Yeahhh, him.<eos> He is a dick... No, I built it!<eos> It's for... I was...<eos> Wait a minute...<eos> People think I'm a dick?<eos> Who thinks I'm a dick?<eos> Oh, just, you know, some people because if your parents loved you more, we'd be going home right now.
He's gonna run this town someday.<eos> Pshhh, ain't no thang but a G-strang.<eos> Welcome to the butt cracks of the business.<eos> You know all about that, don't you, big dog?<eos> Hit me.<eos> Anyway, listen.<eos> I don't have a lot of time.<eos> Me, LeBron, and Dwyane... We got laser tag right after this, so...<eos> Pack?<eos> Baby boy, let me talk to you for a minute.
Okay.<eos> Here comes the boob.<eos> Here comes the boobie.<eos> Oh, come on, work with me here.<eos> How's it going back there, Erica?<eos> Super awesome.<eos> You know what they say, always wait till your baby's 12 hours old before racing away from a nuclear dust cloud.<eos> What's a nuclear dust cloud?<eos> It's a, it's a ska band I used to listen to back in the '90s.<eos> It's a poisonous cloud that gives you cancer and slowly kills you.
I mean... you didn't sign up for all this.<eos> It's not like you did either.<eos> But I don't have a choice.<eos> These voices are in my head whether I want them or not.<eos> True.<eos> Though, when I think back, I don't remember being given a choice either... when this nerdy girl walked into City Lights... and this voice in my head was telling me, "Whatever you do... do not let her go until you get her number."<eos> What?<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> We all wake up and we have to take the same Terms and Conditions box:<eos> Everyday stuff will happen to you.
Are you okay?<eos> Kala, just listen.<eos> I need you to do something for me, and I know this will be difficult because I need you to do it without asking a lot of questions, which I'm telling you right now that I cannot answer.<eos> I have not told you about lots of things that are going on because I have been trying to protect you... and maybe, selfishly, our marriage.<eos> I did not go to Bangalore.<eos> I was in Delhi.<eos> I have been cooperating with Agent Singh and the federal police on a complex investigation into political corruption.<eos> Ajay is a part of that investigation.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I cannot tell you more because it will only put you at risk.
Why is that interesting?<eos> Because both of the men in your life are connected to criminals.<eos> What does that say about you?<eos> I'm sure it speaks volumes about my poor choices, my own dishonesty, indecency, and general lack of good character.<eos> When you put it like that, it sounds very sexy.<eos> Mnh-mnh. No, I...<eos> Why?<eos> Because right now I need something.<eos> I need to know something... before I get any more confused.<eos> And every time I kiss you, I'm always left even more confused than I ever was.
Welcome home, sexy.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Is she with you?<eos> Isn't that just too perfect?<eos> It's her.<eos> [Lila] I warned you, Wolfgang.<eos> There are only two sides in this world: with me or against me.<eos> Imagine my surprise when I found out how badly the Cannibal wanted you.
Get off!<eos> You coming up?<eos> 'Come into the other room with me.<eos> 'Why?<eos> 'I want to talk to you about something.'<eos> Can't you talk to me here?<eos> I want to talk to you in private.<eos> When are you going to let me have sex with you?<eos> I'm not.<eos> All the things I've given you.
No.<eos> Look...<eos> You're my bitch now... ..and if you cross me... ..I'll kill you.<eos> There's someone in.<eos> It's Amber.<eos> He stinks, doesn't he?<eos> Like curry.<eos> He's not as bad as Chef, though, he's hanging, he is.<eos> He's always got food in his teeth.<eos> Don't let them kiss you.
Get off me!<eos> Call Daddy!<eos> Right.<eos> Interview concluded at 10.48pm.<eos> You'll get a court summons for the criminal damage charge through the post.<eos> He raped me.<eos> What?<eos> Who did?<eos> The delivery driver.<eos> Where did he do that to you, Holly?
When did this happen?<eos> Friday.<eos> And then you went home?<eos> No.<eos> I was staying with mates.<eos> The car park?<eos> You were saying something about a car park?<eos> That were today.<eos> You're going to need to help me.<eos> You're saying someone's raped you on Friday, you stayed the night with a pal, and then the same man's raped you again the next day?
You're raped once. You don't walk back into it, do you?<eos> You don't go back for more, do you?<eos> These are the clothes the police wanted.<eos> Do you understand what you've come to talk to me about today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> OK, and what do YOU think that's about?<eos> About...what happened at... ..with the men at Top Curry.<eos> About what happened with the men at Top Curry.<eos> OK.<eos> Obviously, I've got to ask you some questions about what they actually did to you during the sex, OK?
'That fucking little witch, your friend.<eos> 'You tell her I'm coming for her.<eos> 'You better tell her I'm coming to her house now, 'and I'm going to drag her out of there and I'm going to kill her.'<eos> You can't stay here.<eos> You can't.<eos> He says he's going to rape your sisters and burn your house down.<eos> Come on, Holly.<eos> We need to sort it.<eos> We're going to sort it.<eos> If you tell the cops you made it up, they'll drop the charges and he'll leave you alone.
Ah, do you know, it's like one of them Magic Eye posters.<eos> Me and you, we're looking at the same thing, but where I am seeing kids being turned inside out by abusers, all you lot are seeing is slags who bring it on themselves.<eos> OK, Holly.<eos> Holly, I want you to go to the police.<eos> No way.<eos> Let's stop this.<eos> You and me.<eos> Now.<eos> I'm not going to the police.<eos> Cos you're scared of what they said they might do to you?
This programme contains strong language from the start, and scenes which some viewers may find disturbing.<eos> Right, Holly.<eos> Shall we start again?<eos> From the beginning.<eos> 'At me mates', there's no-one standing at the window 'waiting to kick off.'<eos> If you like it so much, why don't you go live there, then? !<eos> When are you going to let me have sex with you? No...<eos> No...<eos> 'Don't let them kiss you.' Get off me!
His DNA's all over your knickers...<eos> ..and there's an "unrealistic prospect of conviction".<eos> Mum?<eos> What about all the interviews I did, and picking 'em out of a line-up?<eos> It wasn't the police, Holly. It was CPS.<eos> Why?<eos> I told the truth.<eos> I told 'em everything.<eos> I know.<eos> They didn't think a jury would believe you.
Hello, can you hear me?<eos> 'What do you want?<eos> Look, I told you...'<eos> Yep, I know you did. And I'm not surprised, because if I were you and a copper 'came round to my door, I'd want to hose them off the pavement.<eos> But... 'I'd like another chance to talk to you.'<eos> What happened to your girls is a disgrace.<eos> What we LET happen.<eos> But we've got a chance to put it right.<eos> Ring me next week.<eos> Who's ringing you next week?
We can apply for guardianship of her.<eos> Me and your mum.<eos> If you want that.<eos> I don't know why I did it.<eos> I don't...<eos> Sara came to see you.<eos> Sounds like the coppers, this time round, they're night and day from the other lot.<eos> You don't have to have anything to do with 'em, but if you want to carry on with this... ..your mum and me, we... we'll be right behind you.<eos> Come on, Ruby.<eos> They pass you round like a ball.

Holly, you're the first witness for the Crown, so you'll be called first.<eos> So, depending on what gets done today, in all likelihood you'll be going in to start giving your evidence tomorrow.<eos> We'll need to phone Suzanne.<eos> Who's Suzanne?<eos> I have to do stuff. Go to AA meetings and that to get Ella back.<eos> They write it down if you miss one.<eos> You're not going to see any of them.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> It'll all be by video link and you're just going to carry on doing what you've been doing for years.<eos> And those 12 ordinary men and women are going to believe you.
Is it?<eos> Is it a big story? Or does it just seem that way because there's so much reporting on it?<eos> You must admit, it's a gift for the BNP and all that lot out there.<eos> "Innocent white victims", "dark-skinned abusers".<eos> It's uncomfortable, isn't it?<eos> I just don't see what it achieves.<eos> She's here.<eos> Ignore them, ignore them, ignore them and ignore them.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> They need to hear you, but they don't need to see you.
Take a seat.<eos> They need to hear you, but they don't need to see you.<eos> Would you like a curtain?<eos> No.<eos> Hello, Holly.<eos> Can you see and hear me?<eos> Yes.<eos> OK, that's a good start.<eos> The usher should help you to swear an oath.<eos> Has that been explained to you?
Yeah.<eos> "I swear, by Almighty God, that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth."<eos> Members of the jury, the prosecution will now present its evidence in chief, which takes the form of recorded interviews with the witness, Holly Winshaw.<eos> Now do you understand what it is that you've come to speak to me about today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> OK, and what do you think that's about?<eos> About what happened at, um withthe menat Top Curry.<eos> About what happened with the men at Top Curry.<eos> OK.<eos> Obviously, I've got to ask you some questions about what they actually did to you during the sex, OK?
It's just going to make you angry.<eos> It'll upset you, and that'll upset her.<eos> No, it won't.<eos> I don't care if they've decided I'm not a good enough, like, victim or whatever.<eos> Cos I'm a good mum.<eos> I'm actually good.<eos> And that's where my head's going. Not on all this that happened years ago.<eos> All rise.<eos> Go on, Ruby.<eos> They pass you around like a ball.

Coming here?<eos> Now.<eos> Didn't return me calls. Didn't reply to me texts. You promised all sorts.<eos> Should've known never to trust the police.<eos> I'm not the police.<eos> Then why you turning up here, then?<eos> Cos no-one can tell me not to.<eos> I've left GMP.<eos> I've resigned.<eos> I, um I I don't know what the police told you about why you didn't get to go to court.
I've left GMP.<eos> I've resigned.<eos> I, um I I don't know what the police told you about why you didn't get to go to court.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't give a shit about that now.<eos> They didn't say nothing.<eos> Justthey're using Ruby, but they're not using her.<eos> That decision, I strongly disagreed with it.<eos> But I got taken off the job after that and ordered not to have any contact with you.<eos> But at some point, the powers that be decided that though they weren't going to call you as a witness, they still needed to be able to use your evidence.

Not cos of owt I've done to her, just cos of me.<eos> Who I am.<eos> What's happened to me.<eos> And they never could.<eos> But now, I've been named as a fucking sex offender, I have got no chance.<eos> Well, that's not going to happen.<eos> First thing tomorrow, you're going to go and get a solicitor.<eos> And I'm going to come with you.<eos> Why do you care? Why are you even here?<eos> Because I let you down.

He called me this afternoon.<eos> He said that he had Shinwell killed because he found my number in his phone.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Are you?<eos> You said that you would come with me.<eos> I forgot.<eos> You forgot? You.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You can remember what you had for lunch on your fifth birthday, you can remember how many stars there were in the sky that night, but you can't remember to come to a memorial service for a friend that I cared about?<eos> You didn't go because you didn't want to, because Shinwell hurt you, and you just don't have it in you to get over something like that.
Well, I believe it is a rattle.<eos> For the baby.<eos> They shake things.<eos> God, it's gonna have hands.<eos> Yes.<eos> Two of them.<eos> And I thought that is why you brought me here, to talk about the plan for the baby?<eos> No.<eos> No. But soon.<eos> Those goddamned Widows nearly killed you just a day ago.

There will be more.
Right.<eos> Maybe I should get us some towels.<eos> They're like, - an inch thick.<eos> - Waverly.<eos> Well... this feels weird!<eos> OK, what if the Widows come back?<eos> What if... what if we find the third seal and I'm not there to help?<eos> Is this your thing? Cute but annoying?<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know, I'll leave you alone.
This is the vapour guard I've been working on.<eos> You know, with it I can...<eos> Shitcrumbs.<eos> Dude, next time I say stay in the truck,<eos> - Go ahead and shoot me!<eos> - Come on!<eos> What are you so afraid of?<eos> Damn it, woman, I just told you to shoot me.<eos> Doc, listen to me!<eos> If I don't break the seal, the Widows will find it and they will kill you anyway.
Lobito!<eos> Lobito!<eos> Lobito...<eos> You're okay. - You're okay...<eos> - Are you okay, fucker?<eos> Come on.<eos> Give me a hand.<eos> - Can you stand? - Easy, easy.<eos> I can do it!<eos> - Did they hurt you, fucker?
You're right, I can do this.<eos> I just need to make a list, a long list.<eos> What comes first?<eos> First, you breathe.<eos> My sheets are dry.<eos> Please let them be white again!<eos> I never should've gotten behind the wheel...<eos> I should've stopped for the night, but it was three o'clock in the morning, I just...<eos> You know, I just lost focus for just a second.<eos> Well they're charging you with Gross Negligence because you were behind the wheel, and you were responsible for all of them.
What was that for?<eos> I've made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life, but being with you is the best decision I ever made.<eos> And that's why I made it twice.<eos> Abby!<eos> Abby!<eos> Abby!<eos> Jess, what're you doing?<eos> You hate running...<eos> Looking for you!<eos> What is wrong with you?
You wanna know what I'm doing all day?<eos> I'm being dead! I can show you what being dead's like!<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I got old. What's it look like happened?<eos> Apparently, you wanted to see me this way, so.<eos> - Look, I gotta go soon, but, um...<eos> Because this is the last time you're gonna see me.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> You've been standing on a beach in Florida for 21 years... looking out at the ocean.<eos> I watch you every day, and I see your family there behind the dunes and they're calling your name.
OK, you are kicking ass at not helping right now. Just so you know.<eos> Grownups or not, I'll be here when you tell him.<eos> OK?<eos> Full support.<eos> - Hi!<eos> Henry!<eos> - Yeah, gotta go.<eos> - Yeah, I should go too.<eos> I... No, we should... we should talk.<eos> I never thanked you for your note.
- We're at...<eos> OK, yeah, I guess I deserved that.<eos> Hello?<eos> You did not just hang up on me.<eos> Next time, this... means don't tell my sister we're at a sleazy knocker locker. It's Waverly, OK?<eos> You know me, you know how I am;<eos> See? This is what you get when you're friends with a narc.<eos> I guess I deserved that too.<eos> I did drag you into this shit storm.<eos> And I... I'm gonna drag you out just as soon as I get that saliva sample, but you have got to jet.
Body armour, and you couldn't have shared?<eos> Particularly as only you could touch them for some reason.<eos> Yeah, we share a likeness.<eos> We're both marshals.<eos> Boom.<eos> I've oft brought calamity onto others, on that you are correct, but believe me,<eos> I do not always get what I want!<eos> Well, you are the father.<eos> Because we need you to be a father.<eos> Those marshals found you after all this time;
- That way nobody gets hurt.<eos> - Nicole got hurt!<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Nicole was bitten because of me, Wynonna.<eos> She saved me.<eos> And now, I I need some air.<eos> Mercedes bit her?<eos> The Widows bit Juan Carlo.<eos> He was already dying when he kidnapped you.
Hey, you alright?<eos> - You're shaking.<eos> - Yeah, just cold.<eos> What did the doctor say?<eos> They can't identify what bit her, but I ordered a tox screen.<eos> - What?<eos> But Dolls...<eos> - They want to induce a coma.<eos> Slow the venom's move through her system.<eos> But Nicole said that she won't go under until she sees you.
You're gonna be just fine.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Jeremy, is this everything you've got on the Widows?<eos> Yeah.<eos> OK. The effect of the poison was immediate. But, uh... she could still move.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My guess, it's the same toxin they spray as a paralyzing agent.<eos> But in that case, the poison is inhaled.<eos> Less concentrated. Different effect.<eos> You mean instead of freezing you in place, it kills you?
Smells like Doritos and feet.<eos> You been here all night?<eos> It's the heir!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. The bar is closed.<eos> Private game to which I was about to win big.<eos> I didn't know you were still hangin' with my mortal enemies.<eos> Oh, well, one of us is mortal and it ain't him.<eos> I wasn't expecting you to be cool about it, but the pouting is getting old.<eos> We are born to die.<eos> And once the seal I gave you serves its purpose... it will all be worth it.
You called it in, right?<eos> You were with her when it happened?<eos> Yeah... I found her.<eos> She'd already been bitten... or... something, I don't know.<eos> So, how did you guys meet?<eos> Rock climbing in Nevada.<eos> Not far from Vegas.<eos> - ...oh! - Yeah.<eos> We got married in a fever.<eos> Britney Live and a big win at the slot machines will do that to you.
Perhaps they'll bury you with your trophies.<eos> Now tell me where the seal is, and your death will be quick.<eos> We got no seals here.<eos> We got elk. We got pronghorn.<eos> We got plenty of loons.<eos> Or I can keep you alive for weeks.<eos> And in the most glorious pain.<eos> That sounds kind of kinky.<eos> Are you sure you're not the real Mercedes?<eos> Would it have killed you to add a little morphine to the mixture?
You are?<eos> Lord, please tell me there is a part of you that knows me.<eos> I know you're a criminal.<eos> A killer!<eos> You are not wrong, but believe me when I say I am done with that life.<eos> We need to find the Trophy and bring her back...<eos> Hey!<eos> Keep your hands up, Holliday.<eos> I'm afraid the stakes are too high, Xavier.<eos> Jeremy told you where I am?
I mean, look, isn't she gorgeous?<eos> Tell me how it is after going through menopause.<eos> Okay, ladies, let's go, we're starting with the cha-cha.<eos> Cha-cha, one, two, three.<eos> Cha-cha, one, two, three.<eos> One, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three.<eos> Okay, very good.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just summer in the valley.<eos> Why don't you go yourself?<eos> I just, um, if it's hitting you too strong... I know this, like, shoots out... maybe you can stand further down, like on the other side.
- Yeah, I got it.<eos> - Okay. - I'm not telling anyone.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because, you know, who cares?<eos> She's pulled her life together.<eos> - Oh... oh, crap.<eos> - What?<eos> I missed a call from Dr. Katzberg.<eos> My phone didn't even ring.<eos> Why is she calling you on a Saturday?
I'm starting to see why she went all butt all the time.<eos> She doesn't have a lot to work with on the top floor.<eos> - So?<eos> - So, if she's choosing porn as her profession and she doesn't have the boobs for it...<eos> - It's like a champion swimmer who's got strong legs and weak arms.<eos> They bank on the legs.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> Oh. Oh, this is a nice bag. This looks like a...<eos> I think I've seen this at Target, this bag.<eos> They just don't prepare you for this stuff in the parenting books.
I look normal... I'm disgusting.<eos> - Mike, tell her.<eos> - She's an animal.<eos> I just yelled in front of her granddaughter.<eos> - Jeez, my God...<eos> - Sorry, Diane.<eos> Melissa, I actually knew what you used to... do before.<eos> And I did not tell anybody.<eos> Yeah, it was annoying.<eos> I am so sorry that this is happening to you.
Awesome!<eos> Audition meal?<eos> Do you believe this?<eos> I have to try out for the same job I've had for two years!<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why can't you just tell Josh who you are and what happened?<eos> Because this stupid smart Harvard doctor won't let me!<eos> He said Josh has to remember everything by himself or it could cause a psychic meltdown.<eos> It's basic brain stuff, Sofia, basic brain stuff.<eos> Okay, okay, so you'll make your audition meal, he'll hire you and eventually he'll... get his memory back.
Actually, I don't know.<eos> Could you speak a little clearer?<eos> - Can you do me a favor?<eos> - Anything.<eos> Can you hit me over the head so I get amnesia so I can forget what Josh just told me, 'cause it was so hurtful!<eos> Oh, Gabi, it's gonna be okay. How?<eos> How's it gonna be okay?<eos> I mean, we have two options here.<eos> One, he doesn't remember me and it's over, or two, he will remember me, including that night on the couch where he was gonna tell me that he didn't love me.<eos> Or three, and don't forget about three, he remembers you, and was gonna tell you he does love you.
If I give you an assignment, you do it.<eos> Since I got here, I have had to take shit from Louis.<eos> And now you're asking me to waste my time and my ability on something like this.<eos> We can't have you setting a precedent that Alex's clients can run roughshod all over us.<eos> The only reason that you're pissed about this is your new honeysuckle friend canceled lunch on you for me.<eos> I can't let them get away with this without handing it off to the one lawyer I know who cares enough to see this thing through.<eos> If our firm is associated with that case, we lose a huge client.<eos> - I'm not working on it.<eos> Then you're gonna put that in writing and you're gonna deliver it to Alex's client.<eos> I was just wondering. Have you redone the assignment that Rachel gave you?
- Morning.<eos> - Harvey, I'm sort of busy, so if you're here to shoot the shit--<eos> I'm here to give you this.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - It's my way of saying thanks.<eos> - For what?<eos> - You know what.<eos> Harvey, I dropped the suit because you asked me to.<eos> You don't have to give me anything in return.<eos> Has anyone ever taught you how to be gracious?
I never thought I'd ever hear you say that.<eos> Well, Katrina told me that you said something once that I was afraid I'd never hear, and...<eos> It meant everything to me.<eos> And what's that?<eos> That you think I'm a great lawyer.<eos> And that you're proud of me.<eos> Rachel... I may not say it often enough.<eos> But I think it all the time.<eos> I love you, Dad.<eos> I love you too, baby.
Oh, yeah?<eos> What's my favorite movie? Mmm.<eos> Trick question.<eos> You don't have one.<eos> Now, good night.<eos> Well, when I was in middle school, what sport did I play?<eos> And why did I quit?<eos> Basketball.<eos> Ed Clark wanted you to try out because he thought it would help you be a team player, and even though you never wanted to go, you didn't quit.<eos> Until they kicked you off the team.
It's all Steve's!<eos> Oh. Hello!<eos> The Barracuda wants to see you.<eos> But I didn't... I didn't do anything.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, no!<eos> My fish, it's gonna get burned!<eos> It's been cooking for hours!<eos> I feel so badass right now.<eos> Great. Now step in the attack zone, like I showed you...
Should I have a spear, or...?<eos> No.<eos> Stupid question.<eos> Yeah, stupid.<eos> It's just that, if I don't have a spear, how do I kill the caiman?<eos> You don't.<eos> Oh, right, right, right.<eos> Then how does it die?<eos> When the caiman smells you, it will silently approach.<eos> And then I will stab this spear in its skull, hopefully before it tears you in half...
Rosa?<eos> What, you don't recognize me?<eos> We share a hot, sticky night together, and then you don't even bother to remember me?<eos> What?<eos> - You look...<eos> Different.<eos> Listen, you and I, we need to talk, okay?<eos> About what happened between us.<eos> Okay, let me just come right out and apologize.<eos> I feel really bad about how we hit you in the head, but I...
So, the clinic's just up here.<eos> Oh, I'm just so glad that there's no protestors waiting outside.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're lucky.<eos> Ahh, hello, welcome.<eos> I'm Dr. Florence.<eos> You're right on time.<eos> - You must be Rosa.<eos> - I know you.<eos> I held you hostage, in camp, with him.
That's exactly what... why I thought it was so funny.<eos> - It's insane.<eos> - Florence!<eos> Can I have a word with you, just the two of us?<eos> Yeah, just... just you and I?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, uh, hypothetically, if you were in a relationship with someone... - Hmm. - and you wanted<eos> How well do you know each other?<eos> Well, let's just say we're... having sex.<eos> You really expect us to believe that someone on this island who has met you is having sex with you?
I'm very busy.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Maybe seven.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, unfortunately, I don't have any real picnic food because we're stuck on a deserted island.<eos> So you wrote the word "cheese" on a rock?<eos> Fancy some wine?<eos> All right. Let's do this.<eos> Take your pants off.<eos> Uh, actually, um, I brought you here because I want us to talk.
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Okay. Face each other.<eos> Todd, look at Jess.<eos> Nope, in the eyes.<eos> In the eyes?<eos> Why would I...<eos> Wow. What is happening to us?<eos> I'm getting all... goose-pimply.<eos> Now, Jess, I'm guessing that little plank-board situation from before isn't exactly how you like to get down.<eos> So why don't you tell Todd exactly what you want him to do to you?
I'm getting all... goose-pimply.<eos> Now, Jess, I'm guessing that little plank-board situation from before isn't exactly how you like to get down.<eos> So why don't you tell Todd exactly what you want him to do to you?<eos> Like, with words, or...?<eos> Yeah, with words.<eos> Kiss... my neck.<eos> Your neck?<eos> I mean, okay.<eos> What's that sound?<eos> Am I hurting you?
Arlene, wh...<eos> Fred wanted to take away everything that you believed in.<eos> And I just couldn't let him do that.<eos> So you killed him.<eos> You found out where Peggy worked, and you threatened to cut her off if she didn't give you the nerve toxin.<eos> And when she refused, you killed her.<eos> Rudy is the love of my life.<eos> And I couldn't just stand by and watch him just swirl into madness again.<eos> I had to kill him.<eos> I lost you once, sweetheart, and I could not let Fred take you away from me again.
Anyone in the park?<eos> No, it was quiet.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, there was no-one around.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Mo?<eos> - This is all on yourself.<eos> Yeah, all right, Jesus.<eos> - Stop the kids crying, will you? - I said, "In a minute"!<eos> Who spoke to you today at the park?
There's a chopper that comes once a month from Turkey to deliver med supplies.<eos> We were supposed to fly out on it today.<eos> How do I know you won't betray me to the American army?<eos> That they won't waterboard me?<eos> We'll tell them you saved our lives.<eos> You give them intel on the Caliphate, you'll be safe.<eos> Promise.<eos> They'll pay you for the information.<eos> I mean, in three days you will be in London, 10,000 pounds in your pocket.<eos> Or you could, you know, bleed to death in some bombed out building, and your family will never even know what happened to you.
- That mean you're back?<eos> - I want to, but it's complicated, man.<eos> Not really.<eos> Just rip the Band-Aid off already.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Me and Jordan, Shannon, I mean, hell, even Topher's back.<eos> Topher's back? You're dreaming.<eos> Unh-unh, we talked to him today.<eos> He'll be here tomorrow.<eos> Your dad's met you more than halfway, Paul.
Need more fire power. He's pinned down.<eos> You're hit in the femoral artery.<eos> Think I don't know?<eos> Another inch, and my nards would've been ribbons.<eos> You lose your balls, you'd still be alive. This bleed may kill you.<eos> Okay, look, I gotta stop the bleeding.<eos> - This is gonna hurt, okay? - Just do what you gotta do.<eos> You sure?<eos> - Ready?<eos> Don't move. My knee's keeping you from bleeding out.
Hmm. Plus he saved T.C. and Topher in Afghanistan a year ago.<eos> So this is payback?<eos> Yeah, you can say that.<eos> What's with you and free soloing?<eos> Yeah, it seems a little crazy to me.<eos> The same as Martin.<eos> It, um, gives me peace.<eos> But you weren't in Fallujah.<eos> No.<eos> You know that friend I told you about that took that fall?
Yeah.<eos> I'm not gonna let you down like Kenny did.<eos> Well, it's a bit more complicated than that, but I'm glad someone's showing up.<eos> Go for it.<eos> You need to go for Cain before you melt those Lulus.<eos> Yeah, Jordan.<eos> He's cute and totally into you.<eos> Yeah, I'm done dating in the hospital.<eos> - Paul?<eos> What's up with you?
Then I should probably hold onto that, heh.<eos> I made you a pop-up book, so you'll remember all the fun things we did together.<eos> Wow, this is amazing! - Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This was the time you took us to the petting zoo, and Booker got his head stuck in a bucket.<eos> And this was the time you took us to the Natural History Museum and Booker got his head stuck in a dinosaur.<eos> And this was the time you took us to the state fair and Booker went to the bathroom - and got his head stuck in the...<eos> Everybody knows where I got my head stuck!<eos> Okay! You had your head stuck in a toilet?<eos> What's wrong with you, boy?
My solicitor says I'll get bail.<eos> When?<eos> He said it's only matter of time.<eos> The Garda can't do nothing to stop it.<eos> What did you have to chase her around for?<eos> Who?<eos> That Paula one.<eos> I knew it from the minute you saw her.<eos> I knew it.<eos> When are they going to let you back?
Sorry! - Jesus! Could you not just text me, or something?<eos> No-one does this - knocking-on-your-door stuff any more!<eos> - Sorry, I WAS texting.<eos> So, are you in big trouble?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Huge.<eos> Is it funny, or...?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Be a few months to the trial.<eos> No-one would blame you if, afterwards... ..you wanted to go away or something.
Mac?<eos> I'm sorry I shouted at your kids.<eos> They've been shouted at plenty of times.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - All right, Sean?<eos> James?<eos> James?<eos> There's a torch by your head.<eos> Don't kick around so much.<eos> That tube up your nose is keeping you alive.
She's brilliant, she's inspiring.<eos> Double back, just a reminder... she's got hooks for hands.<eos> But not Susie, not the rabbi.<eos> She doesn't see color.<eos> She doesn't even see hands.<eos> That's how amazing she is.<eos> I'm a...<eos> I'm a...<eos> I'm a very sexual person.<eos> You can always tell a sexual person because they, um, tell you as a segue to their next bit in their stand-up act.
But there was, like, a 9-year-old girl there with a little pink cardigan.<eos> And she had a huge...<eos> She had a sign, like, twice her size.<eos> And it said, uh, "Abortion is bloody murder."<eos> And the "bloody" was, like, in red paint, dripping down.<eos> And that was the first time I was like, "Oh, they had to go to, like,<eos> Michaels or Blick's or something and buy crafts.<eos> Hobby Lobby, probably."<eos> And she goes:<eos> "God hates you."
- You know I was seeing a psychiatrist last year, right?<eos> - Harvey, if this has to do with your well-being, I'm all ears, but as you know,<eos> I'm not a licensed practitioner of mental health services...<eos> - Louis, that's not it. Look, my psychiatrist is being sued.<eos> She has her own attorney, but I don't trust him, - and I want you to handle it.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> If you don't trust him, why aren't you taking it?<eos> - I told you, she's my therapist.<eos> - Yeah, was.<eos> That doesn't stop you from helping her with a legal issue.
- No, there's no problem.<eos> I just want to know if she came through.<eos> - Well, she stuck it to us on the fee a little, but other than that, yeah, she came through.<eos> - Was it worth it?<eos> - Let me put it this way, the article they wrote about Mike, it never would have existed without her.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - If it isn't Mike Ross.<eos> I take it you're not here selling Girl Scout cookies, but if you are, I'll take two boxes of go fu... yourself.<eos> - Just sit down, Gallo. I don't want to be here any more than you do, but I need your help.<eos> - Last time I helped you, I got five years for my trouble.
- Your ex, and he's threatening to go to the board with it.<eos> If there is one shred of proof...<eos> - There isn't any proof, because it didn't happen.<eos> And if you don't care to believe that, then you can turn around and walk right out.<eos> Because I don't care to be represented by a man who questions my integrity.<eos> - Okay, I am sorry.<eos> I just don't like being blindsided.<eos> - Well, I'm glad your shock is behind you, but mine isn't.<eos> What do you mean he's going to the board?<eos> - I mean he is blackmailing you with the threat of going to the board.
I just don't like being blindsided.<eos> - Well, I'm glad your shock is behind you, but mine isn't.<eos> What do you mean he's going to the board?<eos> - I mean he is blackmailing you with the threat of going to the board.<eos> - What?<eos> That would ruin my career.<eos> - I know, which is why you need to tell me what really happened between you and Jacob now.<eos> - Louis, I don't feel comfortable doing that.<eos> - I'm sorry, Paula, but you're gonna have to, because the only defense against what he is trying to do is the truth.<eos> - When I told you he broke my heart, I was telling the truth.
I will find out where Louis is, and I will bring him down here right now with a copy of the bylaws, because I am betting it is something we vote on.<eos> - Okay, Donna, you win. You don't wanna hire her, we won't.<eos> But you wanna be the one to make that call, you're gonna be the one to tell her to her face.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You hungry? There's some leftover Thai in the kitchen.<eos> - Great, I'm starving.<eos> - Haven't eaten all day. - Mike, about that, I know I said that maybe you should ask Harvey for a little time off to help with the clinic, but I'm wondering if maybe you should take a little time off from the clinic to help Harvey.<eos> - Rachel...<eos> - He was looking for you today, and it was clear it wasn't the first time.

It's not like we work on every case together.<eos> He knows that.<eos> - And I know that, too.<eos> But he brought you back for a reason, and that's so that when he does need you, you'll be there.
Break some skulls, get a reward.<eos> So I went to the source to get things codified.<eos> - And did you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Found out what was what.<eos> It was good at first, then I realized it was like working for the mob.<eos> Great work while you can get it, but you can never quit.<eos> So I tried to put an end to the whole thing.<eos> That night the guards killed the cameras, and five of my so-called friends did a number on me.<eos> - Are you saying this the deal that got you to Danbury?
- I asked Louis not to tell you that.<eos> - Louis didn't tell me.<eos> - Well, then how do you...<eos> - Because I do, and all I could think of was I wish you trusted me enough to know that I wouldn't go nuts on this guy for what he did to you.<eos> - Is that why you think I didn't tell you?<eos> - Well, you know my history with infidelity.<eos> What else could it be?<eos> - Harvey, the man cheated on me.<eos> I trusted him, and he cheated on me, and I was afraid of how you'd see me.<eos> - Why would him cheating on you make me see you differently?
- Is that why you think I didn't tell you?<eos> - Well, you know my history with infidelity.<eos> What else could it be?<eos> - Harvey, the man cheated on me.<eos> I trusted him, and he cheated on me, and I was afraid of how you'd see me.<eos> - Why would him cheating on you make me see you differently?<eos> - Because some people think that a woman who can be cheated on can't be... loveable.<eos> - How can you know me and think that?<eos> - Well, it's not about you.<eos> - And if this guy did this to you, then he's an idiot, and all he did is lose out on something great.
Yeah, I hope so.<eos> You know, we'll do what we can, for sure.<eos> Uh, what about you?<eos> When are you gonna get your ass out there?<eos> Yeah, chemo kicked me in the nuts.<eos> But my numbers are coming back up.<eos> And so is my gut...<eos> thanks to you and Jordan.<eos> Oh, yeah. That's our fault.<eos> We're never going to leave you out on the mountain, Mac, right?
Cain! Cain, where are you going?<eos> Cain! Let's just start with a simple drill... the guillotine counter.<eos> Ford, want to come in here?<eos> Hey, we're squaring off.<eos> Saw that coming a mile away.<eos> Hey, can we let the instructor teach?<eos> All right.<eos> You're going to shoot.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm going to lock you in the guillotine, right here.
Ted, do you have any cardiac history?<eos> No, the job keeps me in shape.<eos> Julie and I ran the half-marathon last year after the baby came.<eos> I was on a diaper run.<eos> I saw the flames, went to help.<eos> I got some maids out.<eos> Wish I did more.<eos> You did plenty.<eos> That took a lot of balls.<eos> Anything else bothering you?
Oh, this is Locke... blunt-head trauma, brief L.O.C, vitals are stable.<eos> Hot doc.<eos> Me likey. Hey, watch your mouth, Locke!<eos> - How'd this happen?<eos> - Ask Drew. Hey, he's fine, all right?<eos> Medics did it by the book with the c-collar.<eos> I'm going to see Kenny.<eos> All right, let's get him to Exam 1.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Locke's the vet I told you needed help.
Where is she?<eos> On her way.<eos> She was working.<eos> Her boss wouldn't approve a transfer until she finished her project.<eos> She can give consent over the phone.<eos> I'll give her a call.<eos> I'll... I'll call her.<eos> Her... Her boss can be a real dick.<eos> But I'll bring in the phone as soon as she answers.<eos> Doesn't that seem weird to you?
Um...<eos> Yo, could you just give me a minute just to, you know, just mentally prepare for this... this intrusion?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> But... You've got to be kidding me.<eos> I'm already done.<eos> What?<eos> That...<eos> That's it?<eos> I told you I was good.
You're the reason he's in here.<eos> He knows.<eos> He's here to pay his respects.<eos> Locke?<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> I, um...<eos> Hey, look at this.<eos> I got my bell rung, too.<eos> Five stitches 'cause doc here cheap-shotted me.<eos> I cheap-shotted you? !
You're not my boss, Cain.<eos> Last time I checked, you're technically a first-year resident.<eos> Who's forgotten more than you'll ever know.<eos> - Show some respect.<eos> - Says the man who told me, "Less conspiracy, more work."<eos> I tried telling you I had a feeling about this.<eos> You totally dismissed me.<eos> Because of your background, I...<eos> What do you know about my background?<eos> Jordan told you to watch me? No.
- Is there a problem, Sergeant?<eos> No problem, sir.<eos> Just a long day.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> It was him. 10 minutes late.<eos> So every time he's on the news or doing an interview,<eos> I've had to watch him embellish that battle and his role in it more and more.<eos> Okay, so why don't you call him out on it?<eos> I just figured it would drudge up - more stuff than it's worth.<eos> - And now it's killing you? Yeah.
Will you please turn that off?<eos> It's binge TV.<eos> How will we destroy the world today?<eos> I can't wait to find out.<eos> You want me to brief you on the latest or would you like to mock me for a few more minutes?<eos> HHow did we end up here, Grace?<eos> We've got a working EmDrive, a gravity tractor ready to launch, and our incompetent leaders can't get it off the ground without starting World War III. - Explain, please.<eos> - I wish I could.<eos> I can't get a straight answer from anyone.<eos> So all that gush from Harris at the hangar the other day about how he wants to be with you forever, he didn't tell you forever might mean a day and a half the way these goons run things?
And that is not fair.<eos> My soul mate died... and II figured my heart would die with her.<eos> Laura was there.<eos> At first as just a friend, but...<eos> It just happened.<eos> Do what you want, Dad.<eos> Jillian.<eos> Jillian.<eos> Wait.<eos> What is going on with you?
And so how do I get in touch with them? You can't.<eos> That's my source.<eos> - They're underground.<eos> - Did they say who they got the photo from?<eos> No.<eos> But... whatever Atlas is, it nearly got me killed, Liam.<eos> A car came out of nowhere and hit me headon.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I met you that first night, I started out just looking for a big story.
But only four of them were happy.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Other than... everything?<eos> We've come all this way and haven't even had a chance to make our case.<eos> I mean, if we leave, what hope's left?<eos> Our only contact was murdered, and we're the prime suspects. If you have another idea, I'm all ears.<eos> Apologies, Mrs. Petrovic. FSB agents.<eos> A little warning next time.<eos> Darius Tanz.<eos> Darius, they recognize you.
At least I know I did everything I could to save this... dumb-ass planet.<eos> It is pretty dumb-ass.<eos> Do you really like dancing?<eos> Me, too.<eos> You were right.<eos> You are good at this.<eos> I like this Darius.<eos> Dancing Darius.<eos> And I like you, Grace.<eos> Ever since I saw you at the Croatian embassy.
Why don't I lay it out for you... one earring at a time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You broke into my briefcase, stole my nuclear access codes.<eos> What exactly were you doing with four barrels of enriched uranium, Grace?<eos> Nothing... compared to what you did in Chelyabinsk.<eos> N... it was a mistake.<eos> A weapons test that went wrong.<eos> That asteroid was supposed to land in uninhabited terrain, - but it went off course.<eos> - Our government developed a weapon of mass destruction designed to have no fingerprints, no accountability.<eos> - And that doesn't disturb you?
Saving your incompetent asses?<eos> She violated the Logan Act, conducting foreign relations<eos> - without authority.<eos> - The Logan Act?<eos> AAn obscure law that's never been used to prosecute anyone, including me, strangely.<eos> What you do as a private citizen is not my business.<eos> Grace is a government employee who exceeded her authority.<eos> You petty son of a bitch.<eos> This is personal, and we both know it.<eos> She's become a completely different person since she met you.
The backbone of contemporary American theater is screaming stuff.<eos> For starters, it wakes the audience up towards the end of the third act.<eos> But also it reveals things from the past.<eos> My father was my brother and that's why we can't go to lunch today.<eos> Do you want to know why?<eos> Do you want to know why, Karen?<eos> Because I could not afford Adobe Photoshop!<eos> My baby.<eos> My chair baby.<eos> He killed you.
But for our final episode ever, we have a very special guest.<eos> - We really do.<eos> - He's a good guest.<eos> - He's a great guest.<eos> Sort of good get.<eos> - It's a good get.<eos> He began as a writer on the Smothers Brothers' comedy hour, and since then, he's been one of the rising stars in the world of entertainment.<eos> Please welcome, Steve Martin.<eos> Bye, thanks for coming.<eos> God bless you, thank you.
That's not gonna work on me.<eos> I know that's sheep dog blood.<eos> OK, if I were you, I would just drop this right now.<eos> How can I drop this, George?<eos> It was a life-changing opportunity for me.<eos> Just drop it, before I have to start screaming revelations.<eos> - I can handle it.<eos> - You booked it!<eos> You booked the CBS voice-over job! You booked it!<eos> And I took the message and I lied to you!
In fact, I'm free all week.<eos> Louis?<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> I... it's allergy season. I...<eos> I think it's probably best that we don't have lunch today.<eos> I... my... my chest feels like a vice.<eos> All good?<eos> I think so.<eos> What kind of plant did he get you, anyway?
But not like that.<eos> Maybe this'll work.<eos> You ever seen "MASH"?<eos> Of course, but what does that have to do with this?<eos> Louis is Frank Burns.<eos> Why didn't you say so in the first place?<eos> Now I totally get it.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He loves you, hates you, and wants to be you, all at the same time.
Yes, I do.<eos> Harvey, listen to yourself.<eos> It's one pro bono.<eos> He just took it.<eos> He can drop it.<eos> I gave him my word.<eos> And you once gave your word to me and went back on it and I let it go.<eos> Because I understood it was business.<eos> If this kid doesn't get that, what the hell is he doing here?<eos> Stephanie, I asked you to come to my office. That was over an hour ago.
I said, you're here, and I'm here.<eos> So unless you want to deal with me, you'll listen when Rachel tells you something.<eos> I was recruited to come here.<eos> And I was told that I would be valued for my mind, my billings, and my relationship with my clients.<eos> And since I got here, I have had to take shit from Louis.<eos> And now you're asking me to waste my time and my ability on something like this.<eos> - No...<eos> - You're right, Stephanie.<eos> You shouldn't have been treated like that by Louis. And Rachel and I took care of it.<eos> Now as for your time and ability, if you don't do whatever assignment Rachel gives you, I don't give a shit how good you are.
You told me you were afraid that I was gonna become better friends with him than you, and that's what this is.<eos> How dare you say that to me in front of Donna?<eos> I told you that in complete confidence.<eos> This isn't about my relationship with Alex. This is about your relationship with Alex and how you're afraid to stand up to him.<eos> You want to run that by me again?<eos> I just ran it by you.<eos> What you are doing is a mistake.<eos> I don't think so, and Donna doesn't think so, which means...<eos> Actually, Harvey, I do.<eos> And if it's all the same to you, I can speak for myself.
Ironclad Chinese wall.<eos> You have nothing to do with this case.<eos> Are you saying you don't trust me?<eos> You saying you didn't know what you were doing when you gave it to the clinic?<eos> Okay, Harvey.<eos> I'll put it in writing.<eos> I want you word you're gonna live by what you sign.<eos> You have my word.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did, I was just wondering, have you redone the assignment that Rachel gave you?
She just wants your helmet.<eos> I need no other's power, for I believe.<eos> Uh, that is a lot of Belief batteries.<eos> Prepare to be crushed under the weight of Belief.<eos> [grunts] That's some heavy belief.<eos> Feel the power of Belief, un-believers!<eos> Sam, dude, friends don't let friends get crushed by nutjobs.<eos> You sure this is necessary?<eos> Answer me this first, Samuel.<eos> Do you believe they have treated you as a friend?
All while rotting in this very prison cell.<eos> Yeah, well, not anymore.<eos> I tipped off the current empress, your daughter Victoria.<eos> Remember her?<eos> Let's just say your next prison cell is gonna make this one look like a palace.<eos> Meantime, take one step out of this cell, and I blast your royal heinie.<eos> I guess there will be no Alexander family reunion after all.<eos> Pity.<eos> Don't listen to him, Sam.<eos> Remember how I told you the galaxy's a dangerous place?
You know what's cool about space, Sam?<eos> - [singsongy] No tests!<eos> - [Drax] Not true, Quill.<eos> I have been tested in battle and won every time.<eos> Well, I've been tested on a bunch of times.<eos> - I don't recommend it.<eos> - I am Groot.<eos> More to the point, there's a Nova Corps APB out for you, Sam.<eos> Not to mention a ten-million-unit reward for this baby... [screaming] [groans] Pfft!<eos> The last place you need to be is the first place everyone in the galaxy will be looking for you.
- Walla-walla-hoo!<eos> - [all] Walla-walla-hey!<eos> - Kim-chu-ay!<eos> - [all] Chu-ay!<eos> Hey, man!<eos> All right!<eos> - Coop!<eos> Hey, Katie.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about you, Coop.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about you, too.
Hey, buddy. Louis, I was just making a cup of coffee.<eos> I'm not taking any time off, I swear.<eos> Whoa, Brian, it's okay to take a break every now and then.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yeah, absolutely.<eos> In fact, coffee preparation is very important.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Actually, making coffee is one of my favorite hobb...<eos> That's great. Listen to me, I need to ask you something.<eos> The other day when I said those things to you about taking time off, I mean, I don't even know
I am not gonna go on record and jeopardize it.<eos> Well, then this is gonna go one of two ways.<eos> You give us your records, and we submit them quietly... Or we subpoena your records under the Freedom of Information Act and put you on the stand.<eos> And seeing as you're afraid of ruining your career, I suggest you go with option A.<eos> You're a couple of little shits.<eos> Good, you're here.<eos> Listen, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you about.<eos> - Harvey, it's gonna have to wait.<eos> - Donna, it's important.<eos> Frank Gallo left a message for you a few minutes ago.
Let me get this straight.<eos> The woman who convinced me to leave a good job for one where I was treated terribly, sexually harassed, and then fired is now asking me for a personal favor?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Well, I'm not in the mood to grant one.<eos> So you can tell Louis I will see him in court.<eos> Stephanie, the woman I knew at Rand Kaldor Zane wouldn't do this.<eos> Please... tell me what's going on so I can help.<eos> I heard people here talking, and they said that I got fired because I couldn't hack it.<eos> Well, that's not true, and I won't have them thinking it is.<eos> Then close that door and sit down, because I'm betting that we can work out a deal right now that shows anyone who's ever underestimated you just how strong you are.

Harvey, I meant to let the clinic handle it, okay?<eos> It just turned out that this thing - was bigger than we thought.<eos> - I don't give a shit if it turned into the trial of the century.<eos> - We had an agreement.<eos> - No, you had an agreement with Alex, and then I agreed to sign a document, but as it turns out, stopping corruption is more important to me than some client's bottom line.<eos> Then grow the hell up, because that ends now.<eos> Harvey, I have to see this through.<eos> See this through?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> You think I don't know this is what Gallo was helping you with?
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't sign it.<eos> Louis, I know this isn't what you wanted, but in my professional opinion, this is the best you're going to do.<eos> At least take a day to think about it.<eos> And, Louis, this goes without saying, but however tempted you are, don't go see Stephanie.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't "hey" me.<eos> I take it you heard about what happened between me and Harvey.<eos> I take you didn't hear about what happened between me and Harvey.<eos> Rachel, what did he tell you?
In fact, I'd like to stay out of it entirely, if you don't mind.<eos> - Paula...<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> Because, you know, I'm not the one that brought it up.<eos> And, frankly, I don't like you behaving as though I'm the one making you do this.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> What's going on here is you're rather keen on keeping our relationship a secret from Donna... when you clearly had no trouble telling Louis.<eos> Are you worried that I have feelings for her?<eos> Of course you have feelings for her.<eos> You started having panic attacks after she left you.
Oliver, it's not a bomb.<eos> You knew all along you were gonna have to do this on your own.<eos> I knew you wouldn't be up there next to me, but I was counting on you helping me to prepare.<eos> - Oliver...<eos> - Son of a bitch, Mike!<eos> You know what happens to me!<eos> It happened last time, and now it's gonna happen tomorrow because you're goddamn hanging me out to dry!<eos> You know what, Oliver?<eos> You knew there would come a time when you'd be up there by yourself when you agreed to take this case.<eos> Now, last time we were in this situation, I coddled you all night, and you still dropped the goddamn ball.
Turned out she already knew.<eos> Well, I'm glad you told her.<eos> And I hope you got some egg rolls in there.<eos> Katrina, hey.<eos> Louis, what the hell did you do?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Then why were Donna and Rachel slapped with subpoenas last night?<eos> - Katrina, listen to me...<eos> - God damn it, Louis!<eos> How long did you wait to go over there after I explicitly told you not to?
Well, strap the hell in. 'Cause this motherfucker is going down.<eos> May I come in?<eos> What do you want this time?<eos> Tell me I'm so worthless I don't even deserve an office?<eos> I want to tell you I'm sorry, and if anyone's worthless, it's me.<eos> Louis, if you think pretending to give me an apology is gonna make me drop this suit, you have another thing coming.<eos> I don't think that.<eos> I just think that I owe you an explanation.<eos> You see... the night before<eos> I said those horrible things to you, my fiancée left me.
I don't know how I can repay you.<eos> You just did.<eos> Louis, if you're here for the Stevenson brief, I can have it to you in the morning.<eos> Go home, Brian.<eos> Am I fired?<eos> Nope, there's just more to life than working here.<eos> Am I being punked?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> It's just that you have a new supervisor starting tomorrow, and he would like you to get a good night's sleep.<eos> And he told you to tell me that?
They just threw us off of it.<eos> What the hell's the difference?<eos> The difference is it's a good case, and somebody else can still take it.<eos> - We just have to...<eos> - Stop bullshitting me!<eos> Now, you told me to turn down that settlement.<eos> I trusted you, and now it's over.<eos> No, it's not over, and I know I told you to turn down that settlement, but you told me you weren't doing this for the money and...<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I told you I was doing it for justice.

When you have a multi-day tournament, so much can happen.<eos> You know, you can get an injury...<eos> They could've met in a draw, and they could've met in the preliminaries.<eos> So, it's really great for the boxing fans, it's great for the storyline, and it's only gonna elevate their fight game.<eos> This will be our last bout.<eos> Two warriors at 201 pounds plus.<eos> Boxing out of the red corner, Cam Awesome.<eos> Fight!<eos> You can't do that with that jab...<eos> Is he hurting' you?
- Dolly, man, what you on about?<eos> - Don't.<eos> You don't call me that.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What it is now?<eos> Leighton Thomas.<eos> How come you got a new name?<eos> You're gonna tell me you've changed now, aren't you?<eos> Of course I've changed.<eos> I was 15 when I met you.
That's what the judge said.<eos> That's what everyone said.<eos> - Remember that first one we did?<eos> - I did!<eos> It was me.<eos> - You just stood there. - Nah.<eos> I'm not having that.<eos> I kept the edge.<eos> You couldn't have done it without me.<eos> Mate, I was messed up, and I used you.
None.<eos> Not one?<eos> What, seriously?<eos> When's your dad getting back?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Where'd you come from?<eos> - Evie all right?<eos> Did the cops ask you about Mr. Petrie?
Hello?<eos> I made a mistake, but I'm gonna sort it.<eos> When?<eos> What... What mistake?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna tie it off right now.<eos> What mistake, Tench?<eos> I let slip my name to your mate Alan.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm not letting them put you away again. Hang on.
No, the General is no longer in charge.<eos> From now on, I'm in charge.<eos> Vera, tell your boss not to worry.<eos> I've smuggled more blow than the Avendaños and El Chapo.<eos> El Chapo Guzmán won't be missed. All right.<eos> I need to speak with the General.<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> I want to negotiate.<eos> It's too late, Chapo.<eos> Nothing can save you from prison.
Stop it!<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.<eos> Blessed art thou amongst women...<eos> Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.<eos> Well, if it isn't Dorchester's finest sneaking around the back door.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> How long's it been?<eos> A month?<eos> So did it work?<eos> Did your wife take you back?
Read to me?<eos> Please?<eos> So I've been talking to the DA's office, and because we're cooperating, I think we can get a decent deal, all things considered.<eos> Possibility of parole in 30 years, pending good behavior.<eos> What would happen if I changed my plea to not guilty?<eos> Well, they have no incentive to change the deal. They have an airtight case against you.<eos> Well, what if we went to trial?<eos> Cora... the chances of winning a temporary insanity plea... are really, really rare.<eos> It means a long trial-- more press, your family getting dragged through the mud, and it will get ugly.<eos> They'll dig up your past. They'll dissect you in public.
You look nice.<eos> Why didn't you just lie to her?<eos> He'd only punish us and make you sick.<eos> Cora, God doesn't listen.<eos> Whitney at the hospital-- she prayed over and over to get better.<eos> She still died.<eos> I even prayed for you to get sick once.<eos> Sicker than me.<eos> Just so you'd know what it's like.<eos> Once, I ate an entire chocolate bar because I thought it would kill you.
Unless it was a lie.<eos> You've seen my arms, asshole.<eos> It's what happened.<eos> Prove it.<eos> What's next?<eos> The next thing you do?<eos> You don't know how to do it, do you?<eos> Cora, addicts start by injecting in their feet and their hands way before their arms are scarred like that.<eos> Five years ago, 4th of July weekend, you went out, and then you showed up on a street in Poughkeepsie. You don't know how you got there.<eos> You don't know who brought you there.
- Come on.<eos> Shh. We need to give this one a chance.<eos> Our first grandchild.<eos> My waters haven't broken.<eos> I lied.<eos> Well, we're still gonna get you to hospital.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Get you checked out.<eos> - What did he do to you?
You did swab Jordan Whitehead?<eos> Not exactly. No.<eos> II got some help.<eos> From Bea.<eos> You got some help?<eos> - Can I...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Michael Yuill is the father of your children, isn't he?<eos> You wouldn't let P.C. Denny perform the mouth swab on Jordan because you knew it would link him to the heart.<eos> Which would link you to the heart that we now know belongs to Michael Yuill.
Julia. Julia. Julia.<eos> Julia. Julia. Julia, Julia, Julia, Julia.<eos> Julia.<eos> Julia, Julia...<eos> Julia!<eos> What's that, now?<eos> It's okay.<eos> He blurts things out sometimes. It's normal.<eos> Is everything okay, Sam?<eos> Paige, I'm sorry to inform you of this, but I shouldn't be here because I don't love you.
I have to go.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can you come get me?<eos> This is a good igloo.<eos> Way better than his last one.<eos> So what's going on here, Sam?<eos> I mean, you show up with my necklace and soaking wet.<eos> I mean, what do you want?<eos> Do you want to get back together?<eos> I want to try to explain, but I might have to talk about animals, and I know that annoys you sometimes.
You okay?<eos> My mom had an affair.<eos> Here, come here.<eos> I knew she was a dick. I just didn't know she was that big of a dick.<eos> Sorry I was so weird to you.<eos> No, it's, um... it's okay.<eos> I was, uh... an idiot.<eos> And when you didn't say that you loved me back, I just... I felt like a tool.<eos> But I really don't care whether you say it or not.<eos> I love you, and... and that's that.
"No, Mom, but thanks for everything you do."<eos> In second grade, Madison Gold gave me a valentine with a picture of a western honeybee on it that said "Bee mine." Bee.<eos> I didn't understand why the word "be" was misspelled, but she was nice and explained it to me.<eos> That's the first joke I ever learned.<eos> Hey, Madison.<eos> Bee mine.<eos> Um... what?<eos> Would you like to go on a date?<eos> That's so nice, but I'm busy.<eos> Wait. I didn't tell you when the date is.
That's the first joke I ever learned.<eos> Hey, Madison.<eos> Bee mine.<eos> Um... what?<eos> Would you like to go on a date?<eos> That's so nice, but I'm busy.<eos> Wait. I didn't tell you when the date is.<eos> Friday, 6:00 p.m., Eastern.<eos> I'm still busy.<eos> I also forgot to tell you that you would be my practice girlfriend.
How do you currently pick out your clothes?<eos> I don't.<eos> My mom does.<eos> Doesn't your mom pick out your clothes?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I think maybe it's time to start picking out your own clothes.<eos> But... how?<eos> There are so many clothes. And different colors and patterns and sizes.<eos> This shirt is called "fog gray," but fog isn't even a color... it's translucent.<eos> Just pick something that feels like you.
Zahid's here.<eos> I invited Zahid, because he's the most stylish person I know.<eos> Sometimes he wears two watches.<eos> I think I'm also quite stylish.<eos> Bring it in, Mrs. G.<eos> Nice.<eos> Long hug. Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You smell amazing.<eos> Um... hey, Sam. This would look very handsome on you.
In 2004.<eos> For eight months.<eos> Oh, forget it.<eos> Casey!<eos> So...<eos> You stole a tuba?<eos> Casey.<eos> Casey.<eos> Listen...<eos> I never told you about that, because, honestly, it's just... It's not something I'm very proud of.
Oh, forget it.<eos> Casey!<eos> So...<eos> You stole a tuba?<eos> Casey.<eos> Casey.<eos> Listen...<eos> I never told you about that, because, honestly, it's just... It's not something I'm very proud of.<eos> You know, it was hard when your brother was born.<eos> It was hard having a son who... didn't smile and... look you in the eye.
It was you?<eos> You're the mole?<eos> You're like the son I never had.<eos> I would rather die a hero than a traitor.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Bad dream?<eos> What time did you get in last night?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> It was late.<eos> Darius is working you way too hard.
Well, honey, you know, Mike has moved on.<eos> Don't you think it's time that you let another man into the picture?<eos> - Mother, please.<eos> - So, Zoe, when are you leaving for Kenya?<eos> Four weeks.<eos> But I'm ready to go now.<eos> Ed can be a real buzzkill, but at least he's got great taste in whiskey.<eos> Isn't it possible you're seeing something you want to see?<eos> So forget all the strange things that have happened since Tanz and the DoD have forged this new partnership.<eos> Doesn't it strike you as odd that the great and powerful Darius Tanz gave an exclusive to little old me?
I had my reasons.<eos> I don't care about your reasons.<eos> I told you I didn't want to have to lie to her, but you didn't give a crap.<eos> You destroyed us, Darius.<eos> You're a heartless prick just like Nicholas.<eos> So, is this retribution?<eos> I don't assume to know what the Russians want.<eos> Talking about you.<eos> I mean, this was your home.<eos> Your uncle took you in, put you through school.
Hey, hey, look, Kirsten.<eos> Look at me. As long as we're together, you are my life.<eos> If you don't want to stitch, then I don't want you stitching.<eos> If you want to leave, then I'm leaving with you, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Come here. Guys, a case just came in.<eos> Maggie, I just told you...<eos> And I heard you.
Uh, but I think it really comes down to teamwork and determination.<eos> That's just really the key for us.<eos> And having your teammate carry you doesn't hurt either.<eos> Monica let a few slip by the baseline, but I feel like I brought my A-game.<eos> Leslie's kind of a bitch.<eos> She didn't just steal Monica's thunder... she totally destroyed her.<eos> Textbook 'roid rage. $20 says Leslie's the one shooting up.<eos> I'll take that bet.<eos> Okay, I am locked on to the steroid memory.<eos> All right, moving you back to the steroid memory, baller.
I know it's hard keeping up, but steroids, Monica?<eos> Really? Just lay off.<eos> If you get caught juicing, we'll both be disqualified.<eos> For once, Leslie, keep your big mouth shut.<eos> - Or I...<eos> - Or what?<eos> Pretty sure Monica just threatened Leslie's life.<eos> Sounds like motive to me.<eos> Okay, we're running out of time.<eos> Moving you to the death memory.
- Hitwoman.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> I was simulating. Not doing.<eos> We were discussing hypothetically signing up.<eos> I filled in your name for demonstration purposes.<eos> Why me?<eos> - I thought you said it was a good idea.<eos> - Not that part.<eos> It must have been an automatic registration.<eos> As soon as you enter the last field, it must have registered you without having to hit a submit button.
Jesus Christ.<eos> Well, Lopez will be happy, at least.<eos> We got a story.<eos> Kinda all makes sense now.<eos> Doesn't it?<eos> Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.<eos> I indulged in temptation and risked my sister's life.<eos> Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...<eos> You're been praying out here for over an hour.<eos> Phoebe saw you from the window... reminded me you were out here.

You were sitting there with your husband, and you were slicing up a pear for your son, and Frankie and his friends were 15 yards away, and somebody was playing music.<eos> And you heard that music, didn't you?<eos> It reminded you of something, didn't it?<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> - No, we are going through this.<eos> We are going through this step by step.<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> - Why?<eos> He did something to you, didn't he?
It reminded you of something, didn't it?<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> - No, we are going through this.<eos> We are going through this step by step.<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> - Why?<eos> He did something to you, didn't he?<eos> What did he do?<eos> What did he do to you?
young reporters with influential voices.<eos> - No way, that's awesome.<eos> - I know. I'm really excited about it, and Jacqueline actually seemed impressed.<eos> Okay, that is great, babe, but you are killing me.<eos> You just had your first orgasm. Come on.<eos> I can come back.<eos> Actually, no, I can't.<eos> Uh, Sutton...<eos> Oh, Lauren needs me?<eos> Actually, Oliver needs you.
After you.<eos> Oliver's considering me for the fashion assistant job.<eos> - That's amazing.<eos> - I know, but he...<eos> - Wait, what did you just say?<eos> - I said he wants somebody who went to fashion school.<eos> He would be lucky to have you.<eos> So was he going before he knew you were on the panel?<eos> Nope.<eos> I feel like this moves you out of casual sex territory.
You can?<eos> Sutton, I'm gonna ask you a question.<eos> Did you really go to FIT?<eos> Um, no.<eos> And I know that I should have said something as soon as...<eos> But you didn't. In fact, your opening move in our relationship was to lie to me.<eos> I know, I don't know why...<eos> Neither do I, Sutton.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, jail, and Jacqueline picked you up?
This is, like, an infection waiting to happen.<eos> Not if you use the right ones and in the right way.<eos> I don't really feel comfortable putting a yoni in... my yoni.<eos> Which is exactly why I want you to. So crazy how they...<eos> Don't touch it!<eos> Could you please tell her to stop being so uptight?<eos> There's absolutely nothing wrong with being uptight. Thank you.<eos> The problem is when you let it hold you back.<eos> Jane, if you want to have an orgasm, you have to find your inner freak.<eos> She did not seriously tell you to watch porn as an assignment?
Can't sleep?<eos> I snapped at my friends tonight.<eos> No, you're just nervous about your interview.<eos> I just feel like they don't know what this could mean for me...<eos> Kat especially.<eos> She's never had to worry about money.<eos> She doesn't have student loans and a mom who can't pay her own bills.<eos> This job would literally change my life.<eos> Yeah, it's a big deal.<eos> Can I tell you something that's probably gonna sound insane to you?
What is all this?<eos> Research for my article.<eos> It's very science-y.<eos> It's giving me flashbacks to high school, gross.<eos> Okay.<eos> I haven't been able to have an orgasm, and that's kind of the whole point of this, so I have to turn something in.<eos> All right, fine. Somebody really needs to get themselves off though.<eos> Tell me something I don't know.<eos> Okay, I'll tell you something you don't know.<eos> Uh, these little charts and graphs and stuff... they're not gonna help you.
These are the women of "The Bold Type."<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> May I?<eos> Sure.<eos> What are you working on? Okay.<eos> Let's just get this out of the way.<eos> I kissed you.<eos> And then ran.<eos> Yes, I kissed you, then ran.
Hey.<eos> No time.<eos> Lauren has an insane day getting ready for the Planned Parenthood fundraiser.<eos> Oliver's assistant up and quit to take a job at Bal-mane.<eos> Balmain.<eos> What?<eos> Are you sure? Positive.<eos> I overheard the fashion interns when they were putting together an outfit for me.<eos> Pause.<eos> Why were the fashion interns putting together an outfit for you?
Cool place.<eos> So, are you an astronomy guy, or is this like a "Rear Window" kind of thing?<eos> Can't it be both?<eos> Are you ever gonna sit down?<eos> I've read your column.<eos> I know what's happened on that couch.<eos> Oh, is that why you won't sit down?<eos> I could get you a towel or something.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> So, does it ever bother you when people say that you're just a sex writer?
We'll figure it out.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't even care about the picture.<eos> I really don't. I'm proud of it.<eos> It's the fact that they violated my privacy.<eos> Maybe you should stop looking. Oh, jeez.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm a slut because I took a topless photo of myself in the south of France.<eos> What is wrong with these people?<eos> Okay, hey, look. It's not all bad.<eos> The CEO of a VR company tweeted at you.
And it got me thinking.<eos> Honestly, your article, it inspired me. Oh...<eos> Oh, great.<eos> 'Cause that's all I do, right?<eos> I'm just another sexist pig writer.<eos> You have me all figured out, don't you?<eos> It's not that hard.<eos> Jane, this is what we do.<eos> No, it's what you do.<eos> So you think he was using you to write his story?
But the anonymity of the Internet has completely raised the stakes.<eos> Yeah, it has.<eos> But you are stronger than that.<eos> I... I don't know if I am.<eos> I do.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You're getting that black Jared Kushner vibe, right?<eos> Yeah, I mean, you're only missing the flak jacket.<eos> Who did this to you?
This is great.<eos> That was my idea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "Pay Attention to the Woman Behind the Clothes."<eos> Your congresswoman piece went to a place I did not expect.<eos> Is that a good thing or a bad thing?<eos> I like surprises.<eos> Well, believe me, no one is more surprised about where it ended up than I am.<eos> I know.<eos> You have this idea of the kind of writer you should be, but... don't let that keep you from the kind of writer you could be.
Here we go, batter!<eos> Swing, batter!<eos> Wait, what do you mean?<eos> Oh, it's just like in those movies.<eos> Any time the nanny is hot, it just means she's a homicidal maniac.<eos> Go, batter!<eos> Swing, batter!<eos> - Really?<eos> - Totally.<eos> At first, she butters you up, tells you you have the perfect family. Then one of the parents calls the nanny agency to ask about her, and the receptionist is all like,
The freezing cold truth hurts, but here it is.<eos> And I'm gonna serve it up raw.<eos> You know, for years I would look at that totem and I would see a glow, a force, a magical feeling that covered us all, protected us, kept us safe and made us good.<eos> And now, I look at it and all I see is a bunch of weird doodles carved into a piece of wood.<eos> And if that spirit is gone, then I do not know what I'm doing here.<eos> But I will find a buyer that cares about this place as much as we all did.<eos> And it has been an honor to be your camp director.<eos> Please excuse me.<eos> - Come on.<eos> You know, George, the Bill Clinton videotape I sent you...

- Is someone listening?<eos> - You can never be too careful.<eos> Listen, there's something going on, and I need you to...<eos> All right, Joan, where the hell is the car?<eos> I told you, it's not in this section.<eos> You never listen to me.<eos> No, I remember. B2.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> I brought you here to tell you that there's a conspiracy involving very evil forces.
- "Can you give us a minute"?<eos> Sorry, I'm saying can you give us a minute?<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Don't you see, Susie?<eos> I can't play it cool any longer.<eos> I can't get through a bloody interview without melting into your eyes.<eos> Say you'll be mine.<eos> But we always promised that we wouldn't let our relationship get in the way of our work.<eos> Don't you ask me to jump if you're not gonna be there to catch me.<eos> Oh, I'll catch you and cradle you in my arms.
My own place right on Union Square.<eos> But how am I gonna make that happen?<eos> These other chefs, they go to the best culinary schools, they got all the right connections...<eos> Ginny, what are you doing?<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> If I go back now, I can maybe get back in time to let Faison off the hook.<eos> Stop.<eos> Faison's not gonna care one way or the other, and you know that.<eos> You lied to me, Coop! "The hot couple"?<eos> The only reason that I didn't tell you about Katie before is because that's so far in the past.
- Who's this?<eos> Who are you?<eos> - I'm a journalist...<eos> - She's a journalist - from the media.<eos> - News.<eos> Um, would you excuse us for just a second?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What did I tell you right before I left?
- No, don't fucking tell me to calm down!<eos> She's a fucking bloodthirsty, murderous, bitch-ass psycho!<eos> What?<eos> Surprise.<eos> - Surprise.<eos> - Surprise.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Renata organized a surprise wedding anniversary for you.<eos> For us. No, no, Ben. She's got a knife.<eos> For this cake I made you.
It's hard being a new parent.<eos> I get it. - Will you accept my apology?<eos> - Of course I will, yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Come here, you.<eos> - I have a secret to tell you.<eos> - What's that? You were right about me.<eos> You fell right into my trap.<eos> I made you look insane.<eos> And now, no matter what I do, no one will believe you.
I really am the smasher!<eos> Ah, don't sweat it, buddy.<eos> Holy cow!<eos> Fern, that was perfect!<eos> You're getting new powers like every day now.<eos> Let me see you do Jake...<eos> No, wait, Ice King!<eos> Do Ice King!<eos> Ha, nah, man.<eos> Imitating uncool people infects you with their loserishness.
Stop and notice you're dead.<eos> Bastard.<eos> Granddaughter, then. Ah.<eos> I wish Speakers wouldn't do that.<eos> What?<eos> Dress the girls like boys.<eos> It's safer when we travel.<eos> What happened?<eos> You walked into a cyclops.<eos> Turns you to stone with its eyeball and feeds on your terror while you're trapped in your own body.
And He does not love you.<eos> I have done His bidding.<eos> My life's work is in His name.<eos> Your life's work makes Him puke.<eos> I am the Bishop of Gresit!<eos> Your God knows that we wouldn't be here without you.<eos> This is all your fault, isn't it?<eos> She was a witch!<eos> Lies? In your house of God?<eos> No wonder He has abandoned you.
No.<eos> You're asking if I believe you're some sleeping messiah who'll save us, and no, I don't.<eos> Belmont!<eos> I know what you are.<eos> And what am I?<eos> You're a vampire.<eos> So, I have to ask myself, have we come down here to wake up the man who'll kill Dracula, or did we come here to wake Dracula?<eos> You call me Dracula.<eos> I'll call you anything you like if you're gonna show me your teeth.<eos> She called you Belmont.
Let's find out.<eos> Belmont, you can't do this!<eos> Tell it to your floating vampire Jesus here.<eos> You've got nothing but insults, have you?<eos> A tired little...<eos> Stone the fuck up.<eos> You can't do this, Belmont!<eos> He's not your messiah.<eos> Dracula's castle can appear anywhere, Sypha.<eos> And I told you, this is what he looks like on the inside.
Jalapeno hands are feeling better, huh?<eos> Yeah, thank God.<eos> Now they're just piss hands, I guess.<eos> Yeah, pretty much.<eos> Oh, they really do think he's funny.<eos> Look how cute that is.<eos> I mean, come on, let him have this.<eos> I feel good about that.<eos> I filled out the whole online dating profile, and the first date they set me up with was my sister.<eos> If they set you up with your sister maybe it's time to say good-bye to internet dating.
She can walk out and just jump on a plane and go to Cabo instead.<eos> Cabo obviously being any other dude.<eos> Yeah, but everybody knows Cabo's [bleep] lame, and Zihuantanejo, pretty rad all the time.<eos> I'm just not convinced that you're really ready to settle down.<eos> - Okay, but I'm telling you I am. - Okay.<eos> I want to meet someone.<eos> Okay, good, but you're not getting any younger, your sperm's not getting any younger, so we got to lock it down before the "poo tunnel"<eos> gets so long that nobody can actually survive the treacherous landscape.<eos> Who's Morgan Freeman in this situation?<eos> I'm Morgan Freeman, I'm leading you to your happiness and I just led a blind man to the bathroom.
Listen, if he's really ready to meet someone, we should introduce him to someone we really like.<eos> Okay, we'll give it a try.<eos> All right, I'll put the feelers out.<eos> Wouldn't those be my feelers?<eos> These would be your feelers, because you like to touch balls.<eos> - Yeah, they appreciate the attention, and also, maybe use a little bit more thumb.<eos> You know what, the more I think about it... - What?<eos> - I think it was planned.<eos> Eighty degrees out today... why wear a leather jacket?<eos> I have never been more attracted to you.
Shar, we ran out of bagels. Oh, come on.<eos> You ran out of bagels?<eos> You ran out of bagels?<eos> Uncle Richard had an extra half.<eos> Leon, this is what happens when you buy one bagel per person.<eos> It should be more than enough.<eos> I probably have some wheat bread or something I can put out, I don't know.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Why can't you just buy enough bagels?<eos> Does Leon look sick to you?
Oh, dear.<eos> I want to do it now too.<eos> Hold on...<eos> There you are.<eos> Midori.<eos> Don't come near my school.<eos> I know I can find you here.<eos> You're walking too fast.<eos> What?<eos> What's with you?
Would you pay ten million yen for her?<eos> I don't think I would.<eos> That's too expensive?<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> But, you know what?<eos> Guys all over Japan want to fuck her.<eos> There are tons of guys that prefer popular chicks over quality ones.<eos> Especially in this country.<eos> LONG-AWAITED DEBUT OF AYANE HIROKAWA<eos> Why do you think I brought you here?
It's quite easy.<eos> No matter what needs to be done, there are pros who specialize in it.<eos> Pros?<eos> But I don't know any...<eos> I'll ask one.<eos> Leave it to me.<eos> Are you a pro at this kind of thing?<eos> Well...<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Midori, did you do as I told you?
You're the one who must decide.<eos> I won't let you kill anyone.<eos> Let me play the leading role.<eos> I'll get my courage up again and ask you to sleep with me, okay?<eos> Mr. Michima, you're experiencing a desire to kill.<eos> But you cannot kill me.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't kill people.<eos> No, you can't kill people.<eos> That's why I selected you.
NATIONWIDE AUDITIONS FOR THE DRAMATIZATION OF WORLD THEORY !<eos> Are you sure you want auditions?<eos> Yes.<eos> But we had Masumi Arimura all set for it.<eos> With her, we would have a hit for sure.<eos> By normal logic, it's only natural.<eos> Then why?<eos> In order for me to give birth to a logic that only I can create, I will find a new logic yet to be expressed in this world.<eos> I will explain to everyone why we need it.<eos> Just how far will your zealousness take you?
Time!<eos> Run to the symbol of time!<eos> Why run when you can fly?<eos> So this is why you have been winning, Drax.<eos> You were cheating!<eos> Technically, we were the ones cheating.<eos> Oh, and you're welcome.<eos> But you are not!<eos> Not here, not now, not ever!<eos> When is what weighs you down also what lifts you up?
Run to the symbol of time!<eos> Why run when you can fly?<eos> So this is why you have been winning, Drax.<eos> You were cheating!<eos> Technically, we were the ones cheating.<eos> Oh, and you're welcome.<eos> But you are not!<eos> Not here, not now, not ever!<eos> When is what weighs you down also what lifts you up?<eos> "When is what weighs you down also what lifts you up?"
He is an animal!<eos> What do you expect?<eos> You have him in a cage!<eos> He doesn't know how to control his powers.<eos> He just needs to calm down.<eos> Let me go!<eos> Drax!<eos> You must fulfill your destiny.<eos> Atone for your past mistakes.<eos> What did your family bring you in the end except loss?
Wait up! "Hey are you guys skiing in Stadt this winter?<eos> Wait up!"<eos> You know, I got a plane to catch.<eos> I'm gonna go to Florida to lay low for two years until I can reboot.<eos> Florida, perfect!<eos> Tilt the country and that's where all the bad eggs roll.<eos> Prick-shaped state for a dickhole like you.<eos> Hey babe.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been texting you for an hour.
- You got it?<eos> - Mmhm. Now press your lips on the back, but don't actually kiss it with pursed lips or it'll look like psoriasis.<eos> Just press it once.<eos> Lovely, he'll die. [giggles]<eos> [iPad rings] Couldn't stop thinking about me?<eos> Oh yeah. That's<eos> - Woman: Graham!<eos> Hazel, has anyone ever talked to you about the birds and the bees?<eos> Yeah of course. My mom told me where babies come from ages ago.<eos> Did she tell you where pleasure comes from?
Well, I'm not totally sure, but from what I can tell, it's when a group of women get together to celebrate and support a fellow lady in need and, and I love Jennifer,<eos> I support her, so if this is the kind of thing that she's looking for right now in her life, I'm going to do this for her.<eos> You're doing your "I'm sincere" impersonation.<eos> I can be sincere!<eos> Why is it an impersonation?<eos> - Why is it an impersonation?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> It's you pretending to be something you're not.<eos> I am sincerely interested in helping my friend.<eos> It doesn't come to you naturally.
Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Sorry... sorry.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going to need you to explain what just happened here.<eos> Well...<eos> - Jim, our therapist...<eos> He said that maybe because you're an alpha woman, maybe you would enjoy being dominated.<eos> What?<eos> He said a lot of women have rape fantasies.<eos> Our therapist told you to rape me?
You need to make friends at all the fashion houses.<eos> Then and only then will you be useful to me.<eos> Networking. Right.<eos> Jane, you're single, right?<eos> Single?<eos> Um, well, it's kind of...<eos> It's a yes or no question, not a diary entry.<eos> I need a writer to review the new dating app setyouup.<eos> It's a blind date concept with a<eos> "who knows you better than your best friend?" twist.
You said to stick to celeb gossip.<eos> Yeah, that's not gossip. Okay, I...<eos> I'm confused.<eos> You told me to do celeb gossip, so I did.<eos> I feel like I'm not understanding How to do this right.<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> I can see that you're frustrated,<eos> So, uh, why don't we do a bunch of tweets together? Yeah.<eos> I'll push my meeting<eos> And take you through it step by step.
Which is no small deal, certainly not to me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Kat, you should not be up here.<eos> I just spoke with Jacqueline.<eos> I cannot believe that you went over my head.<eos> I am over your head, Kat.<eos> I told you that I had it handled.
I got really mad, And Natalie tweeted out this thing last night...<eos> So yell at Natalie!<eos> I have to call him.<eos> I messed up, didn't I? Yeah.<eos> Oh, my god, Natalie is just...<eos> she's just not getting it.<eos> I keep trying to explain things to her, and...<eos> She's just not.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, sorry I'm just calling you back.
I just want to let you know,<eos> I'm gonna be moving out.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> - You're leaving? - Not LA. Just the house.<eos> Amanda and I are... are moving in together.<eos> But you barely know her.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna know her any better not living with her.<eos> Are you sure this isn't gonna be a mistake?<eos> What if Cameron asked you to live with him and I said you were making a mistake?
Denise Nichols?<eos> Pull through the gate.<eos> Take any open spot.<eos> That works too.<eos> What is this place?<eos> From the looks of it, an old munitions factory.<eos> Mom.<eos> It kills me to see her like this.<eos> Dr. Goodkin.<eos> Last time I saw you, you were just a little boy.
My father.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> The last time Stinger stitched you into your mother it put her in a coma, you almost died, and it left you with temporal dysplasia.<eos> That's why you need him, so you don't make his same mistakes.<eos> I am not letting him anywhere near this.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> He might know a few tricks.<eos> That's what I'm afraid of.<eos> I'm so sorry for everything I put you through.
Don't let anything happen to my sister.<eos> Hello, Kirsten.<eos> Give us a moment.<eos> I know you hate me.<eos> Hate you?<eos> Do you know how many lives you've ruined?<eos> Just listen to me for a minute.<eos> I can listen to you.<eos> I just can't trust anything you say.<eos> And that's exactly why I reached out to you through the avatar of young Cameron.
You never heard any of this?<eos> Casey's just a sophomore.<eos> Yeah. I forget.<eos> Superstar's still just a baby.<eos> Little baby.<eos> In science, observable evidence plays a key role in discovery.<eos> Yo, brotha.<eos> But to really understand it, you have to ask questions.<eos> Excuse me. Bailey?<eos> I'm the boy whose sister punched you.
We're just wasting time.<eos> We don't have time.<eos> There was no...<eos> I can't fucking...<eos> God damn it!<eos> Terry.<eos> What?<eos> You have kids, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's your conscience telling you here?
- I know.<eos> We haven't had a holiday in three years and your mother loves Blackpool.<eos> - I don't like Blackpool, Terry.<eos> - Dad.<eos> It's gonna be okay, I promise.<eos> I'm gonna work it out.<eos> - He's gonna break his neck.<eos> - I'm gonna break his neck.<eos> Do you really wanna put yourself through this again?<eos> It's a world that doesn't wanna know you.
Garmisch Seniors Tournament.<eos> Next month.<eos> Final jump is an open event so if you could just land one jump, you are...<eos> - Going to the Olympics.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Get better soon.<eos> - All right, coach.<eos> - I'm not your coach. Okay?<eos> Seriously.<eos> A coach teaches you how to jump properly.
- That's what I'm talking about.<eos> - That was better, weren't it?<eos> Bo Derek!<eos> Yeah, baby!<eos> I think a little bit of wee came out.<eos> So, all you have to do is make this landing and you qualify.<eos> One jump away from the Olympics, man.<eos> Get your skis.<eos> Okay. Stay focused.<eos> Do everything I told you to do only better.
The only way to qualify is to make 61 meters in competition.<eos> So I'm gonna go on the European circuit.<eos> Man, that's easier said than done.<eos> I'd need you to come, too.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Sure, Fly Boy.<eos> Why not?<eos> You get the money, the transport, I'm in.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> So, if this is you now... how much more are they asking you to jump?
- Yeah.<eos> And you're not gonna like what I did with our savings, either.<eos> The wanderer returns, huh?<eos> Mum gave me some money and I sorted out the transport.<eos> Is that what you call it?<eos> Come on, let's get a drink.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I don't wanna get snow on the seat.<eos> This window is a bugger.<eos> I think it's a good thing they turned you down, man.
I don't mind really.<eos> Okay, look, you and me, we should take another four years. Okay?<eos> Let me coach you properly and we can do this for real.<eos> You could even jump the 90 meter and be taken seriously, Eddie.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We've just pulled off the impossible.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Then you're on your own.<eos> It won't mean anything if you sell yourself short.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Well, can you check again?<eos> I am on the team.<eos> You might be on the team but you're not on the list.<eos> - Appleby, you old dog.<eos> - Zach.<eos> Say hi to your daughter for me.<eos> Eddie, there you are.<eos> I'm Carrie.<eos> I handle the press for the British team.<eos> Been looking all over for you.
Weren't you trying to escape?<eos> I was trying to get in.<eos> I watched Howard build this place, piece by piece, for years.<eos> He was always talking about, you know, possible attacks from<eos> Al Qaeda, Russia, South Korea.<eos> You mean North Korea.<eos> Is that the crazy one?<eos> So, yeah, that one.<eos> And, you know, poured all his money into this place. Took to it like his life depended on it.<eos> Which, you know, that stays with you.
Could you hand me the salt?<eos> Please?<eos> Shoot! I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna need the pepper also.<eos> What exactly do you think you're doing?<eos> I'm asking for pepper.<eos> Like hell you were! What was that?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.<eos> Are you trying to insult me?<eos> Here, in the shelter that I built that's keeping you alive?
Okay.<eos> It keeps doing that.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Michelle, why is this loose?<eos> - Get up.<eos> - Why?<eos> Get off the mattress now!<eos> Shit!<eos> You gonna walk out on me?<eos> After I saved you and kept you safe, this is how you repay me.
I was gonna order an ice cream sundae.<eos> - Extra sprinkles.<eos> - You wouldn't be the first.<eos> - This is my stop.<eos> - Oh, this is you?<eos> Hey, if you're not doing anything... get a coffee.<eos> Hey.<eos> There he is. There's the man.<eos> - Nate, let me ask you a question.<eos> If there was this girl and you wanted her to notice you...
You're that guy from the restaurant.<eos> Seth.<eos> - Are you, like, following me or something?<eos> - What? No.<eos> Look, I'm not some psycho, okay?<eos> You know me.<eos> - We went to school together.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I don't want anything. I just want to talk to you.<eos> When I saw you on the bus the other day, after all these years, I felt something.
Don't you ever come back here.<eos> - Maybe if you retrace your steps. - No.<eos> It's gotta be here somewhere.<eos> Well, was your name in it?<eos> Or like any contact information?<eos> What do you think?<eos> You fucking bitch!<eos> Claire?<eos> You here?<eos> What I just put in you is called pancuronium bromide.
Are you gonna rape me?<eos> No.<eos> Kill me?<eos> I hope not.<eos> You hope not?<eos> Might not have a choice.<eos> And why's that?<eos> I might not be able to save you.<eos> What is this, some kind of fucking religious thing?<eos> Did God tell you to punish all the whores, something like that?
How much more are you ready to lose?<eos> Get back.<eos> Holly.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I believe you.<eos> You do?<eos> Do you...<eos> You saved me, Seth.<eos> Of course I love you.
-I don't know you.<eos> -I'm Stephen strange.<eos> I'm a neurosurgeon.<eos> Was a neurosurgeon.<eos> Actually, you know what, man, i do know you.<eos> I came to your office once.<eos> You refused to see me.<eos> I never got past your assistant.<eos> You were untreatable.<eos> No glory for you in that, right?
It's not about your hands.<eos> How is this not about my hands?<eos> Master hamir.<eos> Thank you, master hamir.<eos> You cannot beat a river into submission.<eos> You have to surrender to its current... And use its power as your own.<eos> I control it by surrendering control?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Not everything does. Not everything has to.<eos> Your intellect has taken you far in life... But it will take you no further.
You see what we're doing.<eos> The world is not what it ought to be.<eos> Humanity longs for the eternal... For a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us.<eos> Time is an insult.<eos> Death is an insult.<eos> Doctor... We don't seek to rule this world.<eos> We seek to save it...<eos> To hand it over to dormammu, who is the intent of all evolution... The why of all existence.<eos> The sorcerer supreme defends existence.<eos> What was it that brought you to kamar-taj, doctor?
You think this is where you die.<eos> You wonder what I see in your future?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> I never saw your future.<eos> Only its possibilities.<eos> You have such a capacity for goodness.<eos> You always excelled... But not because you craved success... But because of your fear of failure.<eos> That's what made me a great doctor.<eos> It's precisely what kept you from greatness.
Get up and fight.<eos> We can finish this.<eos> You can't fight the inevitable.<eos> Isn't it beautiful?<eos> A world beyond time.<eos> Beyond death.<eos> Beyond time...<eos> Strange.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Even strange has left you and surrendered to his power.
Family drama, that kind of thing.<eos> But we're looking for my father.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So if you found Odin... You'd all return to asgard promptly?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Promptly.<eos> Great!<eos> Allow me to help you.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> They carried you into kamar-taj on a stretcher.
You denied being on our train.<eos> You're the liar.<eos> You're hiding from someone.<eos> If I were you, I would forget about that... and everything you've seen on here.<eos> This is not a game.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> This is not a game.<eos> The boy's seen what he's hiding.<eos> He'll have to make contact with his superior now.<eos> What did he say to you, John?
You're not allowed to sail at night.<eos> Is this your knife'?<eos> - I lost it in Rio yesterday.<eos> - Well, that's strange.<eos> Because it was found on Mr Turner's boat this morning.<eos> And now, even stranger, we can't find Mr Turner.<eos> Well, that's not strange.<eos> I don't know how it got there.<eos> Stop it, John.<eos> What's come over you?
Holtzmann.<eos> Virgo.<eos> Avid skier.<eos> Gluten-full.<eos> And 100% jazzed to meet you.<eos> Don't get too close to her, Holtzmann.<eos> She'll ask you to write a book, and then she'll squash your dreams.<eos> Okay.<eos> Holtzmann works with me here in the lab.<eos> She's a brilliant engineer and very loyal. She would not abandon you.
Really?<eos> When I was eight years old, the mean old lady that lived next door died.<eos> And that night, I woke up and she was standing at the foot of my bed, just staring at me.<eos> She did that every night for almost a year.<eos> What?<eos> And I told my parents, and they didn't believe me.<eos> Still don't believe me.<eos> I had to go to therapy for years, and the kids at school found out, and they would laugh at me and make fun of me, call me "ghost girl."<eos> Abby was the only person who believed me.<eos> Kids is mean, man. But I believe you.
- Yeah, we'll put them on in the car.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Erin!<eos> One second.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Erin!<eos> Hello, Phil.<eos> How do you just completely ignore my calls and messages for a week?<eos> - Me?<eos> Ignore you?
- "Stop"?<eos> I'm just letting you know that I have fucked some very beautiful women.<eos> Good ones.<eos> They don't worry their mommy is gonna steal me away from 'em.<eos> Two hours ago, I would've crawled through glass for you.<eos> And... while I was worried sick, you were...<eos> We're done.<eos> No, Frank.<eos> You were only with me 'cause you can't be alone. Right?<eos> - I was alone when I met you.
It's a big fucking deal.<eos> Auditions were in Paris two weeks ago. - Yeah, cool.<eos> I get it. You're connected.<eos> - Well, listen, my man.<eos> He doesn't wanna bring a celebrity chef to Vegas.<eos> It's been done.<eos> People are over it. Gordon Ramsay, all these people. Blah, blah, blah.<eos> He wants to launch a new star right here, okay?<eos> But he doesn't like any of the chefs that he auditioned.<eos> Frank, I got you in.
To find someone and take her somewhere more private?<eos> I haven't decided yet.<eos> Let me know if you do.<eos> I might be able to help.<eos> - How much?<eos> - A hundred.<eos> The restaurant I am planning is not small, and there will be a lot of visibility.<eos> You are very impressive in the kitchen... but are you strong enough for the pressure, the responsibility of what will be in front of you?<eos> Oui.<eos> Does the ride that just dropped you off mean what I think it means?
Yeah.<eos> I got it.<eos> Yes!<eos> I knew that you would.<eos> You hungry?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Good. 'Cause I'm taking you out.<eos> You saw him.<eos> In Paris.<eos> What did he tell you?
Unfortunately, church finances bein' as they are these days,<eos> I've just been going around to parishioners and askin'.<eos> It'd be nice to get the air-conditionin' fixed.<eos> Money's always tight, but I'll see what I can do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> How's Donnie?<eos> How's he doin'? Donnie's up in Pecos reenactin' the Battle of Fredericksburg.<eos> Donnie's fine.<eos> If things weren't fine... you'd come to me, right?<eos> If Donnie ever hurt you, as a for instance... you should... you should tell me.
You get that, right?<eos> I'm sure it's the job to end all jobs, Tulip.<eos> I imagine they'll be singing songs about it.<eos> Pretty damn close, actually, yeah.<eos> Tell me you don't want to.<eos> Tell me you don't miss it.<eos> I just did.<eos> Twice.<eos> So, you're gonna keep goin' with this preacher thing, huh?<eos> How's that workin' out for you?
Tom Cruise has died.<eos> This footage just coming in from a Church of Scientology service<eos> Cruise was presiding over when apparently... and details are still coming in...<eos> You're right.<eos> Can I have a bottle of 10-year whiskey, if you have it.<eos> Otherwise, I just suppose I'll choke down a bottle of...<eos> "Ratwater."<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Evening, Padre.<eos> What's the matter with you?
It's...<eos> I'm getting... I had to jump out of a plane 30.000 feet.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Meantime, stay out of trouble.<eos> Get rid of your credit cards, hold up, and lay low.<eos> Oh, I'm layin' low, all right.<eos> Now, listen, I need you to wire me some...<eos> Oh, come on. You...<eos> The moral of this sad-ass story is don't believe what you hear.<eos> I know the little snitch who told you, too.
One last time.<eos> But I want an answer.<eos> Right now.<eos> Or that's it.<eos> I'm done.<eos> God... please forgive me.<eos> Yeah... thought as much.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> You, too.<eos> Much bigger things are comin' for you.
Ah, hell.<eos> Get his legs.<eos> Get off now!<eos> Quit moving!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Millie!<eos> Millie!<eos> 33% of deaths happen while someone is watching.<eos> But Henry wasn't there on that Tuesday penny died.<eos> I wonder why it is, when life turns on you, you go back to those places in your mind, those places you knew, that made you happy, made you feel safe.
Get off now!<eos> Quit moving!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Millie!<eos> Millie!<eos> 33% of deaths happen while someone is watching.<eos> But Henry wasn't there on that Tuesday penny died.<eos> I wonder why it is, when life turns on you, you go back to those places in your mind, those places you knew, that made you happy, made you feel safe.<eos> Sometimes it's the spark of a memory, like the places we've been, things we done before, or people we knew or loved.<eos> In the end, I think that's what it's all about, the people that left a mark on you.
Stay away from me!<eos> .<eos> .<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> Aurora.<eos> I know nothing I can say will make this okay.<eos> But please listen.<eos> I was so alone for so long.<eos> I felt like I was disappearing.<eos> The night I first saw you, I was ready to... You saved my life.
The outer door is jammed.<eos> We got to open that door and cool the reactor down or the whole ship's going to blow.<eos> How?<eos> I got to go out there.<eos> Open it from the outside.<eos> I open the door I get cleared.<eos> You blow that fire into space.<eos> - You get cleared?<eos> - You talk to me through this.<eos> What happens to you when that door opens?
A witch?<eos> I'm talking a flying, spell-casting, making-shit-disappear witch. A sorceress from another dimension. Another world.<eos> Archeologist Dr. June Moone, wandered into the wrong cave.<eos> June.<eos> She opened something she shouldn't have... releasing a metahuman more powerful than any we've encountered.<eos> The Enchantress.<eos> She inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.<eos> And where is this witch?<eos> In my pocket.<eos> Now tell him why she won't turn you into a frog.
Don't worry, I still love you.<eos> Welcome to Belle Reve, special security barracks. How you doing, man?<eos> Why don't you kiss her ass?<eos> She's in charge. Welcome, ma'am. How are you?<eos> I'm here to assist you in any way.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Are you the Devil?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Ain't you scared?<eos> Why'd they put you down here?
Tell them, Put it down.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Colonel, for the record, this is exactly what I was concerned about.<eos> What's for dinner?<eos> Ames, if this man shoots me, I want you to kill him, and I want you to go clear my browser history.<eos> See... the firing pin is filed down, alright? Mag full of dummy rounds. If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> Why would we give a loaded weapon to an infamous hitman?<eos> Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.<eos> Don't empty nothing. You don't even know this lady. I've known you, like nine months.
Injection successful.<eos> Hey! Miss? What was that?<eos> Location verified.<eos> Next!<eos> Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.<eos> Come on.<eos> Shut up, and get it done.<eos> Listen, you're being transferred. I don't know where you're going.<eos> It's from Mr. J.<eos> You gonna tell him I took care of you?
Our body's at the top of that building.<eos> We get up there, pull them out of the vault they're hiding in. Helos extract us off the roof.<eos> It's Miller time.<eos> Check.<eos> Oh, you!<eos> You're not leaving me.<eos> You're not leaving me!<eos> You're a pain in the ass.<eos> I have done, everything you said. Every test, every trial, every initiation.<eos> I have proved I love you. Just accept it.
Let me in, I promise I won't hurt you.<eos> A promise-promise?<eos> Hey, dickface!<eos> Mind screaming at your bitch somewhere else?<eos> I was gonna say, I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> Don't hurt me.<eos> I'll be your friend.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it, do it, do it.<eos> My heart scares you and a gun doesn't?
Hell, no.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't want your crazy.<eos> Says the guy who lives in a sewer.<eos> At least I know it's a sewer.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> 'Cause like, this is a sewer, too, only with nice shops and restaurants, right?<eos> You hate mankind much?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Mommy didn't take you to Chuck E. Cheese on your sixth birthday.
We don't want you here.<eos> You get to the part in that binder saying I was sleeping with her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I never been with a witch before. What's that like?<eos> Apparently, that's why the creatures chase him all the time. 'Cause, the witch is scared of him.<eos> The only woman I ever cared about, is trapped inside that monster.<eos> If I don't stop the witch, it's over. Everything is over.<eos> Everything.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Your daughter writes you every day.
I don't have a cat.<eos> Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?<eos> Anyhoo, tell me something... what situation isn't improved by pizza?<eos> Do you happen to know a Meghan Orflosky?<eos> Getting that right?<eos> Orflosky?<eos> Orlovsky?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Good.<eos> Because she knows you.
Bernadette is not going anywhere, because you're not going anywhere.<eos> Drink.<eos> You're right.<eos> Cancer is only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain.<eos> All things I can live without.<eos> You belong here at home.<eos> Surrounded by your Voltron and your Bernadette, and your me.<eos> Listen, we both know that cancer is a shit-show.<eos> Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff-opening-for-the- Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa-State-Fair shit-show.<eos> And under no circumstances will I take you to that show.
And you are?<eos> Negasonic Teenage Warhead.<eos> Negasonic Teenage...<eos> What the shit?<eos> That's the coolest name ever!<eos> So, what, you're like, his sidekick?<eos> No.<eos> Trainee.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> X-Men left you behind on what?
Quite unfortunate.<eos> That does it!<eos> Canada!<eos> That's not good.<eos> Wade, please.<eos> Cock shot!<eos> Your poor wife.<eos> You really should stop.<eos> All the dinosaurs feared the T. rex.<eos> I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
You ever see 127 Hours?<eos> Spoiler alert.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Nasty.<eos> There's the money shot, baby.<eos> Are You There God?<eos> It's Me, Margaret.<eos> Rock, meet bottom.<eos> And when life ends up breathtakingly fucked... you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.<eos> The one that sent you down the road to Shitsburgh.
Where's Francis?<eos> No!<eos> Please!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I'm so sorry!<eos> You little spider monkey!<eos> Where... is...<eos> Francis?<eos> This is confusing.<eos> Is it sexist to hit you? Is it more sexist to not hit you?
Every time I see her, it's like the first time... Especially from this angle.<eos> You can't buy love, but you can rent it for three minutes.<eos> You weak motherfucker!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, get it together.<eos> This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Maximum effort.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> Someone out back asking for you.
Yeah, I'm excited to start.<eos> Sales Analyst. It sounds so impressive.<eos> Junior Sales Analyst. But the "Junior" is gonna be gone by Christmas.<eos> And Will's finally being paid at LA Weekly.<eos> - Way to go, you two. - I know.<eos> I told you guys, we're a power couple.<eos> Will, there's a little something to get you started.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> Will, did I ever tell you what my first job was?
Go, go, go... - Still here? Still here?<eos> And I better fucking win!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - I need a sexy video of you.<eos> - Yeah, I don't think so.<eos> I made an appointment to donate sperm.<eos> What?<eos> Your best idea for making rent is masturbating into a cup?<eos> I'm an accomplished masturbator.<eos> Will, I don't know what's going on with you.
Could you put me in touch with that fellow from your video?<eos> Yes, sir. In six months to a year. Depending on good behavior.<eos> What the fuck? What the fuck!<eos> How is it possible to be this bad?<eos> Ball.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kwan, let's review the basics.<eos> Give and go!<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Big Stuff, anyone ever show you how to set a pick?
I mean, she was on my ass about my e-mails, and my Facebook page, and how I dress in front of everybody.<eos> It was humiliating.<eos> Wait, this isn't how you dress at work, is it? Dad, I'm the video guy.<eos> Who cares what I look like?<eos> Look, just stop, okay? Stop for a second.<eos> Your clients pay $30,000 for your services.<eos> They care what you look like.<eos> You need to conform to their standards, not the other way around.<eos> And the fact that you can't grasp that is mind-boggling!<eos> What is up with you?
They were $779.<eos> I know. I just... I just want them to take me seriously at work.<eos> Everybody takes you seriously.<eos> - They do?<eos> - Yes, they do.<eos> Sophomore year. We're running Ultimate Frisbee drills down in the lounge.<eos> Ethan comes in and says that there's a situation that I need to handle downstairs.<eos> So, I go downstairs, and I see this tiny little person in pajamas and slippers, and she is so, so angry.<eos> I was trying to study.<eos> The moment that I saw you, I knew that you were someone to take seriously.
- No, no, no.<eos> What I'm saying is that she said that I should talk to you. About, you know...<eos> I have ADD.<eos> You know there's two Fernandos in this office?<eos> Fernando Little, Director of Client Services,<eos> Division Sales Leader, three years running. And Fernando, the janitor.<eos> Mi madre, she's a psychiatrist.<eos> So, I can hook you up with whatever you need.<eos> Those are drugs.<eos> Saw you last night.
I've rid this company of the dead wood.<eos> We are leaner and meaner.<eos> This is a contract.<eos> It's a what?<eos> You're now Vice President of Corporate Communications.<eos> Your salary is $52,000.<eos> 52,000?<eos> You'll be doing the work of three people.<eos> Get used to eating dinner at your desk.<eos> Now that I've turned you around, it was easier to kick you upstairs than to train someone new.
She's about to get to the Living Legend achievement.<eos> This is fucking crazy, man!<eos> She's on a killing spree.<eos> Killing frenzy.<eos> - Your girlfriend is a fucking prodigy, bro.<eos> - Bong me.<eos> You light it.<eos> Light it for her.<eos> "Bong me"?<eos> Hey, what's up with you, man?
I, uh, said my backpack is heavy.<eos> Stupid books.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Freak.<eos> See, Max?<eos> I protected you.<eos> Whoa! Incoming.<eos> Max?<eos> Sofia.<eos> What happened to you yesterday?
I have to run.<eos> I'm really late for my Zumba class.<eos> The girl creature appears to cause increases in heart rate and respiration.<eos> Perhaps you should avoid contact with her.<eos> Perhaps you should shut up.<eos> See?<eos> She has made you angry.<eos> Okay, we should be good here.<eos> I don't know, Max.<eos> It seems like that girl creature must have put out some kind of mind control virus on you.
Turn on your TV now.<eos> Look at your TV.<eos> Now. Now.<eos> Turn on Channel 4.<eos> Bridget, I've found him.<eos> He's the dating website guru.<eos> See, you have to trust the science.<eos> Algorithms don't lie.<eos> You slept with a fucking billionaire.<eos> So, tell us, Bridget. What was it that initially attracted you to the billionaire Jack Qwant?
Thank you for sharing that with us.<eos> Bridget, what are you doing?<eos> You wouldn't believe some of the weirdos that cross my path.<eos> Really?<eos> - Get up.<eos> Can you tell me what she's doing?<eos> Ask him something about algorithms.<eos> - Have to be the last question. Have to be.<eos> Lastly, algorithms.<eos> - Yes. What first attracted you to them?
What's he doing here?<eos> Because at 'Hard News', we believe...<eos> We believe that we are ready and on the front line... asking the questions the world wants answers to.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Career down the toilet.<eos> Both men in the same room.<eos> What could possibly go wrong?<eos> I hope you don't mind me just showing up and surprising you.
- Get out, both of you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I've changed my mind.<eos> I've changed my mind.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You can.<eos> We can do it together.<eos> Just think what lifes thrown at you already.<eos> You've turned disasters into triumphs... with your sheer, joyful, indefatigable, infectious lust for life.<eos> You've managed this entire pregnancy almost entirely on your own... despite a lunatic mother, repressed men and cheating boyfriends who don't deserve you.
- Look, if this is about my copy...<eos> - It's terrific.<eos> You're the best I got.<eos> You write like they wrote back in the day.<eos> Cigarettes, little brown hats.<eos> Things that say: "Scoop." No, I love your copy.<eos> - So what's this about?<eos> - Your copy.<eos> Jesus, Chester!<eos> I put you on a story about rising mortgage rates.
Oh.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was starting to think that no one in new English had any social graces.<eos> This town soured long before you were born, dear.<eos> I could tell by the warm welcome.<eos> Frigid, right?<eos> Well, fuck 'em!<eos> Town this small, this old, you can measure its age in secrets.<eos> Like the rings on a redwood.<eos> What brings you to me?
' ' No!<eos> No, no, really.<eos> I'm doing you a great kindness here.<eos> I don't expect you to understand, but this is probably the last good deed I'm gonna do with my wretched life.<eos> Believe me, the alternative they got planned for you out in the forest is much, much worse.<eos> Julia Howard, this town has awaited your return like lambs to the slaughter.<eos> The two that got away.<eos> The only blood in new English that survived.<eos> Well, I'm gonna give you an out that I couldn't give your sister.<eos> You just consider this bullet to be the savior of what's waiting for you out there in that forest.
Hello?<eos> James?<eos> Who is that?<eos> You look exactly how I remembered.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> Lane?<eos> I guess she couldn't have let you go.<eos> She had to find people who remember.<eos> Draw us apart, you understood?<eos> You have to do what she tells you!
I know I certainly haven't.<eos> If I could get the president to admit, on tape, to ordering the hit on Masovich, I could probably get them to turn against each other.<eos> Maybe get one of them to flip.<eos> You're definitely gonna get yourself killed.<eos> I'm not talking about me.<eos> You.<eos> Tomorrow night at the inauguration, wearing a wire.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> - This could be your chance to start making a difference.<eos> I promise... I won't let anything happen to you.
I doubted you the whole time, but... I was wrong.<eos> You are... him.<eos> Him who?<eos> - The Ghost.<eos> - Yes, the Ghost.<eos> And as to you, Agent Bolivar, I hope he was right when he said that you are a patriot.<eos> Will you help me make a real difference here?<eos> - I will.<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> Juan is gonna take you up to the compound and bring you up to speed.
Got your Netflix.<eos> Jack Ryan and Jack Reacher.<eos> Tonight's gonna be a total Jack-off.<eos> You have something else here.<eos> What is it?<eos> Open it.<eos> Gryootings, Derek Zoolownder.<eos> Are you a Boxtroll?<eos> That's Alexanya Atoz, owner of the largest fashion empire in the world.<eos> Because you are one of the world's true fishion icons, I have personal selected you to come to Rome... The Eturnanal Cyootee...
Slash-guy who has got to stop beating himself up about that!<eos> Slash-guy who couldn't make spaghetti soft so they took away his son, so-slash-now he's alone and hiding from the world.<eos> Slash.<eos> Slash-have you ever even tried to get your son back?<eos> You can do that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You'd hire a litigator, he files the appropriate paperwork...<eos> But I don't even know where he is.<eos> First things first.<eos> If you take this job that Alexanya's offering you, you could prove to Child Services that you're a productive member of society again.
You bastard!<eos> I'm sorry. I'd love to keep talking about this, but I seem to have developed a nasty itch.<eos> I'd ask you to scratch it for me, but no doubt you'd think I was just trying to trick you.<eos> Or you're trying to make me think I shouldn't help you.<eos> In which case, I should do the opposite of that and help you.<eos> Or don't help me.<eos> I think that's even a better option.<eos> You're trying to switch it around on me, but I won't take the bait.<eos> Sorry, Mugatu.<eos> I'm going with my first instinct. And helping you.
For safety. And buoyancy.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> We are swimming back to Rome.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just talked to your dad.<eos> And we've got to get you out of here pronto.<eos> I never want to see him again.<eos> What're you talking about?<eos> Your dad's a great guy. He loves you like you're his own.
What're you talking about?<eos> Your dad's a great guy. He loves you like you're his own.<eos> I am his own!<eos> He's literally the worst father ever!<eos> Do you know it would break your mom's heart to hear you bugging out on your dad like this?<eos> You knew my mom?<eos> Yeah. One of the most amazing women I ever met.<eos> Really?<eos> You didn't want to cross her in the sack.<eos> Those hips of hers would put a love lock on you to beat the band.
Mugatu!<eos> - D.J.<eos> - Wait. We don't have backup yet.<eos> Jacobeem Mugowto has deliver us the Choosen Why-yun.<eos> And behold.<eos> God expunged Steve from the Garden, only to redeem us with eternal youth... No. ...bathed in the blood of the fat little Chosen One!<eos> - Derek!<eos> - Derek, don't.<eos> No!<eos> I don't care if you're fat anymore, Derek Jr. I love you.
Why don't you try, "The People's House"? Make it more personal.<eos> Welcome to The People's House.<eos> We're so proud to call it home.<eos> Better?<eos> When will Jack join us?<eos> They want to hear from you.<eos> They think I'm a fool.<eos> One year in office, wasting their money.<eos> That's why you need to show them what you've done.<eos> The President will join you in the Monroe Room at the end of the tour.
No, please don't.<eos> Because the last time you did that, they added a month to your tour.<eos> Come on.<eos> Tell me that wasn't the best 2 minutes of your life.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I would like my fiance back permanently.<eos> What was that?<eos> We've been getting these power surges for the last couple of days.<eos> You take a look at the houses I send you?
This is too much for me!<eos> What is wrong with her?<eos> She's... she's little!<eos> - She knows better!<eos> - I mean, it's just pee.<eos> No, she's supposed to go on the potty.<eos> I have the book. My neighbor gave me the training book.<eos> She knows what to do, she just doesn't want to do it!<eos> God, this is just so hard.<eos> Nobody tells you how hard it's going to be.
Is she all right sleeping there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Her breathing is so fast.<eos> Is that bad?<eos> No.<eos> Isn't she just the coolest, weirdest little thing you've ever seen?<eos> Yes.<eos> She's just so little.<eos> She's got those, like, tiny little toenails, it just blows my mind.<eos> Then they grow up and hate you, and it really blows your mind.
- Did he really say that?<eos> - Shh.<eos> Carlos, just a minute.<eos> That's Eva Fenton.<eos> Can we not just cut him loose?<eos> So I have $215,000 left?<eos> Just about.<eos> - Then why don't we just stay here?<eos> - Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible.<eos> Half the money belongs to you, Maddie. - What?
You know, Perry wants you to model for him.<eos> I told him only I'm allowed to paint you.<eos> You only ever put me in for the perspective.<eos> No, I put you in because I want you there.<eos> Right.<eos> I have to get to the warden's post.<eos> It's a writing job.<eos> Well done, Catrin.<eos> When there's a raid, I want you to go down to the tube station.<eos> I didn't bring you all the way from Wales to see you hit by a bomb.
You didn't choose me.<eos> I'll come back in a few days and move my things.<eos> Oh, for God's sake, the flat's yours.<eos> You're the one who pays the rent.<eos> Anyway, I'm going to Manchester tomorrow.<eos> They decided to take the exhibition on tour.<eos> It's a success, then?<eos> It's a success.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> You know, the first time I painted you outside the steelworks... maybe I shouldn't have shown you walking away.
- Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mrs. Cole!<eos> The boss wants to try a take without Uncle Frank's lines 'cause he says we are losing visual tension.<eos> Mr. Hilliard is talking about the integrity of the story, saying he will play the scene as you wrote it or not at all.<eos> - Nobody's had any sleep and you're just--<eos> - It's all right. I'm coming.<eos> No.<eos> Let me deal with it.<eos> Once Hilliard gets his hands on you, he won't let you go for hours, and I was rather hoping to do that myself.
Oh, Barnabus.<eos> You're my only friend in this whole miserable world.<eos> Dad was right.<eos> I'll never ever, never ever, never be happy.<eos> Never.<eos> Never say never.<eos> Chad.<eos> Todd.<eos> Chef, where did you come from?<eos> My father banished you 20 years ago.
No!<eos> Bridget, if you go in there without us, you know what they'll do.<eos> I know.<eos> But, Bridget...<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay, Poppy.<eos> You showed me what it feels like to be happy.<eos> I never would have known if it wasn't for you.<eos> And I love you for that.<eos> I love you too, Bridget.
Fuck, I hate this fucking job!<eos> You okay?<eos> Everyone okay?<eos> That's super fucked up about Bill and those guys.<eos> They stayed in their package, followed all the guidelines of the song.<eos> - We're not supposed to understand... the will of the gods.<eos> They work in mysterious ways.<eos> Since we base our lives on the song, it might be nice if there was some proof.<eos> Proof?<eos> All the proof you need is right in front of you.
Fifty-five minutes.<eos> I know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Looks like you got ditched, bun.<eos> He wouldn't ditch me, dumbass.<eos> I mean... we touched T-I-Ps.<eos> We touched tips Just the tips Oh, we touched our tips<eos> Sorry, I don't know why I'm singing.<eos> Sometimes I get nervous And I'll sing!<eos> Maybe that's why he ditched you.
You don't think that because I'm out of the package he thinks I'm not pure?<eos> God. I didn't want to say it, but I do have that not-so-fresh feeling.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you a bun?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> And you've been traveling with a sausage?<eos> Yes! Yes, I have!<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> I have!<eos> He's looking for you in my aisle.
Fuck.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I gotta show them.<eos> They need to know how wrong they all are before it's too late!<eos> Sammy, bubula, where have you been?<eos> Oh, I'm surprised that savage Lavash didn't stone you to death.
No way.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I gotta show them.<eos> They need to know how wrong they all are before it's too late!<eos> Sammy, bubula, where have you been?<eos> Oh, I'm surprised that savage Lavash didn't stone you to death.<eos> You had to travel with a bagel?<eos> How much did his dirty hands steal from you?
"I can face blunt fact better than damnable incertitude.<eos> "Give me the damn straight plain truth right now, damn you!<eos> "Tom."<eos> "Talked of everywhere as a truly important book.<eos> "All comparisons with greatest writers.<eos> "Even James Joyce."<eos> "Hell, Joyce wishes he was so good."<eos> "Had to rush out five editions of the book. "Thirty thousand copies.<eos> "Never seen a book so talked about.<eos> "They're calling you a genius again, god help you.
Well, you know tom, he's exuberant.<eos> Bullshit. He's starting to believe what they say about him.<eos> Same thing that happened to Fitzgerald.<eos> Gets to hear he's the great man of letters so many times, he starts to believe it.<eos> Then he's got to live up to it and then he stops writing.<eos> Tom has to write, it's in his blood.<eos> Well, they said the same thing about Scott five years ago.<eos> Most elegant writer i ever knew.<eos> Now the poor son of a bitch can't string five words together to save his own life.<eos> You know tom will leave you soon.
Listen to you.<eos> I'm not some rude mechanical.<eos> Scott!<eos> You old bastard.<eos> Tom! I tried to tell that to Max.<eos> I mean...<eos> Tell me, Scott.<eos> Does... Does he... Does he make you take a lot out?<eos> He doesn't make me do anything.<eos> Well, does he "advise" you to take a lot out?
If today was a great day.<eos> And he needs to write as much as you do.<eos> He fights over every word.<eos> Then, he should fight more.<eos> His wife is going mad!<eos> Nobody cares about what he writes or even remembers him anymore.<eos> Can you imagine what that's like?<eos> Don't blame me for his weakness.<eos> It hurts me to see you so cruel.<eos> So I've disappointed you, yet again.
You don't know what it is to wake up and grab hold of life every day and fight with it.<eos> You're just so goddamn scared to live.<eos> There are other ways to live!<eos> There's loving your children and seeing them grow up right.<eos> There's providing for your family.<eos> There's doing work that's important and giving to other people.<eos> That's enough.<eos> No, I've taken your abuse 'cause I told myself you were worth it.<eos> That the work was worth it.<eos> But god help anyone who loves you, tom.
Max thinks he created me. You know that?<eos> Like pygmalion.<eos> He thinks... he thinks he found this ugly lump of Carolina Clay and molded it into me.<eos> They say i don't even write my own books.<eos> They say I can't write my own books.<eos> It's all because of Max and his brilliant editing.<eos> I hear it everywhere I go.<eos> Wouldn't I be lost without Max?<eos> What would I do without the great Maxwell Perkins?<eos> So he finally stood up to you.
He crippled me.<eos> He deformed my work.<eos> He as much admitted it.<eos> And then he tried to take all the credit for my success.<eos> He did no such thing.<eos> Do you know how much you hurt him?<eos> We hurt each other.<eos> Don't be glib with me, tom.<eos> You don't know what he did to me.<eos> What he did to you?
Is he coming back?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> See, tom's the kind of fellow who needs to make his own way through life.<eos> Is he mad at us? No, honey.<eos> No, sometimes people just go away.<eos> They have to grow up, leave home.<eos> It'll happen to you, too.<eos> Poor daddy.<eos> I miss him, too.<eos> Tell you what, get me his book.
Oh, yeah?<eos> I didn't know you were divorced.<eos> Oh, God, no. That'd be crushing.<eos> - Hmm. - But I get it.<eos> On one level, it must seem like, uh,<eos> "I'm signing away a huge chunk of my life "that I'm never getting back."<eos> That's it? No other level?<eos> - No, that's it.<eos> Uh, initials. - Oh.<eos> Hey. There are good things ahead for you, okay?
Hey...<eos> You bring it on yourself, Nate.<eos> You know, I do have a girlfriend. I know.<eos> She's a human woman, and we've done it.<eos> Maybe just don't talk about her so much at work.<eos> It's just gonna make those guys jealous.<eos> You know, not only are you their boss, but you also have a hot girlfriend.<eos> You know?<eos> - It's too much.<eos> I hate you. - Yeah.
It's going really, really well.<eos> - Hmm. - Phase one's complete.<eos> Why don't you come on in?<eos> I thought you were going to London.<eos> I was on my way to the airport, but I thought I would stop by and have a tour of your bachelor pad.<eos> Well, that didn't take long.<eos> How did you know about my divorce?<eos> Oh, you changed your emergency contact to "self."<eos> And nobody single by choice would live this close to the freeway.<eos> Is that robe why your wife left you?
Where is your girlfriend?<eos> Listen, man, we've had enough trouble with your sister already.<eos> So I'd really appreciate it if you leave Trish alone.<eos> What the hell were you doing in there?<eos> - Bill, stop. - Stop!<eos> Why do you always have to get so fucked up?<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Come here.<eos> You must be Jacob.<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?
- You heard me.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Does he think I'm dealing or something?<eos> That's what I've been told.<eos> - Patricia, who is this guy?<eos> - It's Bianca's brother.<eos> - Really?<eos> It's good to meet you, mate.<eos> Welcome.<eos> What brings you to this neck of the woods?
All his shit was still there.<eos> I don't fucking know, man.<eos> He just left, all right?<eos> She wasn't even fucking mad.<eos> She was just scared.<eos> What happened after that?<eos> She came to me one day and gave me a fucking bag with all her shit in it, and told me not to tell Zico.<eos> I mean, I don't know, man.<eos> She was fucking freaked out about something.<eos> What do you want me to tell you?
- You've seen this guy's teeth?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> You can tell a lot from a person's teeth.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Like he's not going to go away.<eos> Like he's not going to screw up.<eos> - We have to deal with him, Mike.<eos> - Seven hundred and fif...?<eos> No fucking way.<eos> Did Bianca ever talk to you about where she was from?
The more jobs we do with these guys...<eos> The more they squeeze us.<eos> Fucking Russians.<eos> Well, Vassili kept things tight, at least you knew where you were. But this bitch... I don't know.<eos> Man, no shit. I can almost feel her breathing down our necks.<eos> I'll tell you what though, man.
All right.<eos> Tell you what, l1lgetbaHs deep in your pink, you fucking feel me?<eos> You, uh, want to take care of your partner over there?<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Them cuffs a little too tight. You fucking punk bitch...<eos> Shut the hell up!<eos> Yo, Snaps. What's up with your hyna here...<eos> Shut the hell up.<eos> Pinche mayate!<eos> Hey, didn't the cop tell you to shut the fuck up?
Black Sabbath.<eos> Who the fuck is Black Sabbath?<eos> Hey, y'all rug rats don't go to school?<eos> Get out of here. Go to school, man.<eos> I will arrest your little ass.<eos> - Okay, stay on that. - Okay.<eos> I got two or three more sources to check in with.<eos> I'll call in later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, uh... Hey, someone named Sweet Pea called you back.
Have you looked at what's inside?<eos> This.<eos> It's a locker in the North Station in Paris.<eos> What will you do with that much money?<eos> What will we do.<eos> We'll see.<eos> He won't be out for a while.<eos> We have plenty of time to think about it.<eos> I'll be back in a month.<eos> Judge Ferrer will call you to testify.
Can we have a moment alone?<eos> I'm a bad person. No, you're not.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> - Am I a bad person? - Of course not.<eos> - I'm a bad person.<eos> - Honey, it's okay.<eos> - I'm a bad person.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Those earrings look great on you.
Next time I'll come later.<eos> This is my second warning, Paco.<eos> You can come anytime.<eos> You're in trouble, Paco.<eos> I have Roldan's documents.<eos> You can't touch me.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I don't think you'll dare to find out.<eos> You know there's nothing in those documents.<eos> They won't protect you from the law.

Hey, Paul?<eos> It's not your fault, mate you got shit for brains!<eos> I can't help all of ya!<eos> It's alright, mate.<eos> You're not my type.<eos> - That's not what you said the last time you saw me.<eos> - What?<eos> My bird!<eos> Is it you?<eos> They finally got you with that taxi, huh?
- Shay.<eos> - Guevara?<eos> Is that you?<eos> - Heard that one before.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Hell of a concert, though, yeah?<eos> I think we might've woken up a couple of corpses.<eos> And isn't this the cherry on top?<eos> Home sweet home.<eos> - What did they get you for, anyway?
Hey.<eos> Thirty-one flavors and I got them all!<eos> I got somebody very, very important that I want you to meet.<eos> The best trainer in the history of boxing.<eos> Ray Arcel.<eos> He has trained more world champs than anyone else in boxing history.<eos> Relax.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I told you I would bring you to the Madison Square Garden.
Give me the money.<eos> I got no money.<eos> He's just a kid!<eos> - Wassup, kid?<eos> - Wassup.<eos> - All good?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Clearly, all is great.<eos> I can get you out.<eos> But let me be clear... If you are caught fighting or stealing... I'll bring you back myself and leave you here.
I can get you out.<eos> But let me be clear... If you are caught fighting or stealing... I'll bring you back myself and leave you here.<eos> So you are gonna train me?<eos> They're not all gonna be this easy.<eos> Sometimes... You need to get points.<eos> There's technique...<eos> Rules.<eos> Cheats.<eos> Movement.<eos> You learning everything I tell you?
She's good, thanks.<eos> 20 years since your heroic mission to expand boxing to the nation.<eos> Boxing expanded.<eos> I wasn't wrong.<eos> Yes and no.<eos> But yes, the sport makes for fantastic television.<eos> And now you're back.<eos> Sort of.<eos> I like you, Ray.<eos> I feel really bad for what they did to you.
Durán, Durán, Durán, Durán, Durán!<eos> Hey!<eos> We love you, Panama!<eos> Durán, Durán, Durán...<eos> Hey, Ray!<eos> Cheers.<eos> - I got a question for you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why you always brushed my hair when we were in the corners?<eos> Fighter punches you, feels proud.
What the fuck?<eos> And you see, and you see his, um, his diet cola commercial?<eos> And he calls himself "Sugar" and he's selling you sugar-free shit.<eos> Or-or maybe, maybe that's what we're gonna have.<eos> A sugar-free fight.<eos> Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah! I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Sorry's not good enough.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> Insult a woman like that?<eos> What's the matter with you?
Just... just let me... let me have respect for Sugar Ray Leonard?<eos> Sure.<eos> Sure.<eos> Leonard.<eos> You are my friend now.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Leonard.<eos> You are my friend now.<eos> All along, he's been doing this on purpose.<eos> He hurt you to drive me crazy.
Look at this.<eos> Leonard.<eos> You are my friend now.<eos> All along, he's been doing this on purpose.<eos> He hurt you to drive me crazy.<eos> To get me to be in his macho tough guy war.<eos> Ray, you're obsessed.<eos> I'm telling you, it's a strategy. It's been a strategy...<eos> I'm gonna fuck your husband in the ring and when I'm done with him, I'm gonna go and fuck you all night, baby.<eos> From the moment he insulted you, he knew that he could get in my head and cause me to stand toe-to-toe with him.
Listen. I think Durán is a tough, impressive, intelligent fighter. And we are in for a serious fight.<eos> You're gonna feel bad.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - Hand me that.<eos> - You can't eat like this.<eos> Pass me that yellow thing.<eos> Why didn't I get wings when I asked?<eos> You have plenty.<eos> And why were you looking at Leonard?<eos> Don't start with that. You think I didn't see you?
- You can't eat like this.<eos> Pass me that yellow thing.<eos> Why didn't I get wings when I asked?<eos> You have plenty.<eos> And why were you looking at Leonard?<eos> Don't start with that. You think I didn't see you?<eos> Don't fool me.<eos> - You think I'm stupid?<eos> - Insane is what you are.<eos> I saw him winking at you. And you were all smiles.
Those boys'll ride with you.<eos> God, we work hard in this business, sometimes for nuthin'.<eos> I wake up every morning, I tell myself: "I don't have to do this".<eos> I get to do this.<eos> And then it's just... blue skies.<eos> Blue skies, baby.<eos> My old man... the legend.<eos> That was the last time I saw him alive.<eos> Pour one for Kenny.<eos> God bless you, Roy!
It's from a poem that I read when I was a kid.<eos> A bird with no feet... sleeps in the wind.<eos> Ese, Ese, Ese!<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Mike! Mike!<eos> Hey!<eos> You see.<eos> They look worse every time we get one.<eos> Do you remember when I told you about patience?<eos> Yeah, you know what I told you about money?
It's a dime out of every one of my dollars, not your dollars!<eos> I said "No" a second ago.<eos> You want to invest? We got the gold.<eos> We can talk about it.<eos> We don't need a fucking partner!<eos> You know there's something about finding gold.<eos> It's so difficult to put into words.<eos> It's very difficult.<eos> The taste of it on your tongue... the feel of it between your fingers... it's electric.<eos> It's like a drug... because it hooks you.
I like my shitty life.<eos> It's mine!<eos> Why don't you give it a thought?<eos> You always wanted a broken bird, didn't you?<eos> Said the right things but, in here, you never fuckin' believed it, did ya?<eos> You never believed in me, did you, Katie? Hmm?<eos> You like to be losin', don't ya?<eos> Damn, you don't know. Come on, admit it.<eos> Does it feel comfortable Kay?<eos> These people are using you.
A clown.<eos> Out of your league.<eos> Fuck them.<eos> Fuck them. You know what?<eos> Fuck you too!<eos> You think I want to hear it from the fucking golden boy... standing there in his golden glow telling me how messed up everything is, huh?<eos> Now, go fuckin' back to your perch at the Jakarta Palace, huh.<eos> Ah, you can use that instinct of yours to find some new strike with some new people.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> I know you, man.
I'll call you back.<eos> The New York Stock Exchange just suspended trading.<eos> They're taking Washoe off the Board.<eos> You sold some, right? Yeah!<eos> Of course.<eos> Bobby?<eos> I thought...<eos> I thought it was just gonna keep on going up.<eos> Damn it, Bobby!<eos> I told you from the beginning... just put some away.
What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> I'm about to get fucking married, Grandpa!<eos> In one week! To a Jewish girl!<eos> And I just woke up in fucking jail with a bunch of penises on my forehead in the shape of a swastika!<eos> Could call it a swasticock.<eos> What?<eos> It's a play on words.<eos> A play on words.<eos> Play on these words.<eos> I'm dropping you off at your old army vet buddy's house, he's gonna drive you to fucking Boca.
Here we go, ladies.<eos> Time to strap on a feedbag.<eos> Yeah, chow time.<eos> And every good meal needs a little booze.<eos> Bronn?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's okay. I got a soda around here somewhere.<eos> God bless you. I don't know how you can do it.
Michael!<eos> Uh... - Honey, not now, okay?<eos> - No?<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah. - I wanna talk to you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Kids are up.<eos> Mikey.<eos> Hey, I told you not to leave the tap running in the kitchen.
In the wall.<eos> Well, maybe Jenny's hungry, too.<eos> Come on.<eos> Steph.<eos> You in there?<eos> Mom! What the hell?<eos> Did you burn something in the kitchen?<eos> Close the frickin' door!<eos> Jesus H.!<eos> Mikey, I told you not to do this.
I'll do it.<eos> It's just a quick jog around the block.<eos> Twenty minutes max, okay?<eos> What is up with that dog?<eos> Yeah, she...<eos> She's...<eos> She's not like that. She doesn't...<eos> She... I don't know. She doesn't enjoy it.<eos> I don't know. My birthday?<eos> Yeah, look, I would if I could, but I told you how things are right now. It's just nuts with work and, um...
I've got to study.<eos> Michael.<eos> Hey, sweetie, what're you doing?<eos> I kept hearing weird noises last night.<eos> Freaked myself out, so I came in here.<eos> What kind of noises?<eos> Can you tell Michael to stay out of my room?<eos> He keeps leaving dirty hand marks everywhere.<eos> Hey, big guy.<eos> Something's bugging you, huh?
- Thanks, Mom!<eos> - Okay. - Bye!<eos> - Bye.<eos> Okay, mister.<eos> How about peanut butter and jelly?<eos> I think it's time that we went and watched your favorite television show.<eos> Okay? I'm just gonna finish up in here.<eos> And Keensy can keep you company.<eos> Keensy!<eos> What's gotten into you?
With the house? You got goblins and fairies up in the attic?<eos> What do you got?<eos> These guys aren't interested in our little soap opera.<eos> Thank you so much for dinner.<eos> Honey, I think we probably should hit it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go. - Yeah, thanks. This was amazing.<eos> - What are you so angry about?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> I embarrassed you in front of Simon?
Honestly, he is unbearable.<eos> - That may be true.<eos> - It is true.<eos> But he's my unbearable boss who is now going to tell the entire goddamn office that my wife can't get through a single dinner without bringing up our personal family problems.<eos> Thanks for dragging me along.<eos> Steph, where's Michael?<eos> Mikey?<eos> Mikey?<eos> Mikey.<eos> Honey. Sweetie, I told you not to play in here until we clean it up.
Hey!<eos> Who's up there?<eos> Jenny, is that you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Stephanie, come on.<eos> Okay, it's okay.<eos> Sit right here.<eos> No, no, no, no! Dad, don't leave me!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm gonna get you. It's okay.
This has been a really fun night.<eos> I'm sorry if I flipped out on you on the Ferris wheel earlier.<eos> Oh.<eos> No, my timing was just bizarre.<eos> I'm going through a lot of shit right now.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> I'm sorry you're going through stuff.<eos> You're a really great guy, Erwin.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> I look at you and I just see this really, really, really old man.
You're gonna press a button that sucks me into the drain, aren't you?<eos> Dickhead You're such a dickhead<eos> Oh, my God. And everybody knows it<eos> Everyone but you<eos> You're a dickhead<eos> I hope you'll soon be dead<eos> And this is payback time for what you put me through<eos> You're a dickhead<eos> Everybody's said<eos> I hope you like the song so screw you
If you think you're keeping that phone, you are dreaming.<eos> The second you come home, that phone is going.<eos> I am done.<eos> I am done trying to understand you.<eos> Come on. Please.<eos> Please, God, help me.<eos> Why do I even bother?<eos> Why do I even...<eos> You've never given me one thing.<eos> Any time I ask you for anything, you're like,
I'm just messing with you.<eos> Yeah, I'm just messing with you.<eos> I set that up.<eos> You shithead.<eos> Yes.<eos> Felt pretty good.<eos> You...<eos> You being nervous for once.<eos> And I'm just over here, like, just sniffing' my flowers.<eos> I hate you so much.
But he never raises a finger to help out.<eos> It's a woman's fate.<eos> Says who?<eos> Says the Bible.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> Your father's a man of the cloth.<eos> He serves God and leaves earthly chores to his wife.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Leave us alone, I have to talk to the girl.<eos> Has your mother told you what it means to be a woman?
It's all right.<eos> I'm old enough.<eos> I know.<eos> God has forgiven me.<eos> I am ready.<eos> Thankyou,Lord.<eos> Thankyou,Almighty.<eos> Yousaw,andforesawall.<eos> Yousawthatmywife didnot dowhatyouexpectedofher.<eos> That she did not love you, or me, as my daughter will.
No, Mama!<eos> Mama!<eos> No!<eos> Mama!<eos> Mama!<eos> I will do to your daughter exactly as I did to you.<eos> I am going to hurt you as much as I can.<eos> I will leave the door open.<eos> I brought you this.<eos> Has your mother told you what it means to be a woman?
He was the one, told me they was lookin' for deputies... Up in Bismuth.<eos> I made myself up a new life there.<eos> About a year ago, the sheriff there got himself shot.<eos> And I was chosen to replace him.<eos> And while I was cleaning out his office... I found this.<eos> You should've changed your name, Liz.<eos> How many Elizabeth Brundys you figure there are in this world?<eos> And how many of 'em you figure don't got no tongue?<eos> Elizabeth Brundy, I hereby arrest you for the murder of Frank Blain, your former employer and proprietor of Frank's Inferno.<eos> Your past done caught up with you, Liz.
She had to wear special shoes made of lead, to keep her from floating away.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> She's still on the island, I believe.<eos> My mama and papa sent me there, to live with the special children.<eos> And now Tygrysku, time for sleep.<eos> He used to call me Tygrysku.<eos> It's Polish for little tiger.<eos> He couldn't have picked a less appropriate nickname.<eos> I was always a chicken.<eos> Why did your mom and dad send you away?
You looked like him.<eos> Just for a moment, before you started screaming, running away, and concussing yourself.<eos> Wait.<eos> What's happening?<eos> We're waiting until the coast is clear before we go into the loop.<eos> You never know who might be watching. Wait.<eos> Before we, before we go into what?<eos> Please, Jake.<eos> Miss Peregrine's waiting.<eos> She saw you on the ferry.
Police?<eos> Are you implying Abe died an unnatural death?<eos> I found him in the woods. With his eyes missing.<eos> I'd say that was pretty unnatural.<eos> Unless essential, I don't discuss unpleasant matters.<eos> An Ymbryne's duty is to protect children, Jake.<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> He wanted you to tell me everything!<eos> How frustrating for you.<eos> Between Miss Peregrine's rules, and my housemates little pact not to scare you off, it's like no one's telling you anything!
Here I come!<eos> Cold?<eos> Wait till the blood freezes in your veins.<eos> Hey!<eos> That was your attempt to rescue your friend, was it?<eos> Jake.<eos> I'll hold him off as long as I can.<eos> When are you going to realize, you are a terrible shot with that thing.<eos> Get the others. I'll meet you at the loop entrance.<eos> Let's get you out. Eventually, you're going to run out of breath.
Jake.<eos> I'll hold him off as long as I can.<eos> When are you going to realize, you are a terrible shot with that thing.<eos> Get the others. I'll meet you at the loop entrance.<eos> Let's get you out. Eventually, you're going to run out of breath.<eos> And it'll all be over! Death for your beloved Jake and Miss Peregrine, everlasting life for me!<eos> And a mint for you.<eos> Olive. Olive.<eos> I'm so sorry, Olive.<eos> All these years, I never appreciated you.
We'll take her to measurements.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Lift up.<eos> - You should really fix this.<eos> - I don't wanna fix it.<eos> I thought you did great.<eos> Honest.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Pretend that you don't know.<eos> People see you.
I don't think I'm his type.<eos> Why not?<eos> You're very masculine.<eos> I bet they made you do the casting.<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> I just come in, choose what I wanna wear.<eos> But I'm not sure about the makeup this year.<eos> I think you look perfect.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, flattery will get you everywhere.
- Get over here!<eos> - Hey, pecker heads.<eos> - What's up? - Yo.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> - Oh, I felt a peck.<eos> This is the legendary Mighty Eagle.<eos> Our protector and hero, but no one has seen him for years.<eos> Mighty Eagle is missing.<eos> When's Mighty Eagle going to come back.<eos> Eyebrows, didn't your parents ever tell you, Mighty Eagle isn't real?
DEEP BREATH!<eos> And we're back in the now.<eos> Chuck!<eos> - You had your hand up the whole time.<eos> My poem, is about a hate crimes<eos> - How did it...?<eos> Oh no.<eos> A lot of sickos out there.<eos> A lot of sickos.<eos> What? Oh, what did I make you of?
- How did it...?<eos> Oh no.<eos> A lot of sickos out there.<eos> A lot of sickos.<eos> What? Oh, what did I make you of?<eos> - I made you out of love.<eos> - Wow.<eos> But, wait. Too late.<eos> Now I see your fate.<eos> Some very troubled somebody destroyed you out of hate.
What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Iz, what happened?<eos> How come you didn't tell me you went to Iraq?<eos> I was looking for the plumber's number on your computer and I saw the photos.<eos> I can explain.<eos> You said you never left the hotel room in Jordan.<eos> I know.<eos> Because I didn't want to freak you out.<eos> Why is it every time I catch you in a lie you try to convince me that you lied for my benefit?
He just fell off the planet.<eos> I was done with Albania.<eos> I was never going back.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> The reason I went to Albania was to repackage Chinese ammunition so we could disguise it and sell it to the U.S. government.<eos> That sounds illegal.<eos> It is.<eos> But I'm done.<eos> I swear, no matter what happens for the rest of my life I'm never going to lie to you again.
April 16th.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. April 16th it is.<eos> But, uh, I gotta ask permission from Cluff first.<eos> You gotta ask permission?<eos> Yeah, it's from my commanding officer.<eos> It's Coast Guard regulation.<eos> But I promise I'll ask him tomorrow.<eos> Okay, Bernie.<eos> Let's get you home.
And, hey, did I hear right, that she asked you?<eos> Following orders, right, Webber?<eos> Yeah, she asked me, Chief.<eos> You, uh, sure you got your pants on, Webber... or is she wearin' 'em?<eos> Sounds like this girl cut off your...<eos> What, Webber? What?<eos> Huh?<eos> Don't you got boats to tie up?<eos> She's my fiancée, sir.<eos> Who asked you... to be married.
She knew.<eos> I will not be defined by what I face, but how I face it."<eos> "It was as if she was a fallen angel,"<eos> Angel in the skies?<eos> "sent to watch over him.<eos> 'Kiss me with your eyes, ' she teased.<eos> Every molecule in this sailor's body ached for her touch."<eos> Tie us together!<eos> Found more men and supplies.<eos> These two say they drifted away from the same group as you, Theodore.
And just like there were different groups of survivors in the water... There are different groups on land today.<eos> Every year, we survivors gather together to honor our fallen brothers.<eos> Even though they're gone, they'll be with us forever.<eos> Our new mission is to try to make sure that even future generations never forget the price that we all paid for freedom.<eos> Time marched on, and I eventually lost my dear Louise.<eos> And the memories... of all the boys we lost at sea... never faded.<eos> And the phone... never stopped ringing.<eos> The first day, we must have had 120, 150 sharks around us all day long.<eos> It's a horrifying experience, you know, being in the water, don't know if they're coming to get you.<eos> If you hit those sharks in the eyeball, it really hurt them, and they left you alone, and you could see down in the water maybe 50 feet, and they'd go down there and just thrash back and forth in pain.
Maybe you sing a little song, eh?<eos> I will join you.<eos> We can sing together how you saved the gratefull Chinos.<eos> You saw what happened out there, and that's what you say?<eos> I see black powder.<eos> - I see a man forget his friends.<eos> - The black powder's not going anywhere.<eos> What goes nowhere is you.<eos> You'll never get what you want from this.<eos> You think they see you as some kind of hero?
Oh, really?<eos> Yeah, I'm an Elvis impersonator, too.<eos> - That's frightening.<eos> - You're good though, man.<eos> You could be second best, baby.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Do you do Teddy Bear'?<eos> - When I'm in the mood.<eos> - Well, listen to this, man.<eos> I got an Elvis song that's gonna blow you away, man.
Elvis! Elvis Presley!<eos> Elvis is coming here!<eos> Hey, ladies.<eos> Mary Anne Peterson.<eos> I'm so glad you called.<eos> I can't believe you remember my name.<eos> Well, I remember that face even more.<eos> So, what are you doing in Washington, D.C., Mr. Presley?<eos> Well, Mary Anne, it's top secret.<eos> But the minute I met you I knew you were a woman of discretion.
You see?<eos> Even your house is fat.<eos> I'm on a diet.<eos> You're always on a diet, Mum, but you're always fat. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Because you never stop eating! Mmm-hmm.<eos> Now will you please... just stop for one second and look at what you've done?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, I love that girl.<eos> Your death threats, m'lady.<eos> Everybody bloody hates you!
That's right.<eos> Flash, flash, flash.<eos> Flash for Patsy.<eos> Patsy, flash, flash, flash.<eos> Ugh, Eddy.<eos> You killed Kate Moss!<eos> I've lost my job because of you!<eos> And now I am nothing as well.<eos> It's from Stella McCartney.<eos> How many "Om's" have I given you?
I'm wearing this.<eos> But not those shoes.<eos> Those shoes, darling.<eos> Not those shoes.<eos> But I like these shoes.<eos> They make you hobble.<eos> I'm wearing them anyway.<eos> I have thin ankles.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What that woman has done to you.
Welcome to my humble abode.<eos> Lulu?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I want to see you pay.<eos> Mum!<eos> - Saff. - Oh, shit.<eos> Get out!<eos> No, no.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Nick's come to take you back for the hearing.
With all my heart. Will you marry me?<eos> Then yes.<eos> Yes I will.<eos> When?<eos> Soon as you get your first leave.<eos> But I still don't like you at this moment.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> Mama say come see you here.
- Nice.<eos> Now this would be the kind of broad That deserve a real man.<eos> Give me that back.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please give it back, Smitty.<eos> Please give it back, Smitty.<eos> Do you hear voices Desmond?<eos> No, Sir.<eos> I understand that God talks to you.
Really strange coincidence that the statue near you.<eos> Just a coincidence.<eos> Now that we have to rasèistili with your permission to go.<eos> No, you're not going anywhere.<eos> You will be assigned my mission Monsignor Jimenez.<eos> Mission was founded by my mother, it is an oasis of peace.<eos> You need a long period spiritual peace.<eos> - We accept orders only from from the official church authorities.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Monsignor Jimenez, there are two fathers that I told you about.
I'm comming mommy.<eos> Hi.<eos> You must have thought for a long journey.<eos> Yes.<eos> How is your daughter? Fine.<eos> She remembers nothing.<eos> And I haven't told what have happened.<eos> You made the right move.<eos> Gul must know nothing.<eos> I told you that I had a girl too.
You just need to go to the pharmacy in Kempten.<eos> Go, straight away.<eos> Your Majesty, I am here to save you, not to help you die.<eos> Orders of the King.<eos> By order of the King, these gentlemen must stay under close guard. They must not leave this room under any circumstances. They cannot receive either food nor drink.<eos> This is what we get.<eos> We do not have much hope.<eos> Munich is far.<eos> We should not have trusted him.<eos> Sergeant! I order you to deliver this message to the Prime Minister:
Hey kid!<eos> Bring all your roses.<eos> All of 'em?<eos> All of 'em!<eos> - Atta boy. 20 Ok?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Ok, thank you<eos> - Thank you<eos> Oh Miss Fort. Good evening.<eos> A gentleman brought some flowers by for you earlier. I thought you might like to have them.
I have a gentleman here who wants to give it back to you.<eos> Is he alone?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's alone.<eos> Put him on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello Boyle.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Charley Varrick.<eos> I got something I wanna get back to you.
Sugar instead of smack.<eos> Meg. You don't have any salad.<eos> Look!<eos> - Let them go.<eos> - They're out of their goddamn minds.<eos> They're so violent.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Watch her go!<eos> Mr Vitroni, I gotta talk to you.
- Pretty close?<eos> - Pretty close.<eos> Did he talk to you about my party?<eos> He sure did.<eos> About my daughter?<eos> No, I didn't know you had one.<eos> - He didn't mention her?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh.<eos> Didn't tell you what she did?
- He loved his wife.<eos> - Was she cheating on him?<eos> Are you cheating on your wife?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But my wife's not dead.<eos> Was he cheating on her?<eos> Is your wife cheating on you?<eos> How come you know so little about your dear old pal?<eos> Or are you dummying up?<eos> Last night what did he tell you?
Maybe.<eos> But my wife's not dead.<eos> Was he cheating on her?<eos> Is your wife cheating on you?<eos> How come you know so little about your dear old pal?<eos> Or are you dummying up?<eos> Last night what did he tell you?<eos> That he was in a jam with his gambling associates?<eos> That he was fighting with his wife again?<eos> What excuse did he give you?
- Protecting his image you'd call it.<eos> - He's done this sort of thing before?<eos> Yes.<eos> My husband has a drinking problem.<eos> Every so often he reaches a stage when he feels he needs professional help.<eos> So he goes someplace to dry out.<eos> Is there some particular place he likes to go?<eos> Yes, but he's not there.<eos> I've checked every single place I could think of.<eos> Didn't he tell you where he was going?
If it weren't for me you'd never get out.<eos> It was I who bribed the porters.<eos> They were forbidden by the High Lama to take any one out of here.<eos> - Is it true?<eos> - I was with her.<eos> They only took the bribe because he's dead now.<eos> But aren't you afraid to leave?<eos> You know what will happen if you go.<eos> Happen?<eos> Ah, I suppose Chang told you that I am old.

There are at least 17 ways... of getting around the dead man statutes.<eos> You wrote an article showing that in 1936.<eos> If I wrote an article in November 1936... showing that there were 17 ways... to get around the dead man statutes... I hardly need to be told now that Mr. Bell is correct.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No.<eos> Your name?<eos> Hart.<eos> Mr. Hart, I can understand your wanting to ride... to the rescue of the unfortunate Bell... but aren't you a little late?<eos> You had your chance in class.<eos> Nobody inhibits you from expressing yourself.
Hear that, Beau?<eos> BootIegger claims he don't know the Iaw.<eos> I don't need no bottles to book you.<eos> Law says all I need is one little old drop.<eos> And law says you use a vehicle to transport alcohol, the said vehicle is confiscated to be sold at public auction.<eos> Kiss that pretty little car goodbye.<eos> - hold on!<eos> That seems rough...<eos> - I didn't tell you to lower your hands.<eos> I tell you to lower them, you lower them.
Inspector Palmer? May I see you?<eos> Was it necessary to let everyone in the station house know I was coming to see these guys?<eos> You believe from what you now know that an investigation is warranted?<eos> - Yes, Commissioner Delaney.<eos> - Go to it.<eos> But sir, shouldn't Headquarters handle something like this? No.<eos> You're all experienced men.<eos> Chief Gallagher here will be available for consultation.<eos> Commissioner...<eos> Serpico claims that er... Inspector McClain talked to you about this whole thing some time ago.
Come on, move it!<eos> Sadi, get them stowed below.<eos> Get them out of those robes and into work clothes!<eos> Well?<eos> When did he bathe last?<eos> Very soon now, in 500 feet of water.<eos> Not until I spend the night with him.<eos> What if he hurts you?<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> If anything happens to you, Amafi will kill me.
Yes, I remember.<eos> We don't see rich people here anymore.<eos> There isn't even enough room for the poor.<eos> There's just too many.<eos> Far too many.<eos> -Fa--<eos> -My memory's eroded.<eos> Chiefly, I assign space to people who need space.<eos> Do you need some space?<eos> I need to know what he said to you.
Father, did you hear his confession?<eos> There should be a requiem mass, but there's no room.<eos> -Should I make room?<eos> -This is very important.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> It's destroying me.<eos> -What is?<eos> -The truth.<eos> The truth Simonson told you?
The audience card, please!<eos> You don't get the audience card here but from his Excellency!<eos> Required documents will include your baptism and wedding certificate as well as your school records, etc. etc. etc.<eos> As I said you'll need to go to room # 16 first and then to room # 17. And to room # 23.<eos> Let me tell you something:<eos> I'll neither set foot into room # 16, 18 nor 99.<eos> I wouldn't dream of it.<eos> I'm not willing to...<eos> I'm not willing to...<eos> I already told you that I'm a school friend of Klaus Patera!
Please show the gentlemen the computer room.<eos> Yes, Mr. Stiller.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> This way.<eos> See you again.<eos> Let's put this incident behind us.<eos> You already have. Good.<eos> I'd like to discuss Vollmer's job with you again.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> As I've already told you... Vollmer's pigheadedness, I mean... It was a strain on my nerves.
- Are you the landlord here?<eos> - Aye.<eos> I'm Alder MacGreagor.<eos> And you must be the policeman from the mainland.<eos> Aye, that's right.<eos> Sergeant Howie, West Highland constabulary.<eos> I'm quite obviously not going to get back to the mainland tonight, so I wondered if you had a room and a bite of supper I could have.<eos> - Could you manage that?<eos> - Aye, I think that can be arranged.<eos> My daughter Willow will show you to your room.
We were in the same unit, so no doubt I did meet him.<eos> Back in those days, everybody looked alike.<eos> Skinny necks, bulging eyes, hollowed out cheeks.<eos> Besides, no one had enough humanity left to recognize anyone's face.<eos> But Terajima-san told me, he charged nobly and died in combat.<eos> Well, that's fine, then.<eos> But he didn't actually see him die...<eos> I want to know the truth.<eos> Well, he's not going to badmouth his Sergeant.<eos> But that doesn't help you much, right?
—Sorry, the five minutes is up.<eos> That was never five minutes.<eos> —I'm afraid it was.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> Sorry, I'm not allowed to argue anymore.<eos> What? —If you want me to go on arguing, you'll have to pay for another five minutes.<eos> But that was never five minutes just now.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> —I'm very sorry, but I told you, I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid.
Surety?<eos> Yes, surety.<eos> My mother has no money, either.<eos> Maybe my grandparents... or rather my grandmother.<eos> I'd have to ask.<eos> -How much would you need? -5,000 at least.<eos> No, that's out of the question.<eos> No surety?<eos> No.<eos> You'll be handling money that doesn't belong to you.
Follow me.<eos> Imprudent girl!<eos> I warned you that the crime you have just committed is punishable by death.<eos> You should indeed wonder what kind of death you will suffer.<eos> You will be bled three times a day.<eos> I want to see how long you might live in this way.<eos> It is an experiment I have always wanted to try.<eos> I thank you for offering me this chance.<eos> Monsieur, monsieur, come quickly,<eos> Madame wants to talk to you before she renders up her spirit.
She didn't break any law.<eos> Your help I don't need.<eos> Like Mr Markham says, there was no harm done.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, I think everybody can forget about it.<eos> Well, and I'll be going.<eos> Mr Markham, may I borrow that will for an hour or two?<eos> Well, it isn't mine.<eos> It belongs to Jennifer.<eos> I'll take it back to her.<eos> I'm sure dropping it off will take you out of your way.
We believe their spoken testimony, that some 2,000 years hence, their descendants will have all but exterminated the human race from Earth.<eos> And we know that the female ape is now pregnant with child.<eos> The commission therefore recommends that the birth of the female ape's unborn child should be prevented and that both the male and the female should be rendered incapable of begetting another.<eos> But, Mr Governor, every zoo, public and private, was searched by the police, and every circus, including my own.<eos> - But a small chimpanzee was found.<eos> - The only one ever to be born in a circus, and legally certified to have been born a month - a month - before the talking apes arrived on earth.<eos> - Where is he now?<eos> - I wish I knew.<eos> I've searched everywhere.<eos> Señor Armando! Let me remind you... of the seriousness of our problem.
- This way, señor. This way.<eos> - Sit down, sit down.<eos> We have good news for you.<eos> - Good news?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You're to be released.<eos> Inspector Hoskyns and I believe that your ape is not the child of the talking chimpanzees.<eos> - You found him?<eos> - Not yet, but he'll turn up sooner or later.<eos> I'm sorry for the inconvenience we had to cause you.
It's about time.<eos> Orion launches tomorrow at 9 a.m.<eos> Have a nice trip without Dan.<eos> Here, so you won't get lonely.<eos> I found him yesterday.<eos> What is it?<eos> A lion.<eos> Prof. Scholl, I hereby submit an official statement:<eos> I do not feel like obeying your order.<eos> Captain Lagny, I am officially reminding you: you've had 3 disciplinay actions.
A lot of guts.<eos> I'm okay, baby.<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> - Belle, is she all right?<eos> She got through.<eos> She saved Scott.<eos> She cleared the way for all of us.<eos> She got through.<eos> But something went wrong, didn't it?<eos> Like I told you, she did everything.
$100 says that back door doesn't lead to the parking lot.<eos> I'm not a gambling woman.<eos> I'm a gambling man.<eos> I thought it was my action you were digging here.<eos> Never took you for a gambler but if that's your meat, that's the door.<eos> You're pushing mighty hard, my man.<eos> Maybe I ought to push the boys in the back who've been taking all your money.<eos> Extend him for another $5,000 and not one cent more, do you understand?<eos> Listen, Gus... You told me you would take care of Shaft.<eos> That's what I told you.
There's such a thing as breeding!<eos> The quality that breeding brings...<eos> cannot be acquired.<eos> Of course, he failed his test abysmally.<eos> He may well have done, sir, but he also must have been put in fear of his life.<eos> Such irresponsible action... warrants a serious charge of assault.<eos> I suppose that's marginally better than the charge of murder... you were contemplating a few minutes ago.<eos> - I still am contemplating it.<eos> - oh, come on, Inspector.<eos> I told you what happened.
Well, you must believe me!<eos> With real bullets... and real blood,<eos> Isn't it about time we stopped talking about games, sir?<eos> Look!<eos> Look at the window!<eos> There you can see the pane of glass he cut out in order to break in.<eos> And down there, the imprint of the ladder in the flower bed... and the size 28 boots, or whatever the hell it was he was wearing.<eos> Look, I can show you!<eos> - Over the years, my eyes have been adequately trained to see things for themselves, sir.<eos> I'm just trying to point out a few facts... to substantiate my story, like the blown safe I've shown you in the study... and like the dressing-up basket you found in the cellar.
We in the Police force know just how fond... murderers are of their backyards, sir.<eos> One's as near a murderer's heart in a garden as anywhere else on earth, eh, Inspector?<eos> - Excepting the bedroom, sir.<eos> I think you'll find that's still the favorite.<eos> There's no mistaking whose room this is, eh, sir?<eos> My wife showers.<eos> I bathe.<eos> Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.<eos> Clothing all screwed up... on the floor of the wardrobe.<eos> That's not like you, sir.
- Well, is honor satisfied?<eos> Score even?<eos> One set all?<eos> "Honor"?<eos> That's another one of your words.<eos> I know... that you've stripped me... more than naked.<eos> I know... that you actually... terrified me to death.<eos> I stood on those stairs looking down... and realizing that my-my coat sleeve button, the bannister, the nail on my fourth finger... were absolutely the last things I was gonna see... ever.<eos> Then, I heard... the sound... of my own death.<eos> Now, that changes you, Andrew, believe me, and I still owe you for that.
He committed suicide...<eos> I knew Guibariane. It's not like him to...<eos> He was in a state of profound depression.<eos> Since these mysterious disorders began...<eos> Maybe you'd better rest, take a bath.<eos> You may take any room.<eos> Come here in an hour.<eos> I'm impatient to meet with Guibariane...<eos> I mean Sartorius.<eos> I doubt if he'll let you in.
I can't move against him openly until I'm sure that Miss Grant is safe.<eos> I'll just have to play for time.<eos> Ah, Doctor.<eos> Good news.<eos> -Stubbs, did you find Varan?<eos> -He's been dealt with, sir.<eos> (SOFTLY) Dealt with.<eos> Hmm.<eos> These Mutts are a bigger menace than you realise, Doctor.<eos> As no doubt Miss Grant will tell you.
Take her back inside.<eos> Well, don't just sit there.<eos> Get after her.<eos> Have you any idea why Colonel Trenchard is taking orders from the Master?<eos> Look, man, I'm talking to you.<eos> Very well.<eos> Now, then, Doctor, I'm afraid you're in very serious trouble.<eos> I've been giving this matter some thought.<eos> I'm going to hold you here until the whole thing's cleared up.<eos> Is that what the Master told you to say?
Anybody at UNIT headquarters will vouch for me.<eos> If you'll permit me to use the telephone...<eos> Prisoners are not allowed to make telephone calls.<eos> Colonel Trenchard, why are you allowing the Master to use you like this?<eos> All right, take him away.<eos> Look, you're jeopardising your entire career.<eos> I have nothing further to say to you.<eos> The interview is over.<eos> Didn't anybody else warn you about the Master?<eos> Whatever he's told you, it's all lies.
I'm terribly sorry, old chap.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes.<eos> I tell you I must speak to the Minister.<eos> It's most important.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Well, when do you expect him back?<eos> No.<eos> I can't tell you what's wrong.
Look, I don't want to seem ungrateful...<eos> Something's worrying you?<eos> Well, you did say you might be able to get me back - to my own time, I mean.<eos> Our scientists are working at it, but time travel is a very difficult, it's a very dangerous business, you know?<eos> The guerilla's machine got me here easily enough.<eos> That was a lucky fluke, I assure you, nothing else.<eos> You could just as easily been killed.<eos> Then what about the Doctor?<eos> You did say something about rescuing him.<eos> There is something I have not told you.
He's queer. Have you picked him up yet?<eos> Don't ask me.<eos> Ask Morsella.<eos> He might even let slip the fact... that we haven't been able to find him since the girl died.<eos> You see what I mean about Morsella.<eos> Good thing I'm around to keep an eye on him.<eos> - Giordani?<eos> - Yes.<eos> May I come in?<eos> I'd like to tell you something that may interest you.
You see what I mean about Morsella.<eos> Good thing I'm around to keep an eye on him.<eos> - Giordani?<eos> - Yes.<eos> May I come in?<eos> I'd like to tell you something that may interest you.<eos> I'm sorry. I... I don't remember where we--<eos> Oh, you haven't forgotten.<eos> We've never met. May I?<eos> And I don't think my name would be of any interest to you.
Oh, you haven't forgotten.<eos> We've never met. May I?<eos> And I don't think my name would be of any interest to you.<eos> I've just read your article about Professor Braun.<eos> I know you're looking for him, and I can tell you where he is.<eos> Only you have to hurry, because he's about to leave.<eos> Look, uh, the paper I work for is not very rich--<eos> I'm not interested in money, if that's what you mean.<eos> I just want you to hurry.<eos> And for reasons which I won't trouble you with, but which you can probably imagine, I'd prefer not to have dealings with the police.
They won't find the body<eos> - Really?<eos> - Of course<eos> Come with me<eos> Go in<eos> Hello, miss.<eos> Sit down<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> Thanks<eos> I guess your friend's told you why I'm here
And that is neither a criminal act, nor a violation.<eos> I am right.<eos> You are guilty, not me.<eos> Dr. Johnson, I have here reports on your operations on embryos... with all the details.<eos> You have stolen from human beings in embryonic stage the chance of development.<eos> I call that criminal and blasphemous.<eos> You say blasphemous?<eos> In what world are you living?<eos> There can be only one aim: To help human beings. Without moral terms.<eos> Dr. Johnson... for the moment, this group of doctors forbids you to continue your experiments.
-Amen, and don't come anymore.<eos> Papers, please.<eos> -What did I do?<eos> When seeing a pedestrian in a crosswalk, slowdown and stop.<eos> I did stop.<eos> -And that's to allow safe crossing.<eos> We write and write, but no one reads the rules.<eos> The auto registration, please.<eos> Take the registration, take the car, I don't care.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Anton Phibes.<eos> Now are you satisfied?<eos> Well, I'm not sure that I am really, sir.<eos> Think.<eos> All this proves is that somebody was incinerated in that car crash.<eos> - The Swiss police told us that.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> But suppose that somebody was not Phibes at all, but his chauffeur.<eos> - And Phibes is back in London?<eos> - Just like the old man told you.
Take a, um...<eos> - Seat?<eos> - Seat. Take a seat.<eos> So, you want to join my mountaineering expedition, do you?<eos> Who, me, sir?<eos> - Yes, I'd very much like to, sir.<eos> - Jolly good. And how about you?<eos> There is only me, sir.<eos> Well, bang goes his application then.<eos> Now, let me fill you in.
Can't you at least tell me who phoned at this ungodly hour?<eos> Grandpa, there's a car, and they got guns.<eos> Do they now?<eos> Well, that's serious.<eos> I'll watch out.<eos> Honey, you've been dreaming.<eos> I wish I were!<eos> No.<eos> Uh-uh. Get someone else.<eos> Dr. Leavitt, I told you, there's a fire!
I... I don't mean to bother you, but I think that you are terrific.<eos> Really terrific.<eos> Me and my friends have backed you from the very beginning of this career of yours. And I...<eos> We...<eos> I... I'm awestruck.<eos> I really don't know what to say.<eos> You know, it's very funny, but you remind me of somebody I once knew.<eos> A boy. He...<eos> He was really...<eos> No, he was really nothing like you.
Then he becomes a subversive mother.<eos> Call Fielding Mellish.<eos> Mr Mellish... what is your nationality?<eos> Well, you might say I have two nationalities.<eos> Are you being coy?<eos> Well, I am an American citizen and also the President of San Marcos.<eos> I would not joke with this court if I were you.<eos> - Wouldn't you or couldn't you?<eos> - That's enough.<eos> Does the codename Sapphire mean anything to you?
It was ethics that got me wounded in the first place.<eos> How so?<eos> Well, you see, ma'am, I'm a Quaker.<eos> And I don't... carry weapons into battle, I carry bandages.<eos> And my company, we were fighting in this thicket... and there was this wounded rebel officer... who was trying to crawl away from the fire.<eos> My duty was to stay with my men... but my ethics wouldn't let me.<eos> I carried that reb to safety. That's why I got shot.<eos> Now, my conscience does bother me... because I should've stayed with my own troops.<eos> I feel like I deserted them, you might say.<eos> Do your hands hurt you terribly?
We don't propose to entertain you.<eos> I don't expect it.<eos> It's just that I've been at war a long time.<eos> It's been months since I've seen a woman's face.<eos> You'll find I'm easily amused.<eos> If you get any ideas of tryin' to amuse yourself with any of the ladies- Wait just a minute-<eos> You'll find yourself out on that road so fast you won't know what happened.<eos> I'm not that kind of man. You know that.<eos> I know nothing of the kind.<eos> How long does it take you, ma'am... to get to know someone?
- Goodbye!<eos> - Goodbye!<eos> - Bye-bye!<eos> - Bye-bye!<eos> - Calm down!<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I'll be right back!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Doctor...<eos> Should I pay you for your visit?
- Oh, Ken. - I wouldn't want to get you into trouble.<eos> - Of course not. All right, Lilly.<eos> How much?<eos> - I hope you don't think that's the... - No.<eos> I don't think anything. I'll tell you something. I'm most grateful you came to me first.<eos> Know why?<eos> Because I think we can reach an equitable agreement.<eos> I do so admire your candour.<eos> It isn't easy for me, a widow running a small country store, trying to make ends meet.<eos> I can understand that. I also recognise in you a woman of... some breeding. I mean, you're not just a common... blackmailer.
But once you assume Franklin committed these crimes, everything fits together.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I've known Ken too long. He's not a murderer.<eos> It wouldn't make any difference if you knew him for 100 years. That wouldn't change anything.<eos> This man Franklin took your husband's life!<eos> Do you have a match?<eos> Help yourself. I don't smoke.<eos> It doesn't make sense, Lieutenant! Ken has an alibi.<eos> What's his motive?<eos> I told you how he could've worked the phone.
We've got two children.<eos> Oh, then things do change.<eos> Do they live in Italy?<eos> No, no, in Sweden.<eos> He has a building company in Norkopping.<eos> Does Mr. Di Noi come in Italy often?<eos> Since coming in Sweden, more than six years ago, he never went back in Italy.<eos> But, maybe he went to Italy without you knowing it...<eos> You know the way italians are.<eos> Has he ever talked to you about his italian past?
And where is Joe?<eos> Joe couldn't make it tonight.<eos> I'm Mr. Wint.<eos> This is Mr. Kidd.<eos> I see.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> It's my wisdom teeth. I haven't had them out yet.<eos> Would you mind having a look, doctor?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.
That's quite a nice little nothing you're almost wearing.<eos> I don't dress for the hired help.<eos> Let's see your passport, Franks.<eos> "Occupation: Transport Consultant"?<eos> That's a little cute, isn't it? - I'll finish dressing.<eos> - Please, don't.<eos> Not on my account.<eos> I don't care much for redheads.<eos> Terrible tempers.<eos> - But somehow it seems to suit you.
Why are they harassing you?<eos> They tried to frame me with the murder.<eos> And now they're trying to murder me.<eos> And look at me!<eos> I'm innocent until proven guilty and look at what they did to me.<eos> Everywhere I go cops follow me.<eos> And just look at me!<eos> Just a minute, nurse.<eos> Let me ask him one more question.<eos> Did you see who did this to you?
They're a nice family, are they?<eos> Churchgoers and all that?<eos> Good.<eos> I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll be seeing you again.<eos> Here.<eos> -Go and get your hair done.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> Be good.<eos> And don't trust boys.<eos> That was left for you this evening.
As far as I'm concerned, that's it.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good thing to take over the whole of my outfit, so I'm worried.<eos> I can't fight them.<eos> I don't have that sort of a setup.<eos> But I've got to fix them before they fix me.<eos> The trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.<eos> £5,000,000.<eos> That belongs to you.<eos> Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
That's why I don't remember it. $5,500.<eos> Ernie, I think we can get the company to come up with another $750.<eos> That would make it $6,250.<eos> Of course, we'd have to have an immediate answer on that.<eos> Well, Mr. Sears... the immediate answer to that is, "No."<eos> I have to tell you the rest of my story.<eos> Come on.<eos> Excuse me, if I may intercede here.<eos> Mr. McCabe, may I call you John?<eos> I have a son called John, not unlike you.
Signore, you had a ride to the Lido for nothing.<eos> Will you give me something for the trouble?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good afternoon, Professor von Aschenbach.<eos> Allow me to extend you the compliments of the management.<eos> Professor Aschenbach's key.<eos> I hope the room we have reserved will meet with your satisfaction.<eos> The hotel is extremely quiet. Do not worry, Professor.<eos> This is Professor Aschenbach's suitcase.<eos> Your trunk, Professor, will be delivered to you immediately.
All your friends walk around with weapons like that?<eos> That depends.<eos> My Negro friends don't walk around with rabbits' feet no more.<eos> Don't get wise with me.<eos> There's a simple way for me to go.<eos> - I'll put your goddamn ass in!<eos> - I'll sue your goddamn ass for false arrest.<eos> You want me to believe the man fell out the way you said he did?<eos> - What do I look like?<eos> Some kind of klutz? - Don't ask, and I won't tell you.
You didn't kill her. No.<eos> I know that but this afternoon, you gave the impression... No.<eos> You're in the clear.<eos> You got nothing to worry about.<eos> You see, whoever did this, he had to wear a ring.<eos> Now, you don't wear a ring.<eos> Well, I could have taken it off.<eos> No, not with that tan, because that would show.<eos> Now listen. Tell me something.<eos> Mrs Kennicut. Did Mrs Kennicut ever indicate to you that she was concerned that her husband knew about you two?
And even those of whom we think that they don't think.<eos> Madmen, notorious drunkards, idiots.<eos> All of them, without exception, think.<eos> Once they brought me a halfwit.<eos> He wet himself, he didn't know how to eat, he was incapable of human speech.<eos> But he was thinking.<eos> I have observed infants, and I can tell you that they have dreams.<eos> But why am I telling you all of this?<eos> Because you're going to speak with the governor.<eos> And he will undoubtedly ask you about my thinking machine, driven by a hand crank.
afraid our regular psychiatrist hasn't come round this morning and i've got an ego block which is in turn making my wife over-assertive and getting us both into a state of depressive neurosis.<eos> i see, sir, who's your regular?<eos> jersey cream psychiatrists.<eos> oh, yes, i know them.<eos> right, well, uh... what's your job, then?<eos> i'm a doctor.<eos> didn't i see you just now under a scotsman?<eos> yes, but i am a doctor.<eos> actually, i'm a gynecologist but that was my lunch hour.<eos> what does this remind you of?
If you'd be so kind.<eos> What length of BBC rope- will we be likely to need?<eos> I should use the longest BBC rope.<eos> That would be a good idea, I would imagine.<eos> Okey-doke, chief.<eos> Tex, get the longest BBC rope and bring it here pronto.<eos> In the meantime, since I am on all channels, perhaps I'd better carry on with this broadcast, by shouting about our housing plans, from down here as best as I can.<eos> Could someone throw me down a script?<eos> The script would appear- to have landed on a different ledge, somewhat out of my grasp, don't you know.<eos> Well, perhaps when the rope reaches you, minister, you could kind of swing over- to the ledge and grab it.
Across the street there, they think I'm lying.<eos> They say there's no water.<eos> No water?<eos> Listen.<eos> I was robbed and left to die without a drop.<eos> Well, do I look dead?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Climbed up on my hind feet and walked straight to water.<eos> W-A-T-L-E.<eos> That grabs you by the short hairs, don't it?
I've always treated you like God Almighty. You too.<eos> We're not responsible for this. It's got nothing to do with the Union.<eos> Hotheads are to blame.<eos> - So what are you doing here? And what do you represent?<eos> - People are exasperated.<eos> Because 600 workers have been reduced to penury in a factory in this town.<eos> Not in mine, it's nothing to do with me.<eos> You and the same old mafia whose president you are.<eos> Explain which mafia?<eos> - The one which gave money to the owner of that factory until it suited you, then you threw him overboard.
You're all wet.<eos> No! The stones are hurting me.<eos> Hold still.<eos> My husband's body is rotting in storage at the graveyard. Why?<eos> You know perfectly well.<eos> Of course I do. To hide him like an embarrassment.<eos> You granted him neither God nor man.<eos> It was you who hid him like an embarrassment by putting him in the square like an embarrassment. In the middle of that factory.<eos> - It's true!<eos> Now I'm the one asking you why.
Half dead frorm loss of blood. Day by day.<eos> Like the fly who is the spider s prey.<eos> The father watched and waited by her bedside til one night when she was close to her end the neighbors hear d a terrible shriek.<eos> There is some similarity in the case but that is no explanation.<eos> Perhaps not, that you see.<eos> All my life I've made a study of what some people call the black arts.<eos> That's why Renfield was admitted to my care and also Jonathan Harker.<eos> The mountains in the north of Transylvania are rich in legend, yet behind the legend, behind the fantasy, there are certain facts.<eos> Now I think that Jonathan has seen some of that truth.<eos> Then why didn't you believe what I told you about Count Dracula? Jonathan. Oh.
Goodbye Anto... goodbye.<eos> Excuse me...<eos> The strike also applies to international trains?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To Vienna. You have to take it tomorrow morning at 6.<eos> Is there another way to do it?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have seen a bus service.<eos> Yes but they go to Torino, Verona, Novara<eos> Bologna, won't take you there
The count has personally instructed us on your rooms, Professor.<eos> We hoped the horses'd reach you before the nightfall.<eos> The storm prevented them.<eos> The Count is very sorry he can't lunch with you.<eos> He has a bad migraine.<eos> You'll eat with Doctor Froeber who attends the Countess.<eos> Luncheon will be served at one.<eos> If you wish anything, ring for the footman.<eos> Give us some starka.<eos> As a doctor, I highly recommend starka to you.
- We're in the middle of putting.<eos> My God.<eos> All right.<eos> You men are under arrest.<eos> - l'll have you court-martialled!<eos> - Come off it, Colonel.<eos> You don't have us. We have you.<eos> Your boys blew this case and we bailed you out.<eos> Now we are gonna stay here for one more day and check out the congressman's kid, and... get in some golf for ourselves.<eos> If that's OK with you, then we got a deal.
She's too Jewish looking!<eos> Neuchl, you should take the part.<eos> You'd make a hell of an English lady.<eos> Why not bring your friend, Berger, up here to the stage... and do the sketch for us like two English ladies?<eos> Won't you?<eos> Your position, Kapitan, is not so to give me such insult.<eos> My position as your commanding officer is so... to have you killed for being a coward, if I must.<eos> Are you not a coward?<eos> I obey the rules of a prisoner of war.<eos> As the German Camp Commandant you know the Geneva Convention forbids you to incite a riot.
- I wanna hear you talk.<eos> - If you quit prodding me...<eos> - I knew it!<eos> I can tell by your talking, you're a Yank.<eos> - Didn't you tell him?<eos> - He's a difficult man to convince.<eos> You would be too, if you had a flock of no goods hanging on you.<eos> You said you was my boy's captain.<eos> How do I know that?<eos> Did he write to you about the first battle we were in?
- You're not going.<eos> You've been trying to run this show since we met.<eos> Listen to me and keep still.<eos> You are not going!<eos> - You tell her, Frenchy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'd give every horse I own to get a chance at that fella.<eos> Mr Pryor, if we don't come back, you said...<eos> I'm not gonna disappoint you.<eos> I told you I'd get the girl to Blackthorne.
The Sheriff did it.<eos> - Why?<eos> - To make me talk.<eos> To punish me.<eos> He did it and then he laughed.<eos> - Someday I'm gonna kill him.<eos> - You'll have to beat me to it.<eos> I'm gonna kill him someday.<eos> Be careful.<eos> The Sheriff has many men outside hunting for you.
Firstly we need to find our freedom.<eos> Then we'll study the best way not to lose it.<eos> It's useless... I've tried to talk to many like you, but there's nothing doing.<eos> Stubborn, you are like mules.<eos> That's it, it's fine.<eos> You can leave.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Goodbye, my boy.<eos> And remember what I said to you.
Of all the ungrateful nitwits.<eos> You seem to know a great deal about this project.<eos> Enough.<eos> -You're a scientist?<eos> -Of sorts, yes.<eos> Where do you come from?<eos> I've already told you.<eos> I come from a parallel space-time continuum, a twin world of this.<eos> If you told us the truth, there might be some hope for you.<eos> Your counterpart in the other world would tell you that I'm not in the habit of telling lies, Elizabeth.
Did you ever think of becoming a scientist?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I can see that you did.<eos> I read physics at university.<eos> What's that got to do with it?<eos> Simply that her mind process runs along a similar parallel to yours.<eos> Doesn't that strike you as significant?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Look, Elizabeth, please try and think.<eos> Whatever they taught you in this bigoted world of yours, you've still got a mind of your own.
-Well, Benton?<eos> -Excuse me, sir, but it's the Doctor.<eos> He's...<eos> Well, he's back.<eos> -Where is he?<eos> -He's in the hut, sir.<eos> Miss Shaw's with him.<eos> -Right, I'll come back with you now.<eos> -Right, sir.<eos> My dear Miss Williams, much as I value your services, I must remind you that you're not in control of the... (HIGH-PITCHED WHINING)
No, sir, I'm sure it'll be all right.<eos> Perhaps you'd care to come to my office... and have a look at the patient's records before you examine him.<eos> Good idea.<eos> I could do with a cup of tea, too.<eos> Yes.<eos> ...be an error in that report.<eos> These anomalies are completely inexplicable.<eos> Well, let's go and see this freak.<eos> I shan't believe it until I see it with me own eyes.<eos> I assure you, sir, that everything I've told you.
She'll become the woman of your life.<eos> You'll be happy. You'll be cured.<eos> I must get over it.<eos> I must free myself from my complexes and fears.<eos> I must have faith in my male strength.<eos> Are you satisfied?<eos> Without a hitch.<eos> Word for word as you described it.<eos> It wasn't a fair play game.<eos> You knew what would happen to you, before you even started.
I knew you would like him.<eos> And the new detainees?<eos> There's a little blond among them...<eos> Number 99.<eos> Young, exciting, with a nice body.<eos> I think you might rather like her.<eos> I'll see about her later.<eos> I have a lot of work today.<eos> Thank you for coming so quickly Governor.<eos> I am, as always, devoted to you.
Helped you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm certain I will need you.<eos> Do you have any experience in prison management?<eos> Very little.<eos> I have dealt with juvenile delinquents.<eos> This is my first time in a penitentiary.<eos> You have a great deal to learn.<eos> I know.<eos> That is why I would ask you to help me.
You're a pig.<eos> I love you too... sir.<eos> Everybody makes a profit out of the war.<eos> Why shouldn't I?<eos> Know your trouble, Lieutenant?<eos> You got no ambition.<eos> I'm goin' out of this war rich.<eos> Or dead, Angel.<eos> You may be dead.<eos> If I do get it, I got a present for you.
Oh, excuse me, Herr Major.<eos> You must do something about the civilian traffic.<eos> We can't get our work done.<eos> This is Captain Baumann, Chief Engineering Officer.<eos> Major Kreuger.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> If we don't clear the bridge, we'll never be ready to blow it.<eos> The most immediate problem is not to blow the bridge up but to keep it open.<eos> Excuse me, but is it not true the Führer has ordered the bridge destroyed?<eos> Does the Führer transmit his orders directly to you, or are you simply spreading idle gossip?
Wait a minute.<eos> Toni!<eos> You'll meet her.<eos> You'll meet her!<eos> - Oh, Señor Sanchez...<eos> - The doctor, he is waiting?<eos> I tried to call you at the UN, but you had left.<eos> The doctor had to cancel his appointments today.<eos> - That's too bad.<eos> - But as long as you're here we might as well x-ray that tooth that's bothering you.
Send it to 975 Glenwood, Jackson Heights, Apartment 3A.<eos> You moved out?<eos> I packed everything, children included, and moved in with my sister.<eos> I thought that was the best thing for everybody.<eos> Mrs. Winston!<eos> What about your future?<eos> What's going to become of you?<eos> I'll ride into the sunset.<eos> Well, I want to be sure you're all right.<eos> Well, I'll write you every day.
Oh, yeah, honey, I'll have a little champagne.<eos> New York radio from United Overseas Airlines 404. Copy Gander.<eos> Position 54 north, 40 west, 17:05.<eos> Flight level 350.<eos> My luggage stayed on the plane. My husband isn't in Rome.<eos> There is no reservation on tomorrow's plane in the name of Evans.<eos> You called me yourself, and you told me not to take that flight.<eos> I want to know what has happened to my husband. - l demand that you...<eos> - Madam, please try to stay calm.<eos> First of all, I did not telephone you.
- What is your name?<eos> - Levi Morgan.<eos> What's yours?<eos> - Emiliano Zapata.<eos> - I'll call you Emil.<eos> - I'll call you Levi.<eos> - All right.<eos> He's the one I told you about.<eos> There he is.<eos> The one I told you about.
These are made of Corvexo... an alloy of gold and platinum.<eos> Impervious to all temperatures.<eos> And this is an added precaution, put them on.<eos> Then, we'll board the Alpha.<eos> Lawton. -Thank you.<eos> Have you changed your mind, Dr. Okada?<eos> Never!<eos> Do you expect to be rescued?<eos> The people of Latitude Zero already know where we are.<eos> I certainly hope so. They've had ample time to pinpoint your location. That's why I didn't take that homing device away from you when you first time turn on.
My father didn't hold with gambling and neither do I.<eos> Well, I know, Miss.<eos> I know that.<eos> I'm trying to mend my ways.<eos> Seriously.<eos> It doesn't look right for a marshal to be playing cards.<eos> I know that.<eos> Now you rest.<eos> Try to sleep.<eos> And remember what I told you.
Oh, Cass, take it easy now.<eos> At 28 years old, you think you can come up here and pull this kind of crap?<eos> - You're out of your mind! - Cass, come on now.<eos> I could just kill you with my bare hands!<eos> Will you get out of here?<eos> Will you get out of here?<eos> Oh, Cass, honey.<eos> Oh, Cass, come on now.<eos> Cass. Hey, Cass, you think I meant that?<eos> Would I be asking you for money with a wad like I got riding on my hip?
Well, it happens.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> - It ain't never happened to me before.<eos> You can bet your bottom dollar on that.<eos> Where's the matches, ma'am?<eos> Over there, behind that thing.<eos> Maybe if you didn't call me "ma'am," things might work out better.<eos> That's the first goddamn time the thing ever quit on me.<eos> That's a fact.<eos> You think I'm lying to you? No.
So from now on I'll have to wear this sackcloth?<eos> Did you come as my friend or enemy?<eos> Why should I be your enemy?<eos> I came as a friend.<eos> My name is Lado.<eos> I'm a painter.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Please, have a seat over there.<eos> This is where I live.<eos> What can I treat you with?
- What bouquet?<eos> - The bridal bouquet.<eos> I completely forgot about it.<eos> My wife reminded me this morning.<eos> It's in here.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> I'll come by this evening to pay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here's the ring.<eos> That's the little string she sent you for the size.
All the passengers are ashore.<eos> Don't you recognize me, Monsieur Mahé?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> I am Julie.<eos> I am Julie Roussel.<eos> Julie Roussel?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You don't think I'm like my picture?<eos> The picture I sent you wasn't really of me.
They were orphans, like you.<eos> But I'm not sure they were as beautiful.<eos> This is our house.<eos> This is where we'll live.<eos> Our house?<eos> Yes, I have a confession to make.<eos> I didn't tell you everything in my letters.<eos> - I'm afraid that I even lied.<eos> - What do you mean you lied?<eos> I told you that I was a foreman in a factory making cigarettes.
- But why am I here?<eos> You were exhausted.<eos> You've been having a sleeping cure.<eos> If I'm having a sleeping cure, why do you wake me all the time?<eos> - We've got to feed you.<eos> - I'm not hungry.<eos> Let me help you walk a bit.<eos> If we don't, you'll get too weak.<eos> I don't feel very rested... because I have these dreams all the time.<eos> That's because of the shots we have to give you.
Were you expecting someone else?<eos> No, no.<eos> I thought it was the maid, that's all.<eos> And these dresses, these shoes, these stockings... do they belong to your maid?<eos> Monsieur Comolli, I don't want you to look for my wife anymore.<eos> You can drop your investigation.<eos> Just tell me how much I owe you.<eos> I see.<eos> You certainly have the right to change your mind.<eos> But I'd like to remind you of one thing.
Oh, you're not going to catch me- with an old one like that.<eos> Right... let's reconstruct the crime.<eos> Constable, you be inspector Tiger.<eos> Right, sir. Nobody leave the room I shall<eos> Somebody I leave nobody in the room-body shall... take the tablets, Tiger buddy.<eos> Alself me... Very good... just sit down there.<eos> Very good, thank you.<eos> Right. Now, we'll pretend- the lights have gone out.<eos> Constable, you scream.<eos> Somebody shoots you. And the door opens.
- Good morning.<eos> This is where you'll live for a while.<eos> Come along.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> What is this?<eos> We'd like you to be comfortable here and to feel at home.<eos> If there is anything at all we can do... Is it your house?<eos> No, but I'll be coming here quite often.<eos> Mr. Kusenov, we would like you in here for a few minutes, please, if you don't mind.
She is a widow of a hero of the revolution.<eos> She is loved and honored in this country.<eos> You are an intelligence agent.<eos> Your association with her can put her in grave danger.<eos> I want you out of the country on the next plane early tomorrow morning.<eos> And if you have been collecting information about what the Russians are doing in Cuba to help us here, don't think for one minute you will take it out with you.<eos> You will not.<eos> You will be searched at the airport, completely.<eos> And if anything is found on you, you will be arrested.<eos> And what can happen to you after that is something you know about. Now, if you don't mind cutting your dinner short, I'll take you back to Havana to pack your bags.
He's a tough customer.<eos> There's no appeal except to the President himself!<eos> Call Deputy Marshal Cogburn.<eos> Mr. Reuben J Cogburn will take the stand.<eos> You were sworn this morning, you're still sworn.<eos> Defence will cross-examine.<eos> Mr. Cogburn, you testified for the prosecution this morning.<eos> Allow me to summarise what you said.<eos> According to your story C.C. Wharton grabbed a shotgun and killed Marshal Potter.<eos> Then he turned the gun on you, and you shot him.
No...<eos> This is how it's done<eos> Young student...<eos> Young student seeks au pair or housework<eos> Come.<eos> The gold interests me<eos> You keep the Christ, I'll take the metal<eos> Me?<eos> Why?<eos> Don't scorn what is offered you.
-Yes?<eos> -Burglar, madam.<eos> -What do you want?<eos> -To come in and steal a few things, madam.<eos> Are you an encyclopaedia salesman?<eos> No, madam, I'm a burglar, I burgle people.<eos> I think you're an encyclopedia salesman.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Open the door, let me in.<eos> If I let you in, you'll sell me encyclopaedias.
I was quite pleased.<eos> And you?<eos> What do you think of the 48 positions?<eos> You're talking about wrestling...<eos> i don't have any experience with that.<eos> You need to catch up right away.<eos> This is one of them.<eos> My Lord, not here in the garden...<eos> Don't get excited, we're just sparring.<eos> I already told you that i'm clueless.
What kind of woman is that?<eos> No anger, no despair, no desire.<eos> Very well, i'll set her ablaze.<eos> I want her to burn!<eos> Burn!<eos> Aguri... look at me.<eos> Don't you hear?<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> Excuse me, Lord, for delaying you.<eos> I've wanted to speak to you for a long time.
I don't follow you Oh Well, I was in the bedroom I was checking some things, and I heard him open the front door, and he didn't say anything<eos> Gee, it's funny how people are different, isn't it?<eos> Now, you take myself When I come home from a trip, uh, the first thing I do is I say, "Honey, you here? "<eos> Exactly what is your point, Lieutenant?<eos> Point? Oh, I wasn't making a point<eos> It sounded to me as if you were<eos> You heard the man admit that he had an argument with his wife He probably still had a chip on his shoulder this morning<eos> I was only tryin' to...<eos> Lieutenant,<eos> I've... have already told you that Dr Flemming is a close, personal friend of mine
- Thank you, dear!<eos> How is the training going?<eos> -Not bad...<eos> There's only a few days left to the big fight...<eos> It's good to see you in shape!<eos> Hey, young man! Why the hurry? Where are you going?<eos> Congratulations on the next bout...<eos> But it's the Joe Louis-Walcott match?<eos> You can tell me next time.<eos> But young man, it was a very interesting match. What is wrong with you?
You asked me what you could do for me, and I told you.<eos> Well, all right, but I don't see what good it will do.<eos> - Do you have any pills?<eos> - Pills? !<eos> Oh, never mind. I have some, here.<eos> What is this pill?<eos> It's an exaltation transference pellet, of course.<eos> - I know nothing of this.<eos> Well, on Earth, when our psychocardiogram readings are in harmony, and we wish to "make love," as you call it, we take an exaltation transference pellet and remain like this.<eos> Here, let me show you.
- See you after the credit-union meeting.<eos> - No, you get some sleep.<eos> As a matter of fact, we both should.<eos> - I'll see you tomorrow night at the plant.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night, sweet.<eos> Now, Lloyd, I told...<eos> Hello, Luis.<eos> Has your attorney explained to you that you don't have to answer our questions?
He just broke into my house!<eos> Mr. DeSalvo, your attorney, Mr. Asgeirsson here tells me you're resisting his representing you.<eos> I strongly urge you to follow his counsel.<eos> But I don't need an attorney.<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> You suppose the officers have nothing to do but go around framing innocent people?<eos> Why should they?<eos> Yeah. That's what I'd like to know. Why should they?<eos> This standard burglar tool was found on you when you were arrested.
And then, all of a sudden, I'd lose it.<eos> I mean I could actually...<eos> I could see it coming out of my head, kind of floating out of the box.<eos> Then it'd be gone, and I couldn't talk to him.<eos> I'd feel awful, and that's the way I feel about Mr. Bottomly.<eos> But you do feel good when you think you're going to be able to tell him something, don't you?<eos> But scared.<eos> Well, like...<eos> I suppose it's because I didn't tell him anything.<eos> What do you think would happen to you if you found out what this something is and you told him?
- What line?<eos> Sunshine Cab.<eos> - The guy who hit you, how old was he?<eos> - About 50.<eos> What was his hair like?<eos> Gray. Getting bald.<eos> Bald on both sides.<eos> - That?<eos> - No, balder.<eos> Am I helping you, sir?
There are multiple surgical incisions about the left side of the face.<eos> There is considerable hemorrhage in these deep tissues... and a number of surgical sutures are present about this area.<eos> There are entrances into the sinuses... and several pellets are found located within this area.<eos> There are also multiple lacerations and multiple gunshot entrance wounds... about the left side of the neck.<eos> And similar wounds are found on the left upper thorax.<eos> Period.<eos> The lacerations...<eos> Could you send up those prints right away?<eos> There's a soft rubber catheter extending out through the lateral extent of the...<eos> I understand Capt. Bennet told you, you had until Monday morning... to comply with my writ of habeas corpus.
Well?<eos> You remember now?<eos> Education Chief... it's been ages.<eos> Have you been well?<eos> What?<eos> You said goog-bye to me a few hours ago and went off to die.<eos> Don't scream at him if you want him to recover!<eos> You have to take your time, lead him by the hand.<eos> Cover every specific detail.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- You didn't know him?<eos> I was just interested in living my own life.<eos> They appear like disjointed elements of a totality which nobody assumes completely.<eos> I can't answer for the others. Because everybody answers for himself.<eos> It seems like you want to accuse me of being the originator of the invasion,<eos> - No, no, I don't blame you of anything.<eos> - I'm telling you I... I want to insist that my mission was purely spiritual.<eos> I have never handled a weapon.<eos> The fact that one is mixed up in the conspiracy doesn't make him a conspirator.<eos> I've told you that I have never been a political person.
Really?<eos> I see it in colour.<eos> You live with your parents? I sell detersives. Are you married?<eos> No...<eos> No. You don't like marriage?<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't like to have children?<eos> Why not?<eos> What do you think about love?<eos> It's a filthy thing. Does 69 mean anything to you?
You... I missed the middle part, but I can tell from the way... that you are enjoying yourselves... it must have been a very humorous anecdote... because the way you are laughing... just shows how much you enjoyed it.<eos> I love a good laugh, don't you?<eos> It makes the world go round.<eos> It's good to have a laugh.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Very good.<eos> I shall remember that one.<eos> They were bound and gagged for six hours.<eos> They took everything... even the gold watch my daddy'd left me.<eos> They took the gold watch that your father left you?
That's terribly funny.<eos> Yeah, it's been terribly funny for about twenty years.<eos> Gore, are you sure it's all right? It's not all right.<eos> It's divine.<eos> If you want to keep the women's vote... you've got to start with education.<eos> That's where you spend the most-- Oh, Mrs. Clutterbuck. Please, can I take this opportunity... to apologize to you formally... for what happened at the dining room table.<eos> Oh, my dear, just forget it.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> Thank God. What embarrassment. Oh, I know.<eos> It was that ridiculous little chair they put you on.
Our throat feeling better?<eos> - Still hurts, doesn't it? - See?<eos> He keeps pretending he can talk.<eos> That Bright Eyes is remarkable.<eos> He keeps trying to form words.<eos> You know what they say.<eos> Now what?<eos> He seems to want something.<eos> I'd be careful, doctor.<eos> What did I tell you?
Show him.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Do your trick.<eos> Speak. Go on.<eos> Speak again.<eos> There.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> Yes, amusing.<eos> A man acting like an ape.<eos> - Dr Zaius, I could swear he's answering you.
They start with the eyes.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> If you do, I'm going on alone.<eos> Have you read the Jack London story about two gold prospectors lost in the Klondike?<eos> Don't you ever read anything?<eos> You're a yahoo.<eos> I'd even say you're...<eos> Will you shut up?<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> I'm not answering you.
May my lips be sealed.<eos> Who are you alluding to, madam?<eos> Swallow, keep quiet, don't talk about that.<eos> Frankness is an enemy of love.<eos> - No, you'll talk now! Ouch!<eos> Listen, madam, I've always been like a gentleman with you.<eos> But if you don't talk now, I won't even follow manners and will beat you, you know?<eos> Marino, don't let me say a thing you couldn't like!<eos> - What will I do, must I break this?<eos> So swear on your mother you won't tell anybody what I'll say to you!
- Secret Service!<eos> Oh, he can find your Marisa in a very short time.<eos> Really?<eos> Rather, go and talk to him immediately.<eos> Go, right now!<eos> But don't tell him that I've told you!<eos> Go, c'mon, quick!<eos> Will you bet I'll win the first prize? - No!<eos> Sir general... - What?<eos> May I talk to you about a bit confidential thing?
What an ugly town this has become.<eos> They have a lot of police out here.<eos> Who was the young woman at the window before you came to the door? Young woman?<eos> I'm afraid you're mistaken.<eos> No, I'm not. I saw her.<eos> Dark hair and eyes, about 20.<eos> I'm quite sure you think you saw someone.<eos> I'm in the full possession of my faculties.<eos> Please, allow me to show you something.<eos> Never believe everything your eyes tell you.
You know how funny things can look i-in the fog sometimes.<eos> - I think you've been up on that Haight-Ashbury beat too long.<eos> Swing that light over here.<eos> - What's that thing?<eos> - It's a dried squid, Sergeant.<eos> Here's the damages.<eos> Can you pay it?<eos> - I'm sorry. I have no money.<eos> - Then your car will be impounded.<eos> My guess is the judge will order you to sell it at auction and the proceeds given to Mr Wu.
Will you let me go?<eos> You know I only speak once.<eos> Get inside.<eos> Hey, man...<eos> Hello.<eos> What are you doing lying at my door?<eos> Oh, I'm the teacher.<eos> So what?<eos> Flavio sent me here.<eos> Flavio sent you here, did he?
Yeah, I think we ought to let the TV and press boys in on this.<eos> Coming in right now.<eos> Out.<eos> I can still get you out of this.<eos> All right, move away, we're pulling out.<eos> Wait.<eos> Mr. Halder, it's gonna have to be your way.<eos> Sergeant?<eos> I'll pay you back, Mr. Halder.<eos> I don't know how or when, but I'll pay you back.
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.<eos> Next time, for sure.<eos> Hi.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.<eos> I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.<eos> Always.<eos> Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother.
He agreed with me that this was the top German agent in Britain.<eos> Is your name, Colonel.<eos> Don't look so shocked.<eos> Surely, you suspected it.<eos> Otherwise, why were you here to meet us? In case you were found out?<eos> Go on.<eos> You see, you underestimated Adm. Rolland.<eos> He'd suspected you and the others for some time.<eos> He brought me and Mary back from Italy because we were the only ones... in his department that he could trust, yourself included.<eos> He asked you to choose a leader for this expedition.
I like the rain.<eos> That's not what you said.<eos> You're right. It's not.<eos> You said -<eos> That the rain made me sad. Is that it?<eos> Isn't that a trite thing to say?<eos> No, because the rain doesn't make everyone sad.<eos> Tell me something else you find interesting.<eos> People never really talk in a movie.<eos> I wanted to do that with you.
By taking an interesting topic and talking about it.<eos> Then let's talk about sex.<eos> Not that again.<eos> - Are you afraid to? - Absolutely not.<eos> I think you're afraid.<eos> Think what you like, but I'm not.<eos> Why would I be?<eos> Why does sex always frighten people?<eos> It doesn't frighten me.<eos> For instance, I'll ask you to say something and I bet you won't say it.
- And you pray for her.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Professor, I have something to say to you.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> Careful with what you are doing.<eos> I don't believe your bullshit.<eos> I'm not interested in your professional future.<eos> But whatever happens to Elena, I'll put you under charge.<eos> Even if you had nothing to do with it.<eos> - Give me back the money I gave you.
And then?<eos> Then you fell asleep, so everyone left, but I came back to look for my handbag.<eos> Enough of that.<eos> Why are you hiding in that closet?<eos> I've stowed away.<eos> - You what?<eos> - I'm going to America.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> - Please don't get excited.<eos> If you let me stay until the purser's checked all the passengers... I'll leave your cabin and will never bother you again.
- Guard.<eos> - All right, what's the deal?<eos> What's the deal if I do stay alive?<eos> - Might get off the hook.<eos> - Count me in.<eos> But you foul up once, anywhere along the line, just once... and you'll be back here at the end of a rope.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> What's the matter with you?
But it seems to me I remember a quotation that goes like:<eos> Vengeance is mine.<eos> Vengeance is mine. I will repay, sayeth the Lord.<eos> Paul to the Romans, Chapter 12.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Now, isn't that supposed to mean... that we leave punishment of the transgressors to his hands?<eos> That's right, major.<eos> That's exactly what it means.<eos> But it doesn't restrict him to the kind of tools he would use, now does it?<eos> And like I told you, major, I only do what I'm called on to do.
This one won't.<eos> It's his woman, but he won't do it.<eos> He doesn't care enough about her, but maybe somebody else does.<eos> All right. You, lady.<eos> You worry about his wife more than he does.<eos> Go on down there.<eos> Cut her loose, then get shot in the back or the front... if the Mexican by the trough does it.<eos> In the back or in the front, one way or the other.<eos> Just give me your knife.<eos> That's all I want from you.
You know damn well we didn't hire him off a homicide squad.<eos> Yeah, well, it's gonna be his week.<eos> 'cause Colbert's only the start.<eos> I say this nigger won't live past Saturday.<eos> Mrs. Colbert, can you tell me about your husband's enemies?<eos> That's Endicott.<eos> He's been fighting us all the way.<eos> He sits up on his hill and runs this county.<eos> Or did, until we moved in.<eos> Did your husband tell you where he was going last night?
You shouldn't want me.<eos> It would be a huge mistake...<eos> - Here, sew it on.<eos> - Can't you hear me...?<eos> You almost killed me.<eos> That's not what we were talking about.<eos> Mr. Pelnar mentioned it but I don't know you.<eos> - Are you familiar with this style?<eos> - Why, of course.<eos> I believe you but I'm not sure you can do it.
I'm very sorry about the accident.<eos> You?<eos> Are you the driver?<eos> Are you the one who killed my son?<eos> What is it that you want now?<eos> You...<eos> You have killed my son.<eos> So why did you come here?<eos> We'll talk some other time.<eos> We'll compensate you for what happened.
Yes, sir.<eos> Show him in.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal.<eos> Reporting as ordered, sir.<eos> At ease.<eos> Well, it's a distinguished record, corporal.<eos> I see from your press clippings,<eos> Otto is obviously keeping a scrapbook for you.
What's going on?<eos> - Mr. Barnier is out of order.<eos> - Call the repair service.<eos> He made strange comments about a suitcase full of jewels, cash, and an employee who stole 60 million.<eos> - And a maid who married a baron.<eos> - Yes, our maid married a baron.<eos> Maybe you misunderstood about the rest.<eos> So long as you get along with my daughter.<eos> I'll leave you two alone.<eos> Did Dad tell you I'm expecting a child?
The mike doesn't stick, so it can't be steel, and there's no corrosion of the surface.<eos> We'll dig down a bit. Let the dog see the rabbit, mmm?<eos> Corporal Gibson, two men with shovels.<eos> Right, Sergeant.<eos> Webster, Jenkins.<eos> Right, Sergeant, five minutes. Five minutes.<eos> You know, I don't think this is any kind of metal.<eos> Then what, sir?<eos> Captain Potter, can you tell me yet how long this is going to take? I realise it must be difficult.<eos> Look, sir, I advised you to leave.
"Yes, it's him, " or "No, it's not him. " Understood?<eos> Bring him in.<eos> Do you recognize this man?<eos> Did you see him come out of the office hallway?<eos> Yes or no.<eos> No, absolutely not.<eos> Thank you. Step into my office.<eos> Do you still recognize him as the man who came out of the hallway?<eos> I can answer unequivocally.<eos> That's what I'm asking you to do.
I doubt it.<eos> Ever see a guy stay handcuffed for 48 hours and not open his mouth?<eos> I haven't seen many.<eos> Stick with the girl, but don't lose his trail.<eos> If you were the man wanted by the police, you could say the criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.<eos> May I get in?<eos> Why did you say you didn't recognize me?<eos> Why did you kill Martey?<eos> I was told I'd be paid.<eos> What did he do to you?
Oh, God.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> It's a shame...<eos> They won't be needing me after all.<eos> I won't be working as a teacher.<eos> I'll be giving Muzio a hand in his studio, right?<eos> - Yes, yes, of course.<eos> - I can support myself.<eos> We appreciate that your friend is helping you out, that he loves you...<eos> - And Ermanno loves you too, you know...
Particularly when we have to charge you an all-inclusive price... - as you see. - Beg your pardon?<eos> High season.<eos> Our price includes dinner and breakfast always.<eos> Always.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think the inspector is waiting for you outside.<eos> Inspector?<eos> Concerning the expenses for the pumpers and such like.<eos> We will see you again, I hope.<eos> What's French for "I don't believe you and you're not going to get a damn penny"?
Well, then you may help your husband if you told us where we can find whatever it was he was delivering.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, then perhaps you know to whom he was to deliver it.<eos> Has there been anyone here asking for your husband?<eos> Look, if there was, and if I told you who it was, would you let my husband go?<eos> I make no promises, of course, but I think it would help, yes.<eos> The artist doing the sketches.<eos> Thank you, my dear.<eos> You have helped your husband a great deal.<eos> I told you, I don't know anybody named Vincent Dean!
Polya, go.<eos> Get the doctor!<eos> Get the doctor up here, and two more attendants, immediately!<eos> Max, straitjacket.<eos> Give him 500 micrograms of the psychedelic and 3 milligrams of the narcotic.<eos> And put up the pads.<eos> I wouldn't want him to hurt himself.<eos> Did you see my husband?<eos> Yes, I saw him, but he's most uncooperative.<eos> He wouldn't tell you where it is?
You could not have put it in the mail?<eos> Of course I could have, and your secretary would have returned it to me unopened.<eos> Or worse, she would have looked at it and told you it was terrible.<eos> But it is not.<eos> It is a good film, Mr Klaar.<eos> I am good.<eos> A fine producer should know about me.<eos> You have no lack of ego, Miss Mikeli.<eos> Please, Mr Klaar, if this film is not as good as I say it is,<eos> I swear, I will never trouble you again.
Look out!<eos> Why don't you watch where you're going?<eos> I am sorry, senor.<eos> I hope there's not much damage.<eos> I don't care about the damage.<eos> I've got to get through.<eos> I did not hit you hard enough to do this much damage.<eos> This metal is soft as butter.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I told you, I was in a hurry.
We'd like to see Commandant Sefra.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm from World News and View magazine in New York.<eos> And we have permission to do a photo story on the prison and, of course, the man who made it what it was.<eos> "The man who made it what it was."<eos> You see, what I have in mind is to recreate what it must've felt like to be a prisoner in this place.<eos> This is Pierre Grillou.<eos> Pierre is a professional model, and we'll be working together.<eos> Get out.<eos> Well, I have a letter here from the District Commissioner ordering you to give us every cooperation.
- Right.<eos> Raff!<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> Where are those two from the magazine?<eos> One of them has left.<eos> The other is in the solitary cells.<eos> - Which one left? - The photographer.<eos> Then the black one is still here.<eos> Lose something, Monsieur Grillou?<eos> I asked you if you lost something.
W256 calling Red Deer.<eos> W256 calling Red Deer.<eos> This is Red Deer, W256.<eos> Request code five, request code five.<eos> Acknowledge code five.<eos> Yes? This is your chancellor.<eos> This is Colonel Stahl, Excellency.<eos> Please advise me regarding the presence of an astrologer, Mademoiselle Varnay, on the plane.<eos> She is there on my orders.<eos> But, Excellency, I spoke with you on the telephone only a short while ago and you did not tell me about her at that time.
What do you think?<eos> I could not help it, Mr McMillan.<eos> We were handcuffed together when he escaped.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> - If you're lying...<eos> - Oh, I'm not lying.<eos> He wants money.<eos> He made me bring him here.<eos> What did he tell you about me?
You get to remove all my makeup in front of three men who will kill you if they see what you're doing.<eos> They'll kill us both.<eos> So they would.<eos> - Open it.<eos> - Open it yourself.<eos> I'm gonna search every inch of this place including that safe.<eos> - Now open it.<eos> - Don't touch it, Frank.<eos> I have a cease and desist order here signed by Judge Pender.<eos> If you'll read it, you'll see that it specifically orders you out of this house as of now.
- he was with you, Daly.<eos> - One of my men was killed when Wayne made his getaway this morning.<eos> Well, what do you want us to do, send flowers?<eos> No, you just tell Wayne and whoever helped him that they're dead.<eos> No trial, no friendly judges, no juries to intimidate, nothing.<eos> Nobody but me that they're gonna have to answer to.<eos> Would you believe it, a cop talking about taking the law into his own hands?<eos> I think our good friend Senator Townsend should know what kind of men he's got working on his committees.<eos> I don't know who you are, but if you're sitting behind this desk, you've taken over for Wayne.<eos> So I'm gonna tell you just what I told him.
Go stop the impostor.<eos> Frederick, you're back.<eos> I hope you're feeling better.<eos> That is my personal desk!<eos> Oh, yes. Yes, of course, it is.<eos> Baron Frick, I beg you to listen.<eos> Won't anyone listen to me?<eos> - Gentlemen...<eos> - Herr General, I must talk to you.<eos> Your Kommandant is talking to you.
If that's true, why wasn't that somebody ever found?<eos> They never looked for him.<eos> They had their patsy: my father.<eos> But, David, if what you say is true and your father was innocent and really loved his country, why are you doing what you're doing?<eos> This country killed my father.<eos> I was Jason Redding's best friend.<eos> As it turned out, his only friend.<eos> That last night in the death house, I promised him I would raise his son.<eos> And I also promised myself that David and I would one day make them pay for the murder of David's father.<eos> I wanna know what the Federal Security people know, and exactly how much the man known as Wilson Channing has told you.
Goodbye, Judge.<eos> Have a good trip.<eos> That should do it, Mr Lowell.<eos> Have your men keep an eye on the house tonight.<eos> I don't want Miller to get another chance.<eos> He will try again, won't he, Miss Marwood?<eos> I don't think he will, Mr Lowell.<eos> I find that difficult to believe.<eos> A man tries to kill me, and you say he won't try again.<eos> That man will never bother you again, Mr Lowell.
Dear God.<eos> What are they doing to you?<eos> They are teaching us, Helmut. They're just...<eos> Just teaching us.<eos> Dr Cherlotov.<eos> I'll be leaving soon.<eos> I didn't want to go without saying goodbye.<eos> Is there any more I can do for you, Doctor?<eos> Perhaps they will let you out soon.<eos> Maybe they will even permit you to attack a very important problem.
Do you see this?<eos> Now, this is a rivet, Miss Putnam.<eos> I sell your company over 20 million of these a year at three and a half cents apiece.<eos> - I see. - No, no.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> You don't see yet.<eos> I sell them to you for three and a half cents, but your automated accounting insists on paying me 35 cents apiece.<eos> Do you mean to say that we have actually been overpaying you by...?<eos> By exactly ten times, yes.<eos> Is it true, Mr. Taggart, that the U.S. State Department has asked you to return the seal?
Under no circumstances can His Excellency be allowed to fly.<eos> Hold one car on the night train to Bern.<eos> Maximum security arrangements.<eos> - Anything yet?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Stay out there, Willy.<eos> Doctor.<eos> I want you to tell me honestly.<eos> What are his chances?<eos> Honestly, it is as I told you before.
Perhaps it is not important.<eos> Or he may be a careful agent.<eos> If he calls you again, keep him talking for at least 30 seconds.<eos> We'll trace the call.<eos> Very well, Captain.<eos> I'm sorry about last night, Madam Goren, but something came up.<eos> Please accept my apologies.<eos> Is Stephen there now?<eos> I see.<eos> As I told you, it concerns a gift.
I've got to get in touch with someone, my partner.<eos> I will order you a phone.<eos> Remember, rest and quiet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Would you like a drink?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, no, of course not.<eos> Mark told me you never drink.<eos> He said your only vice was money.<eos> What else did he tell you?
He'd have been quite perfect.<eos> And I thought to myself,<eos> "You know what, Alfie? You know what you done?"<eos> "You murdered him."<eos> Well, there's nothing you can do about it now, Alf.<eos> - Will you lend me 25 quid, Nat?<eos> - Don't be bloody funny!<eos> - That's all I've got in the world.<eos> - Take this watch as security.<eos> If I haven't paid you back in two weeks, you can sell it.
There's nothing like a kidnapping now and then to keep the circulation going.<eos> The fact is that there are very few men on this Earth whom I admire more than you.<eos> You're a very great man.<eos> No man is greater than the people he serves.<eos> Your respect must be for them.<eos> Yes, sir. I...<eos> I didn't know that you were in England.<eos> You are quite right.<eos> I am not. You have not seen me.<eos> The first favour I would ask of you is to help keep my visit here a secret.
Mr Pollock, very good of you to reconsider my proposal.<eos> I always try my best to cooperate with the very rich, Mr Beshraavi.<eos> Do sit down.<eos> You mustn't mind Hassan, Mr Pollock.<eos> - Hassan?<eos> - He's a peregrine falcon.<eos> I've named him Hassan Jena after our beloved prime minister.<eos> They share so many sterling qualities.<eos> A sharp eye, a fierce dedication, and very sharp claws.<eos> Hassan won't harm you, Mr Pollock, if you don't separate him from his master.
Oh, it's your house.<eos> I got the impression it was Mr Beshraavi's house.<eos> Nejim gives that impression with everything he borrows, but I assure you it is my house, and he's the guest.<eos> Would you care to stay for dinner?<eos> I'm afraid that our street urchin has already invited me.<eos> How bothersome.<eos> You are working on the cipher, aren't you?<eos> Let's not talk about work.<eos> Let's talk about you.<eos> Listen, I don't know what Nejim has told you...
-All right.<eos> -Wrap that one up and give it back.<eos> You didn't have to tell me that.<eos> Look at that helicopter up there with a sign on it.<eos> Happy birthday, Mr. Rogers.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Oh, look, that's ours.<eos> -That's ours.<eos> -That belongs to me, madam.<eos> What's the matter with you?
- Why?<eos> - What?<eos> How did it come about?<eos> What made it begin?<eos> What made you want to do-<eos> How could someone like you be doing this kind of work?<eos> I know everyone says that.<eos> But you!<eos> You're not like them.<eos> When I say something to you, you look at me.
You wouldn't understand.<eos> That's why I want you to explain.<eos> THE COP IS STARTING TO SUSPECT SOMETHING<eos> I CAN'T HIDE IT ANY LONGER<eos> The world is big.<eos> Dear Mrs. Kura. You still don't believe what I said?<eos> Eisuke is the high-noon attacker beyond all doubt.<eos> Has love for him blinded you?<eos> Can't you believe he strangled and raped women?<eos> In that case, although I'm ashamed, I'll tell you what he did to me a year ago.
Cinematography by FRANZ RATH<eos> WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY<eos> Beineberg, please keep an eye on my son.<eos> You can count on me, sir.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Something solid and decisive about you won me over instantly.<eos> Cigar?<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I wish my boy were more like you.
And he say it's true... that his eyes are like black daggers... and before them, all men tremble.<eos> The Major Kitchener has eyes as blue as little flowers.<eos> The man was bragging. He'd never seen Kitchener. He didn't want to say so.<eos> That's true, master.<eos> If he was lying... how could he know about that ring I gave Stewart Pasha?<eos> Anyway, if the Mahdi wanted to send me a false message... why would he say the soldiers were coming?<eos> It makes no sense, Khaleel.<eos> That is right, master. Tell Abdullah he may make his preparations. Then he must come to me.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> The Mahdi asks you to come to his tent in peace.
Your soldiers are in Egypt.<eos> They play cards, drink the liquor, pursue women.<eos> Why would you send me a false message? It is sometimes wise, Gordon Pasha... to provide a man with a few sunny hours... of fraudulent hope so that when night comes... he will have a more perfect inward vision... of the truth of his hopelessness.<eos> I sent the message.<eos> There is no British army.<eos> You are alone. Quite alone. If this is true... then what difference can it make to you... if one man leaves or stays?<eos> It is important to me.<eos> Please explain to me the importance.<eos> Because I am a man of mercy! And I tell you go!<eos> Leave in safety. Now. You are not a man of mercy... for your visions have not revealed to you what mercy is... and so why do you do this?
If I could at least put the tracks digital ...<eos> Tell me what it is?<eos> And he explained the other partner ... you have my uncle did not want to accept again in the cemetery because not have an exhumation order ...<eos> They say a corpse can not be buried twice ...<eos> We carry the corpse us for the house, we get there ... do not know what to do ...<eos> My aunt, the poor, put it a little Ice and ...<eos> I think if I get the exhumation order ...<eos> Look, go to 46 ...<eos> One who is to snuff.<eos> He will tell you what to do.
Take her to the mortuary.<eos> When can you start? Right away.<eos> But a qualified witness is needed.<eos> There are guidelines I have to follow. I told you to move the corpse inside, immediately!<eos> As to the witness, don't worry.<eos> I'll send you...<eos> Inspector! Inspector!<eos> The burgomeister sent me!<eos> He wants you to come back to the inn. He couldn't keep the people you were trying to interview.<eos> He wants to talk to you immediately!
Look, we can leave here if you like, right away.<eos> No.<eos> This is our home and we're staying.<eos> But promise me one thing.<eos> You will never leave me here on my own.<eos> What is it, darling?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought I heard something.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong with you? Come in.
Walt, are you all right?<eos> - What happened? - I'm all right.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Who's she?<eos> - Did the Russians do it, Dad?<eos> Walt, Walt, what happened?<eos> - Take the gag out and I'll tell you!<eos> - He's OK, he's alive!<eos> - Alice! - Take her gag out.<eos> Alice, what did they do to you?
We guarantee a death of this kind.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Delicious!<eos> They have a wonderful way... of baking cheese on it so that it gets very crispy.<eos> Now, there are any number of ways you can be found.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I mean, your body can be found.<eos> The victim of some kind of machinery, an explosion.<eos> A hunting misadventure.<eos> Oh, but I think these are somewhat too gross for you.
What else would you choose?<eos> - I guess I'd like to paint stuff.<eos> - Pictures?<eos> Pictures and things.<eos> Well, I think the creative wish pattern is pretty self-evident.<eos> You mean, I...<eos> I ought to be a painter?<eos> Exactly!<eos> You see, painting allows you a basic creative outlet... as well as an environment in which these sublimations will have free vent.<eos> Now, let's take a look at the program we've worked out for you.
No, I don't mean to California.<eos> To the company.<eos> Start again, all over.<eos> Antiochus Wilson can die, can't he?<eos> The company.<eos> Is it possible?<eos> I think so, sir.<eos> Begin again.<eos> Quite honestly... I'm not the least bit sorry... because there were certain mistakes made in my case...<eos> Of course, but before we go into all that, let me ask you... whether you can recommend and sponsor a new client.
If it hadn't been getting a bit small for me, I shouldn't have parted with it.<eos> Of course not.<eos> There you are.<eos> I'm glad you applied to me first.<eos> You've acquired the unpleasant habit of staring at people's knees when they give you a coin.<eos> Take the blasted money, now I've had all the trouble getting it!<eos> Perhaps I owe you this sum for all I know.<eos> Please realize you are talking to a thoroughly honest person.<eos> Pick it up, before somebody more deserving than you does!<eos> Excuse me. I had a pencil in my pocket in the waistcoat I left with you this morning.
No, she's one of the glories of the heavens.<eos> A saga! He owns a lot of property, eh?<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Kindly remember that his name is Johan Ahrend Happolati judging by the initials.<eos> Johan Ahrend Happolati?<eos> You should see his wife!<eos> Fattest woman in the world, so help me God.<eos> Don't you believe she's fat?<eos> Oh, I dare say. A man like that probably has a fat wife.<eos> Hell's bells, do you think I'm filling you with a pack of lies?
Of course, my candle.<eos> Getting dark early these days.<eos> - Yes.<eos> There'll be snow tomorrow. - It seldom comes so soon.<eos> I haven't come here to listen to your weather forecasts.<eos> Do you know I cheated you?<eos> That you never received any money?<eos> Some people are so disgusting!<eos> A grocer who cheats himself deserves to be cheated.<eos> You just talk and talk and give me change of 5 crowns - - I'd never given you.
One doesn't have to be mad just because one is a sensitive person.<eos> There are people who live on trifles and die because of a harsh word.<eos> Alright, I'm going.<eos> Look, my hand is already on the door handle.<eos> Goodnight!<eos> Goodnight, I said!<eos> At least you could say goodnight to me now that I've said it twice.<eos> I'm not asking to meet you again because I know it would pain you.<eos> Why didn't you leave me in peace?<eos> What have I done to you?
We have some very nice farms around here.<eos> Well, I decided to give it a miss tonight.<eos> Michael, I think Professor Lindt needs a drink.<eos> Yes.<eos> Let us drink the wine and discuss the harvest.<eos> Armstrong, I think that, Professor, the Vice Rector's waiting.<eos> Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck.<eos> Let us have some intelligent conversation.<eos> The Vienna waltz.<eos> Did I tell you that my sister Emily got knocked down by a tram in Vienna?
Mendel.<eos> Trouble.<eos> No, it's these ants.<eos> I was awake half the night trying to find out when they go to sleep.<eos> Here, I'll let you in.<eos> - Come on in.<eos> - I hope I'm not being a nuisance.<eos> No, I was flattered you phoned.<eos> Let's have your coat and hat.<eos> I made up a bed for you.
I had none but him.<eos> One year ago in Mürren, on a skiing holiday,<eos> Samuel met that Sonntag.<eos> Sonntag?<eos> Sunday?<eos> - Did you ever meet this man?<eos> - No, never.<eos> - Then how did you know his cover name?<eos> - 'Cause Samuel told me.<eos> What else did your husband tell you?
What about me ?<eos> Oh yeah, what about him ?<eos> We must fulfill their requirements.<eos> and you can't betray our trust.<eos> - Mr Minister.<eos> - More courage, my friend.<eos> Please don't worry. Everything will be okay. You'll see.<eos> Will I ?<eos> Don't think about it.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow, and will hand you the money.
You will leave the money where they tell you to do so, and please..<eos> - If I'll be able to.<eos> More courage.<eos> You have to do your duty, and we have to do ours.<eos> But don't tell them to follow me.<eos> You've heard what they had said. If you follow me, they will kill me at instance.<eos> So will they do with president.<eos> They will kill me anyways...<eos> Please look straight into my eyes.<eos> Is my word enough for you ? Yes.
Calm down, Rollin.<eos> We're dealing with a mind under hypnotic influence, also the probable effects of whatever drug was used to help program her.<eos> Look, it's Wednesday night.<eos> We have less than 16 hours to pull her out.<eos> - If we don't, she'll be killed.<eos> - Or kill herself.<eos> Yes?<eos> - Any word yet?<eos> - No.<eos> Look, I told you I needed time.
They're marked, all right.<eos> I just haven't found out how yet.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hello.<eos> There's a matter of some delicacy I would like to discuss with you.<eos> Can't it wait till morning?<eos> No, I don't think it can wait until morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll be right over.<eos> As I told you over the phone, Your Highness, something has come up.
Maybe I can.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe you can, huh?<eos> Presenting the daring Pavlova of the high trapeze, Mademoiselle Crystal, who will perform feats of daring and acrobatic skill 50 feet above solid ground with no safety net.<eos> Who are you?<eos> A friend, Your Eminence.<eos> How do I know?<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> Tell me nothing.<eos> But come with me, and I'll prove to you I can get you out of this place.
- This court has already attempted to find the files relating to such operations.<eos> They were burnt by the traitors, Klimi and Lazloff.<eos> Will the court please question Magda Brujetski?<eos> Call Magda Brujetski.<eos> State your relationship to the accused, lmry Rogosh.<eos> I worked in his department.<eos> I was his secretary.<eos> Was the relationship also not more intimate?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did the accused ever talk to you about himself and Colonel Klimi?
- You can't do this to me!<eos> - Guard! Mr Rogosh, be seated!<eos> What were you trying to say, Mr Lopek?<eos> My loyalty is completely to this people's republic, and I firmly...<eos> If the defence advocate is finished...<eos> I take only a moment more of your time only to apologise to this court for taking up its valuable time.<eos> Would you please call John Makavaoo?<eos> Did you talk recently to the accused?<eos> From my cell, yes.<eos> And what was the nature of the questions he asked you?
I chose those men, General.<eos> They are thoroughly loyal.<eos> I know they did not desert.<eos> I leave that entirely up to you, Alisio.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> You don't understand, General.<eos> I suspect something.<eos> A coup. A plot.<eos> I don't know what.<eos> You remember what I told you at the briefing this morning?
I know who you are, Colonel Shtemenko.<eos> So you can drop the accent.<eos> It's not too good anyway.<eos> I know what you are and what you want.<eos> I'll kill the professor for you.<eos> What makes you think I can afford to believe that sort of thing?<eos> Any solution that arrives so neatly and so conveniently<eos> - must obviously be some sort of trap.<eos> - What possible trap?<eos> I'm not going to tell you where the professor is hidden.
If you will take me there...<eos> Yes, I will, when I come back.<eos> Miguel.<eos> Who is it?<eos> The police.<eos> Open up.<eos> Open up.<eos> The machine is jammed.<eos> The lever won't come down.<eos> I tell you I do not know any Anna Kroll!
I don't like being dishonest about the supernatural.<eos> Barney, we're on our own.<eos> Better get started.<eos> Ariana, can you at least stall Martha for half an hour while we're in the living room?<eos> Oh, don't be angry with me.<eos> All right, I'll try to arrange another séance.<eos> But the rest is up to you.<eos> - Yes, who is it?<eos> - It's Ariana.<eos> I know how tired you must be, but I'd like to talk to you.
Pasetto.<eos> Or else Taverna Flavia.<eos> Or Casina Valadier, if you like music.<eos> Do you go there often?<eos> Now and then.<eos> It would be funny if you were at one table and I at another.<eos> I'd ask you to come to my table.<eos> If you were on your own of course.<eos> I wouldn't go there on my own.<eos> That's why I'm asking you to go there with me.
He's unfriendly to people he likes.<eos> Not me. He never finds fault with me.<eos> He ignores me completely.<eos> I won't do as he says.<eos> It's some sort of trick.<eos> I'm leaving, no matter what Red Beard says.<eos> We are under the jurisdiction of the magistrate's office here.<eos> And it has appointed you officially.<eos> You can't hide or run away. Thanks to you, I can go.<eos> I'll take you to your room.
Who are you?<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> General Kohler's signature is magic.<eos> You will excuse us, major.<eos> Before you give orders, may I ask your rank?<eos> Courtesan, first class.<eos> Compliments of General Kohler.<eos> I think we have covered everything, colonel.<eos> General Kohler did not tell me you were so handsome.<eos> What did General Kohler tell you about me?
Hey, Queffle.<eos> You're going to knock yourself out.<eos> You'd better have somebody take over for a while.<eos> Oh, no, sir.<eos> I'm running the ship from here.<eos> - Steer course: 0-9-2.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Excuse me, captain.<eos> - What?<eos> Did Lieutenant Krindlemeyer tell you about the shrimp schools?
Did you see him?<eos> And my prisoner?<eos> Maybe he's in the next car.<eos> Come on!<eos> I shouldn't have done that!<eos> Oh, sure you should, honey.<eos> No question about it in my mind at all.<eos> It was morally wrong.<eos> But it happened so fast, I didn't know what to think.<eos> I was afraid he'd hurt you.
Precisely, the Big Hunt!<eos> I'd like to propose a big publicity stunt for your product with your swimming pool, a crocodile, and the killing... of an American girl.<eos> To me, the idea of killing someone... for publicity always seemed to be a very amusing idea.<eos> Do you know what worries me?<eos> That a woman would be killed.<eos> - Why?<eos> - It might not be good for sales. Insist on it!<eos> If we'd kill someone else...?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I'll tell you, this year it's trendy to kill women.
I want a fine dress.<eos> It's not every day you get married.<eos> - With orange blossoms?<eos> - It can't go without.<eos> Would you like to try them out?<eos> The bridegroom and here the bride.<eos> Very pretty, your fiancée...<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I don't regret I marry.<eos> Didn't I tell you she's pretty?
Thank you!<eos> I'm not asking you anything, but it's over, right ?<eos> Yes<eos> I don't have to tell you, but clearly Shoko must never find out about this.<eos> It's nothing of great value, merely a token of gratitude.<eos> What is it ?<eos> Why are you up so early today ?<eos> Two nights after this brief excursion during which I had killed a man, a stranger came to see me at home.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Does this remind you of something ?
What's the name of that temperance woman? Martindale?<eos> Massingale, sir.<eos> Cora Templeton Massingale.<eos> Oh, yes, Massingale. Do you know where she is?<eos> On a tour of New England last month, sir.<eos> Then Boston, to Philadelphia, to Trenton.<eos> She may be a female hellcat about whiskey, sir, but a fine figure of a woman, with eyes...<eos> - Smythe.<eos> - Sir?<eos> I asked you where she is. Oh.
- You're a hard man to kill, Admiral.<eos> - Seems so, sir.<eos> I managed to get my command shot to hell with no trouble.<eos> Feel you betrayed them by staying alive?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Seven ships sacrificed.<eos> It'll make a fancy court martial.<eos> - He's still doped up?<eos> - A little, sir.<eos> Let me straighten you out, Admiral.
Something like that.<eos> Seven ships sacrificed.<eos> It'll make a fancy court martial.<eos> - He's still doped up?<eos> - A little, sir.<eos> Let me straighten you out, Admiral.<eos> The battle in Pala Passage was a decisive victory.<eos> Skyhook's on its way and the Japs can't stop it.<eos> I'm having you flown to the States, but not for court martial.<eos> They'll stick a peg leg on you and ship you back.
You hypocrite.<eos> I think you're in with them.<eos> Well, none of you are gonna get away with it.<eos> I can't prove anything against you. I've got proof against the others.<eos> - I've got this weight.<eos> - What about the weight, lieutenant?<eos> - I said, what about the weight?<eos> - This...<eos> This isn't the same.<eos> - This isn't the one I gave you.
Until somebody comes along with four A's, anyway.<eos> You're selling something?<eos> No. You are.<eos> You want any?<eos> Well, can we talk about it?<eos> Sure!<eos> Sure, come on in.<eos> My secretary's out to lunch, and my partner's on a case.<eos> My name is Caselle.<eos> Who recommended you to this office?
You don't even talk like a detective.<eos> Hey, Stillwell.<eos> Who else knows about your amnesia?<eos> No one, except you and Dr. Broden.<eos> No one else?<eos> Well, I just realized it myself.<eos> How could anyone...<eos> If you really don't know, my telling you isn't going to help.<eos> She knows!<eos> The girl I told you about.
The two years in California, perhaps.<eos> But why? Why?<eos> These are strange times, Mr. Stillwell.<eos> From here on, you'll begin to remember everything.<eos> Bits and pieces will fall into place with increasing frequency, If you have the courage to face that terrible thing that made you forget.<eos> But whatever it is, I don't want to know about it.<eos> Goodbye, Mr. Stillwell.<eos> You're a brilliant man, Broden, and no doubt a good scientist, but you're not much of a doctor, or a human being, either.<eos> God knows.<eos> Has the doctor made another appointment with you, Mr. Stillwell?
The last one was St Anthony's Abbey, which had been built by my father.<eos> It lay right between two armies, one German and one American.<eos> I provided the German army with its field-of-fire, which it didn't need at all.<eos> The manager asks if you will receive a Dr Nettlinger.<eos> - Would you receive someone called Nettlinger? - No.<eos> Schoolfellow of Robert's?<eos> Ministerial councillor, director, manager?<eos> And you sent him to the Prince Heinrich Hotel!<eos> He doesn't like it, my son Robert, when people disturb him.<eos> But, my child, he won't do anything to you on that account!
We want to do everything we can.<eos> We understand that your position is not an enviable one.<eos> Mr. Brtko happens to be a very good man...<eos> He knows our organization's financial difficulties.<eos> We have voted on paying you a certain sum not as a gift...<eos> but a regular income.<eos> Do trust us as we trust you, because it was the Lord's will to choose you as benefactor of the old widow Lautmann.<eos> Don't harm her...<eos> Why would Mr. Brtko harm her?<eos> It's just like I told you at the meeting - our - our dear neighbor, old Mrs. Lautmann, whom God has seen fit to let live till the admirable age of 78 years, has found the most just and honorable "arisator"
And here we have a young lady...<eos> She's exercising.<eos> Doing the gymnastics.<eos> With that gentleman?<eos> I guess.<eos> -But how did you come up...<eos> -Wait a minute!<eos> Here we've got a surprise!<eos> Clause six!<eos> -Our insurance gives you...
She loves children.<eos> You can reach us at - What's the number?<eos> 225-70-01.<eos> - This is Frank's niece.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can't you say "BALzac 70-01 "?<eos> You don't know Balzac?<eos> Read César Birotteau, how the Fifth Symphony pounded in his poor head.<eos> - What's eating you?
Abandonment by the father...<eos> I was not abandoned by the father, Dr. Hewitt.<eos> The father was abandoned by me.<eos> Are you trying to shock me, Miss Reynolds?<eos> You may call me Mrs. Reynolds, if you like.<eos> Because if you are, it's not easily done.<eos> You asked the questions.<eos> You're a minister, you wouldn't want me to lie to you, would you?<eos> Neither would I want you to lie to me if I were a truck driver or a disk jockey.<eos> I questioned you because it's my job to do so.
Finally I said to myself, "Striker, you've done a lot of fool things."<eos> "You haven't done any lately, and you're overdue." I'm sorry I got here too late.<eos> _ You two would've made a lively team.<eos> _ Well, thanks!<eos> _ Why don't you come on in?<eos> _ Thank you.<eos> But it'll be a favour to my bad knee to stay here.<eos> _ It's been nice meeting you.<eos> _ I've got a proposition for you.<eos> I wouldn't blame you if you turned me down.
But I don't have another.<eos> When we enter the abbey, our worldly clothes go to the poor.<eos> What about this one?<eos> The poor didn't want it.<eos> There wasn't time to make a new dress. I can make clothes.<eos> I'll see that you get some material.<eos> Today, if possible.<eos> -Now, fräulein... .<eos> -Maria.<eos> I don't know how much the abbess told you.
How did you climb up?<eos> It's how we always got in to play tricks on the governess.<eos> Louisa can make it with a whole jar of spiders in her hand.<eos> Spiders?<eos> Were you out walking all by yourself?<eos> If we wash that dress tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow.<eos> You could put this on.<eos> Take your dress and put it to soak in the bathtub.<eos> Come back here and sit on the bed, and we'll have a talk.<eos> I told you today I didn't need a governess.
These are a few of my favorite things<eos> Together.<eos> Girls in white dresses With blue satin sashes<eos> Snowflakes that stay On my nose and eyelashes<eos> Silver white winters That melt into springs<eos> These are a few of my favorite things<eos> When the dog bi--<eos> Dog bites.<eos> Hello.<eos> Fräulein, did I not tell you that bedtime is to be strictly observed?
Then introduce you to other members of The Link, who might find you a job.<eos> Officially, we're allowed to offer you £5 out of society's funds, to tide you over the first few days.<eos> And, unofficially, we're allowed to offer you lunch.<eos> More retsina?<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> I've nothing to be clear-headed for.<eos> Oh, but you will have, if only you'll stop being obstinate and let me introduce you to this great friend of mine, Dick Carlton.<eos> Yeah, all right, all right.<eos> But I keep on telling you I can't write, except business reports.<eos> I keep on telling you, you don't have to write.
- I don't know what you mean.<eos> - You followed me from prison when I was released with some cock-and-bull story about prisoners' aid.<eos> You bought me an expensive meal and gave me a fiver for services which I didn't render.<eos> - I was only trying...<eos> - I know what you were trying and don't bloody well interrupt.<eos> Just wait until I finish.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> You're used to waiting, aren't you?<eos> On street corners.<eos> Now look here, Leamas, ever since I've tried to help you, you've done nothing but insult me.
The Copenhagen letter.<eos> The Helsinki one's easier.<eos> I wrote it in my own handwriting.<eos> Now what?<eos> Within a week we should at least know the dates when Rolling Stone was last in Copenhagen and Helsinki to draw the money.<eos> Is Mundt back?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Until we hear from the banks, there's nothing more we can do.<eos> We shall be constantly in one another's company.<eos> If that's distasteful to you, I apologise.
What is your name, child?<eos> What is your name?<eos> Nancy Perry.<eos> You are a member of the British Communist Party?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> If he moves again, take him out.<eos> He can speak later, if he wishes.<eos> Nancy, have you been told in the Party of the need for discipline?<eos> Today, the reason for this tribunal will be a secret from you.
I don't know.<eos> - Hello, Miss Rawnsley. - Hello.<eos> Rawnsley, Mays.<eos> Just popped in for an entrance form... for that little junket of yours to Gay Paree.<eos> If you are referring to an official entry form... for my London to Paris air race, my office will send you one.<eos> Well, considering the fact that I'm one of England's foremost aeroplanists... it's rather jolly inefficient of them not to send me one before.<eos> I say, excuse me, if you'll hold your mallet like this... you'll play that shot much better.<eos> I shall hold my mallet as I've always held my mallet.<eos> In that case, you'll miss the shot.<eos> What did I tell you?
She's at it again...<eos> Disobeying my instructions.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> It's the American.<eos> The American? What's he doing prowling around in my garden?<eos> - You suppose he has a gun?<eos> - Why should he, sir?<eos> Well, the fellow's from the Wild West, isn't he?<eos> - It's only a motorbicycle, sir. - Oh.<eos> He's trying to get back into the race, just as I've been telling you for some time.
And my treasure, my love, my dear?<eos> - Went up in flames.<eos> - No, it didn't.<eos> Just disappeared.<eos> If you saw that it was in the stove...<eos> He was not in the stove.<eos> - How can I get out of here?<eos> - Is there any problem?<eos> I have no motor-bike, no luggages and if they discover Grisha...<eos> I have just told you that he left.
May I remind you that, under the emergency regulations, with four rooms and a kitchen you can be forced to take eight people.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> Should Britain ever thus attempt the evacuation of nearly 20 per cent of her entire population, such scenes as these would be almost inevitable.<eos> All citizens resident within this area are requested to proceed immediately to the municipal offices to collect emergency identification papers and ration cards.<eos> Name?<eos> Sue Wilkinson, 159 Thornton Avenue.<eos> Er, widow...<eos> children aged 19 and 21.<eos> Non-supplementary ration card.<eos> This entitles you to a basic ration per week of two ounces of butter, a half a pound of margarine, two ounces of tea, a quarter-pound of sugar, two eggs, a half a pint of milk when available,
This is my business!<eos> I'll tell on you!<eos> Mother Rosaria!<eos> The savings book, eh?<eos> Beautiful poetry, yes.<eos> But she'll have to return here.<eos> -Mother, I have insisted...<eos> -Have a seat, Mother.<eos> The suitcase and the savings book, now!<eos> One moment, I'll explain everything to you calmly.
-Allow me to persuade.<eos> Kind lady, see here.<eos> Let's start by sitting here.<eos> -Get some chairs, now.<eos> -Immediately, commander!<eos> Sit here.<eos> Sit, kind lady, please.<eos> Have a seat, commander.<eos> Is it all right?<eos> Ma'am, I immediately tell you that the striptease is not a thing...
- And what if it were true?<eos> - I'm still not with you, sir.<eos> If an attack was not in progress, your orders to the entire wing...<eos> I would say, sir, that something was dreadfully wrong somewhere.<eos> Take it easy...<eos> Make me a drink of grain alcohol and rainwater, and help yourself.<eos> Gen. Ripper, as an officer in Her Majesty's Air Force, it is my duty to issue the recall code on my own authority, and bring back the wing.<eos> I must ask you for the key and the recall code.<eos> Do you have them handy?<eos> I told you to take it easy.
After all, screw it all.<eos> Know what "screw" means?<eos> - No, what?<eos> - Then don't say it.<eos> Is this your Simca?<eos> Someday I'll buy a 2 4-cylinder Ferrari and race it at Indianapolis.<eos> Then you'll see.<eos> You sure the money's at the villa?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's with you?
Like the hero of a legendary romance, he suddenly had a dark foreboding.<eos> Despite Odile's pleadings, he did a U-turn and the car obediently retraced its route.<eos> Hey, asshole!<eos> Arthur's dying thought was of Odile's face.<eos> As a dark fog descended on him, he saw that fabled bird of Indian legend, which is born without feet, and thus can never alight.<eos> It sleeps in the high winds, and is only visible when it dies.<eos> When its transparent wings, longer than an eagle's, fold in, it fits in the palm of your hand.<eos> - You want to get us killed?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> What's got into you?
It is a hard thing to order men to their death, is it not?<eos> It is.<eos> Sir, there's someone trying to persuade him it's a trick.<eos> They want him to strike back at once.<eos> Soviet airspace has still not been violated, Mr. President.<eos> But if it is, we will be forced to shoot down your bombers.<eos> And then we will come to full alert with all our missiles and planes.<eos> I understand that.<eos> I hope you're able to shoot down our bombers.<eos> But I urge you not to take any steps that cannot be recalled.
Let's go, fast!<eos> Step on the gas.<eos> Agnes!<eos> How come you are here?<eos> They kidnapped me, and Adrien , my fiance, saved me.<eos> He has a leave.<eos> -Keep your eyes on the road!<eos> -Thank you very much, sir.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> -What have they done to you?
Is that the whole reason?<eos> I wish it were.<eos> But the truth is part of me wants to come with you.<eos> And you know that.<eos> I warn you.<eos> It won't keep me alive very long.<eos> You said you never lie, so I've believed everything you told me.<eos> You said you'd kill Matt.<eos> You said you aren't human.<eos> I told you I'd been told that all my life.
Must you talk like that?<eos> You are an officer, aren't you?<eos> Let me present myself.<eos> A teacher, trained, in uniform.<eos> Three years in trenches, two in camps.<eos> What regrets could I have?<eos> Still it's thoughtless of you.<eos> What about you?<eos> Why did you come?<eos> I was afraid something might happen to you.
Oh, I don't mean pay.<eos> Salary isn't the most important thing with me, but more interesting work, Mr. Ward.<eos> Something that will keep me busy, occupied.<eos> Well, I don't care how much work I'm given or what hours I work.<eos> Uh, but, Mrs. Taylor, why did you leave Pittsburgh?<eos> Well, after my husband died, I just...<eos> Now, Mrs. Taylor, this is a post of some confidence.<eos> Oh, please, let me have a chance to prove myself, Mr. Ward.<eos> Uh, very well, Mrs. Taylor. I suppose you might as well report to work on Monday.<eos> Our Miss Clabon in the outer office will brief you.
Hello, Mr. Sam. How's the curmudgeon business?<eos> Oh, Miss Mainwaring!<eos> Is Mark in there?<eos> I'm looking for a free lunch and somebody to cash a check for me.<eos> I thought I'd stick Mark for the lunch and you for the cash.<eos> Go right on in.<eos> You have your social security card, Mrs. Taylor?<eos> Yes, of course. It's right here in my purse.<eos> Who's the dish?<eos> Miss Clabon will show you around.
is it fairity to take advantage of a man like that?<eos> The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.<eos> Where do I come in?<eos> How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me!<eos> You sent her here on purpose!<eos> Don't take a man up like that, Governor.<eos> The police shall take you up.<eos> This is a plan a plot to extort money by threats.<eos> I shall telephone the police.<eos> Have I asked you for a brass farthing'?
Speaking.<eos> Anything I can do for you?<eos> Who?<eos> Shannon.<eos> You're wanted on the blower.<eos> El Paso.<eos> Person-to-person.<eos> This is the moment you've awaited, Miss Fellowes.<eos> That will be my esteemed, but not by me, employer.<eos> I will now demonstrate to you how a man of integrity brings an almost... ..insoluble situation to a triumphant conclusion.
- Let me out of here!<eos> - You lie doggone now.<eos> Quiet down.<eos> You know and I know that half this show you're putting on... ..is playacting.<eos> Only trouble is, sharks don't know that.<eos> - Let me loose.<eos> - Honey, you scared me... ..out of seven years' growth tonight, you ain't gonna do it again.<eos> Mrs Faulk?<eos> I wonder if you'd mind making a pot of this tea?<eos> Miss Jelkes, does this strike you as the right time for a tea party?
- And that experience, you call that a...?<eos> - A love experience?<eos> Yes, I do, Mr Shannon.<eos> That sad little, dirty little episode, you call it a...<eos> Sad, it certainly was for the poor little man.<eos> But why do you call it dirty?<eos> You mean you weren't disgusted by it?<eos> Nothing human disgusts me, Mr Shannon.<eos> Unless it's unkind or violent.<eos> And I told you how... How gentle he was.
- It doesn't make any difference.<eos> No, I'll take it now if it's that important.<eos> Is that my chart, Ralph?<eos> Aren't you writing an awful lot for just indigestion?<eos> The more I write, the more money I charge.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh yes, he is, Doctor.<eos> I appreciate how busy you've been.<eos> That's why I didn't press you on it.
Uh, perhaps I could drop you somewhere.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> By the way, Sir Frederick... as long as I'm here, I wonder if you might help me out... with a legal point that's been troubling me?<eos> It's just a small thing.<eos> Well, I should be delighted to clear it up for you.<eos> I want to know if there is a legal method to recover my file from my doctor?<eos> Under what circumstances?<eos> Actually, from my doctor's estate.<eos> He was an analyst.<eos> Surely your solicitor must have advised you... that it's next to impossible.
Tell them I've already gone out!<eos> It's your husband.<eos> What does he want?<eos> He says he's waking you as he promised,<eos> He wants to know if you're meeting him for lunch.<eos> He says it'll be difficult, he only has half an hour.<eos> Right, tell him I'll come and fetch him tonight and send him a kiss from me.<eos> Madame, what does "equilateral" mean?<eos> Raymonde, how many times have I told you not to touch my papers and things?<eos> And how many times have I told you to call me Madame Celine, not by my name?
- I'm going to be late!<eos> - Can you tell us something about that? How's it going?<eos> - It's going badly!<eos> Just this morning I had a problem with my machine, it was a mess...<eos> The wheel got twisted, broke free of its chain and now some idiot is asking me about it!<eos> What a morning!<eos> Go get yourself a job!<eos> Prophetic words.<eos> 7 days later I'd become a cog in that perfect machine that changed my destiny when I was still in Guastalla.<eos> This is Mr. Luciano Bianchi, the one I told you about earlier.
I told you, i don't want you to tutor my son.<eos> I don't want him to have anything more to do with you.<eos> So you've come here to tell them what you've discovered about me.<eos> Just keep away from my boy.<eos> Just keep away, that's all.<eos> Stay away!<eos> This office will not open till tomorrow morning.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> In your case, it would have been better never than late.<eos> I don't think they would have believed you anyway, mr. Turner.
Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?<eos> - Lois.<eos> - Alice, isn't it?<eos> No, it's Lois.<eos> It's Alice.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Well, I'm not positive, if that's what you mean.<eos> I need her exact name, you see.<eos> Oh, just hold on one more minute, please.<eos> In that case, I'll tell you what you do.
Go right around. It'll take you back to the main road.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you have a boat for Miss Daniels?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> It's the one right below.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Yes, I think so.<eos> What do you suppose made it do that?<eos> That's the damnedest thing I ever saw.<eos> I don't know. It seemed to swoop down at you deliberately.
Well, what did it say?<eos> It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner.<eos> "I think you need these lovebirds after all.<eos> "They may help your personality."<eos> - That's what it said.<eos> - But you tore it up?<eos> - Yes. - Why?<eos> Because it seemed stupid and foolish.<eos> Like jumping into a fountain in Rome.<eos> I told you what happened!
- I'm terribly sorry. Mrs. Lampert, would you look at that photograph and tell me if you recognize anyone?<eos> Just a moment. Have a good look.<eos> - It's Charles.<eos> - Very good.<eos> - He looks so young.<eos> When was this taken?<eos> Next, please.<eos> The man who was at the funeral yesterday.<eos> A tall man in a corduroy suit.<eos> - Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Doing work that has its compensations, even if it's a bit hard. "Man is the only animal that has to work,"<eos> said that philosopher, what's-his-name.<eos> Well, I'm one of those animals too.<eos> But you feel things would be better if we were a bit more indulgent.<eos> Gentlemen, shall we rescind the fines on these rascals?<eos> - If you think so.<eos> - Let's rescind them.<eos> As for our whistle-blower, we abolish his suspension and end the whole matter.<eos> Satisfied?<eos> Sir, allow me to speak to you man-to-man.
I have no home, no family, no friends.<eos> No one's interested in me except the police.<eos> Then why are you doing this? Why?<eos> Because I'm full of foolish ideas.<eos> Fagiolini, my regards to your father.<eos> No, Pierino, not you.<eos> This is from grades 1, 2 and 3.<eos> Miss Spirinbergo refused, of course. Thank you.<eos> - Good morning, sir.<eos> I spoke to you yesterday about a complaint from the school board, and I was very civil, you must admit.
I've been on the go since breakfast.<eos> Of course not.<eos> We'll go to the restaurant car.<eos> Go with Nash to the restaurant car.<eos> I'll join you there in a few minutes.<eos> Whatever you say, old man.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> There you are, old man.<eos> I was worried something had happened to you.
That's all right, Eleanor.<eos> - Go on.<eos> What does your mother say?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I must be more tired than I thought.<eos> My mother died two months ago.<eos> You weren't sorry when it happened... were you?<eos> No, she wasn't very happy.<eos> Then I won't say I'm sorry now.<eos> If I'd known, I'd never have asked you to come here.
But let's face it, girls, we didn't get very far from the house.<eos> Then you must've heard that ungodly noise.<eos> No, there wasn't a sound from the house.<eos> At least, nothing audible to us.<eos> - We'd better take precautions.<eos> - Against what?<eos> When Luke and I are decoyed outside... and you two are bottled up inside... wouldn't you say that something, somehow, is trying to separate us?<eos> Good morning, Dr. Markway.<eos> 'Morning, and please call me John.<eos> - This curious life seems to agree with you.
[I told him: I've seen nobody.]<eos> Very old mosque every ancient E<eos> That's quite untrue, of course.<eos> What is?<eos> What he said.<eos> It isn't old at all.<eos> It was rebuilt after the war.<eos> But it's included in all the guides<eos> Oh, the guides, well of course E<eos> What else did he say to you in Turkish?
All this is a product of your imagination E<eos> Look EThe mosque of your dreams elt's crumbling E<eos> And there's the ship of your dreams E a ship that didn't prove seaworthy...<eos> Everything must start all over again.<eos> Let's start again together.<eos> You think you're strong enough?<eos> Don't be so sure of yourself.<eos> Don't trust me too much E<eos> It's nothing EI must have been dreaming E<eos> Was it the barking that frightened you?

How kind of you to say so.<eos> What time does our plane leave for London?<eos> - Eight o'clock. - Oh.<eos> I'd better go home and pack.<eos> Look, I'm afraid I can't take you to my castle in Worcestershire.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I don't have a castle in Worcestershire.<eos> Of course not, it's in Yorkshire.<eos> Quite, but... what I mean to say I haven't been entirely frank with you, my dear Irma.<eos> - For instance, what I told you about unicorns.
Penelope.<eos> "O my brothers, who braved 1 00,000 perils to reach the west, choose not to deny experience of the unpeopled world.<eos> Think of the seed of your creation. You were not born to live as brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge."<eos> Know it?<eos> Sure, it's very famous.<eos> Dante.<eos> "Night then saw all the stars.<eos> We were filled with gladness, which soon turned to tears until the sea closed in upon us."<eos> I'm PaulJaval.<eos> Mr. Prokosch told you...
- Sergeant Walter!<eos> - Sergeant Quinn.<eos> Any more behavior like this, and I'll have your stripes.<eos> Now get out of here and start mingling again.<eos> Quite funny that, the zebra and the stripes.<eos> - Yes, very good, very good.<eos> - Not bad, not bad.<eos> I think I'll mingle.<eos> Right.<eos> Didn't I tell you I'd make this the biggest social success of the year?
Stand up!<eos> In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.<eos> Notice, my siblings, that you are celebrating the marriage sacrament which is necessary for conception of the Human Gender.<eos> And to all of you...<eos> ...if there's no object it's granted to them it was instituted by God in Heaven on Earth and consecrated with the Royal Presence of Christ, our Lord.<eos> It's one of the Seven Sacraments of the Church... ( - Move that way!<eos> That way! That way! )<eos> ...with the big importance and with the virtue and dignity of what's small.<eos> Thank goodness to the ones who take Him with pure minds, with which...<eos> I told you several times that the organ must be tuned.
M rs Scot<eos> How would you describe the morale climate of Cypress Hills?<eos> Not good<eos> Did this condition prevail when you and your husband moved here?<eos> It wasn 't until... toward the last that things became almost unbearable.<eos> And would you attribute it to that machine?<eos> I didn 't know it existed until this morning.<eos> - And who told you about it?<eos> - Mr Lomax.<eos> Your husband never mentioned O.B.l.T. to you?
I told you to remain out- what difference does it make?<eos> They won't be in the way.<eos> It's simply that i see no reason why more than 2 of us should be exposed to the dangers of radiation.<eos> I know you're thinking about the welfare of others, doctor, but really, there's no need to worry.<eos> No danger at all.<eos> He's right in there.<eos> You'll have to talk to him through the grill.<eos> Tell me who i am.<eos> Ingrid!<eos> What did i tell you yesterday?
Jules was pale, silent, less self-assured, and more handsome than ever.<eos> Catherine wore her same smile, like a modest young general after his first brilliant campaign.<eos> No one spoke of her plunge.<eos> I've arrived.<eos> Please, Mr. Jim.<eos> No, just Jim.<eos> Just Mm...<eos> I'd like to meet with you to ask your advice.<eos> Would you meet me tomorrow at 7:00 in our cafe'?<eos> Yes. She wants to talk to you.
Of course you know I'm grateful, the way you put the lid on this matter.<eos> I didn't get that impression tonight.<eos> Well, a president has to stand up for a man he sends down to Senate. You know that.<eos> It seems to me, the sooner you withdraw him, the sooner this will blow over.<eos> I still want him, Brigham.<eos> If we open this up, he won't be confirmed.<eos> I'm sure Senator Munson told you that.<eos> If we don't open it up, we've got enough votes committed to put him through.<eos> I've gone as far as I can with this, Mr. Rresident.<eos> I think the circumstances might permit you to go a little further.
He did extensive research, but death by hanging is cruel.<eos> It's not pretty.<eos> I'd like to sleep forever.<eos> But I've lived another day.<eos> And you complain about me getting drunk.<eos> Is it because I survived?<eos> Or is this the end?<eos> ShÃ"saku, that's enough!<eos> Please go away.<eos> The doctor forbid you to take hot baths.
I didn't hear him, Mrs. Thomas. I saw him.<eos> Now, don't talk that way.<eos> I don't sleep so good as it is.<eos> It's these old houses. They...<eos> They're big enough so that you could hide a man in every corner.<eos> You just gotta not let your imagination run away with you.<eos> - Are you going out there?<eos> - Well, of course.<eos> There's nobody there.<eos> Now you just go and eat that sandwich I made for you.
Please don't cry like that.<eos> What will my waiting customers think?<eos> I'm not a bird of bad omen.<eos> Understand.<eos> The cards spelled death, and saw cancer.<eos> She is doomed.<eos> "Wait, pretty butterfly.<eos> Ugliness is a kind of death.<eos> As long as I'm beautiful, I'm even more alive than the others. "<eos> Did Madame Irma rid you of your fear?
You're a nice man.<eos> Want that one. Fur?<eos> In summer?<eos> - Yes, ladies?<eos> - I'd like a hat.<eos> Can try some?<eos> Certainly, madam.<eos> What kind do you like?<eos> That one, this one...<eos> This one's very smart on you.
You're not cold?<eos> It's not very warm.<eos> - I'm all right.<eos> It's the first day of summer.<eos> For me, summer is when I'm on vacation.<eos> Today it's official.<eos> It's Flora, it's you.<eos> - What talk!<eos> - like talking.<eos> Doesn't it interest you to know that today's the longest day of the year?
No one will come in without your permission. How do I know that?<eos> That's one of our rules.<eos> Things look in pretty good shape here.<eos> Could we talk for awhile?<eos> Dr. Swinford, I submitted to extensive testing and other nonsense for two full days last week.<eos> I'm here, I'll go along with the routine, with the indignities.<eos> But frankly, I don't care for any more interviewing.<eos> It's just talking things over so that perhaps I can help you.<eos> After all, that's what we're both here for, David. All right.<eos> Then let's say if I feel like talking to you, I'II talk to you.
There's nothing further here for a warrior.<eos> We drive bargains.<eos> Old men's work.<eos> Young men make wars, and the virtues of war are the virtues of young men.<eos> Courage and hope for the future.<eos> Then old men make the peace.<eos> And the vices of peace are the vices of old men.<eos> Mistrust and caution.<eos> It must be so.<eos> What I owe you is beyond evaluation.
Do you recall a girl called Dolores Haze?<eos> I remember one guy didn't have a hand. He had a bat instead of a hand.<eos> He was really sort of wacky.<eos> Lolita!<eos> Lolita...<eos> Yeah, yeah, I remember that name all right.<eos> Maybe she made some telephone calls, who cares?<eos> Hey, you're a sort of bad loser, Captain.<eos> I never found a guy who'd sort of pull a gun on me when he lost a game.<eos> Didn't anyone ever tell you it's not really who wins, it's how you play, like the champs.
Listen, I don't think I want to play anymore.<eos> I wanna get a drink.<eos> I'm just dying for a drink.<eos> I'm just dying to have a drinkie.<eos> You're dying anyway, Quilty.<eos> All my friends always put their smokies out in the drink.<eos> It's so unsanitary.<eos> Quilty, I want you to concentrate.<eos> You're going to die.<eos> Try to understand what is happening to you.
You're dying anyway, Quilty.<eos> All my friends always put their smokies out in the drink.<eos> It's so unsanitary.<eos> Quilty, I want you to concentrate.<eos> You're going to die.<eos> Try to understand what is happening to you.<eos> You are either Australian or a German refugee.<eos> This is a gentile's house.<eos> You'd better run along.<eos> Think of what you did, Quilty, and think of what is happening to you now.
What's more, Mona disappeared from that party last night and she did not come home till 4:00 a. m.<eos> So Jean and I decided that isolation from boys would be the best thing for both of the girls this crucial summer.<eos> Do you think that the camp is the answer?<eos> Frankly, Hum, I do.<eos> It's all arranged.<eos> The Farlows and I phoned the camp long-distance and I did all the shopping this...<eos> Is something the matter with your face?<eos> Toothache.<eos> You poor man.<eos> If it still pains you tomorrow, I'll call and arrange an appointment.
Long live France!<eos> There he goes, right on time...as usual.<eos> They're landing!<eos> They're coming!<eos> They're coming!<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> Look, they're landing!<eos> The Americans, the English and the French!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> What's the matter with you?
You mean you can't read at all?<eos> No, I can't read, and I can't write.<eos> Here, take your book.<eos> For heaven's sakes, isn't Mr Peabody's order ready?<eos> - Hallie...<eos> - Not enough beans on it.<eos> Hallie, I'm sorry.<eos> I could teach you.<eos> What for?<eos> What good has reading and writing done you?
I guess your friends call you Jennie?<eos> Not yet, they haven't, for which I am deeply grateful.<eos> But you may call me Jennie.<eos> What do your friends call you?<eos> Rosie.<eos> Why?<eos> My full name is Eugenie Rose.<eos> Of the two names, I've always favored Rosie because it smells of brown soap and beer.<eos> Eugenie is somehow more fragile.<eos> Still, when I asked you what your name was, you said it was Eugenie.
Can you remember that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you stationed in New York?<eos> Or is "stationed" the right word?<eos> I'm not exactly stationed in New York.<eos> I was stationed in Washington. But I got sick and now I'm on leave and I'm gonna s-spend it in New York.<eos> Eldorado 5-9970.<eos> I'm gonna look up an old friend of mine who's a newspaper man.<eos> We were in Korea together.<eos> Mr. Shaw, there's a gentleman outside to see you.
The staff of the Kanburg Hotel, thanks to this picture... has been able to identify the mysterious Mr. Bender.<eos> I refuse to answer in front of an outsider.<eos> Mr. Steiner has my authorization.<eos> Yes, I was at the Kanburg last night.<eos> Why did you use a false name?<eos> - For personal reasons.<eos> - What kind of personal reasons?<eos> - I can't tell you.<eos> - Why?<eos> I told you. For personal reasons.
Are you sure?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> What did you do then?<eos> I took a room.<eos> And then?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I went to bed, I tried to read, and I fell asleep.<eos> What time was that?<eos> I wasn't expecting you to ask me. I didn't look at the time.<eos> You should leave your attitude outside. It won't help you here.
Sooner or later, take my word for it, he'll say, "Oh, no, no, she could never fool me,"<eos> "All right,<eos> "we'll make that the deciding condition,"<eos> After he agrees, we'll show him we fooled him already,<eos> He'll stick to his bargain, I know it, I guarantee it,<eos> Sam, are producers born that way, or do they teach you those things when you join the studio?<eos> Well, like the man said, who was asked if he was a communist,<eos> "We're not allowed to tell,"<eos> Well, the local gals don't come blue-eyed, so I'll need some contact lenses,<eos> It's all right, We'll send to America to have a man come down here and fit you,
- That's good.<eos> Certainly is convenient, isn't it, living in the same house?<eos> I mean, it saves cab fare and all that.<eos> Well, here you are, delivered safely.<eos> You're dropping me at my door?<eos> Well, how are you going to get home?<eos> - Well, I'll feel my way.<eos> - No, no. No.<eos> Carlye, I couldn't possibly let you go home alone.<eos> Why, if anything were to happen to you, I'd never forgive myself.
Help! I don't intend to help you on this case.<eos> Cooperation, Gridley.<eos> You're a guest of the United Kingdom.<eos> That's true, but I'm not a police spy.<eos> Now, now, now, Mr. Gridley, let me put it this way.<eos> Assuming Mrs. Hardwicke was not guilty, there would be no problem, provided we knew all the facts.<eos> Therefore, every shred of evidence I can gather is important to her.<eos> Even something that seems damning fitted into the overall picture might be just the clue to prove her innocence.<eos> I see.<eos> You want me to snoop around and report everything that I find to you, huh?
And I expect you to do the same.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Right away, sir.<eos> - I beg your pardon.<eos> - Whatever for?<eos> Yes.<eos> - There you are, sir.<eos> - Gridley.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> When I instructed you to keep your presence in Mrs. Hardwicke's house absolutely secret, did you feel that you could best carry out that order by trying to set fire to London, coming within inches of being arrested and having the whole story appear in the papers?
Yes, I'm sure.<eos> It strikes me that perhaps I have been a bit derelict, and I suddenly find myself most eager to personally explore this entire unfortunate situation with you.<eos> Now if I may suggest, there's a quiet little restaurant around the corner,<eos> I thought perhaps we might just slip over there, have a bite of lunch, and talk about the whole thing.<eos> You're not afraid of being seen in public with me?<eos> On the contrary, it'll be a relief to get away from these constant interruptions.<eos> Then you're not going to send him away?<eos> The thought never entered my mind.<eos> You have hazel eyes, as guileless and innocent as a child's.<eos> It's easy to understand why he's so devoted to you.
In the past you just took the money, and it was, "See ya later!"<eos> You've got your troubles, I've got mine.<eos> Give me some credit.<eos> Don't make me sell everything!<eos> You can't speculate with my hide! If the market drops, I pay.<eos> If it goes up, you win - is that it?<eos> I know it's not fair, but what am I to do?<eos> It's 10:00 and I'm still explaining this to you. When you first came to me, you only had 500,000 lire.<eos> Remember?<eos> Sure, I remember. In two years I earned you seven or eight million. Then I told you to stop, but you were too greedy.
Thank you, monsieur.<eos> You are most kind.<eos> Tonight I wish to speak to you of something very personal.<eos> I think you will agree that before this night is over all your dreams will come true.<eos> Oh, Madame Rubens-Chatte, isn't it wonderful?<eos> I do thank you for making it all possible.<eos> Come, my dear.<eos> Paris awaits you.<eos> And, dear madame, may I say everything that happens is because of your faith in me?<eos> I'll be back soon and tell you about it.
It's been a long, hard night.<eos> Yes it has been.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> I was talking about myself.<eos> That's what they all do.<eos> What else do they ever talk about?<eos> So give me a rest, will you.<eos> Alright.<eos> Alright what?<eos> Well I'll do whatever you say but... if you don't want me to talk to you and you won't come in...
You mean your legal alternatives.<eos> I told you ostensible acquittal, or indefinite deferment.<eos> What's wrong, joy, not feeling well?<eos> No... must... must be the heat.<eos> If I open that door we have those girls in here all over.<eos> Then don't do that.<eos> Well now with ostensible acquittal I write out an affidavit of your innocence.<eos> And make the rounds off all the judges I know personally, beginning with the one I'm painting now.<eos> I explain to him that you're innocent and myself guarantee that in...<eos> And if he believes you?
- At what time?<eos> - Morning. I don't know what time.<eos> - What were you doing?<eos> - I was asleep.<eos> The voice woke me.<eos> - Was it in your room?<eos> - It was in the chateau.<eos> Did you thank the voice and kneel before it?<eos> I sat on my bed and joined my hands.<eos> What did the voice tell you?
What a din.<eos> Two assessors, a substitute, the clerk and the inquisitor.<eos> And the others?<eos> I don't need them.<eos> But they must not leave the city.<eos> You have no jurisdiction.<eos> Did you know you'd be caught?<eos> My voices said it was necessary, but they didn't say when.<eos> If I'd known, I wouldn't have gone.<eos> Ifyour voices had ordered you to go where you'd be caught, would you have gone?
But he's a good pal of mine. I don't think that's right.<eos> I'd be ashamed.<eos> You never mentioned Nadine.<eos> I didn't need to, you knew.<eos> I thought you were a pal.<eos> But does she truly like you?<eos> After what she told me I don't think so.<eos> -What'd she say?<eos> -A lot.<eos> I don't need to tell you.
S'cuse me...<eos> S'cuse me...<eos> S'cuse me.<eos> Those are all the defendants's bags. What about ours?<eos> Come on!<eos> Wait, I'll take off the handcuffs.<eos> The hotel is deserted. There's only a young newlywed couple.<eos> Enrico, come see!<eos> It's that famous lady. From the court.<eos> I reserved for you the quietest suite. It was Sir Winston Churchill's favourite.
Be nice.<eos> I really do have a secret.<eos> I love my wife and I'll lose her if she continues to believe that I was with another woman that night.<eos> But it's the truth.<eos> -Yes, but it was just an meaningless fling.<eos> If you could just talk to her and convince her that I was alone.<eos> Me?<eos> -Yes, you could come up with something...<eos> One small lie, it wouldn't be difficult.<eos> My wife will believe you, I'm sure.
No.<eos> No.<eos> Now it's you that makes me cry.<eos> Because... you're so appealing in a cruel sort of way.<eos> This play acting is useless. I know you had the gun on the motorboat. Now it's time for you to confess.<eos> Why are you so stubborn?<eos> Alright then.<eos> But first let's drink up.<eos> It'll loosen my tongue.<eos> Did the Public Prosecutor tell you why he went to dinner with the accused?
His name is Richardson, He's a Major, and his number is 64-21-23.<eos> A great combo!<eos> We'll play the lottery.<eos> How's your hand? - Not bad, thanks, Major.<eos> I'm sorry, we're short on medication.<eos> Oh, it's not serious!<eos> And will have appropriate care when we get to Eguadaba.<eos> But how do you know that we go there?<eos> - Well, in truth... Our information service is the best in the world.<eos> As long as you're held captive, the information will not help you much. Captain!
- Comatose, sir!<eos> No food, no ammunition, and completely demoralized.<eos> - Very good.<eos> So, nothing to worry about. Let's see.<eos> Where... where you left them?<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Around here. Journeying toward fort Eguadaba.<eos> Eguadaba...<eos> - Yes, sir. - Hold on.<eos> Means nothing to you, Sandy?
[He didn't worry about Don Camillo.]<eos> [He knew that he'd be leaving on the 11:23 express.]<eos> A civic wedding?<eos> The first one ever celebrated in my Parish!<eos> Lord, I shall reduce him to pulp!<eos> Hello? Is that Rome?<eos> It is, my son.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Reassure the cardinal that I'm on the point of returning.<eos> Tomorrow I'll phone telling you when I'm arriving.
He thinks I care about the money.<eos> Do you care about me, Eddie?<eos> We were together a long time, night and day.<eos> So how do you say goodbye?<eos> You give me the car and $100.<eos> Do you think I care about the dough or the car?<eos> This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw.<eos> A high-class con man.<eos> He can charm anybody into anything.<eos> Did he tell you how well we did on the road?
Some day, you'll make some lucky woman a fine husband.<eos> That's kind of you.<eos> I'm afraid I could never get married.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Wait!<eos> Why can't you get married?<eos> It's the sort of thing a man doesn't discuss with a woman.<eos> Oh, Linus.<eos> What is it?<eos> Carol, I'm going to say something that'll shock you.
Yeah.<eos> - Jimmy, isn't it? - Yes, sir. And now you're a minisub man.<eos> How do you like the new model?<eos> She handles like a dream, sir.<eos> I can't wait to test her under the ice.<eos> - You will. Good luck, my boy.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Sorry to break in on your social life.<eos> Back to work.<eos> This should interest you, Doctor.
You're driving my crew to the point of exhaustion possibly even rebellion.<eos> These are men, not machines.<eos> If they break down or blow up, we'll never meet your deadline.<eos> We'll meet it because we have to meet it.<eos> I'm not worried that your men can't take it. They can.<eos> But I am concerned about your alternative: Rebellion.<eos> I found this note in my cabin just a few minutes ago.<eos> "If you continue your lunatic project, you'll never live to see it completed."<eos> Hodges will never see it completed.<eos> And he won't bother you anymore.
- And it's not supported by the leading theoretical authorities.<eos> Please.<eos> I'd leave the bottle out because I could hurt myself... .. and leave traces of blood.<eos> You haven't got a lot of imagination.<eos> - I haven't, have I?<eos> - Or you don't hate me enough yet.<eos> No, I do hate you, only thing is I've never murdered anyone.<eos> Then, I'll see how I can help you!<eos> You'd do me favour!<eos> The "Murder Anonymous" models I'll show you have arrived... .. the day before yesterday from America. - Alright.
The evening is approaching.<eos> Two nights and one day until launch.<eos> We must sign off.<eos> We won't be able to see or interview Cosmokrator's passengers for a while.<eos> For 50 hours they will be in a deep, artificially-induced sleep which will help them adjust to this difficult journey into space.<eos> Signing off, Goodbye,<eos> Brinkmann, in two minutes you will sleep, whether you like it or not.<eos> You can see and hear your heartbeat.<eos> I'm glad you're coming with us, Sumiko.<eos> Now I'll always be near you.
What then?<eos> When I heard you were coming I was very happy.<eos> Now I wish you weren't here.<eos> Why, Brinkmann?<eos> I'm a scientist and researcher just the same as you.<eos> You're also a woman.<eos> I brought Ogimura back from the lunar mountains, dead.<eos> I'm worried I'll have to bring you back from somewhere, too.<eos> Your role is to preserve life, to bring a child into the world.<eos> I never told you how I got to know Ogimura.
- Lousy! What's your greatest ambition?<eos> To become immortal and then die.<eos> You're Claudius Mansard?<eos> Yes, Mr. Kovacs.<eos> I called this morning.<eos> I was told you'd be here.<eos> Yes, Mr Kovacs.<eos> Tony sent me.<eos> Didn't we meet in Nice?<eos> Nobody phoned you?
About the apartment. Now that you've got a raise, can't we afford a second key?<eos> - I guess so.<eos> - You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Is she the lucky girl that?<eos> - Oh, no, no.<eos> I just meant that she's kind of a busybody, and passing that key back and forth...<eos> - Why take chances?<eos> - You can't be too careful.<eos> Oh, I... have something I think belongs to you.
For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!<eos> But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> My sister, to tell her what happened to me.<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> Let's talk it over first.<eos> Just what are you gonna tell her?<eos> - I haven't figured it out exactly.<eos> - Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.<eos> Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night.
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.<eos> Spades are double... 154.<eos> Blitzed. Two games.<eos> All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.<eos> - Hi, Baxter.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> What do I want?<eos> Just a minute.<eos> - You can't come in!<eos> - What's the matter with you?
- I dig.<eos> So what's it going to be?<eos> - Now you're being bright.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> But this is the key to the executive washroom.<eos> That's right.<eos> I won't be needing it because I'm all washed up around here.<eos> - What's gotten into you?
Perfect, I want you to!<eos> Have you made an order already? No.<eos> I just want to know the price.<eos> You can't beat his prices.<eos> Madam is calling you.<eos> Just a moment!<eos> Are you going fishing?<eos> No, I told you already!<eos> It's my poor legs.<eos> All this was for you...
Don Anselmo, you should not behave like that.<eos> I can explain!<eos> I had another buyer...<eos> It's my brother's fault.<eos> Let's be clear.<eos> This vehicle... is it for your brother or not?<eos> It's for me.<eos> For you?<eos> Congratulations!<eos> - What's wrong with you?
It's for a sick person.<eos> Give me 5000 pesetas. I beg you.<eos> German gold is worthless.<eos> But I feel sorry for you.<eos> It's a lot of money, be discreet!<eos> It really is a lot of money.<eos> I'm doing this as a favour to you.<eos> Absolutely no word about this to anyone!<eos> I keep the box.<eos> You said it didn't interst you.
Of course!<eos> Fortune favours the bold.<eos> - Who wants chocolates?<eos> - Me.<eos> God, look how much it's raining!<eos> Oh, Doctor!<eos> You seem changed since the last time I saw you.<eos> You, on the other hand, are exactly the same.<eos> A coffee, please.<eos> Perhaps it's just me, but you seem to have such an unhappy, depressed look about you almost as if something had happened to you, some kind of great suffering.
Do you hold a degree from any recognised theological seminary?<eos> - Does Gantry?<eos> - No.<eos> Are you sanctioned to preach by any church?<eos> No, Mr Lefferts, but... neither was Peter or Paul or any of the other apostles.<eos> Ah, but they said that they lived with the Son of God, were taught by him, were sanctified by him.<eos> What gives you the right to speak for God?<eos> I couldn't possibly be doing God's work without his approval.<eos> How did you get his approval?<eos> Did God speak to you personally?
- Yes, mostly.<eos> Mostly?<eos> - A supporting company.<eos> May I write that?<eos> I wish you wouldn't. It's not definite.<eos> It would really do well for your publicity.<eos> I would prefer that you didn't write it.<eos> Will you let me know when it's definite?<eos> If an announcement is made, I can't say that it will be released to the general public.<eos> It was a pleasure to meet you. Thank you.
Baby, that's a very attractive man.<eos> Isn't he, Angie?<eos> You look like you didn't sleep so good last night.<eos> I slept fine, thank you.<eos> Mabry, we're in the middle of a lot of trouble out here.<eos> You know, snow and Indians, a lot of trouble.<eos> Don't make any more.<eos> - I'm here to help you, Healy.<eos> - We're very grateful.<eos> But if I'm too much trouble for you, all you gotta do is say "git." I'll go.
- Try them all.<eos> - I'll do my best.<eos> Thattagirl.<eos> Get me some numbers that answer.<eos> Mr. Santos, Sheriff Wimmer.<eos> Nice of you to drop by so soon, sheriff.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I guess you understand my position, Mr. Santos.<eos> We're grateful for your work. But don't cut out on your own.<eos> Whatever I get goes straight to you.
I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.<eos> What do you know about caring?<eos> Have you ever seen the inside of one of those places?<eos> The laughing and the tears and the cruel eyes studying you.<eos> My mother there?<eos> But she's harmless.<eos> She's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I only felt...<eos> It seems she's hurting you.
-But I'm not a fool.<eos> -Well, I...<eos> And I'm not capable of being fooled, not even by a woman.<eos> -Well, this is not a slur on your manhood.<eos> -Let's put it this way.<eos> She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.<eos> Well, then your mother met her.<eos> Could I talk to your mother?<eos> No.<eos> As I told you, she's confined.
She's not missing so much as she's run away.<eos> That's right.<eos> -From what?<eos> -She stole some money.<eos> A lot?<eos> $40,000.<eos> And the police haven't been able to...<eos> Everyone concerned thought if they could get her to give the money back, they could avoid involving her with the police.<eos> That explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.<eos> What exactly did he say when he called you?
I don't think he's capable of that.<eos> Then what can I do?<eos> Yoshiko.<eos> If you really want your father to make amends, let me take care of it.<eos> It may seem unbearable to allow me to expose his deeds, but it's the only way he'll ever make up for what he's done.<eos> Yes.<eos> As you say, right now my hands are tied.<eos> Yes, I understand that perfectly.<eos> In the worst case, I will take my own life.<eos> I wouldn't think of dragging you into this.
I feared telling the story of the uniform, so I made sure to describe all my wartime experiences very vividly.<eos> I was afraid that this officer would suspect me of spying for the Nazis.<eos> There was no one who could testify that I just put it on for fun.<eos> What are you babbling about?<eos> I swear I'm telling the truth.<eos> I'd like to be part of this new life, and become a helpful citizen.<eos> I want to work in whichever field the State needs me to work in.<eos> Are you confessing to all the charges?<eos> Which charges?<eos> I already told you that Wasik...
- The women shouldn't know anything in this place.<eos> Mum!<eos> I love you.<eos> Miss...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing, I'm sorry. It's just a moment of melancholy.<eos> Sometimes I get these thoughts, and I just can't stand them.<eos> You're right, until 2 days ago I didn't worry about anything... and now I feel 10 years older.<eos> But you're not alone!<eos> I saw how much your mother loves you.
Yes, go and have fun, you always work so hard!<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Bye, Rodolfito.<eos> What a lovely girl, she's got plenty of friends.<eos> Listen, Rodolfo, when I'm dead, you should marry her.<eos> It's a very lovely girl... she and not that girlfriend of yours.<eos> Don't say such silly things!<eos> Why do you eat so fast?<eos> You'll be sick.<eos> I told you, I gotta go back to work.
We will do as you command.<eos> For the moment.<eos> -No for the moment about it.<eos> You just do as I tell you.<eos> You do not need guns.<eos> -Maybe we think we do.<eos> -They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood, and you two look like you've got a lot of both.<eos> True, they would be effective upon us.<eos> If you were to have the opportunity to use them...<eos> Mister, if you don't get away from that control board I'll show you just how effective they can be.
You see ?<eos> You see ?<eos> Your stupid minds...stupid !<eos> Stupid !<eos> -That's all I'm taking from you !<eos> -Get back here you jerk !<eos> Let him finish.<eos> It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.<eos> Headstrong, violent !<eos> No use of the mind God gave you.
That's just like your husband's, isn't it?<eos> He gave me this because I liked the one he had. He's like that.<eos> He gives me presents all the time.<eos> You have a happy marriage?<eos> Yes.<eos> What went wrong with the first marriage?<eos> What went wrong is when I went for Manny.<eos> - That's honest enough.<eos> - It was more than just that.<eos> Like I told you, I grew up on the move, and Jack, my first husband didn't like to move.
I must've tried to get out of the car and dropped them.<eos> You might be interested to know that your lie-detector test turned out in your favour.<eos> Of course it did. I could've told you it would.<eos> You weren't worried about it?<eos> No, why should I be?<eos> Would you like to have something to worry about?<eos> Silly.<eos> Like your husband watching us from his cell window?<eos> All right, let's have it.<eos> Did he say something to you?
Pauly? That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer.<eos> - Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.<eos> - You're not splitting the scene, man?<eos> - I mean, you're not cutting out?<eos> - No, I'll be back.<eos> Hi, Pauly.<eos> Fellas, this is Manny's lawyer.<eos> - Sit down, won't you?<eos> - Sorry, I can't right now.<eos> Mrs. Manion, may I talk to you for a moment outside?
- Were you witness to the shooting?<eos> I was.<eos> Will you tell us in your own words, please, what happened?<eos> I was at a table by the door when Lt. Manion came in.<eos> Did you know Lt. Manion by sight and name?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> He came in and walked over to the bar and began to shoot. He shot Barney when he came up to the bar. When Barney fell, he kept on shooting down at Barney behind the bar.<eos> Then he turned and walked out.<eos> When Lt. Manion entered the bar, how did he appear to you?
- You think so.<eos> How long have you worked at the Thunder Bay Inn?<eos> Six or seven years.<eos> Does this window beside the table suddenly vanish and then reappear, and come and go in a ghostly fashion?<eos> It's there all the time.<eos> While you were talking to your friends, did you look out the window?<eos> - I might have.<eos> - When you looked out were you looking for something?<eos> - No, I wasn't looking for anything.<eos> Didn't Barney Quill tell you to go to the window and watch out for Manion?

Manion?
I check people in and out, lock the gate at night.<eos> What is your authority for these duties?<eos> I'm paid by Mastodon township and I'm also a deputy sheriff just courtesy, sort of.<eos> Did you see Lt. Manion on the night of the 15th the night Barney Quill was killed?<eos> Will you tell the court about how and when you saw Lt. Manion?<eos> About 1:00 a.m., a knock on my door waked me up.<eos> I went to the door and Lt. Manion was standing there.<eos> He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon, because I just shot Barney Quill."<eos> I told him to go to his trailer and that I would call the police.<eos> How did Lt. Manion appear to you when he asked you to take him?
We drove the lieutenant down with his wife.<eos> On the drive to Iron City, did the lieutenant talk about the shooting?<eos> He said that if he could do the whole thing again, he'd still do it.<eos> During all this, at the trailer, the drive to Iron City how did Lt. Manion appear?<eos> He was very quiet most of the time.<eos> Seemed clear-headed.<eos> Would you say he was in complete possession of his faculties?<eos> He seemed so to me.<eos> Your witness.<eos> You testified that Lt. Manion told you that he shot Barney Quill after he had learned that his wife had had some trouble with Quill.
His wife came running out of the dark and fell into his arms.<eos> You saw his wife in the trailer.<eos> How'd she look?<eos> She was a little hysterical. She'd been pretty badly beaten up.<eos> She had big, black bruises over her face and arms.<eos> Did Mrs. Manion tell you about this rape and beating?<eos> She did.<eos> Did she take you to where it happened?<eos> Yes, the next morning.<eos> Did you find anything? Any evidence pertaining to the story that Mrs. Manion had told you?
- I thought so.<eos> - Why did you think so?<eos> She'd kind of lean on him and a couple of times she bumped him with her hip.<eos> Would you say that Mrs. Manion was making a play for Barney Quill?<eos> Objection.<eos> That calls for an assumption on the part of the witness.<eos> Would you say that Mrs. Manion was free and easy with Barney Quill?<eos> I would.<eos> Your witness.<eos> The attorney for the People asked you if Mrs. Manion was "tight" and you said she was "high."
Born: Blind River, Ontario, 1934, out of wedlock.<eos> Mother was a waitress.<eos> Simone Platt.<eos> Father was a lumberjack named Barney Quill.<eos> I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.<eos> It's late, mister.<eos> I know. This is important.<eos> - Real important?<eos> - Real important.<eos> Miss Pilant? Sorry if I woke you. There's a guy to see you.
He was the only person I saw.<eos> What was he doing?<eos> I think he was just standing there behind the bar.<eos> Did he make a threatening move to get a gun?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He may have, I don't know.<eos> You say you went there to find him, to hold him for the police?<eos> Why did you shoot him?<eos> I don't remember shooting him.<eos> When you left the bar, do you remember Alphonse Paquette coming up to you saying, "You'd better not run away from this" and your reply, "Do you want some, too, buster?"
Quiet, I leave immediately and tonight I will be up to you.<eos> It's all arranged.<eos> We hired five elements trusted, true gentlemen!<eos> Yes, hello, love!<eos> - Change plate!<eos> - Done!<eos> Please try again...<eos> Great!<eos> - Well, smart!<eos> - What did I tell you?
I'm not intruding, I hope.<eos> I'm very fond of you.<eos> I'm feeling great.<eos> It was a false alert.<eos> Just in time!<eos> You were both so sweet.<eos> Real pals!<eos> You can be proud of yourselves.<eos> A drink?<eos> Has anyone ever asked you when Correggio painted you?
Lukey!<eos> - What for they shoot me, Miss Hannah?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Get my bag.<eos> - She's gone, ma'am.<eos> Are you all right, Miss Hannah?<eos> I brought you a little bitty piece of candle.<eos> We'll have some hot water for you in the morning.<eos> And lookee here.<eos> I found a piece of looking glass for you.
- Doctor, Major Gray.<eos> - All right, coming.<eos> When your next doctor takes that bandage off...<eos> I know. Tree moss.<eos> So longer, croaker.<eos> Take care, section hand.<eos> You're tired.<eos> You've helped a lot.<eos> Thanks for it.<eos> A poor way of being grateful after what I've put you through.
So longer, croaker.<eos> Take care, section hand.<eos> You're tired.<eos> You've helped a lot.<eos> Thanks for it.<eos> A poor way of being grateful after what I've put you through.<eos> - You'd better be going.<eos> - Yes, I guess I'd better.<eos> Look, Hannah Hunter.<eos> Thank God I won't be the cause of hurting you any more.
But there are certain people who do, and you're going to meet all of them. That is, if you're really serious about your career.<eos> I am, but...<eos> Good, then you're going every place with me.<eos> Every party, opening night, every saloon in town. With a complete new wardrobe at my expense.<eos> Oh, it's tax deductible.<eos> This is a tough, competitive racket.<eos> Although it's a lot more than any agent is supposed to do,<eos> I'd do it. What's this got to do with acting?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But I'll show you how to realize your ambitions, if you do as I say.
A thing like this needs verification.<eos> Here is my paper.<eos> I've written to the foremost authority in Europe.<eos> The Royal Geological Society?<eos> More eminent still.<eos> Professor Göteborg of Stockholm. Oh?<eos> And what does he say?<eos> Unfortunately, I've not yet received his reply.<eos> I've written to him twice!<eos> Well, then, I suggest we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent sees fit to answer you.
When the flesh is gone, they'll eat the bones for marrow.<eos> All they leave are teeth, horns, hooves...<eos> I could use another martini.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Of course, my dear.<eos> I'll get you one.<eos> There you are.<eos> Mario?<eos> Mario.<eos> [SPEAKING SPANISH] Mario will show you to the bath And you will freshen up a bit.
He helps us out.<eos> You jealous?<eos> You think if you side with him, he'll give you half his yams?<eos> He's a tightwad.<eos> Won't even give you one.<eos> I have my own.<eos> You've got it good.<eos> I've only got one left.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I won't ask you for yours.
No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes!<eos> Mr. Thornhill has told us that he was brought here against his will last night and forcibly intoxicated by some friends of your husband and set out on the road.<eos> Do you know anything about this?<eos> Roger was a bit tipsy when he arrived here by cab for dinner.<eos> She's lying.<eos> And I'm afraid he became even worse as the evening wore on.<eos> Finally, he told us he had to go home to sleep it off.<eos> I knew I should've served dinner earlier.<eos> What a performance!<eos> Mrs. Townsend, does the name George Kaplan mean anything to you?
Selling at $1,000.<eos> The three of you together.<eos> Now, that's a picture only Charles Addams could draw.<eos> Good evening, Mr. Kaplan.<eos> Before we start calling each other names, you'd better tell me yours.<eos> -I haven't had the pleasure.<eos> -You disappoint me, sir.<eos> I was just going to say that to her.<eos> I've always understood you were a shrewd fellow at your job.<eos> What possessed you to come blundering in here like this?
I didn't realize you were an art collector. I thought you just collected corpses.<eos> $500.<eos> $500. Thank you.<eos> I'll bet you paid plenty for this little piece of sculpture.<eos> $700.<eos> She's worth every dollar of it, take it from me.<eos> She puts her heart into her work.<eos> In fact her whole body.<eos> Sold to Mr. Vandamm at $700.<eos> Has anyone told you that you overplay your various roles rather severely?
-No. Then why are we going there?<eos> To set his mind at ease about George Kaplan.<eos> Oh, you, huh? You're George Kaplan, aren't you?<eos> There is no such person as George Kaplan.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I've been in his room.<eos> I've tried on his clothes.<eos> He's got short sleeves and dandruff!<eos> Believe me, he doesn't exist.<eos> Which is why I'm going to have to ask you to go on being him for the next 24 hours.
Not her!<eos> Did I misunderstand you about bringing her here?<eos> We'll get to that later.<eos> I suppose you were surprised to get my call.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I knew the police would release you, Mr. Kaplan.<eos> By the way, I want to compliment you on your colorful exit from the auction gallery.<eos> Thank you. And now what little drama are we here for today?<eos> I don't for a moment believe that you invited me to these gay surroundings to come to a business arrangement.<eos> Suppose I tell you that I not only know when you're leaving the country tonight but the latitude and longitude of your rendezvous and your ultimate destination.
Because it's wonderful to be in love... even when we are not loved back.<eos> I don't understand!<eos> I am courting you.<eos> Nice!<eos> Not as big as your house.<eos> These modern houses are all alike, eh?<eos> All the fault of my friend who lost him memory<eos> - Not my business<eos> No windows until you pay! No windows? How is it possible?<eos> Didn't my brother tell you about his friend? The one who made a run with the money?
Did he owe them, too?<eos> Probably did.<eos> Didn't think about that.<eos> I can't turn anything over to you till I get a court order.<eos> Does that mean you hold the wagons, too?<eos> That's right.<eos> Meantime, I'm broke.<eos> If you or any of the rest are short eating money, I'll go good for it.<eos> I'll tell 'em at the hotel.<eos> I wish you'd do that soon before anything happens to you.
No, you were quite specific.<eos> You told me that it wouldn't matter to you if I started going out with Marianna.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - You're a scoundrel, too! - What?<eos> !<eos> - I've already been slapped twice.<eos> Who cares? !<eos> You told me that it wouldn't matter to you if Didi and I...<eos> Is that not the truth?<eos> Yes, because you told me that it wouldn't matter to you if I started seeing Marianna.
Suddenly, last summer he wasn't young anymore.<eos> We went to Cabeza de Lobo suddenly, he switched from the evenings to the beach.<eos> Evenings to the beach?<eos> I mean, from the evenings to the afternoons.<eos> Suddenly, Cousin Sebastian changed to the afternoons in the beach.<eos> What kind of a beach was it?<eos> Was it a public beach?<eos> Yes, public.<eos> Little statements like that give her away.<eos> After all I've told you about his fastidiousness, can you accept that Sebastian would go to some dirty public beach near a harbor?
- Enough!<eos> Rudi, what foolishness is this?<eos> Even if I said yes, you couldn't do it.<eos> But I could.<eos> Captain Winter knows I could.<eos> That's why he asked for me.<eos> When did Captain Winter set eyes on you before?<eos> It seems our secret is out, Rudi.<eos> Rudi and I met on the glacier this afternoon.<eos> - And he told you he was a porter?
I thought you'd want to see them.<eos> Oh, yes. Thank you.<eos> I keep them under my pillow.<eos> At night, I mean.<eos> You shouldn't list them by name, just symbols.<eos> Professor Sanchez.<eos> Engineer Cifuentes and<eos> Teresa. Who's Teresa?<eos> She dances naked at the Shanghai Theater.<eos> How interesting for you.
I doubt it, Mr. Wormold.<eos> Mr. Wormold.<eos> A cable.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Mr. Wormold's busy.<eos> A cable from Hawthorne in Jamaica.<eos> "Report immediately to 59200 on grave personal matter."<eos> Had a good trip?<eos> Not very.<eos> I asked you to come over because there's a spot of bother.
If you don't, you put my source in danger. You needn't eat anything.<eos> Couldn't you give the impression of somebody who only drinks?<eos> You know, an alcoholic. Thanks very much.<eos> Very good for business.<eos> You're not afraid, are you?<eos> This is a dangerous job.<eos> You shouldn't have taken it on unless you were prepared to see it through.<eos> There's no need for you to worry.<eos> When they serve you, never take the nearest portion.<eos> It's like a conjuror trying to force a card on you.
It was only me remaining to save him from Lucia.<eos> I let the others do everything; my conscience was clear.<eos> - Hi, Lucia.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You know?<eos> It's the third day...<eos> It's the third day I've been loving you.<eos> I've rediscovered the world, and I find it wonderful.<eos> Even this sham of a city seems different.<eos> What I've told you the other day were bollocks.
- Let's turn back.<eos> No, no, let's go all the same.<eos> What good is it, Lucia?<eos> What good is it?<eos> We can try.<eos> - I know what I feel, I don't need any proofs. - And what about me?<eos> Does Marcello also come here?<eos> - How old are you, Lucia?<eos> - Twenty, in ten days.<eos> Will I be enough of a friend, in ten days, so to make the present I'm giving you acceptable?
The project has already been rejected by the committee.<eos> Then there is only to thank the cretin who rejected the project. - Oh yes?<eos> And then know that I am the cretin who rejected the project!<eos> And now that I know you, I say I did well!<eos> - Please allow me...<eos> - Do not be surprised, I know her situation, you are on the verge of bankruptcy.<eos> But when one begins without initial capital and with the liquid shortage that there is today...<eos> And would you like become a industrial without initial capital?<eos> And you want to keep me from having ambitions just because I did not have the luck that you had?<eos> Thanks to that poor woman of his wife who is watching you, if not I already have hit you in the face.
Are you married?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Happy? - Enough.<eos> - In short...<eos> The woman has 200 grammi of brain less than the man, it is scientifically proved... and wives are the salt of life, for this husbands drink.<eos> Is there a cat in this tavern?<eos> We give him the brain...<eos> Have you seen how I treated my wife?<eos> Get home, I said!<eos> Straight away, I told you!
She'd like you to do it again, sir.<eos> Well, my first success in Japan.<eos> Now watch closely.<eos> No, here.<eos> Malice against the foreigners was growing.<eos> They were plagued constantly.<eos> Henry, will you take Okichi into the house?<eos> My hat.<eos> Let him have it, Henry.<eos> It didn't fit you anyway.
It was a bad deed to kill him.<eos> Family is being set against family... and friend against friend.<eos> Do you want to tear us to pieces?<eos> I told you long ago that there are men here... who will fight for our old ways to the death.<eos> Do they still include Your Excellency?<eos> Mr. Harris, you do not understand.<eos> In Japan we do not belong to ourselves but to our families.<eos> We owe them unquestioning obedience.<eos> Go, Mr. Harris.<eos> Go before that obedience is turned against you.
- Thank you.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - Goodbye, Mr. McKay.<eos> Hey, look at that.<eos> All right, Clint.<eos> Turn 'em around.<eos> Mr. McKay?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm Steve Leech, foreman at Ladder Ranch.<eos> I brought Pat's buckboard and team for you.
You just go pick out any little spot that suits ya.<eos> I'll be right with ya.<eos> I'd like this to be strictly between us.<eos> I can see how you'd feel that way.<eos> All right.<eos> McKay, you're a bigger fool than I thought you were.<eos> And, to tell you the truth, that just didn't seem possible.<eos> Come on.<eos> All I can say, McKay, is you take a hell of a long time to say goodbye.<eos> I'm... just about finished, if it's all right with you.
This is nothing but a personal feud between two selfish, ruthless, vicious old men:<eos> Henry Terrill and you.<eos> You gonna stand there and take that?<eos> I've had enough of...<eos> You're mistaken, Mr. McKay.<eos> I came to visit for a few days.<eos> There's no need for anyone to worry.<eos> I suppose I... I should've left word with somebody.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> - I didn't ask you to bother about me!
We're all here.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> I'm Elsa Mackenbourg.<eos> - I thought you knew each other.<eos> Not as well as I'd like to.<eos> Pretty dress.<eos> Not as pretty as some of yours I've got.<eos> They are just brilliant.<eos> You're kind.<eos> But the line of that suits you.
Next thing I know, the doctor's fixing me up.<eos> Do you know what happened last night?<eos> You, lady?<eos> You.<eos> Or were you deaf and blind last night, too?<eos> They sent us women away.<eos> Why?<eos> Ask them.<eos> Sam, what'd you do with them?<eos> It's like I told you before, sheriff.
Are you Mr Winters?<eos> I'm Angelo.<eos> How do you do?<eos> - About this house...<eos> - I could throw the bull all day... But I'm straight from the shoulder. Do you appreciate that kind of talk?<eos> - From the bottom of my heart.<eos> - I got drunk.<eos> I've three children on my hands. What am I to do?<eos> What a party. You should have been there.<eos> If this house is not up by nightfall, I'll sue you for every penny you have.
Well, it seems to be starting.<eos> Enemy troops are massing at several points along our borders.<eos> Is my city in danger?<eos> Not yet, certainly.<eos> Though you never know where they'll strike or when or if.<eos> Hsien Chang, I must go now.<eos> May I ask a favor?<eos> A moment alone with Jen-ai.<eos> Go into the garden.<eos> I told you once that I have few personal feelings.
What do you mean by that?<eos> - Central jail, under lock and key.<eos> - No!<eos> Why not?<eos> You'd be safe there.<eos> Why do you think I'm going through all of this?<eos> Why do you think I agreed to be a witness?<eos> I want to keep out of jail.<eos> You go back to sleep.<eos> No one's going to hurt you.
About big enough for a man.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - You bet.<eos> Pay the cashier on your way out.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm the relief officer.<eos> I'm new.<eos> Never seen you before.<eos> Does music bug you like it does all the other cops?
Things are going well now, Nurse Brita said.<eos> The bleedings have stopped, and there are no worrying signs.<eos> Please sit.<eos> But...<eos> Maybe you're not happy about it.<eos> Maybe you would have preferred...<eos> Well...<eos> You don't think marrying the father of the baby is an option and you don't want to go to your parents' house.<eos> Your parents still don't know anything.<eos> I would like to remind you once more of what I said before.
Couldn't take one again.<eos> Terrible thought.<eos> Makes me old.<eos> Makes me antique.<eos> - Do you like subs?<eos> - I chose the service, sir.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Good record. - Thank you, sir.<eos> It's a fact, not a compliment, so don't thank me.<eos> I told you two years ago you were hot stuff, that you'd have a sub one day.
You know why?<eos> It's because you're so easy.<eos> Deal.<eos> Yes, sir. What can I do for you?<eos> My name is George Hansen.<eos> I'm the son of Sven Hansen.<eos> Come on, Willie.<eos> You better get back in there.<eos> Willie's here most of the time.<eos> - Has someone told you about your father?
- I'd give it away.<eos> Come on, Swede, you can tell me, is there something special about it?<eos> It belonged to my mother.<eos> One day, it will belong to my wife.<eos> In that case, we might as well just split it up between them right here.<eos> Half and half.<eos> - You got to stop them or they'll kill him.<eos> - Sure.<eos> When you're through with him, put him on the train.<eos> What did they do to you?
No.<eos> We had no evidence.<eos> We couldn't hold you on a Federal charge.<eos> You could help us if you wanted to.<eos> You're a handy boy. Sorry.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> You're bucking the United States government.<eos> There's a conspiracy moving into Rillow Valley and we intend to put an end to it.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Nobody's asking you to blow the whistle on your own people.
- Mr Grandi...<eos> You have something for my husband.<eos> Isn't it time you gave it to me?<eos> It's time he laid off my brother in Mexico City! That's advice.<eos> That's what I got for him.<eos> Then the conference is over?<eos> I'm free to leave?<eos> - Free?<eos> Nobody was holding you, Mrs Vargas.<eos> Nobody laid a hand on you.
l`ll be right there, Major.<eos> You wished to see me, sir?<eos> There are many kinds of officers that we get in a war.<eos> Men like Green, Emerson, and a few officers like you. Fortunately, a very few like you.<eos> Sometimes we find you out. Occasionally, we don`t.<eos> In your case, we`ve been lucky.<eos> l`ve just completed an investigation of the reasons for Private Ackerman`s behavior.<eos> - Sir, I can explain. You see...<eos> - l hope you can.<eos> l`ll read you the charges that`ll be brought against you at your court martial.
In your case, we`ve been lucky.<eos> l`ve just completed an investigation of the reasons for Private Ackerman`s behavior.<eos> - Sir, I can explain. You see...<eos> - l hope you can.<eos> l`ll read you the charges that`ll be brought against you at your court martial.<eos> "That said officer willfully persecuted Private Noah Ackerman by ordering mass punishment of his entire company as a means of disciplining him."<eos> "By willfully and knowingly permitting savage beatings to be inflicted upon him by members of his company."<eos> "By attempting to blackmail Private Michael Whiteacre, who interceded on his behalf."<eos> Do you want me to go on?<eos> I thought not. l`ve preferred these charges against you, and I officially serve you with them now.
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.<eos> -Would you care for one?<eos> -No, thanks.<eos> -A drink?<eos> -No, thank you.<eos> -Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.<eos> -Very good, sir.<eos> Do you read this?<eos> Oh, I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.<eos> I never congratulated you on your escape.
I'm not in it for the money, sir.<eos> I kill for honour.<eos> -He's Corsican.<eos> If you behave, I'll behave.<eos> If you show no respect, I'll kill you.<eos> You respect me, don't you?<eos> See? Excuse me, I'm busy.<eos> You're really out of luck, darling.<eos> -One moment...<eos> What's wrong with you?
Oh, that's even better.<eos> I like that better.<eos> Better than what?<eos> Goulash.<eos> Well, yeah. So do I.<eos> - This dinner is white tie, isn't it?<eos> - White tie and bathrobe.<eos> Now, how do you like your chicken fried?<eos> Salt and pepper mixed in the flour, throw it in a paper bag toss in the chicken, shake it up.<eos> Like me to show you?
Kate, I can have a pair of saddle horses put 'round back of the hotel.<eos> That's as much as I can do.<eos> With the feeling against Doc, I wouldn't stay in business 10 minutes if they knew I'd helped him.<eos> Ten, please.<eos> - Wilson live here?<eos> - Why, no, sir.<eos> They're just holding Doc Holliday upstairs in his room.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Mr Earp?<eos> - Look, Miss Fisher, I told you this is none of my business.
- I must have worn out your machine.<eos> I needed two full sets of pictures spaced several days apart.<eos> I had to compare them before I...<eos> Before I could be sure.<eos> Sure of what, Doctor?<eos> What is it?<eos> Relax, Doctor, you can't tell me anything I haven't imagined.<eos> You are getting smaller.<eos> I... I don't profess to understand it, Mr. Carey.<eos> There's no medical precedent for what's happening to you.
I drank a barium solution, and stood behind a fluoroscope screen.<eos> They gave me radioactive iodine.<eos> And an examination with a Geiger counter.<eos> I had electrodes fastened to my head.<eos> Water restriction tests, protein bond tests, eye tests, blood cultures... X-rays and more X-rays.<eos> Tests, endless tests.<eos> And then one day in the third week the final examination.<eos> A paper chromatography test.<eos> Now don't be despondent, Mr. Carey.<eos> At least we've found out what is happening to you.
- Well, I've seen your picture in the paper.<eos> - Well?<eos> - Would you come into the bedroom?<eos> - What?<eos> - You're wanted on the telephone.<eos> They say it's Washington.<eos> Don't I get a minute to myself?<eos> Everywhere I go, Washington.<eos> Well, that means a half an hour.<eos> Crewson, I wanna talk to you.
Please, Karswell.<eos> I'll stop this investigation.<eos> When Holden arrives, I'll tell him I've made a mistake.<eos> I'll send a statement to the newspapers.<eos> No more newspapers.<eos> All I ask for is privacy for myself and my followers.<eos> - Well, I promise. - All right.<eos> That's good enough.<eos> Then you'll stop this?<eos> You've still got that parchment I gave you?
You're really serious, aren't you?<eos> You will die as I said... at 1 0:00 on the 28th of this month.<eos> Your time allowed is just three days from now.<eos> "My time allowed."<eos> Oh, yes, your trick with the card.<eos> Very good too.<eos> I'm sorry you remain so skeptical.<eos> But as the time gets closer, mental disintegration will set in.<eos> First, weakness and unsureness.<eos> And then horror, as the fear of what is behind you grips your heart.
Very good too.<eos> I'm sorry you remain so skeptical.<eos> But as the time gets closer, mental disintegration will set in.<eos> First, weakness and unsureness.<eos> And then horror, as the fear of what is behind you grips your heart.<eos> Because it's there, Dr. Holden.<eos> It's there!<eos> It has been from the moment we met in the museum.<eos> You actually believe this nonsense.<eos> I asked you to drop this ridiculous investigation.
Perhaps you will before it's too late.<eos> Well, it's nice to know that I do have a way out, Mr. Karswell.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> I don't know if the diagrams are of any use to you, dear... but as you see, the words make no sense at all.<eos> - What kind of language is this?<eos> - I really don't know.<eos> I didn't know that you were interested in the black arts, Miss Harrington.<eos> She wanted to see the books you and Dr. Holden were discussing, didn't you?<eos> But we can't read a word, can we, dear?<eos> - What especially interests you?
Number 44.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Over here, John.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> I just got back to the hotel and found your message.<eos> It's only a minute or two.<eos> I wanted to wait and go in with you.<eos> - What is this all about?<eos> - I'm not sure I know.<eos> That's why I asked you to come here.
When I was a kid, I used to walk down the street with the other kids.<eos> When we'd come to a ladder, they'd all walk around it.<eos> I'd walk under it, just to see if anything would happen.<eos> Nothing ever did.<eos> When they'd see a black cat... they'd run the other way to keep it from crossing their path.<eos> But I didn't, and all this ever did for me... was make me wonder why... why people could get so panicky over absolutely nothing at all.<eos> I've made a career studying it... maybe just to prove one thing... that I'm not a superstitious sucker like about 90 percent of humanity.<eos> But what did you run from in the woods?<eos> It was a trick gadget that Karswell had rigged up to frighten me away... and I fell for the bait like an idiot.<eos> But he told you himself not to go back through the trees.
Thank you.<eos> That's all right. You keep them.<eos> I shan't need them anymore.<eos> You're very generous.<eos> Well, I'll leave you two alone.<eos> I know there's a certain feeling between you, and you might want to be alone.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Your generosity is becoming overwhelming as it gets closer to 1 0:00.<eos> You're staying with me, Karswell.<eos> You've sold your bill of goods too well, because I believe you now.
- Yes, yes, it's fine.<eos> Now you're back and maybe you have changed your mind as far as I'm concerned.<eos> Were that the case,<eos> it would be much better to clarify everything and find closure with a formal appointment.<eos> - Tomorrow, at the usual place?<eos> - As you wish.<eos> But now, pay a little attention to me too.<eos> You're not trying to court me, are you?<eos> You're looking at me like a man in love<eos> After everything I've told you about myself you can't fall in love with me.
You...<eos> - You...?<eos> - Yes, I did just that.<eos> So, nothing's changed.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Now you can keep your hopes up.<eos> You can write to him again and it'll all work out, you'll see.<eos> Try to forgive me.<eos> Maybe you'll manage to when you're happy, right?<eos> What possessed you to trust a man like me?
You're not concerned with them.<eos> You're in love with Joey.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> We understand each other.<eos> We're alike, Joey and I. The same breed.<eos> I'm not so sure of that.<eos> Joey's better than you think, better than he thinks.<eos> Nobody's better than he thinks.<eos> It may come as a surprise, Miss English... I do believe there's nothing between you. That makes you dangerous.<eos> He may not know it, but when he told you to keep your clothes on he played the greatest love scene of his career.
- Probably wants me to break a leg.<eos> - No, an arm, he said.<eos> I told him the item would be in Mr Hunsecker's column tomorrow.<eos> - It isn't.<eos> - But...<eos> I saw the early edition.<eos> - But, Sidney... - But.<eos> But, but, but what?<eos> That makes five days in a row Mr Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.<eos> May I rent you out as an adding machine?
This requires investigation.<eos> How did you mean it?<eos> Come on, I'm waiting.<eos> I don't take kindly to you and Falco teaching me ethics.<eos> Who's the injured party here?<eos> You?<eos> You have no right to ask questions.<eos> And your snide...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you yet.
Come on in, Carter.<eos> Look at this room.<eos> It's ugly, old and musty.<eos> But I never knew I could miss anything so much.<eos> - Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.<eos> - Oh, thank you, sir.<eos> I'm not a religious man, but when they carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.<eos> - Why, thank you, Carter.<eos> - Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.<eos> If anything happened to you, what would happen to me, after 37 years?
No motive.<eos> No motive whatsoever.<eos> - You find some flaw in this reasoning?<eos> - No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.<eos> Well, it's all yours.<eos> You'll find Mr. Vole very responsive and quite candid.<eos> So candid, he's already told me we'll have to sue him for our fees.<eos> Oh, we'll simply put a lean on Mr. Vole's £80,000.<eos> - What £80,000?<eos> - The £80,000 Mrs. French left you.
Aye, that's so.<eos> Four and sixpence I pay out every week.<eos> That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay.<eos> I am sure that many agree with you.<eos> Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply to the National Health Insurance for...<eos> - ...a hearing aid?<eos> - For... for what?<eos> I protest against the way in which this question was put!<eos> I will repeat the question, my lord.<eos> I asked you in a normal tone of voice, audible to everyone in open court, did you apply to the National Health Insurance for a hearing aid?
Leonard Vole left the house at 7:30 and returned at 25 minutes past 9.<eos> Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?<eos> No.<eos> He returned at ten minutes past ten.<eos> Christine, what are you saying?<eos> It's not true.<eos> You know it's not true!<eos> Silence!<eos> I must have silence.<eos> As your counsel will tell you, Vole, you will very shortly have an opportunity of speaking in your own defense.
I doubt if anything is to be gained by questioning you any further.<eos> That will be all, Frau Helm.<eos> Mrs. Helm, I presume you know the meaning of the English word "perjury"?<eos> - In German, the word is Meineid.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Meineid.<eos> It means to swear falsely under oath.<eos> And are you aware, Mrs. Helm, that the penalty in this country for perjury is a heavy term of imprisonment?<eos> Yes, I'm aware.<eos> Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more, is the evidence that you have given the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- Patience.<eos> - Write!<eos> - I write.<eos> Yes, the body will arrive...<eos> - The body...<eos> - On the 17th, with the 6:25 express, platform 8.<eos> Very well, thank you.<eos> - Madame De Ritis?<eos> - Yes, Sir.<eos> Did a warehouse-keeper ask you to sign a protest against microphones?
The estimate for transportation your husband from the station to the cemetery.<eos> What're you doing, tearing it?<eos> I shaved really close.<eos> It won't be necessary anymore.<eos> - From today, you don't work here anymore.<eos> - They've moved me in another department.<eos> I doubt they need you in another department.<eos> - You're letting me go?<eos> - They told me you chose freedom.<eos> They told you.
He never will.<eos> Let's sit down.<eos> - Shall we continue?<eos> - Well, I think we ought to take a break.<eos> You know, one man's inside and I think we ought to wait for him.<eos> Looks like we're really hung up here, huh?<eos> I mean, that thing with the old man, that was pretty unexpected.<eos> Wish I could figure out some way we could break it up.<eos> You know, in advertising...<eos> I told you I worked in an agency?
He ran to the door and saw the kid run out of the house.<eos> What's that mean to you?<eos> I wonder how clearly he heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.<eos> He didn't.<eos> The window was open.<eos> So was the one upstairs. It was a hot night.<eos> It was another apartment. It's not easy to identify a shouting voice.<eos> He identified it in court.<eos> The lady across the street looked right in the open window and saw the stabbing.<eos> - Isn't that enough for you?
It may be, you can have me replaced.<eos> That, of course, is your privilege.<eos> Until then, I intend to function as commissario.<eos> You are an efficient man, signore.<eos> A man of sincerity.<eos> There will be no thought of replacing you.<eos> Then I must say that at daybreak, I intend to use all means at my disposal to destroy that creature before it kills someone.<eos> But you can't do that.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> May I remind you that the commissario is a Sicilian police chief performing his duties?
- Thank you.<eos> Is this okay?<eos> - Yes, fine. Put it over there.<eos> It won't hurt, will it?<eos> - No, don't worry. It should control your anger, too.<eos> That's easier said than done.<eos> Do you know what it means to put 20 million on the table? The deal is as good as done, and after 15 minutes it's all gone.<eos> The deal and the 20 million.<eos> God damn Rome and the day I came here.<eos> Why, did they screw you...
And even when that's happening, Pa holds me safe away from the blades.<eos> He was, you know, really strong... and we was real close, him and me.<eos> And when they brought his body back to our barge...<eos> Ma comes up and looks at him... she looks at me, and you know what she says, looking right at me?<eos> She says, "Why couldn't it have been you?<eos> Why did it have to be him?"<eos> Looking right at me, she says.<eos> I just started to run.<eos> I ain't stopped running since... until Shep gave me this job.<eos> What am I talking this way to you for?
-Very well, Doctor.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Doctor, with that nurse around, I do feel crazy.<eos> Don't make me laugh.<eos> I know perfectly well you're not crazy.<eos> Then why don't you let me go?<eos> I have to ask you some questions first.<eos> Sit down there.<eos> Why did you attack that poor man...<eos> -who'd done nothing to you?
Johnson... Dr. Johnson.<eos> Very good!<eos> Very good, indeed, Dr. Morgan.<eos> I had no idea you could arrange surgical instruments this well.<eos> Genetics may be my specialty, but I'm also a doctor.<eos> I didn't mean to offend.<eos> It's just unusual these days... to find such fidelity to doing things exactly right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's unfortunate that Mr. Grant... couldn't tell us the exact location of what we're looking for.<eos> I told you it was in the Everglades.
It resists everything we used on it, including extreme temperatures.<eos> - It makes me Superman, for one thing. - Yes, we know.<eos> I have a peculiar range of vision.<eos> I can also hear a young man just outside that window discussing a problem in advanced biology.<eos> Carol, would you see if I'm right?<eos> ...when I kissed her good night, she slapped my face.<eos> I said:<eos> "I didn't slap yours when you ordered a $4 steak for dinner."<eos> Just as we need glasses and hearing aids these people need electronic amplification of their senses especially sight and hearing.<eos> - Does that suggest anything to you?
Oh.<eos> You be a good boy, now.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> I hope the storm doesn't louse up your party, Mr. Rink.<eos> Slip-up, boy.<eos> I just forgot to order the right kind of weather.<eos> I heard a twister hit Waco.<eos> What's the matter? Can't you talk United States?<eos> You're talking to my wife.<eos> My name's Benedict, Jordan Benedict, if that means anything to you.
- Sergeant!<eos> - Yes?<eos> - My car?<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - My car was here.<eos> - Are you joking again?<eos> - What?<eos> - You put it here, but then you took it away.<eos> No, I came back and I put it here.<eos> - After I told you to go away?
I am lucky gentlemen.<eos> What is it?<eos> You defile this song.<eos> This Mussolini's anthem<eos> -In Rome.<eos> But at us no.<eos> The big geniuses meet.<eos> These Jews.<eos> I kiss your hand, Lola! (*old greeting*)<eos> I brought this to you.
You can't associate your name with his.<eos> His name isn't mentioned.<eos> The contribution will be anonymous.<eos> - I just want to do the right thing.<eos> - Reject this offer.<eos> Don't be hasty.<eos> We must consider her tax position.<eos> She can't carry the full load of this charity drive.<eos> They won't allow more than a 20% deduction.<eos> - I advise you to accept it.
Well, I come from a long line of Swedes.<eos> We have an old saying too:<eos> "When the cat's away, why should the mouse act like a rat?" Liz!<eos> Liz, I've been looking for you.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I've been right here all the time, Mr. Lord.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> Oh, no, call me Seth.<eos> - Seth.<eos> Your daughter doesn't resemble you.
Who you betting' on, mister?<eos> Anything look good to you?<eos> - Red Lightning. - Huh?<eos> Red Lightning in the seventh.<eos> - So you're bettin' on him, huh?<eos> - Yeah, I got a little bet down on him.<eos> Well, I guess I better be getting back to work.<eos> Yeah, well, thanks for bringin' me the program.<eos> No trouble at all.<eos> You sure there's nothing else I can do for you?
No.<eos> Not even, I suppose, that he was an agent of the Deuxième Bureau?<eos> What's that?<eos> Perhaps you have also never heard of the American FBI?<eos> Now, wait...<eos> It would be so much easier for both of us, monsieur, if you would cease to pretend.<eos> Look here...<eos> The dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover.<eos> That's why he was killed.<eos> He told you what he had discovered.
You expected someone else.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Ambrose?<eos> I think this gentleman wants to talk to us.<eos> Now, Father, why don't you go and have a nice rest?<eos> I have centuries of rest ahead of me, thank you.<eos> Good day to you, sir.<eos> Now, what can I do for you?<eos> I'm Dr. McKenna.<eos> That name mean anything to you? No.
You got yourself a wife, sonny!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Ethan, tell her to go back!<eos> What?<eos> And have her whole family after our scalps for flaunting' one of their womenfolk? No, sir!<eos> Come on, Mrs. Pawley.<eos> Come on, Mrs. Pawley.<eos> Join our merry group.<eos> Mrs. Pawley?<eos> "There is one other thing I got to tell you...
I hope so.<eos> Mr. Masters told us about...<eos> Well, he told us about your wife.<eos> Would you like to talk about her?<eos> I know it's none of my business... but it might make it easier.<eos> You're right, Mrs. Greer.<eos> It's none of your business... and it won't make it any easier.<eos> Good night.<eos> Mrs. Greer?<eos> There's one thing Masters in there didn't tell you.
Stepp?<eos> The file clerk?<eos> Yes.<eos> I came in right after the shot was fired.<eos> At first I didn't realize what had happened.<eos> By the time I did, I realized the consequences, too.<eos> Complete ruin.<eos> So I hid there until he left, trying to think of some way to save things.<eos> Then I remembered you and that smoker.<eos> Telephoned you in Los Angeles.
What about Stepp?<eos> Well, he's the only possible leak.<eos> I'll take care of that tonight.<eos> Partner, I think we're going to be all right.<eos> Yes, come in.<eos> Stepp, come in.<eos> Sorry, I forgot you were waiting.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The reason I asked you to wait, Stepp... was because I thought it might be... well, a little less uncomfortable for you with the other employees gone.
You did.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Why, yes.<eos> You really do believe that, don't you?<eos> I'm sorry, Stepp, but that settles it.<eos> But Mr. King, I couldn't be wrong.<eos> Don't you remember when you told me to hire-<eos> I'm sorry, Stepp.<eos> There's nothing to be done about it.<eos> I'll tell you what I am going to do for you, though.
You knew you could trust me not to tell her you were in the bedroom.<eos> Of course, I don't believe that you had anything to do... with what happened later.<eos> But you see, it's the police I'm worried about, Mr. Nash.<eos> Maybe tomorrow they'll ask me about you.<eos> So I thought if we could get together.... You know... dinner for two, tête-à-tête.<eos> [bell buzzing]<eos> Mr. Nash, come in, come in.<eos> What a wonderful surprise.<eos> I wasn't expecting anybody but you're very welcome, I'm sure.<eos> You won't believe this, but I was just writing a letter to you.
- Ready ?<eos> Yes.<eos> An innocent man has nothing to fear.<eos> Remember that.<eos> Oh, that's not the note I'm just telling you.<eos> This is the note :<eos> "This is a gun I have pointing at you.<eos> Be quiet and you will not be hurt.<eos> Give me the money from the cash drawer."<eos> Now, I wanna be entirely fair to you, Manny so I'll tell you right now.
This really looks bad.<eos> See that ?<eos> I think you have a right to know, so I'll tell you.<eos> I won't keep anything from you.<eos> Here's three pieces of paper.<eos> This is the note the holdup man gave the girl at the window.<eos> This one is the first you printed at my dictation using the same words.<eos> There's a kind of similarity in the printing, but that doesn't mean much.<eos> Most people print alike when they use capitals.<eos> But it was similar enough, so I asked you to print it again.
I find it... extremely nourishing<eos> Restive, aren't they?<eos> Silence, or no holiday!<eos> Everyone's looking... swallow it<eos> It's revolting<eos> I'm not referring to the fish, either<eos> Get those hooligans out of here, Monsieur Drain<eos> What's this Bolshevism?<eos> Eat your fish and be quiet!<eos> I told you to get them out of here
- Always wanted to have one of those.<eos> - Shall we send it, sir?<eos> - No, I'll give it to her myself.<eos> - And about the bracelet, sir.<eos> - I want that engraved.<eos> Yes, and to whom?<eos> To my dear, sweet...<eos> - May I use your telephone, please?<eos> - Of course, right over there.<eos> I'll have her name for you in just a minute.
You're the first driver who chased a man after he'd already missed him.<eos> - Hey, buddy, who's car is that?<eos> - Mine.<eos> Parked it right next to a fire hydrant.<eos> That wasn't there when I parked!<eos> Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.<eos> Every time it rains those fireplugs pop out of the sidewalk like mushrooms.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Put it over here.<eos> Let that be a lesson to you.
Shut up!<eos> Come on, get 'em up.<eos> I gotta stop that fool.<eos> Hold it right there. Don't think I won't.<eos> Kobish!<eos> - Cindy!<eos> - Don't move!<eos> - Glenn!<eos> - Hal, this girl is ill.<eos> - If there's any decency in you...
I just know it.<eos> It makes you mean and violent and cruel.<eos> And that's the way Cal has always felt, all his life.<eos> I know you didn't mean it to be that way, but it's true.<eos> You never gave him your love.<eos> You never asked him for his.<eos> You never asked him for one thing.<eos> Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.<eos> But before he goes...<eos> He did something very bad, and I'm not asking you to forgive him.
We can find peace and permanence and lasting love.<eos> Maurice dear, this is the first love letter I ever wrote in my life, and I find it difficult.<eos> Too difficult.<eos> I couldn't put such things on paper.<eos> I wanted to say it all, to speak the words to him, to see the desolation leave his face.<eos> - I've been waiting for you all week.<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> I've been very busy making plans.<eos> What is it, Sarah?<eos> What's happened to you?
Well, only in the mornings.<eos> It has to do with the heat.<eos> At night they put a kind of preservative in it.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> What do they use?<eos> Bacardi.<eos> Doesn't that have alcohol in it?<eos> Well, just enough to keep the milk from turning sour.<eos> That's the same song we heard being played near the church, isn't it?<eos> Playing the tambourine has developed in you an ear for music.
What if I'm too busy to go?<eos> Nobody's that busy.<eos> You may be right.<eos> - I am, Mr. Scott.<eos> Beautifully tailored suit, Mr. Garth.<eos> I suppose you wear suspenders.<eos> I mean braces.<eos> Yeah, just as I thought, braces.<eos> Tell the boss we're here, will you please, Miss Worth?<eos> Mr. Garland asked me to remind you to take care of the errand he mentioned this morning.
Perhaps narcotics.<eos> How civilized this earth used to be.<eos> But as the world becomes more primitive, its treasures become more fabulous.<eos> Perhaps sentiment will succeed where greed failed.<eos> You will die, Mr. Hammer.<eos> But your friend - you can save her.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> The young lady you picked up on the highway - she wrote you a letter.<eos> In it were two words - "Remember me."<eos> She asks you to remember.
You're not busy this morning?<eos> No.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> There's something I want to talk to you about.<eos> What is it?<eos> - Let's not be so formal...<eos> - I'm not being formal at all.<eos> Where's your daughter?<eos> She's gone to a friend's house. Some party or other. She'll be back home later tonight.<eos> - Has Kaji said anything to you lately?
Then you live here all alone?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I should tell you, professor, I'm unable to provide breakfast or early morning tea.<eos> This is the sitting room.<eos> And the bedroom is just down here.<eos> These rooms do need an airing, don't they?<eos> I'm afraid there's no proper service.<eos> Most exhilarating.<eos> The rooms will suit me admirably, Mrs. Wilberforce.<eos> I shall move in tomorrow if that is convenient to you.
It always has been.<eos> We could harvest it ourselves then, couldn't we?<eos> You were lucky to get this far without Indian trouble.<eos> If I were you, I'd head back to Laramie while the trail's still clear.<eos> I guess you're right about that.<eos> - Good night, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> - Good night, Miss Waggoman.<eos> Miss Waggoman...<eos> Yes?<eos> That shipment I delivered to you: Is everything all right?
Please.<eos> If you turn up around here again, you won't need mules to carry you away.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> I want to thank you.<eos> - Is this your gun?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry about this.<eos> I figure you've had a bellyful of these parts and are anxious to get out of here.<eos> I figure this place owes me something and I'm going to make it pay.<eos> Let me straighten you out, mister.
Let it alone, Davey boy, or I'll clip off a thumb.<eos> Hold it, Vic.<eos> I'm Alec Waggoman of the Barb.<eos> - What's the reason for this?<eos> - Ask your son.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> Go out to the salt lagoons.<eos> You'll find 12 dead mules and three burned wagons.<eos> - They belong to me.<eos> - Nobody asked you to come here.
They have never been anything else.<eos> Speaking of the Apache, do you know anything about the massacre of a Cavalry patrol at Dutch Creek, several months ago?<eos> Only what I heard, that it was an unprovoked and ruthless killing.<eos> Did you know that the Apache used repeating rifles?<eos> There was talk about that.<eos> Was there any talk about where the rifles came from?<eos> Some men will sell anything for a profit.<eos> I suppose there's a man like that in every town.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I heard my uncle paid you for your mules and wagons.
- You do what you're told!<eos> You go set down by the river.<eos> - Icey, I'm a sight.<eos> - Get along with you!<eos> You!<eos> That young lady better look sharp or some smart sister is gonna snap him up.<eos> She's not the only fish in the river!<eos> Now you two stay put. Shilly-shallying around.<eos> A husband's one piece of store goods you never know till you get it home and take the paper off.<eos> Did Ben Harper ever tell you what he done with the money he stole?
Give the other folks a chance.<eos> Our attendants will be pleased to answer your questions... as you tour the wonders of the deep.<eos> Very shortly now the Gill Man will be fed.<eos> Scientists are still investigating his diet.<eos> They found the creature reluctant to eat these fish... That are swimming about him in the tank.<eos> It was a real break finding you here.<eos> Look, I'm not one of those specialists who fails to appreciate the other fella's field.<eos> Although, personally, I think we're overspecialized.<eos> Why, it's getting so we have experts... who concentrate only on the lower section of a specimen's left ear.<eos> Well, I must tell you, I know something about your work. And I was quite impressed when I heard you were coming.
It's hard just offhand, but there have been plenty of them.<eos> You asked for it.<eos> Take my secretary, for instance.<eos> To you, she's just Miss Morris, a piece of office furniture.<eos> Ten fingers to type my letters.<eos> Well, let me tell you.<eos> - Did you type this letter?<eos> - Yes, Mr. Sherman.<eos> There are six errors in the first paragraph.<eos> What is the matter with you?
I'd have to get in by 1 again.<eos> Very true, you would.<eos> At least occasionally.<eos> That's what's wonderful about a married man.<eos> No matter what, he can't ask you to marry him.<eos> - He's married already. Right?<eos> - Right.<eos> You certainly don't have to worry about me.<eos> Am I ever a married man!<eos> I'm the most married man you'll ever know. And I promise I will never ask you to marry me, come what may.
- Count Malcolm.<eos> - Charmed, I'm sure.<eos> Mr Egerman fell in the pool of water by the front gate.<eos> - I hope you weren't hurt.<eos> - Oh no, not a scratch.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> Is your visit at this hour of an official nature?<eos> We are old friends.<eos> I also see my nightshirt has proved useful.<eos> It fits you well, I trust?
A stranger who doesn't know the language.<eos> I was going to hire an English-speaking chauffeur.<eos> I'll give you a wholesale rate.<eos> - And no tipping.<eos> - Your terms are generous.<eos> - Too generous to refuse.<eos> - My terms usually are.<eos> - Where's your car? - Right there.<eos> I can't seem to get out of this gracefully, so let's go.<eos> I've been waiting for you to mention that kiss I gave you last night.
- Where in Oregon?<eos> The Rogue River?<eos> - Where were you born?<eos> In a taxi, halfway between home and the hospital.<eos> I've lived in 27 different towns.<eos> - Is somebody chasing you?<eos> - Boys.<eos> You can stop running now.<eos> When my father died, they discovered oil on our land. I started to travel.<eos> - The boys' fathers were chasing you?
Just look at the colours of the sea and the sky, and the pink and green buildings.<eos> Think of all those roofs you could climb over.<eos> - Who did you call me?<eos> - John Robie.<eos> The jewel thief known as The Cat.<eos> I read about you in the Paris paper.<eos> You may have read about The Cat...<eos> I thought you said you were hungry.<eos> The picnic basket's in the trunk.<eos> Try to bluff me, and I can have the fun of telling you how clever I was.
Give them back.<eos> Mother's jewels.<eos> I don't have them.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> - When did it happen?<eos> - When I was asleep.<eos> - Let's look.<eos> - The place to look is here!<eos> Help yourself.<eos> Did Francie tell you what happened?
Where'd Arnie get the rabbit?<eos> He found it.<eos> I think Captain Wiles shot it.<eos> I'd like to hear more of your life story, if you don't mind.<eos> You see, we don't know quite what to do with Harry.<eos> Thought you might have some suggestions.<eos> You can stuff him, for all I care.<eos> Stuff him and put him in a glass case.<eos> Only I'd suggest frosted glass.<eos> What did he do to you, besides marry you?
The Captain was so scared.<eos> But then he accounted for all his bullets, so up Harry came.<eos> Then Miss Gravely thought her shoe was responsible for it, so —<eos> - Shoe? - So the Captain, rather gallantly, I thought, pushed him back in again.<eos> Then he was out and back and I can't remember why.<eos> But anyway, he's out again now because Sam and I wanna get married.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But why did you —<eos> - Hit him on the head?<eos> That wouldn't interest you, Doctor.
And purpose.<eos> To know what you want, and never to allow anyone or anything to stop you.<eos> I didn't think you'd allow Parrish to stop you.<eos> Nobody's stopping me.<eos> I promised you the valley.<eos> Anybody following her?<eos> I came here alone, Mr. Parrish.<eos> You don't have to fight Anchor, there's no reason to.<eos> My father made a mistake offering you so little.<eos> I know he'll give you what you want.
-Get those men to the hospital.<eos> - Capt. Glenn Riordan, sir.<eos> -At ease, Captain.<eos> I'm glad to see you made it, sir.<eos> Must have been pretty rough.<eos> It was.<eos> Hello, Frank.<eos> Corinna.<eos> I'll see you to your quarters, sir.<eos> I brought the Colonel back for you.
Not very far.<eos> I'd like to see it.<eos> Forward march!<eos> Hut, two, three, four!<eos> If one of them don't come back, you can be thanking yourself.<eos> Take the wagons to the fort as soon as they're loaded.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Benton will take the water detail back without you.<eos> I want to see Red Cloud's camp.<eos> You won't see anything that I haven't told you before.
Give me someone to help me remove the broken part.<eos> The jar is large.<eos> You, come here!<eos> Help him!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Back to work!<eos> Go unload it in the storeroom!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Is it true you received the glue formula in a dream.<eos> - And who appeared to you?
In front of the mirror.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you want to disrobe?<eos> - No need, it's silk and won't add to it.<eos> Adele, could you close the curtain?<eos> - Right away.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> The colonel has already seen my bed.<eos> - It's no big deal to me!<eos> Just think, my son Pietruccio, your pupil who loves you well, sleeps in the dining room!
Come on, Mrs. Panchita.<eos> You have it all, you don't know what it feels like.<eos> But us...<eos> Too bad, but if they sold your tongue in pieces...<eos> - What?<eos> - The whole city would be poisoned.<eos> Stop blurting those things out.<eos> - Come on, we're leaving.<eos> - Get on, get on.<eos> Mr. Prudencio asked you to wait.
- Why not?<eos> - Because it's free.<eos> Smells like communism to me.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> Communism.<eos> Me pay.<eos> Don't pay, miss.<eos> - Me pay.<eos> Okay, okay, then pay.<eos> What's the matter with you?
I make you a promise.<eos> We won't leave each other anymore.<eos> "Town Hall"<eos> Mentorsi Annamaria, born in Riva January 26, 1925, resident in Milan, Via Della Rosa, 23.<eos> Filed at Milan police headquarters... prostitute.<eos> Sit.<eos> Why don't you pack up and go back to Milan?<eos> I'm here with my daughter, she needs the sea air.<eos> You got money?<eos> - I'm on vacation, I told you.
You'll allow me to laugh after, right?<eos> - But yes!<eos> You may laugh.<eos> - I laugh. You laugh, yes!<eos> - OK, bye.<eos> You didn't come to stroll last night.<eos> - I didn't go out.<eos> I thought it better that way.<eos> Why?<eos> - After what I told you yesterday, I didn't feel like going down among so many lucky people.
And what must I do to be with my daughter?<eos> Want some advice?<eos> It's easy to give advice.<eos> - Well, take my arm.<eos> The world is made in a certain way, and it won't be us to change it.<eos> No one rebukes you for being who you are, but for not having been successful.<eos> Come on!<eos> Take my arm.<eos> Trust in my experience.<eos> My arm is the last chance left to you.
Is it finished?<eos> He's tickling me.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Me, sir.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Colette Brosset.<eos> 1.59m. Bare-feet.<eos> On high heels I'm more feminine.<eos> The stand-in.<eos> Who tickled you?
Tell the truth.<eos> That would be too easy.<eos> You're happy.<eos> It's obvious you're in love.<eos> Don't leave it too long!<eos> I'm sure Bianca is waiting.<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> Bye, Milena.<eos> - Goodbye!<eos> Besides, the smile suits you, believe me!
Why are you angry?<eos> Bianca and I don't see eye-to-eye.<eos> She can be so petty.<eos> I don't know...<eos> We fight over stupid things.<eos> Today, for example, we had a fight because I refused to read "The Hand of Death"!<eos> Sorry, but now you really sound like a kid!<eos> I'm a kid, am I?<eos> Advice?<eos> What advice could I give you?
I will.<eos> Now, you admit that you killed this man.<eos> Well, you say you did it in self-defense.<eos> Unfortunately, there were no witnesses so we've only your word for that.<eos> But I heard it all, inspector, over the telephone.<eos> What exactly did you hear, Mr. Wendice?<eos> Well, I heard a series of faint cries.<eos> Well, did you hear anything to indicate that a struggle was going on?<eos> What I did hear, inspector, is perfectly consistent with what my wife told me.<eos> So all you really know of the matter is what your wife told you, isn't it?
Then one of them lowered it toward my chest.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Can't you speak?<eos> Doctor Martin, I see you are quite well.<eos> You have recovered from your unfortunate accident.<eos> Who are you?<eos> A scientist, like yourself.<eos> Where do you come from?<eos> From a planet yet unknown to you. You know my name.
Here, in our machine, magnetically<eos> Propelled across the electron bridge we have created.<eos> You mean, you come and go, just like that without anyone<eos> Ever seeing you?<eos> Our ships have been sighted on numerous occasions By your people.<eos> And why haven't we been able to track one down?<eos> We have a warning system, similar To your primitive radar.<eos> Our machines are set to change course<eos> At the mere approach of a pursuing object.<eos> Let's say I do believe you.
How practical.<eos> It's the storm.<eos> There should be something even so.<eos> I'm going to take a nap, I'm tired.<eos> And a little old...<eos> A little, little old...<eos> The first time she visited me was in spring.<eos> She seemed nervous, but in a way that also made me nervous.<eos> Your symptoms don't seem particularly alarming, Mrs. Verin.<eos> But we'll examine you anyway, to be on the safe side.
Greta.<eos> Is there anything left from... the household money I gave you?<eos> About thirty marks, I think.<eos> Not enough.<eos> Would you mind lending me some money?<eos> I'll give it back to you Monday morning.<eos> Sure, Mrs. Wagner.<eos> I'll just go off and see what I have.<eos> Mr. Brudner.<eos> Could you give me back the money I gave you this morning?
I'll just stand at a side... and won't bother anyone.<eos> I'm going for a cigarette.<eos> You want me to bring you something?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I saw you and I came here.<eos> What do you want now?<eos> Just to say hello..<eos> By the way...<eos> What did Enrico tell you?
- Prosit.<eos> There it is.<eos> The song they were playing the night before I went away.<eos> David was right here, dancing it with somebody else.<eos> Tonight, I wanted it to be me.<eos> It's all in the family.<eos> How can we make sure that all the fragments have been removed?<eos> Simple.<eos> We will reconstruct the two champagne glasses.<eos> I cannot possibly be hurting you.
It's just a chance, but take it.<eos> A chance?<eos> Do you realize I'd be giving up everything I ever worked for?<eos> That's right. But it served its purpose.<eos> Listen to me, Esther a career is a curious thing.<eos> Talent isn't always enough.<eos> You need a sense of timing, an eye for seeing the turning point or recognizing the big chance when it comes along and grabbing it.<eos> A career can rest on a trifle.<eos> Like us sitting here tonight.<eos> Or it can turn on somebody's saying to you:
Hurry it up, fellows.<eos> I want to advise you that you're entitled to be represented by counsel to be confronted by the witnesses that testify against you to a public and speedy trial by the court or by a jury and the right to be admitted to bail.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> "William Gregory."<eos> "Plain drunk.<eos> Picked up at Fifth and Towne asleep in the gutter.<eos> "Fourteen similar offenses in the past six months."<eos> How do you plead?<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> I didn't ask you how you feel.
We're not staying in New York.<eos> We're booked for the holidays. The Columbia Inn, Pine Tree, Vermont.<eos> That sounds very Vermonty.<eos> Should be beautiful this time of year, all that snow.<eos> - Yeah, beautiful.<eos> - The fir trees, the clean pine air. Just what we need.<eos> Wonderful, could you come up for a couple of days?<eos> - Well, I don't know...<eos> - It would be awfully nice.<eos> If you're ever under a falling building, and somebody offers to pick you up and carry you to safety don't hesitate a moment, just spit in his eye.
- Is anything wrong?<eos> - No.<eos> - Pretty shoes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You always wear high heels?<eos> No. Not always.<eos> Sometimes toeshoes.<eos> Toeshoes.<eos> I'm afraid I've been awfully rude.<eos> I haven't told you how wonderful you were tonight.
- Hello, Mr. Hunter.<eos> - You must have the wrong apartment.<eos> No.<eos> I came to see you.<eos> May I come in a minute?<eos> Please.<eos> I was just about to slip into my bed of nails.<eos> I'm terribly sorry.<eos> That's all right.<eos> You couldn't have done it if I hadn't softened it up for you.
Tom had no reason to kill himself.<eos> The fact is, he did kill himself and that's positive.<eos> Can I have a brandy?<eos> She claims she saw your husband a few nights ago.<eos> Wednesday night.<eos> And there was nothing wrong with his health.<eos> What are you trying to say, Mr. Bannion?<eos> Just trying to check up on her story and find out why your husband took his life.<eos> Maybe I've been trying too hard to keep our dirty family linen... from being washed in public.<eos> I suppose that woman told you about their relationship?
Did he get any phone calls?<eos> All I know about Slim is that he's dead.<eos> Did he have a set spot to work, a place where he kept his tools?<eos> All the tools are mine.<eos> There's nothing here for you, mister.<eos> Nothing at all.<eos> Do you mind if I walk around the yard, talk to your men?<eos> I have to mind.<eos> When it comes to my bread and butter, I stay careful.<eos> It doesn't matter to you that Slim might have been mixed up in a murder?
Gordon is the Larry you asked about.<eos> Vince imported him from Chicago a few months ago.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Tomorrow I'll have another doctor look you over.<eos> I guess a scar isn't so bad, not if it's only on one side.<eos> I can always go through life sideways.<eos> Gordon lives at the Wilton Apartments.<eos> Is Mrs. Davenport at home?<eos> You've got the wrong apartment.<eos> I told you it was--
You were delighted. You were even happy when your husband blew his brains out.<eos> We were getting along very well until the soul-struggling began.<eos> You want to know something ridiculous?<eos> It was after his affair with Lucy Chapman... that he wanted to turn over a new leaf.<eos> Our city is being strangled by a gang of thieves... and you protect Lagana and Stone... for the sake of a soft, plush life.<eos> The coming years are going to be just fine, Mr. Bannion.<eos> There aren't going to be any coming years for you.<eos> None at all.<eos> I don't threaten easily.<eos> If anything happens to you, the evidence comes out.
You're not going to kill a corpse you dumb bastart!<eos> No, I'm gonna drop the monkey from the tree.<eos> So, these people will come to reclaim their rights or not?<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> I attack this land destroy property, steal all I can kill a bunch of monkeys and no one comes to complain.<eos> Where the hell are the people of this land?<eos> I don't know Captain.<eos> Captain, for the love of God!<eos> Don't cry Lady, I don't like seeing old women cry.<eos> Don't cry, I've told you.
Miss Lee, will you dance with me?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> If you hadn't asked me, I was going to ask you.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, by Jove!<eos> I say, will you excuse us?<eos> - Do you remember last night?<eos> - Very well.<eos> I mean when we were talking about the moon.<eos> It reminded you of a moon in Coney Island.
Now watch.<eos> I wondered how it was done.<eos> It's a method of my own.<eos> Crude but adequate.<eos> - Have you found a home for your museum?<eos> - This is it, the building upstairs.<eos> We'll continue to use the cellar as the workshop... it's an excellent location, and the building can be leased at the right price.<eos> I have some capital, but I need more.<eos> $30,000, at least.<eos> That's why I've asked you to come here.
I have some capital, but I need more.<eos> $30,000, at least.<eos> That's why I've asked you to come here.<eos> - I'll think it over.<eos> - Good.<eos> She is about right, now.<eos> Leon, drain out the surplus, and let her cool.<eos> Leon, open up number 27.<eos> Come this way, please.<eos> I told you that I intend to exhibit scenes of violence.
No.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> The police would remove the jewelry from the body, wouldn't they?<eos> Yet you were careful to show that both her ears had been pierced for them.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> If I missed a detail of that sort, Mr. Jarrod would be most displeased.<eos> He insists on reality.<eos> I can understand that.<eos> Just a moment, Leon.<eos> There's something in this box I think would interest you.
- Yes.<eos> Very well.<eos> You also met and spoke with Father Logan the morning after Villette's murder.<eos> You met and spoke to him immediately in front of Villette's house.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - May I ask the reason for that?<eos> I had an appointment with Monsieur Villette.<eos> - He was your lawyer?<eos> - No.<eos> Father Logan, knowing of the murder, stopped you from entering the house?
Why shouldn't she, Father?<eos> - What are you afraid of?<eos> - It isn't necessary.<eos> Don't answer.<eos> Madame Grandfort, are you trying to protect Father Logan?<eos> From what?<eos> He hasn't done anything.<eos> It would seem as if he had.<eos> Are you a human being, inspector?<eos> You think it's important for me to tell you why I was being blackmailed.
Then I am as alone as you are.<eos> - I'm not alone.<eos> - Oh, yes, you are.<eos> To kill you now would be a favor to you.<eos> You have no friends.<eos> What has happened to your friends, Father?<eos> They mob you.<eos> They call at you.<eos> It would be better if you were as guilty as I am.<eos> Then they would shoot you quickly and you mustn't suffer much.
Sam's a good man, he'II send some boys down to help us.<eos> He better send them pretty quick.<eos> Don't fret, bill. You can always run if things get too tough.<eos> You aren't planning on leaving, Jim?<eos> No, I guess not. Don't figure I couId run very good.<eos> I don't run good either, Jim.<eos> colonel Travis!<eos> colonel Travis!<eos> - Yes?<eos> There's a Mexican out there with a white flag. Wants to talk to you.
No miss, that's not good.<eos> You've gotta be more lively, think of something nice, your wedding, for example.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Much much livelier.<eos> This way. Good.<eos> - Do you like this job?<eos> - Well...<eos> - Hurry with the bill !<eos> - Yes.<eos> - This dress looks really good on you.
If her body became damaged, if she were to lose an arm or a leg, she could grow a new one.<eos> I expect Tarantella may survive for hundreds and hundreds of years.<eos> And what about males?<eos> Well unfortunately, in the insect world, the male is a puny, unimportant thing.<eos> You saw a few of the examples.<eos> The dwarfs. I think we're beginning to get some results.<eos> What is it?<eos> If we are successful, I shall have a super female spider with a thinking and reasoning brain, a creature that someday may control the world subject to my will.<eos> Are you convinced now, Doctor?<eos> I hope you appreciate this opportunity I'm giving you to become a colleague of mine.
A gift of Bersagliera.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Get out.<eos> - Has it come?<eos> - No, brother.<eos> - What about kids?<eos> - Arise and greet.<eos> On behalf of the Bersagliera.<eos> Ah, strawberries.<eos> Thank you. The sought for you, that 're as good as S. Antonio.
.. on boIshevism.<eos> Are you looking at my Iampshades?<eos> But, countess, you speaI italian perfectly!<eos> I've been in italy for so many years!<eos> italy... .. France... my father was a diplomat.<eos> Oh!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> Here.<eos> You were loking at my Iampshades?<eos> I'II show you.
I have never been in a similar situation<eos> Well here we are, the two of us<eos> Why hide it?<eos> Why not admit that...?<eos> Remember our meeting that day in Venice?<eos> All it took was a touch of our hands in the middle of all those people and we had something between us.<eos> Don't deny it.<eos> Can you deny it?<eos> Don't ruin everything.<eos> I told you I don't understand it. Leave it.
I know it.<eos> You are seeing him somewhere, aren't you?<eos> Tell me what you are thinking.<eos> Please, break up with him.<eos> Do you understand what I'm telling you?<eos> I came here because I couldn't sit by anymore.<eos> I don't want to see you again, so.<eos> I have to hear your words from you.<eos> You are pretty old-fashioned, aren't you?<eos> I told you I'd go back to Osaka tonight.
- Look, he's almost fine now,<eos> - Yes !<eos> - Thank the lady. - Thank you.<eos> - What do have I got to do with it ?<eos> (together) Tell her to thank all those who helped you !<eos> Lady, how about a glass of wine?<eos> It's good, genuine stuff.<eos> - I believe it.<eos> - Really. - Please have it, lady.<eos> If you wish, I'll introduce you to many of my good friends.
- How do you do.<eos> - Have a seat.<eos> - Did you have time to study her case ?<eos> - Yes, sure.<eos> On the newspapers somebody insinuated that... ..there was a relationship of sort between the lady and the boy. What a shame.<eos> I guess that after the boy spontaneously went to the police,... ..all of this thing just lost its monumentum.<eos> - (Doctor) Go on.<eos> - But there's another aspect.<eos> The social position of the lady and her family.<eos> As I told you earlier, after the death of her child, the lady...
You're to be complimented.<eos> Oh, Chris, perhaps Mr. Emery could join us for dinner tonight.<eos> Oh, but didn't you get my message, Max?<eos> Message?<eos> No.<eos> Yes. I left word I couldn't make it.<eos> - Well, you see, with Steve here, I thought...<eos> - Well, bring him along by all means.<eos> I'd like him to see my house.<eos> Oh, did Chris tell you that I own several of Neal's paintings?
I... I couldn't find your coat.<eos> Where did you put it?<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You promised to leave if I spoke to Mr. Armstrong.<eos> You can't break your promise.<eos> You can't.<eos> Why can't I?<eos> What's come over you?
Go on, ring it again.<eos> Hey, I hear someone-<eos> Be quiet if you don't want those kids to get hurt.<eos> Now you listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna let those kids in because they might go for help, but you better be quiet.<eos> For their sake as well as yours.<eos> You wouldn't harm them.<eos> They're only children.<eos> Please-<eos> Shut up and do as I tell you!
Boy, it sure is a nice tree!<eos> Our tree isn't even up yet.<eos> I made my present all by myself- bookends.<eos> Ooh, look at the pretty Christmas tree- she even decorated it with snow.<eos> I got her a writing set.<eos> Hey, look at this.<eos> What the heck is that?<eos> Why, it's a music box, silly.<eos> Hey, Mrs. Gordon!<eos> Mrs. Gordon, can't you come down and see what we brought you?
- You feeling all right?<eos> - Doc, I'll walk to the corner with you.<eos> - I'm late.<eos> - Bye, Daddy.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I wonder why Doc took his raincoat.<eos> It's a beautiful day.<eos> There isn't a cloud in sight.<eos> I've never seen such activity.<eos> What got into you?
- Of course.<eos> Never interfere between a husband and wife.<eos> It's the best rule I ever heard of.<eos> You mean she's married to him?<eos> - To that man?<eos> - Very much married.<eos> Outside, please.<eos> No one is allowed in the theatre during rehearsal.<eos> That's another very good rule.<eos> How much do we owe you for the shoes, my boy?
I don't know quite why.<eos> It's very strange.<eos> Even when we rehearsed it, I felt something sad and tender.<eos> - I don't know why.<eos> - I know why.<eos> You do?<eos> Tell me.<eos> - I think it was your answer.<eos> - My answer?<eos> I let my heart speak to you with the story, and last night, you answered me with yours.
Won't I recognize him?<eos> Oh no.<eos> He's grown a beard. Musicians do.<eos> He'll tell you he's composed a ballet for you.<eos> And you'll realize who he is, you'll tell him who you are and how you met, and how you waited on him. And gave him extra music sheets.<eos> And that night you'll dine together on a balcony overlooking the Thames.<eos> It'll be summer.<eos> And you'll be wearing pink mousseline. And he'll be conscious of its fragrance.<eos> And all London will be dreamy and beautiful.<eos> And in the elegant melancholy of twilight, as the candles flutter and make your eyes dance, he will tell you he loves you.
That's awful!<eos> I agree.<eos> It's carrying the war too far.<eos> However, there's the possibility of joining up here.<eos> Would you like to dance?<eos> I appeal to your patriotism. You can't refuse a soldier.<eos> Governor, I remember when you played Widow Twankey at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, in 1890...<eos> Go easy there laddie, go easy.<eos> Let's have a drink.<eos> Calvero, old boy, how's the world treating you?
Whitney, move out!<eos> Anderson: come on. Take cover.<eos> How many got it?<eos> Enough. How many of the old bunch?<eos> None.<eos> Come on. Come on, Doc. Give me some.<eos> I gave you some this morning. I've still got my head on, haven't I?<eos> Yeah, you got it, but you won't-- I want to run like crazy, and I'm still here. Give 'em to me.<eos> Don't worry about the apron strings, Doc.<eos> I told you I'm not going home.
This is important, Lieutenant.<eos> Dickerman, tell the colonel we stumbled onto something.<eos> One of the Nip privates is a major. Hurry it up.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What did you find out?<eos> The old man told me that Matsuoda lived with him and his son a year ago on their plantation.<eos> He treated them well, but after a while he moved them out, and the army built a tunnel from the house for wolf-tails.<eos> What are wolf-tails?<eos> Rockets.<eos> Lieutenant, don't you remember what I said to you in the cave about grooved wheels?
And so?<eos> So?<eos> Well, carry on.<eos> What else can I say?<eos> A bad night.<eos> At 3... 00 a.m., I took my lantern and went to the church.<eos> I never endeavored to pray so much.<eos> At first quietly, calmly, then with an almost desperate will that made my heart tremble.<eos> This morning I received a letter written on cheap paper, unsigned.<eos> "A well-wisher advises you to seek a transfer to another parish.
It digests only bread, fruit, wine.<eos> In your state, I fear wine may do more harm than good.<eos> The illusion of health is not health.<eos> Father, there probably aren't two things we agree on about how to run a parish, but this is your parish to run as you see fit.<eos> One has only to hear you.<eos> I needn't know what happened between you and the late countess, but I wish to cut short some foolish and dangerous talk.<eos> My nephew is moving heaven and earth.<eos> The bishop, a simple man, takes him seriously.<eos> Sum up in a line or two your conversation of the other day.<eos> I'm not asking you to be inaccurate, still less to reveal anything confided to you as a priest.
No, I tell you, not for him<eos> Who hasn't had one?<eos> Misfortune has descended on this house.<eos> Mademoiselle Mathilde is in love<eos> The shaveling; she prevented him from drinking<eos> You're not to touch Janou<eos> How can he be saved if we kill all the others?<eos> You know it's all or nothing.<eos> Then tonight it's going to be nothing<eos> What did I tell you?
Here we go again! Every time I open the window, you're there<eos> Get out of the way, please!<eos> He's got no shame. And he's so young<eos> This is crazy.<eos> They come right into your own house!<eos> Yes, in your own house.<eos> Gosh, I'm lisping too now<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Are you ready, Maria?<eos> Don't mess up your hair when you put the dress on, or I'll smack you!
- Right<eos> - Is she jealous? - Yes<eos> Of me?<eos> Find a better one<eos> A pretty girl like her. What am I compared to her?<eos> - Come on<eos> - Well...<eos> Do you think a girl can't be jealous of you?<eos> I'm not saying that, but...<eos> - Has your husband ever told you...
Shut up, I said!<eos> Leo Minosa didn't die.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> Is that the best you can think of?<eos> Stop it, Tatum.<eos> You're wasting your breath.<eos> Now let me tell you the story behind the story.<eos> You got drunk yesterday, you were drunk all night, and you're still drunk!<eos> All right, I'm crazy!<eos> But it's only because I took a chance on you!
In Egypt that would be enough.<eos> There, the pharaoh has certain rights he can command but I...<eos> Even if I had the right I've never used my power to take anything by force.<eos> All that I have ever had has been given to me.<eos> Freely, without restraint.<eos> I refused the throne until every elder of every tribe would come to me and beg me to take it.<eos> It's been a kind of pride.<eos> My pride.<eos> Never to force myself on anyone.<eos> So I said nothing to you.
I'm getting an appraisal on that diamond.<eos> Can we lunch together?<eos> Can I talk to you later?<eos> Oh, that'll be fine.<eos> I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school.<eos> Yes?<eos> I'd like to know what he told you last night.<eos> I really didn't pay much attention.<eos> Bobby has such an active imagination.<eos> Did you believe what he told you?
And what does he expect me to do?<eos> Plead guilty to you?<eos> Well, naturally, not that, of course.<eos> I know what he wants.<eos> He wants me to keep my mouth shut.<eos> He doesn't want me to tell what happened where it can be heard.<eos> Well, you may tell him for me that's very thoughtful of him... but that I'm quite capable of taking care of my own name and reputation in my own way... which will be in a proper court of law.<eos> But to what end, sir?<eos> The verdict is already indicated.<eos> He told you to tell me that too?
- You come up with it.<eos> - l'm supposed to pay;<eos> - Search me. I don't have money.<eos> Why do you even call a taxi if you're broke;<eos> You by car and me by foot; Do I look like an idiot;<eos> Alright, he's got no money.<eos> Will you give it to me;<eos> - You need to claim it at the trial..<eos> - What claim, what trial;!<eos> Don't insist. lf the authority here told you to make a claim..
But why don't you do it yourself? You can see her any time<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I have good reason not to<eos> I don't want anyone else to see it<eos> Mother's in the parlour<eos> Mr Kameda, let's go upstairs<eos> He asked me to give this to you<eos> I am inclined to be somewhat outspoken<eos> Don't be offended, but I cannot abide dishonesty<eos> We've been like relatives so I'll speak to you like a mother
Just, how do you expect to cope with this situation, Inspector?<eos> Well, from what I've been told, I see only one way.<eos> A detachment of the military.<eos> That creature won't be taken.<eos> He'll fight and all those people he's captured will die with him.<eos> Besides, how will you get the soldiers here?<eos> The telephone's out. Our plane has a wireless.<eos> There just might be another way.<eos> oh? what's that?<eos> It's now 9:30. I'll give you until eleven o' clock to try what you can.
Good luck.<eos> - Look out for yourself.<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> Professor Elliot.<eos> Professor Elliot, this is John. John Lawrence.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I hear you.<eos> Where's Enid?<eos> - Where's Enid?<eos> What did Mears tell you when he came back to the Brock?
Why choose me, since you were the indirect victim of the crime that's been committed?<eos> The assassin is known, she's behind bars, she can't deny her crime, this crime touches you, you are better than an innocent man.<eos> I choose as a lawyer the known defender of the guilty.<eos> - - Yes, why?<eos> Because I hate that little creature who killed my stepbrother.<eos> And because, since it's a civil action, I could fear only one thing:<eos> that she'd have you as a lawyer.<eos> Whereas, in becoming the adversary of the one who will defend her, you will put me at ease.<eos> In that case I am sure of her condemnation.<eos> That's exactly why I'm going to ask you to let me have Forty-eight hours to think about it.
Yes, naturally.<eos> So, the idea of the knife, you're the one who had it.<eos> What you're saying is absurd.<eos> No... It's just that I'm expressing it badly.<eos> Would it have been better if I had killed her differently?<eos> But of course not.<eos> Anyway, what's done is done.<eos> All right.<eos> Then I was right to do it that way.<eos> I already told you, yes.
Excuse me, Mr. Prosecutor, I'm not the one who acquits them.<eos> I don't hold your acquittals against you...<eos> Permit me to say I'm glad to hear it.<eos> I don't hold anything against you, except perhaps the rather sharp tone of your response.<eos> We are not in court here, Mr. Aubanal, and I happen to be in your house.<eos> Please forgive me. -<eos> - I do so gladly, Out of esteem for your talent.<eos> But... Maybe I haven't made myself clear.<eos> When I say that your arguments might disturb people's conscience, I'm not talking about the conscience of judges or juries But of that of countless eventual murderers who follow debates, who read newspapers, and who carry you in their hearts.<eos> It's not the magistrate who's talking to you here, it's the man, it's the friend, who wonders if your exceptional and at times very singular eloquence might not be of such a kind, I repeat, as to encourage crime.
I don't see what importance it has that I killed her on Thursday instead of Wednesday.<eos> But why did you come to see me before you killed her?<eos> For two reasons.<eos> First to find out if I would have you as a lawyer, and also so that you'd tell me how I should go about it.<eos> No one could have advised me better than you.<eos> The proof is that I followed all your instructions.<eos> The knife on the table, the soup tureen at the head, the jealousy scene before, everything was done. I'll even say, scrupulously.<eos> Scrupulously?<eos> I didn't want you to blame me for anything afterward.<eos> If I hadn't lied, if I'd said to you:
Sure, I know I'm going to be shot, but not for running guns.<eos> But because I'm something special. I made a monkey out of you.<eos> I'm the guy that ran off with your girl!<eos> Don't you realise if I wanted you shot you'd be in a ditch right now?<eos> Do you know Emir Hassan?<eos> Yes, I guess I know him.<eos> Can you get to see him or any members of his staff?<eos> Can you reach any of his people?<eos> I think I can.<eos> If you can arrange a meeting for me with Emir Hassan I'll get you a pass that'll get you out of the city.
The men can wait outside until take off!<eos> - The guns are in my room.<eos> - That's out!<eos> We'll have to move people and animals as quietly as possible.<eos> - There's a girl...<eos> - Julie Cummings.<eos> Tell her there's been a mix-up.<eos> She and Eddie Garson are going.<eos> We'll gamble on less flying time over the new world.<eos> - Let me tell you...
That's right.<eos> - Go ahead, pal. Interview me.<eos> - Where were you born?<eos> Plainfield, New Jersey. 1907.<eos> I went to work when I was 12 years old.<eos> I been working ever since.<eos> My first job was a paper route.<eos> I bought a kid out with a swift kick.<eos> And you've been working ever since.<eos> Tell you how I'm top man in my racket.
He used to feed us and give us our bath and buy our clothes.<eos> Everything.<eos> All my life I used to think how someday I'd like to pay him back.<eos> It's funny how it worked out.<eos> Once I brought home $100 and gave it to him.<eos> You know what he did?<eos> Well, it sure didn't do the plumbing no good.<eos> I thought he'd hit me, but he didn't.<eos> His whole life, he never hit me once.<eos> How'd he happen to write you, after all this time?
You know Dad would want you to.<eos> Yes, go on.<eos> - But I hate to open anyone else's mail.<eos> - Oh, but this is different.<eos> - Yes, I suppose he wouldn't really mind.<eos> - Of course he wouldn't.<eos> Listen. "Dear Gilbreth...<eos> "the board of directors of the International Management Conference..." "have voted unanimously to extend to you an invitation..." "to speak at their forthcoming meeting in Prague."<eos> Oh, Mother.<eos> "At the same time, I am reliably informed... "a similar invitation will be extended to you... to address the World Power Conference in London. Bleneim."
You can have her, Marston.<eos> When I want her, she'll come running.<eos> Come, my soul.<eos> Has she ever called you that?<eos> Get out of here, both of you, before I throw you out.<eos> Will you be three for dinner?<eos> Or one?<eos> Get out!<eos> Are you going to bring this woman back under your roof?<eos> If you bring that woman here, I will be no mother to you!
For you?<eos> They're for my brother Elwood.<eos> He's devoted to ranunculus.<eos> Sure.<eos> Wouldn't you like to come in and pick some off the wallpaper?<eos> No thank you, these will do nicely.<eos> Good day.<eos> - Lady? Come, lady!<eos> Now really ...<eos> - There's a man inside wants to talk to you.
Why are you looking at me like that, Willy?<eos> He was a nice, polite man.<eos> He said his friend was a pooka, whatever that is.<eos> Give me Upper West R, quick!<eos> - Where did he go, Mrs. Chumley?<eos> He went downtown.<eos> - Dunphy, I left that Simmons dame soaking in 13.<eos> Do me a favour, turn off the juice.<eos> - So you gave him a pass?<eos> They neglected to tell you at school that a rabbit has large pointed ears.
Is there anything I can do for you?<eos> - Well, what did you have in mind?<eos> Mr. Dowd, what kind of man are you?<eos> Where do you come from?<eos> - Didn't I... give you one of my cards?<eos> And where on the face of this old earth did you find anything like him?<eos> You mean Harvey, the pooka?<eos> - Yes, it's true. The things you told me tonight. I know it now.<eos> Well, yes. Harvey has several interesting facets.<eos> Did I tell you about Mrs. Macklehenny?
I'd like to tell you that I honestly think things are going to be better for you.<eos> Stephen's bound to change when the baby comes.<eos> The baby? Stephen told me.<eos> Stephen told you that I was going to have a baby?<eos> But it's not true.<eos> I wish that it were.<eos> Now what on earth would make him want to tell you a thing like that?<eos> Maybe I misunderstood.<eos> Don't go protecting him again, John.<eos> You must know why he lied to you.
"Help, help, help, help!"<eos> Honey, I have neighbours!<eos> Channing won't swim after her because he thinks it's a trick.<eos> Alathea goes on screaming, and suddenly he realizes she's in danger.<eos> He swims out so fast he hardly even touches the water.<eos> But by the time he gets there, she's gone.<eos> She's joined her husband Lester in the sea.<eos> - It's a powerful story.<eos> - What you call an epic.<eos> What did I tell you?
I said I was tired.<eos> You're told the girl you were with last night was found murdered dumped from a moving car.<eos> What's your reaction?<eos> Shock, horror, sympathy?<eos> No, just petulance at being questioned a couple of feeble jokes.<eos> You puzzle me, Mr. Steele.<eos> The jokes could have been better, but I don't see why the rest worries you.<eos> Unless you plan to arrest me for lack of emotion.<eos> - What else did she say about her date?<eos> - No more than I've told you.
I'm calm.<eos> Indeed, very calm!<eos> You made it!<eos> - You made up your mind!<eos> There, you see?<eos> Those, you never stop them!<eos> Those who?<eos> - Well, never mind.<eos> Tell me how much, I got no time to lose!<eos> I told you to calm down.
- Move out.<eos> Well, he has a certain age...<eos> Run, run, run! - What's up?<eos> Come on, hurry!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Oh, forget it.<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Haven't you heard what I said?<eos> I don't care.<eos> - I told you he won't come back ...
Never saw such a sight.<eos> They say his head was bashed in.<eos> I heard they clocked him so hard his false teeth went across the room.<eos> I know I'm pretty silly, but I overheard two people on the street today talking about the murder.<eos> They went into a lot of detail.<eos> I felt so sick and giddy, I just had to come in and have a brandy.<eos> My father says I tend to overdramatize everything.<eos> I expect he's right.<eos> I know how you feel, though. I hate violence myself.<eos> Doesn't that make it rather difficult for you?
We got away as quickly as possible, and here we are.<eos> And that's the story of the short and stormy life of Doris Tinsdale.<eos> It is in many respects a sad one, but, one hopes not entirely without usefulness.<eos> The next thing is to wait for the arrival of Mr. Ordinary Smith with his posse to arrest the whole boiling lot of us.<eos> Well, you think I should give myself up, is that it?<eos> Yes, I should, shouldn't I?<eos> The longer I stay here, the worse it will be for you.<eos> But I won't give up.<eos> There must be a way to get at Charlotte.<eos> Now, I've made a nice hot toddy for you, Mr. Robinson.
What's all this about?<eos> Let's go someplace where nobody can hear us.<eos> Good night.<eos> - Have you gone mad or something?<eos> - No, madam.<eos> I want to tell you about the bloodstained doll.<eos> Well, what about that doll?<eos> Oh, I hate all this, madam. I'm that nervous.<eos> I'm so afraid of doing the wrong thing.<eos> You see, I have a dress that belongs to you with a big bloodstain down the front.
- Adam, you got a minute?<eos> Right now, chief.<eos> Cinch.<eos> A case of overwrought. Simple overwrought.<eos> I've noticed guys doing that sort of thing more and more.<eos> I've got a theory.<eos> You want to hear it?<eos> I think the human race is having a nervous breakdown.<eos> Which is why I am compelled... to return same to you for further revision.<eos> If this course seems to you... unnecessarily exacting... may I again remind you that unless we obtain... certiorari in the immediate future...
- No. I wish she did.<eos> Never mind the comment.<eos> Just answer the questions.<eos> What I'm doing now, all day.<eos> Now listen to this very carefully.<eos> - Did your wife ever threaten you?<eos> - Sure. Yeah.<eos> - When?<eos> - Every day.<eos> And what effect did this have upon you?
- At your service, Judge.<eos> - We'll see you in court.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - At your service.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Paolino, Sir.<eos> Welcome, Judge, God bless you!<eos> Come on up, I'll just open the door.<eos> Come, make yourself at home, I've prepared the room for you.
- What procedures?<eos> I mean, legal procedures that have been left hanging for years, like these ones.<eos> - Oh...<eos> - Good day, Judge.<eos> - Good day, Marshal.<eos> Can you tell me what you've been doing in this place up until now?<eos> There are cases that have been suspended for two... three years!<eos> You see, Judge, they are old affairs that nobody thinks of anymore.<eos> To take them out now, it would put you against the entire town.<eos> I am the only lawyer in the town and I can tell you that your predecessor was very wise not to antagonise the natives, their traditions...
- I see you're well-informed.<eos> - Yes, and it wasn't easy.<eos> Because, if I may be so forward as to point out, you didn't report the theft to the authorities.<eos> Well, for something of such little importance...<eos> A man was killed so that they could steal your mules!<eos> For this you will need to speak to the relatives of the victim.<eos> Yesterday another was killed out of revenge for the death of the first.<eos> - And I don't want to see a third.<eos> - Anyway...<eos> Hold on, I said that I came to speak with you about the mules.
- l'll take what cash you got.<eos> Write me a check for the rest.<eos> How do you know I won't stop it?<eos> I don't think you will.<eos> - What's the name?<eos> - Nick Garcos.<eos> My old man's Yanko Garcos.<eos> - You remember him.<eos> - Can't say that I do.<eos> He left a load of tomatoes on consignment with you.
The porter at Harry's place.<eos> He was cleaning the window at the time.<eos> And saw the accident?<eos> No, he didn't see the accident, but he saw three men carrying the body.<eos> Why wasn't he at the police inquiry?<eos> He doesn't want to get involved.<eos> You'll never teach these Austrians to be good citizens.<eos> It was his duty to give the evidence.<eos> Even so, he remembers wrong.<eos> What else did he tell you?
You got any reason?<eos> He had a big deal on.<eos> Fifty or sixty grand, he said.<eos> But something went wrong.<eos> I was with him when he got that stuff.<eos> He didn't think I knew what he was getting, but I did.<eos> Oh, I want to go home.<eos> Take her home, get her name, and find out where Fuller got that poison.<eos> Right.<eos> As for you, brother .. I'm going to let you off with a little friendly advice.
- If you want to.<eos> - I will be cautious.<eos> Among Mr. Flusky!<eos> Come here.<eos> Presenting the Charles Adare.<eos> Cousin of the governor.<eos> - Came to Sydney to fortune.<eos> -Yes?<eos> Very pleased.<eos> I told you that is not fortune as fleas in a blanket.
"Light of Freedom", it's our newspaper.<eos> Sakazaki is the chief editor.<eos> It doesn't pay much, but we'll supplement if needed.<eos> Do you want to try?<eos> Yes, thank you very much.<eos> I'd do anything...<eos> Sakazaki will teach you everything.<eos> He's an erudite.<eos> You could live here.<eos> Hayase would be near you.
Jonas Lauretz was murdered.<eos> How did you reach that conclusion, Magistrate?<eos> -That suspicion is not new.<eos> My predecessor harboured it, and not only he, but the whole village too.<eos> I found the record of an interrogation.<eos> By the way, thank you for taking the desk key into your possession.<eos> Thanks to you, the report didn't get into the wrong hands.<eos> I'm sure with you it's in the safest hands. No question.<eos> I am going to reopen the investigation my predecessor was unable to complete.<eos> And I ask you for your support.
I don't savvy the Indian part.<eos> Did you know Danning from some place else?<eos> That will teach you not to walk out on me, you yellow back.<eos> Mr Miles!<eos> Just the man I'm looking for, Sheriff.<eos> If it's about filing charges against Ernie, you won't get anywhere, you hit him first.<eos> I hit him last, Sheriff. - My friend, you're headed for trouble.<eos> You giving the folks around here no reason to love you.<eos> I'll do my best to protect you because it's my job.<eos> I appreciate that. - It's also my job to warn you that Frank Yordy is spreading stories that he's gunning for you.
Want something, Jack?<eos> Mr. Temple around?<eos> He ain't here.<eos> Hotel is closed.<eos> When will he be back?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Have a beer?<eos> - The bar is closed.<eos> - That's right.<eos> I told you, didn't I? Hotel's closed.
Yeah.<eos> Uh-huh. Thanks.<eos> Couple of things.<eos> One: medical examiner called in.<eos> - Dexter died between 1:00 and 2:00 a. m.<eos> - I see.<eos> And, uh, here... are a few interesting items on our friend inside.<eos> - Mr. Niles.<eos> - These things happen, Lieutenant.<eos> I told you I didn't know Ruth Morrison very well.
All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, Mr. Niles, I've been 38 years on the force.<eos> I've been a cop on the beat.<eos> I've been with the Safe and Loft Squad.<eos> I've been for 22 years with the Homicide Squad.<eos> But in a lifetime of interrogatin' and investigating'... you are probably the biggest and most willing liar I ever met.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm a liar. I'm a circus character altogether, but I didn't kill Jean Dexter!<eos> I told you where I was last night.
Any little kid asks him, Willie plays the, uh, whatchamacallit.<eos> I don't want I should make trouble for him.<eos> Don't worry, lady.<eos> Mister, you don't want your root beer?<eos> Lieutenant Muldoon, police department.<eos> - Is Dr. Stoneman in?<eos> - He's in the X-ray room.<eos> - Where's his office?<eos> - Straight ahead.<eos> I want you to do exactly as I tell you, miss.
- And I ain't a gentleman.<eos> I'm the detective there.<eos> - You remember me, don't you, Sir Alfred?<eos> - Yes, I think I've seen you skulking around.<eos> You're what's known as the house dick, aren't you?<eos> That's me.<eos> Can I see you alone a minute?<eos> I suppose so. I shan't enjoy it.<eos> Hot work.<eos> I'd like to make this alone, if it's all the same to you, buddy.
-That's far away, isn't it?<eos> -lt all depends.<eos> If you're in Arabia, which is where l'll be before going to Africa, you're pretty close.<eos> All right.<eos> But you're making a mistake.<eos> You can't run away from yourself. The trouble is you're in love with Margaret.<eos> -Don't be ridiculous.<eos> -Look at the facts.<eos> First-- Facts. I'm an artist. I deal in emotions. My emotions say get out of here.<eos> What do your emotions tell you? -Fine.
And you have been appointed to take charge of Saint Faith.<eos> - I, Reverend Mother?<eos> - You.<eos> You will be the youngest sister superior in our order.<eos> Thank you, Reverend Mother.<eos> The agent at Mopu is an Englishman.<eos> He seems a difficult man.<eos> You won't get much help from him.<eos> Dear Madam. My name is Dean.<eos> I am the agent of General Toda Rai at Mopu... and I am writing to you in that capacity.
They're like children.<eos> He told me he was going to order them to come.<eos> They don't know what an order is.<eos> - They should learn.<eos> - Why? We all need discipline.<eos> You said yourself they're like children.<eos> Without discipline, we should all behave like children.<eos> Don't you like children?<eos> Thank you, Sister Briony.<eos> Talking of medicine, Sister Briony, if you get a bad case - one that seems to you as though it might be dangerous or even serious - don't take it.
The way I see it, it's not feasible for you and Sam to keep on...<eos> Well, what I mean is Sam's married to a lovely little wife, and you're engaged to Mr. Grover.<eos> - Right, I am.<eos> - Don't get mad.<eos> I am getting mad.<eos> I resent people marching into something that doesn't concern them.<eos> You think it doesn't.<eos> It concerns me if it concerns Sam.<eos> Suppose you discuss it with Sam, then.<eos> I tried to tell you about him.
What were you doing near San Quentin?<eos> Painting in the hills.<eos> How did you know I'd be on that road?<eos> The radio said the truck was headed south.<eos> I figured you'd head for the county road.<eos> Then I passed the empty car with the door open, so I turned around and came back.<eos> And there I was.<eos> I'm supposed to believe that?<eos> All right, don't believe it.<eos> But I got you past the police.
- Yeah.<eos> I'm glad you provided a towel big enough to cover my embarrassment.<eos> It's decent enough.<eos> May I have the clipping?<eos> You had a caller.<eos> I told her to go away.<eos> That wasn't very bright.<eos> My friends will think that I...<eos> I know.<eos> I told you I should get out.
- I've known people like that.<eos> You know more than that.<eos> You know she was the woman who knocked at the door.<eos> The one who worked against you at the trial.<eos> It's dark enough. I'd better be going.<eos> But she didn't see you. She doesn't know I know you.<eos> Yeah, but she's the kind who always comes back, and back again.<eos> I'll go pack the rest of your clothes.<eos> You finish your smoke.<eos> Head down the hill. I'll tell you where to go from there.
Mind answering a few questions, sir?<eos> No, I've got plenty of time.<eos> - Where's your raincoat? - I'm absent-minded.<eos> - Uh-uh.<eos> Let's try it again.<eos> Where is it?<eos> - Okay, I haven't got any.<eos> - That's better.<eos> Why not?<eos> - I told you I was absent-minded.
- Portland.<eos> - Rains a lot in Portland.<eos> What're you doing here without a raincoat?<eos> I'm hiding.<eos> From what?<eos> My wife, my friends, my family, everybody.<eos> Come on now. It can't be as bad as all that.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll tell you what you do.<eos> Is that why you got the shakes?<eos> I told you, I couldn't sleep.
- Four.<eos> - A difficult point, Mr. Murdock.<eos> What man has done, Murdock can do.<eos> - Please, Rip, I'm 16,000 ahead.<eos> - Bother you?<eos> A solid winning every now and then is the best advertising for any casino.<eos> - Can't we have a nightcap?<eos> - It's your money.<eos> We'll have it in my office.<eos> If it's all the same to you, I'd like that pair for a souvenir.
What did the world look like when you first opened your eyes?<eos> Head like a balloon, huh?<eos> With what?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What kind of a taste do you have?<eos> Sour molasses?<eos> Maybe it was DDT.<eos> I don't know, I never drank any before.<eos> How's your stomach feel?<eos> Am I checking up on you?
Suddenly, Johnny came into the room.<eos> He'd followed us home from the club.<eos> He took the gun from Stuart, or was trying to but it seemed to go off right in my ear.<eos> I passed out and when I came to Johnny was kissing me.<eos> That was the last time I saw him until he came back, two days ago.<eos> I remember he said goodbye.<eos> I think he was crying.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, sure, I believe you but I still want that letter.
He will call out to Sanderson to give you the letter.<eos> Bring the letter here, with Mr. Murdock.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> As glass.<eos> Of course, there wasn't any letter.<eos> I was kicking on the first down and praying for a break.<eos> It didn't look like there was any coming up.<eos> Hold it, you two!<eos> You, Murdock.<eos> I've been chasing you for six blocks.
There was an Indian or something caught in a woman's drawing room or something.<eos> An Indian?<eos> Why, Oliver, how silly!<eos> What would an Indian be doing in New York?<eos> Now, if it were Oklahoma or Wyoming...<eos> I've got news for you.<eos> As a matter of fact, there's a very interesting story...<eos> George!<eos> I think we've got a lot of work to do and you see, while the light is still good<eos> And I'll show you to your room.
- Victoria.<eos> What is it?<eos> She's fainted.<eos> There.<eos> Stop it there.<eos> Well, it's...<eos> It's unbelievable, it's incredible.<eos> - lt's absolutely fantastic.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That little boy looks exactly like you.
He's a born salesman.<eos> I just feel it.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> We'll talk about it in the morning.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> And you'll find toys of all kinds at Macy's.<eos> -Gee, that sure is an elegant costume.<eos> -Yes. I've had it for years and years.<eos> Sure makes a bum out of the one they gave you.
Mr. Sawyer!<eos> He's unconscious.<eos> Get a wet towel.<eos> -No, better get a doctor.<eos> -Mr.<eos> Sawyer?<eos> You must've done something to him.<eos> I tell you, we were merely talking.<eos> But when I mentioned Santa Claus, his delusion, he became violent.<eos> I told you he had latent maniacal tendencies.
-Your employee?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Is he truthful?<eos> Yes.<eos> -Do you believe he's of sound mind?<eos> Mr. Macy, you're under oath.<eos> Do you really believe he's Santa Claus?<eos> Well, I...<eos> He gives every indica...<eos> I asked you, do you really believe that this man is Santa Claus?
- Do you want to go into another room?<eos> - It's not necessary.<eos> Just give me a couple of minutes here.<eos> Now, my dear, let's not waste words.<eos> You don't have to tell me the police are making a terrible mistake.<eos> We mustn't despair. Above all things, we mustn't despair.<eos> - You're not despairing, are you?<eos> - No, Sir Simon.<eos> Now, let me see.<eos> They'll read the charge over to you and then ask you whether you've anything to say.
I put it you, Latour, that your story is a pack of lies.<eos> Do you persist in it?<eos> If she says the contrary, she'd better...<eos> What was that you started to say?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> I stick to what I said.<eos> If you don't mind, Latour, I should like to go over that night with you again, in case any small incidents have slipped your memory.<eos> After the butler Lakin took the Colonel his dinner, where were you?<eos> In my room.<eos> Did he tell you about putting the glass of burgundy at the Colonel's bedside?
That jail doesn't look like 125 Prospect Terrace.<eos> She's probably going to tip Brant off to her father's story.<eos> Your father started threatening me and I took the gun away from him.<eos> - What did you do with it?<eos> - I put it on a cabinet in my office.<eos> Never saw it again.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> - You'll have to step on it.<eos> - I told you, this is against the rules.
- Yes, Mr. Amboy.<eos> Table two, Mr. Amboy.<eos> Henry, table two.<eos> This way, please.<eos> - Good evening, Mrs. Amboy.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> How did you enjoy your trip to Poughkeepsie?<eos> I loaned Fran Page the dough to send Hollis up there.<eos> He's okay now, so I'm here to collect.<eos> Someday I'm going to take lessons from you on how to get blood out of a stone.
Have a drink with us when you finish dancing.<eos> We're finished.<eos> Waiter.<eos> - It's a wonderful opening.<eos> - Yes, isn't it?<eos> Think Hollis will ever be able to take Drake's place?<eos> Nobody will ever be able to take Tommy Drake's place.<eos> Yes, I know how you folks feel about him.<eos> After all, it was you who cleared up his debt, wasn't it?<eos> I told you I didn't let him have the money.
Wait a minute.<eos> I just redeemed the necklace in the powder room.<eos> - What?<eos> - I gave it to Amboy that night.<eos> I didn't want anything to happen to Tommy Drake.<eos> And I nearly threw a $100,000 tour in that guy's lap.<eos> That tour would have meant a lot of money to you, too, wouldn't it?<eos> Of course, but...<eos> But you wouldn't advance him the $12,000... even though you knew Amboy was preparing a cement kimono for him?<eos> I told you he was a bad risk.
I've no reasons for not answering it, milord.<eos> My wife did learn about it for the first time during the quarrel.<eos> Do you think she would have married you, if she had known of it sooner?<eos> I am certain she would.<eos> And yet on the occasion she learned of it, according to your own story, she flung something at your head and cut it open.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Now, let us return to this...<eos> this writing on the program:<eos> "Alas, the love of women", what does that convey to you?
But in the park, in those days the rough young fellas used to be staging hold-ups and the like.<eos> Help! Help!<eos> However, these young fellas were not professionals.<eos> And that's maybe the reason why I start out in this story a little bit like a hero, which I most certainly am not.<eos> The cab driver was waking up.<eos> He was okay.<eos> So I borrowed his carriage to drive the lady home.<eos> In a short while, she recovered herself and brightened up, what with the things I told her to get her mind off the scare she'd had and to set her thinking as well, of the brave fella that had rescued her.<eos> Rosalie, fair Rosalie.<eos> -A name I'm after calling you.
That's where I'm going to be, fella, on that smallest island.<eos> I'll mail the rest to you after the murder.<eos> I want to live on that island in peace.<eos> That won't be possible unless the world is satisfied I don't exist.<eos> You know, the law is a funny thing, fella.<eos> The State of California will say I'm dead, officially dead if somebody'll say they murdered me.<eos> That's what I'm paying you for.<eos> -To murder you?<eos> -To say you did.<eos> Well, what happens to you really?
-He couldn't get a divorce.<eos> -What?<eos> He wanted people to think he was dead so he could get away from his wife.<eos> -Wife?<eos> But that's impossible.<eos> -Why?<eos> George didn't have a wife.<eos> He wasn't married.<eos> And because of that, you can be fairly certain of the month.<eos> Mrs. Bannister, I saved a seat for you.
-I object!<eos> -Does the counsel deny that--<eos> Overruled.<eos> Does counsel deny that the butler Broome was the detective Broome used by him in divorce cases?<eos> Mrs. Bannister, can you think of any reason why your husband would want to hire a divorce detective other than to watch you?<eos> -I object!<eos> -Objection sustained.<eos> Didn't you and your husband have an argument about your showing an infatuation for O'Hara?<eos> We did not.<eos> Isn't it a fact that the defendant, O'Hara, made advances to you?
-Does the counsel deny that--<eos> Overruled.<eos> Does counsel deny that the butler Broome was the detective Broome used by him in divorce cases?<eos> Mrs. Bannister, can you think of any reason why your husband would want to hire a divorce detective other than to watch you?<eos> -I object!<eos> -Objection sustained.<eos> Didn't you and your husband have an argument about your showing an infatuation for O'Hara?<eos> We did not.<eos> Isn't it a fact that the defendant, O'Hara, made advances to you?<eos> And told you he was infatuated with you?
Want to know anything?<eos> I just want to get rid of him.<eos> Might cost you a little.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> I enjoyed your drink as much as you did, sir.<eos> - You'll hear from me.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> Mr. Marlowe, Mrs. Rutledge would like to see you before you leave.<eos> About the money, the general has instructed me to give you a check for whatever you require.<eos> Instructed you how?
You got a touch of class, but I don't know how far you can go.<eos> A lot depends on who's in the saddle.<eos> Go ahead, Marlowe, I like the way you work.<eos> In case you don't know it, you're doing all right.<eos> There's one thing I can't figure out.<eos> What makes me run?<eos> I'll give you a little hint.<eos> Sugar won't work. It's been tried.<eos> What did you try it on me for?<eos> Who told you to sugar me off this case?
You say "ma'am" to me, and "sir" to Mr Syrette.<eos> And "Her Ladyship" to Her Ladyship.<eos> You will perhaps never see Her Ladyship or Sir Henry.<eos> But if by chance you should find yourself in the same room with them, you will not be in the room.<eos> You will see and not see.<eos> You will hear and not hear.<eos> And should Her Ladyship happen to address you, which I very much doubt...<eos> But if she should, you will answer "Yes, milady," or "No, milady,"<eos> depending on the circumstances.<eos> However, these things will come to you more easily when you've put on your uniform.
The glass of beer I was going to offer you seems awfully flat beside all those bottles and phials, filled with magic.<eos> Well, have a good time, my dear.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Goodbye, Mr Belinski.<eos> - Goodbye, Cluny.<eos> Uh, no, let us repeat it once again, Mrs Watkins.<eos> Tilt Master Richard's head back and squeeze one drop of the astringent into each nostril three times a day.<eos> Miss Brown.<eos> You're sure his nose will stop running, Mr Wilson?<eos> Mrs Watkins, it may interest you to know that after the use of one bottle of my nasal bath, the Marquis of Barrocamir, a distinguished speaker, was for the first time clearly understood when he addressed the House of Lords last week.
- It's ordered. Ginger cookies.<eos> - Good.<eos> Who's winning? - June's good.<eos> But he's winning.<eos> Sit down, everybody.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I've told Peter. - What?<eos> Who you are, what you are, all about you.<eos> - Tall order.<eos> - And I've told you all about him.
- Is that to go? - Sure.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> I'm leaving soon anyway.<eos> Where're you going?<eos> Walking.<eos> The streets are so empty.<eos> - You never think about work?<eos> - Sometimes I do bother to consider it.<eos> - And that satisfies you?
Doctor...<eos> What do I owe to you for all your help?<eos> How can I ever show my thanks?<eos> Thank me?<eos> Thank fate if you want, or chance. Or God.<eos> Whoever you like. But don't thank me.<eos> - Goodbye for now.<eos> - Doctor, listen... I am just so... More thanks?<eos> No, I'm so glad.<eos> I'll let you in on a secret.
Oh, I'm sure you'll be interested.<eos> Lieutenant Delbar, Governor General Galoux.<eos> I'm honored, sir.<eos> A pleasure to see you again.<eos> - You're on active duty, lieutenant?<eos> - I'm on reserve, sir.<eos> I wear the uniform.<eos> I've no other clothes.<eos> You have something to tell us about the Rolazoides affair?<eos> Doesn't this confirm the theory I spoke to you about last time?
Merry Christmas, Mr. de Cordova.<eos> Ms. Méndez!<eos> Could you be so kind?<eos> Go to the apartment of Mr. Domínguez and attend to him.<eos> -Could you be see kind as to let me go?<eos> -What?<eos> Pay me what you owe me.<eos> I no longer work here.<eos> How's this?<eos> What's gotten into you?
Good day, doctor.<eos> How are you feeling today?<eos> Just fine, doctor, just fine.<eos> That's a lovely thing you're knitting there.<eos> It's a shawl for one of my friends.<eos> Everyone here treating you well?<eos> Oh, yes, they're very nice to me.<eos> Dr. Stephens hasn't tried to kill me with that needle for a long while now.<eos> Neither has Miss Hatfield.<eos> Haven't I told you many times, Mrs. Penny, that no one here is trying to kill you?
We don't need the police, Mrs. Stewart. You come along with me and...<eos> You don't understand.<eos> There's nothing the matter with me.<eos> I want the police.<eos> That doctor's a murderer.<eos> You go back to bed and we'll call them...<eos> Don't talk to me as if I were crazy.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> Orderly!<eos> Come along, Mrs. Stewart, no one's going to hurt you.
- That's right.<eos> - Oh, that's too bad.<eos> - You know where he can be reached?<eos> - If we did, lady... maybe we'd reach for him.<eos> No, he dropped out of sight quite a while ago.<eos> We did a lot of lookin', but since it was impossible to believe... that he was any smarter than us, we decided he'd been bumped off.<eos> Now, if you'd have asked me that two days ago, I'd have guaranteed that.<eos> What happened since two days ago to change it?<eos> Yesterday an ex-soldier, named George Taylor... showed up at a bank with a letter from Cravat.<eos> That's why I asked you whether your pal was dead.
He doesn't know me.<eos> You're not afraid of him, are you?<eos> -I'm sure he loves policemen.<eos> -I'm not in uniform.<eos> All right, Carleton, go away.<eos> -Well, good night.<eos> -Good night.<eos> Anything wrong, Albert?<eos> Professor?<eos> I just stopped by to tell them the same thing I told you in town today, Oates.
Come along, Carleton.<eos> Evening, Helen.<eos> Helen, I want to talk to you a moment.<eos> Now, Helen, I don't want to frighten you but because of what happened in town we have to be especially careful for the next few days.<eos> If you should see anything outside of this house, or even in it that makes you suspicious, I want you to let me know.<eos> See that someone else does your outside work.<eos> You stay in the house.<eos> And don't hesitate to come to me at any hour if you need help.<eos> Now you may go up to my stepmother, if you wish.<eos> Helen remember what I told you.
Oates can pick up my other things tomorrow.<eos> My suitcase is in the basement.<eos> I'll only be a few minutes.<eos> This is the second time I've closed that window tonight.<eos> I definitely know I did.<eos> Now, if only I knew who opened it.<eos> You're not that clever, and if you were....<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> You scared the life out of me.<eos> I told you not to touch me.
- I heard. Well?<eos> You forget I am no longer a child. I'm a married woman.<eos> Well, you ain't been married very long.<eos> Wait, Mrs Rankin.<eos> - What is it?<eos> I'm in a hurry.<eos> - No need to go biting my head off:<eos> - What is it, Sara? - Well, I...<eos> - If you've got something to say, say it.<eos> - I don't know what's got into you.
He's not at his office.He must have leaved and i didn't notice.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> When i walk holding up my hands, i always expect to touch yours.<eos> - They're so beautiful.<eos> - Don't say that, Gertrude.<eos> Lord gave me these hands to bless.<eos> Leave it to me.<eos> Here's your wife.<eos> I like your wedding ring.<eos> If you were single, i wouldn't say all that to you.
And who's he?<eos> He's my boss.<eos> Oh, hello, Mr. Baldwin.<eos> - Hello. - Look what you've done.<eos> How did this happen? How could this happen? I don't know, all I did was tell them I was Christopher Madden.<eos> But I didn't do anything.<eos> You hear what she said?<eos> She didn't do anything. She's sharing headlines with MacArthur, Stalin.<eos> She didn't do anything.<eos> These people bothering you? - This the flyer you wired me about?
Ah, what an honest man! And what fine behaviour!<eos> You'll see he's done nothing wrong. Nothing wrong?<eos> He knowingly cheated me.<eos> I'd never have expected this of Giovannino. That's what comes of trusting those who pretend they're honest.<eos> My dear Commendatore my husband is honest to the core.<eos> He didn't come to S. Silvesto.<eos> There's no strike. He's sneaked off somewhere with the truck, hasn't he?<eos> -What can I tell you? -There he is, Daddy.<eos> Ah, the honest man is back! What do you have to say to me?<eos> You can either believe me or not, but you can't deny that yesterday on the phone I asked you if you'd explained everything to Gaetano. You said you had, so I left for Naple without a care.
I promise.<eos> "I'm not the courageous type.<eos> I'm writing to tell you what I'd never dare say in person.<eos> And yet -"<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Answer me!<eos> I'm sure she's up to something foolish.<eos> She hasn't been the same since yesterday.<eos> I told you to watch her.
Just remember that Quinton isn't just the prosecutor.<eos> You may rest assured he'll have his brass knuckles on.<eos> He'll throw the whole book at you.<eos> He'll ask you some questions that won't be easy to answer... one in particular.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.<eos> Your name?<eos> Richard Harland.<eos> Your profession?<eos> If you don't mind, Mr. Harland, I shall ask you, for a moment, to be a reader.
Yes.<eos> Yes, I am in love with him.<eos> I think I've always loved him.<eos> The State recalls Richard Harland to the stand.<eos> That's all.<eos> Get some water, please!<eos> Order in the court!<eos> Richard Harland, you heard that woman finally tell the truth, and now I want the truth out of you.<eos> You heard Ruth Berent confess her love for you.<eos> And now I ask you, as I have asked you over and over, time and again... are you in love with her?
- You couldn't have waited so long.<eos> - Since the first aria of the first act.<eos> Do you always drop in just for the overture?<eos> just a minute.<eos> My umbrella, if you don't mind.<eos> - Catch.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> I'm terribly sorry.<eos> You're the rudest person I've ever seen.<eos> What's the matter with you?
It's a block and a half away.<eos> - This isn't Sunday, is it?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - I asked, "Is this Sunday?"<eos> - No.<eos> Saturday.<eos> Why? But it's closed.<eos> Nothing else is closed.<eos> Somebody passed away, most likely.<eos> - What's the matter with you?
Goodbye.<eos> He's sweating blood already.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> And, remember, let me do all the talking.<eos> Wally, you're wonderful!<eos> This is all business, remember?<eos> Yep!<eos> This is it.<eos> Will you wait here, please?<eos> Mr. Beragon, I talked to you on the phone.
The proprietor who threatened Edwardes' life in the 21 Club dropped a revolver in the snow in Gabriel Valley after shooting Dr. Edwardes in the back.<eos> The weapon is still there at the foot of a tree with the murderer's fingerprints on it.<eos> I can't agree with this part of your interpretation, for the good reason that the weapon is now in my hand.<eos> I imagined something of this sort would happen when I made the slip tonight about knowing Edwardes.<eos> That started your agile, young mind going.<eos> You were having a breakdown. In a state of panic, you heard that Edwardes was to take your place here.<eos> So you sought him out in his favorite restaurant, where he was lunching with John Ballyntine.<eos> You accused him of stealing your job.<eos> You threatened to kill him.<eos> He calmed you down, told you he was off on a skiing vacation.
Again?<eos> She's leaving. She won't even come to our wedding.<eos> She's just talking.<eos> No, she's really going. She's packing.<eos> She'll change her mind.<eos> I'm so tired!<eos> Come.<eos> Manfredi's there.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> I'd rather be alone with you a while.
No, no. I....<eos> Goodbye, Ambassado.<eos> I've enjoyed this little talk vey much.<eos> Anytime you'e in Washington, dop in to see me at the White House.<eos> -Those papes.<eos> -Go away. Papes!<eos> -I'll commit him to any place.<eos> -You will?<eos> I've just been appointed Ambassado to Bolivia!<eos> You see? Didn't I tell you?
Perhaps Signor Guardi will make you into a great singer, as she was.<eos> Wouldn't you like that?<eos> You must think of the future, dear, not the past.<eos> No.<eos> Now, look. Wait a moment, signorina.<eos> There's no use.<eos> Paula, you are not concentrating.<eos> Your mind's not on your singing.<eos> All these years you've worked so hard.<eos> Now what's come over you?
- Has anyone seen Petterson?<eos> - He's still in the classroom, sir.<eos> There you are, Petterson.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Come here.<eos> Petterson, Petterson.<eos> It's not easy to be form master when something like this happens.<eos> Why were you truant, Petterson?<eos> What possessed you?
But I'm just an old fool.<eos> Oh?<eos> I see now that you don't care one iota about them.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, do you care about them?<eos> A teacher must care about his boys.<eos> Or else what does he care about in life?<eos> I don't wish to be cross-examined!<eos> Who took map No. 40?<eos> I wish to make it clear to you that you are unsuited to be a teacher!
Will do.<eos> You may go, sir.<eos> Quite a relief, isn't it?<eos> I'm so sorry we had to do this to you.<eos> Good-bye, sir.<eos> Good-bye, Officer.<eos> Would you wait outside, please.<eos> Show Widgren in.<eos> Well, this is a sorry business, Widgren.<eos> The Latin teacher has made a number of serious charges against you.
My name is Laura Hunt, and I'm with Bullitt and Company.<eos> You know, the big advertising firm.<eos> And I'd like to talk something over with you, if I may.<eos> You can hardly fail to realize that I am engaged in eating my lunch.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I'm awfully sorry to interrupt this way but it's so hard to get to see you the regular way, and this will only take a minute, really.<eos> - Now, this is...<eos> - Young woman, either you have been raised in some incredibly rustic community where good manners are unknown or you suffer from the common feminine delusion that the mere fact of being a woman exempts you from the rules of civilized conduct.<eos> Or possibly both.<eos> Possibly, but here's what I wanted to show you.
- Why?<eos> Yours are the best in the bunch.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> But I didn't write them to you.<eos> Haven't you any sense of privacy?<eos> Murder victims have no claim to privacy.<eos> Have detectives who buy portraits of murder victims a claim to privacy?<eos> Lancaster Corey told me that you've already put in a bid for it.<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> McPherson, did it ever strike you that you're acting very strangely?
Really.<eos> I'd better be going.<eos> I'll see you in the morning, Miss Hunt.<eos> I must ask you not to leave the house or use the phone.<eos> But...<eos> But I've got to let my friends know I'm alive.<eos> Sorry, Miss Hunt, but I must insist you do as I say.<eos> - Am I under arrest?<eos> - No.<eos> But if anything should happen to you this time, I wouldn't like it.
I know now how foolish and hopeless it was, but there was only one thing on my mind, the safety of a person whose life was dearer to me than my own.<eos> Don't you understand that?<eos> Did you think Laura had done it?<eos> - Did you?<eos> - I don't remember what I thought.<eos> - Do you think so now?<eos> - No.<eos> - But you didn't?<eos> - No.<eos> On Saturday, when our men went to the hotel to tell you that Laura was dead,
Go ahead. It's a good alibi.<eos> But get away from London.<eos> Well, I've never said "thank you" this way before.<eos> Mothers of the Free Nations.<eos> Mr. Neale?<eos> This is Carla Hilfe.<eos> Is your brother there? No.<eos> There's a fête at Bloomsbury.<eos> He wanted to see if there was anything... anything like Lembridge.<eos> - He told you what happened?
From what you say about the Ministry... Willi and I are only a half turn behind you.<eos> We'll get out of it, all right... even if I have to drown some of these Free Mothers first.<eos> - You wouldn't object? - No.<eos> Someday, when I get back to that quiet life, I... I want to ask you if you'd be interested in it too.<eos> Willi asked me if I was falling in love with you.<eos> And?<eos> I said... yes.<eos> Newland's Bookshop.<eos> Oh, Dr. Forrester.<eos> A pleasure to hear from you, sir. I've found a set for you.
- Not when you lose it like you did.<eos> I paid to rent it every day.<eos> It's your risk.<eos> If you ran a hired car over a cliff, you'd have to pay for it.<eos> - Not if he was in it.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> - That's good, Eddie.<eos> You lost the outfit through carelessness.<eos> It cost me $275.<eos> I won't charge you for the line, 'cause a fish so big could've taken it all anyway.
I didn't ask to see them.<eos> You better head them off.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Let's have it.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Johnson's wallet.<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mister, what's got into you?
I'll ask you again.<eos> Why did you get off here?<eos> I didn't have money enough to go any further.<eos> That's better.<eos> Where were you when the shooting occurred?<eos> - I was...<eos> - You don't have to answer.<eos> - Shut up, you.<eos> - Don't answer it.<eos> - I told you to shut up.
- Go ahead. Slap me.<eos> Come, Capitaine.<eos> This is not a brawl.<eos> We wish to get to the bottom of this affair.<eos> You'll never do it by slapping people around.<eos> That's bad luck.<eos> We shall see.<eos> If we need to question you further, you will be available at the hotel?<eos> I don't know how I'm gonna go any place when you got my passport and money.<eos> Your passport will be returned to you.
One held above the other.<eos> There'll be two people to bring back.<eos> - How'll I know them?<eos> - We've never seen them.<eos> We know the name of one only.<eos> Paul de Bursac.<eos> That's good enough.<eos> How about landing them back here?<eos> Do you know Cape Sainte-Pierre?<eos> - A boat can meet you offshore there.
- I could use a drink, Cricket.<eos> - Sure, come on.<eos> - What will you have, Slim?<eos> - Scotch and soda.<eos> Same.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening, Capt. Morgan.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - Much better.<eos> I'm very grateful to you.
I enjoy getting sick to be treated.<eos> - Funny girl.<eos> - Who's funnier, you or me?<eos> Me, surely.<eos> Because! don't respond to the first woman's advances.<eos> The first woman thanks you!<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> You mean you need to be in love with a capital L.<eos> No, if I was sure I loved a woman, I'd flee even faster.<eos> Then what keeps you from having a good time?
You think people are all good or all bad.<eos> That Good is light and Evil is dark.<eos> But where does each begin?<eos> Where does evil end?<eos> Are you on the good side or the bad side?<eos> What rhetoric!<eos> You just stop the lamp.<eos> Then stop it.<eos> You burned yourself You see, the experiment proves it.<eos> I'm fond of you. I'll let you in on a secret.
There's the tragedy.<eos> In fact, it's all my fault.<eos> I should never have married Laura.<eos> When we were first married, her youth rekindled me.<eos> This last surge of passion consumed what remained of my desire and love.<eos> Then, little by little... I became my wife's friend.<eos> I wasn't enough for her.<eos> But she'd had a virtuous upbringing, so she stayed faithful to me.<eos> Then you arrived.<eos> She liked you.
- Let's have a trial game of double dummy.<eos> - I will bring a lamp. You're a good pupil, Edith.<eos> That's $32,000 I owe you.<eos> Toss you,<eos> - Agreed.<eos> - Well, what is it?<eos> - Heads.<eos> Heads it is.<eos> Ha! We're quits.<eos> Cigarettes, but please do remember, Mr Candy, that smoking is bad for you.
I'm in!<eos> Stand up! Take your hat off my desk!<eos> Put out that cigarette!<eos> Recruits are not allowed to smoke during office hours.<eos> Put a fresh bottle of water on that cooler please. Yes.<eos> How would you like to begin with a propaganda project?<eos> Yes sir or madam.<eos> Do you know how to knit?<eos> Knit?<eos> I asked you if you knew how to knit.
From your uncle, it's the spoiled one.<eos> My uncle?<eos> My Uncle Charlie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mrs. Henderson, do you believe in telepathy?<eos> Well, I ought to.<eos> That's my business.<eos> Oh, not telegraphy.<eos> Mental telepathy.<eos> Like... Well, suppose you have a thought, and suppose the thought is about someone you're in tune with. And then across thousands of miles, that person knows what you're thinking about and answers you.
- That's my special little pond.<eos> So you keep your line out or I'll scratch your pretty little eyes.<eos> This is really absurd.<eos> Get her, making out like she's a duchess.<eos> Listen, Your Highness, I got a left jab that'll knock your royal teeth out.<eos> That dame is a lump of mud.<eos> - Your Highness.<eos> - What was that crack?<eos> Your Highness.<eos> I was just thinking, it does sort of fit you.
Barry, this is awful.<eos> It's like a bad dream.<eos> All these people here.<eos> Isn't there anyone we can trust?<eos> Sure there is.<eos> All of them. Only which one?<eos> Excuse me. This may sound sort of crazy. In fact, I don't even know how to start.<eos> But this whole house is a hotbed of spies and saboteurs. I'm not being silly.<eos> I assure you. Even our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.<eos> What's the matter with you, sir?
Where were we?<eos> Oh, yes, bring your book.<eos> You're not going back to work now.<eos> - Bring your book.<eos> - But you've done a good morning's work.<eos> Besides, this is your birthday.<eos> And really, professor, you've got a honey of a cold.<eos> I feel responsible for it.<eos> I'm going to take care of you.<eos> I'm going to put you to bed and feed you nourishing broths and hot lemonade.
- We found her searching the ashes.<eos> - I was looking for a watch I gave Clyde.<eos> All they found of Bracken was a medal he had won in school.<eos> It gives a girl a queer feeling.<eos> A man weighs 211 lbs. And, wham, all that's left is a medal for shot-putting.<eos> Too bad they're not taking a picture of Dilg swinging from a pole.<eos> - Who said that?<eos> - I did.<eos> Jake, I told you anybody talking like that had to fight me.<eos> I've licked you four times in two weeks.
- Hi, Ravelli.<eos> - Hey, Tommy.<eos> Where's the professor?<eos> I brought that money for him.<eos> - You see?<eos> - Hey, what's going on around here?<eos> I had orders to take this piano. We thought the place was closing up.<eos> Closing up?<eos> Why, I'm gonna tear this place down and build a real conservatory.<eos> - Now, what did I tell you?
Take these off at once and cut out this infernal nonsense!<eos> There you are.<eos> I give you the killers.<eos> Why, it's the Hastings brothers, the men who are going to buy the store.<eos> Gentlemen, I'm terribly sorry, but it's really not my fault.<eos> You certainly do look like crooks.<eos> Well, we'll forget about it this time. Mistakes can happen.<eos> Give me those keys so I can unlock these handcuffs.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> What's the matter with you?
A thousand dollars?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.<eos> - He acted funny sometimes, you know?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.<eos> I've been working for him 11 years now in charge of the whole place, so I ought to know.<eos> - Rosebud.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Like I tell you, the old man acted kind of funny sometimes...
That lamebrain. He can't fly that ship.<eos> There won't be enough left to identify.<eos> Don't blame me if anything happens.<eos> He shouldn't have done it.<eos> I told him that. I mean, I was gonna tell him that.<eos> But he got away so fast, I couldn't.<eos> He ain't had enough experience to fly that ship.<eos> - He's heading for the last roundup.<eos> - Pipe down.<eos> What's the matter with you?
We're doing all we can to get him back on his feet.<eos> Just get him strong enough to sit up.<eos> I'll have more fun beating him on the head.<eos> No, you see, the doctor says he's got...<eos> you see... for the patient's and they get themselves laying in bed...<eos> - Look. You see where it says "ward"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, you take the D out and the... what have you got?<eos> Piston rods.<eos> So you see, it'll never help you.
Cabin's too damp.<eos> It sweats and gathers ice by the ton.<eos> - Outside of that, it's perfect.<eos> - For everything but flying.<eos> Well, I guess that's that.<eos> Here's where we're starting all over again.<eos> Send me a full report.<eos> I'm glad you got it down all right.<eos> Thanks, so are we.<eos> Can I interest you in our pressure suit?
After all, the lady wasn't injured, nor was anyone else. I imagine she might be a tempting morsel in an off moment.<eos> Maybe it's all for the best, Dr. Jekyll. That wasn't my son in there.<eos> It was as if the evil one had crept into his heart.<eos> My poor Sam.<eos> - Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home. - Yes, sir. - I'll walk.<eos> - Good night, Mrs. Higgins. Good night, doctor.<eos> Good night. - Hello, Dr. Jekyll.<eos> How are you? - Good evening, Mr. Weller.<eos> Just in time, sir. Just locking up.<eos> Wait half a moment until I fix this thing over here I'll walk up to the east gate with you. Wonderful nights we're having, sir.
- That is a chance you have to face, Joe... no matter whose body you take.<eos> Wasn't that true from the moment you left Farnsworth? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I forgot. I...<eos> - Don't worry, Joe.<eos> You'll have everything that was ordained for you.<eos> I don't like it, Mr. Jordan. I want to find something...<eos> I mean, I want to be something besides just a plain fighter... even though Murdock is a champ and a swell guy.<eos> But it's like I told you, Murdock is the champ, not me.<eos> No, I don't like it.<eos> If it's all the same to you, Mr. Jordan... you and I'll keep going till we find the right guy.
-What's the matter with her?<eos> -Roy Earle's been traveling with a Marie.<eos> -Sure, I know.<eos> What about it?<eos> -Meet Marie.<eos> Hey, sheriff!<eos> Sheriff!<eos> I guess Slim couldn't make it.<eos> Listen, you.<eos> For the last time, I'm telling you to call Earle.
Coronet Apartments, California Avenue, Apartment 1001.<eos> What's the name?<eos> Miss LeBlanc.<eos> Okay, I'll be right over.<eos> Have Miles' desk moved out of the office and have "Spade and Archer" taken off the doors and windows, and have "Samuel Spade" put on.<eos> Come in, Mr. Spade.<eos> Everything's upside down.<eos> I haven't finished unpacking. Sit down.<eos> Mr. Spade, I I have a terrible, terrible confession to make.<eos> That story I told you yesterday was just a story.
Don't we all?<eos> I don't trust a man who says he's not.<eos> Now, let's talk about the black bird.<eos> Mr. Spade, have you any conception of how much money can be got for that black bird?<eos> Well, sir, if I told you, if I told you half, you'd call me a liar.<eos> No, not even if I thought so.<eos> But you tell me what it is, and I'll figure out the profit.<eos> You mean, you don't know what that bird is?<eos> I know what it's supposed to look like and I know the value in human life you people put on it.<eos> She didn't tell you what it is?
He can say anything he wants.<eos> Forget the Governor and the Mayor and all the small fry.<eos> This can arouse national interest.<eos> If he made a hit here, he can do it around the country.<eos> And you'll be pulling the strings, Mr. Norton.<eos> Arrange for some radio time. -D.B....<eos> -As soon as possible.<eos> Okay. I just came in to get warm myself.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Don't you go. I want to talk to you.
Listen, John. You're a pitcher.<eos> Get in there and pitch.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Let him through.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> The door's right there. -What are you doing here?<eos> -That's what I'd like to know.<eos> -He's a friend of mine. Never mind.<eos> Let him alone.<eos> I'll be over there pulling for you.
Oh, come in.<eos> Mrs. Aysgarth, what a pleasure to see you.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> - Do sit down.<eos> Captain Melbeck, I don't want to impose upon you, but you're Johnnie's cousin as well as his employer, and I wanted to talk to you about him.<eos> Yes, I can understand that. On the other hand, I told him I wouldn't prosecute.<eos> Of course... - I don't understand.<eos> - I told him I wouldn't prosecute. What on earth are you talking about?<eos> How does he get away with it?<eos> What reason did he give you when I discharged him?
- Always wanted to have one of those.<eos> - Shall we send it, sir?<eos> - No, I'll give it to her myself.<eos> - And about the bracelet, sir.<eos> - I want that engraved.<eos> Yes, and to whom?<eos> To my dear, sweet...<eos> - May I use your telephone, please?<eos> - Of course, right over there.<eos> I'll have her name for you in just a minute.
You're the first driver who chased a man after he'd already missed him.<eos> - Hey, buddy, who's car is that?<eos> - Mine.<eos> Parked it right next to a fire hydrant.<eos> That wasn't there when I parked!<eos> Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.<eos> Every time it rains those fireplugs pop out of the sidewalk like mushrooms.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Put it over here.<eos> Let that be a lesson to you.
Oh, Larry!<eos> Oh, boy, let him out again.<eos> Is that sure enough Ms. Mary?<eos> Larry, what in the world was...<eos> Uh, before we go any further, allow me to tell you that you're the most beautiful ghost that ever walked.<eos> Well, I couldn't let you have all this fun by yourself.<eos> How'd you get over here, Ms. Mary?<eos> When boats won't land, you swim.<eos> Swim?<eos> Didn't anyone tell you about the sharks?
Do you think this is really the correct way to compile a letter placing an order?<eos> "Send me a bale, right away".<eos> What will Mr. Hartman think of his client?<eos> He'll think that his client needs a bale.<eos> Silence!<eos> Business letters also require some form, some courtesy...<eos> Come on now, start over!<eos> Can I write: "I will be eternally grateful..."<eos> - No need to exaggerate, now!<eos> - The headmistress would like a word with you.
Testing the air.<eos> I like it, but it doesn't like me.<eos> - Hello, Dinah.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - Did you have a good sleep?<eos> - Wonderful, wonderful. You?<eos> Marvelous.<eos> Have you ever seen a handsomer day?<eos> Never, never.<eos> What did it set you back?
And what particular moment in your young life would you want to keep?<eos> All of them. All these last few days.<eos> I feel as though I'd... I'd collected a whole shelf full of bottles.<eos> Sometimes, you know, those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping out at you, just as you're trying most desperately to forget.<eos> Stop biting your nails.<eos> I wish I were a woman of 36, dressed in black satin with a string of pearls.<eos> You wouldn't be here with me if you were.<eos> Would you please tell me, Mr. De Winter, why you asked me to come out with you?<eos> It's obvious you want to be kind, but why do you choose me for your charity?<eos> I asked you to come out with me because I wanted your company.
I was making a hasty departure. It was so rude of me not to let you know.<eos> But a cable came this morning announcing that my daughter is engaged to be married.<eos> That's rather a coincidence, Mrs. Van Hopper.<eos> I asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement.<eos> You don't mean it.<eos> How perfectly wonderful.<eos> How romantic.<eos> Who is the lucky lady?<eos> I apologize for depriving you of your companion in this abrupt way.<eos> I do hope it won't inconvenience you too greatly.
Oh, I see. And you didn't come till after that?<eos> I came here when the first Mrs. De Winter was a bride.<eos> Mrs. Danvers, I do hope we'll be friends.<eos> You must be patient with me.<eos> This sort of life is new to me and I do want to make a success of it, and make Mr. De Winter happy, so I know I can leave all the household arrangements to you.<eos> Very well.<eos> I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction, madam.<eos> I've managed the house since Mrs. De Winter's death and Mr. De Winter has never complained.<eos> I think I'll go downstairs now.<eos> That room in the west wing I was telling you about is there, through that door.
But he was always hanging about. He must have seen this whole thing.<eos> It's ridiculous, even listening to all this.<eos> You're like a little trade union, all of you, aren't you?<eos> And if my guess is right, Crawley, there's a bit of malice in your soul toward me, isn't there?<eos> Crawley didn't have much success with Rebecca, but he ought to have more luck this time.<eos> And the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm, Crawley, in a week or so.<eos> Every time she faints, in fact.<eos> - De Winter!<eos> - Maxim, please!<eos> That temper of yours will do you in yet, Max.
Full of snakes and crocodiles, I'll wager.<eos> They say there's plants with arms like that'll strangle a man if he ain't careful.<eos> Stop that talk, or you'll be seeing ghosts before you see Spaniards.<eos> It's a funny thing about sailors, you know?<eos> They don't mind a fight if they can see what they're fighting.<eos> But you take a mosquito, now--<eos> What were you saying about mosquitoes?<eos> There's a whole nest of them here.<eos> The beasts have ears.<eos> Try holding your breath, Mr. Pitt, and then they won't trouble you.
Now, come on, let's forget it.<eos> I'll tell Artie you're here. Good luck, darlings.<eos> You haven't forgotten the two trumpet players? No, I'll be right with you.<eos> Quick, let's go.<eos> I'll put your boys on, but first give me a hand with that character over there.<eos> He's been here ten nights in a row. He's an awful ear bend.<eos> Well, well.<eos> Mr. Chisholm, this is Miss Miller.<eos> How do you do, Miss Miller?<eos> Well, sir, did that last number jump for you?
I told you then I wouldn't be there.<eos> And I'm telling you now... - ... I'll never be there.<eos> - What's the matter with me?<eos> Nothing except you got a husband, Mrs. Carlsen.<eos> And it happens that he's a good friend of mine.<eos> Understand?<eos> Oh, you've been listening to some narrow-minded people.<eos> There.<eos> What would they say about that?<eos> You know what's gonna happen to you?
Get some water.<eos> - We'll take her to a doctor.<eos> - Take me home.<eos> - Don't you think it...?<eos> - I said, take me home!<eos> Hop in, Cassie.<eos> - I'll run it in the garage for you.<eos> - No, stop.<eos> Stop it, do you hear?<eos> - What's the matter with you?
Correct me if I'm wrong.<eos> "I, Lana Carlsen..."<eos> She never thought I'd see her.<eos> I'll bet she was surprised when they told her I would.<eos> I'll see her, all right.<eos> I've got things to tell her.<eos> - All right, tell her, not me.<eos> - Just wait till I see her.<eos> Just wait.<eos> - What's the matter with you?
They agreed, Jim.<eos> Heads up, lads. Heads up. Show this rabble our heads are up.<eos> Open the gates.<eos> -Give the order to march, Sergeant.<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> Squads right, march!<eos> Forward, march!<eos> Captain Swanson.<eos> Company, halt.<eos> Jim Smith would like words with you.
- What fuse?<eos> - The fuse that was blowed out.<eos> - How did you know it was blowed out?<eos> - I don't know nothing.<eos> I was just doing what Mrs. Bellam told me.<eos> - And you were here reading?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ain't that late for a lady your age to be up?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Got things on your mind that worry you? Keep you awake?
They're checking them now.<eos> How about that license number?<eos> That car belongs to a man by the name of Vogel.<eos> A gambler racketeer. I'll see him later.<eos> That's for you.<eos> Hello.<eos> Speaking.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Never mind names.<eos> Just a friend of yours, telling you... if you know what's best for you, to lay off that MacFay case.
- Shut up.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Sure, we come in if you insist.<eos> - Is this a friend of yours?<eos> - I should say not.<eos> He's a lawyer.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why?<eos> Do you want to make anything out of it?<eos> Try to bully me, I'll lick you the best day you ever had.
Have you got a pencil?<eos> I left my typewriter in my other pants.<eos> - That's Whitcomb.<eos> What will I do?<eos> - I'll cool him off.<eos> No, you mustn't.<eos> This is so embarrassing.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> What, succotash?<eos> What's eating you?
-That's right. -Say, what coat did he say to get her?<eos> -The mink one. Well, there's a mink coat on that model there.<eos> Well, maybe that's it.<eos> Think that's all right?<eos> Good evening, Mr Merlin.<eos> -Your party is right over there.<eos> -Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, don't leave me.<eos> Oh, I won't know how to talk to these people.<eos> Just say no to the men. The girls probably won't talk to you anyway.
Ah, come on.<eos> You can do better than that. [Wash] You know, Frenchy is the real boss of Bottleneck.<eos> - Oh, well, always like to know who's boss.<eos> - You'll find out.<eos> Come on, everybody. Have a drink on Callahan's pants.<eos> Mr Destry, before we start drinking... I think you and me ought to come to an understanding.<eos> Well, I'm all for folks understanding each other.<eos> - That's a mighty fine idea, Mr Kent.<eos> - I'm glad you agree with me.<eos> So I'll start by telling you that I have a... very peculiar hobby.
See, if I woulda had a gun there... why, one of us might have got hurt, and it might have been me.<eos> I wouldn't like that.<eos> Would I?<eos> Tweet-tweet! I'm a canary.<eos> Where's my cage?<eos> It's gettin' sunny.<eos> Where's my parasol?<eos> Folks, seems like we got a deputy that knows what's good for him.<eos> If he don't carry a gun, he can't get into any trouble.<eos> [Laughter] And if anybody picks on you, you come to Uncle.
I'd like to make a dress for her: Half tar, half feathers.<eos> You came out on the coach with Mr Destry.<eos> What's your opinion of him?<eos> I know a little about him.<eos> Apparently very nice.<eos> Certainly different from the rest of the men you meet out in this country.<eos> I'll say he's different.<eos> 'Course I may be a little prejudiced.<eos> After all, it's kinda hard to judge character... - through eight gallons of water.<eos> - [Knocking] Mrs Callahan, may I speak to you just a moment, please?
Matches?<eos> No, I got 'em.<eos> Monte Carlo booby prize.<eos> Well, that's the smallest.<eos> I guess mine is strictly a bathtub voice.<eos> Aren't you wet through?<eos> How far do you think "through" is for a woman these days?<eos> Well, where to now?<eos> Oh, no. Eighty francs is enough, Skipper.<eos> I'm sorry I got you into this mess.
He'll take orders all right.<eos> Suppose we don't go through with this dam?<eos> Postpone it until next session of Congress.<eos> Or drop it all together.<eos> That would be a crime, Joe...<eos> After all the work we put in on it.<eos> Burying it in this deficiency bill as nice as you please, having it approved.<eos> It's rolling along... like taking candy from a baby.<eos> Is it worth the risk of a scandal?<eos> What's the matter with you?
He'll take orders.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Just one more minute.<eos> - Happy, we've got your man.<eos> - Horace Miller.<eos> - Horace Miller?<eos> !<eos> A born stooge!<eos> Horace'll perform like a trained seal.<eos> - What did I tell you, Joe?
Even I can't take this.<eos> I quit!<eos> There are a lot of things I can't take.<eos> Can't take a simple...<eos> Why don't you go home?<eos> Tell your little streams about the camp.<eos> This is no place for you.<eos> You're halfway decent.<eos> Go home!<eos> That's all I want to tell you.
I was hoping you'd be spared all this.<eos> That you'd see the sights, absorb a lot of history and go back to your boys.<eos> You've been living in a boy's world.<eos> For heaven's sake, stay there!<eos> This is a man's world, a brutal world.<eos> You have no place in it.<eos> You'll only get hurt.<eos> Forget Taylor and what he said about the dam.<eos> But you still haven't answered me.<eos> Can Taylor tell you what to do?
- You can't come in.<eos> Monsieur Mercier, may I introduce myself?<eos> I'm Leon d'Algout.<eos> I had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop.<eos> I was admiring the platinum watch with the diamond numbers.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> - You remember, I....<eos> Glorious, aren't they?<eos> - You have no right.<eos> - I did not permit you to come in here.
We'll leave these papers with you for your further consideration.<eos> - Au revoir, madame.<eos> - Au revoir.<eos> Well, that means another two weeks in Paris.<eos> Too bad we have to waste all that time.<eos> I acted on your suggestion... and got in touch with the power and light authorities.<eos> Whenever you want to visit their plants, they are open to you.<eos> Yes, power and light.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There is something else which I know will appeal to you.
You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition.<eos> I think we can cut your visit short.<eos> - Leon is not here.<eos> - Of course not, my dear.<eos> I didn't come here with any such suspicion.<eos> How ridiculous.<eos> Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.<eos> What is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean?<eos> "I'm delighted to have you here."<eos> I haven't reached that state of civilization, therefore I must ask you to leave.
Where are they?<eos> Don't worry, last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open.<eos> He may have overstepped his function as a waiter... but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.<eos> I just put this on for sentiment.<eos> The rest are absolutely safe, I assure you.<eos> - But if you feel like notifying the police....<eos> - You leave me no choice.<eos> Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet envoy... to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?<eos> I'll have to face the consequences, but so will you.<eos> Don't forget, they'll ask you how you got them.
All right, then let's deal with legal facts.<eos> You know...<eos> - France has recognized the Soviet.<eos> - Unfortunately.<eos> Under the Soviet law, the jewels belong to the State.<eos> - France is going to uphold that ownership.<eos> - Yes, my lawyer agrees with you.<eos> He says that France will uphold it in every court... but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that.<eos> And when I say it will take two years... I am, as always, conservative.<eos> Won't those two years in court be expensive for you?
- OK, if the wind doesn't shift.<eos> - I'll take a look outside.<eos> Big breaks now.<eos> This looks like the last of it.<eos> OK, she's open.<eos> - Let 'em fly.<eos> - OK, Tex.<eos> Joe!<eos> That's the most wonderful thing I've ever seen.<eos> Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it?
He always explained everything before.<eos> But that was something he wasn't going to try to explain.<eos> Soak it, please.<eos> Know Mrs. Potter?<eos> I did her at her apartment.<eos> It looks like a reform school.<eos> Her seven daughters are total gangsters.<eos> Know Mrs. Stephen Haines?<eos> Why, yes. I...<eos> I guess Mrs. Fowler told you about that.
- You don't say.<eos> Then, Elizabeth, you've come to the right man.<eos> He's fed.<eos> Now I'm sure he's going to be quiet.<eos> Come on, let's go in to dinner.<eos> Why are you just sitting there?<eos> I'm just trying to figure out how I ever got mixed up in all this.<eos> "Mr. Bone." Isn't that amazing?<eos> You told me not to tell Aunt Elizabeth what your real name was.<eos> I didn't tell you to think up a name like Bone.
You could have...<eos> Don't be upset, David. Well, who wouldn't be?<eos> Here I am, trying to help you find a leopard... so that your Aunt Elizabeth won't be angry at you.<eos> And then she'll probably give you the $1 million I need for my museum.<eos> If you'd planned it, you couldn't have ruined my chances more completely.<eos> You told your aunt I was crazy, didn't you?<eos> You told her my name was Bone and you didn't tell me.<eos> You told her I was a big-game hunter and didn't tell me.<eos> You tell anybody anything that comes into your head... and you don't tell me.<eos> - Here's something else I didn't tell you. - What now?
And don't you worry about me, I can take care of myself.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Did you hurt yourself?<eos> No, I didn't hurt myself.<eos> It's not that. It's just that I'm miserable because you don't like me anymore. Yes, I do.<eos> You tried to get rid of me and you don't think of me.<eos> You don't like me anymore.<eos> Your face is dirty.<eos> Now you're being nice to me... after all the horrible things I've done to you.
Then tell me all about it.<eos> I can't.<eos> Very well.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> That's all.<eos> Well, doctor, when do you wanna see me again?<eos> There's no point in seeing you again.<eos> Oh, but you must.<eos> I mean...<eos> Well, I'll recommend several other doctors to you. And no doubt you'll find one in whom you'll have more confidence.
But is an anesthetic necessary?<eos> It's the simplest way.<eos> The effect will wear off in an hour or so. And meanwhile I can talk to you.<eos> If you want to talk to me, why put me to sleep?<eos> I'm going to talk to your subconscious mind.<eos> It never sleeps.<eos> But while under the influence of an anesthetic we very often say things or do things we wouldn't under normal conditions.<eos> Well, if you think it's all right.<eos> It gives the doctor a clue to the patient's personality.<eos> Dr. Powers, this is Miss Cooper, the young lady I just told you about.
Sorry, I didn't see you.<eos> That's what we thought.<eos> Bye, now.<eos> And not a word to the Queen Mother.<eos> - Here, Manolo.<eos> I remembered you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You're late today, M. Adrien.<eos> I was up at six to clean out my room with carbolic.<eos> I could have got Jeanne to help you.
One day, to save my own skin, I ratted on an accomplice.<eos> I was let off, they got five years.<eos> They've served the sentence and they're after me now.<eos> So I've become a different person.<eos> I've changed identity.<eos> I like to be clean and neat, my tie is always pressed.<eos> I hate music and the sight of blood no longer affects me.<eos> It's hard to slough yourself off.<eos> But I wasn't supposed to become either Edmond or Paulo.<eos> And the proof is, Robert is talking to you tonight.
Wait a minute. You girls hop in the rumble seat.<eos> Ames, you'll ride with me.<eos> Aah!<eos> Shut up! That's the body!<eos> That's the body I saw in the Lane house!<eos> Old man Lane.<eos> Right on my own doorstep.<eos> It's contempt of court.<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> I told you on the phone she won't go with you.
Now, Miss Manton.<eos> Mike, she's right. But there's a killer loose!<eos> Let me ask you something, Mike.<eos> If she was your wife, would you do this? Inspector, that's an implication that I'm his wife.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Yes, Pete. Because I think lots of other wives Have a right to live in safety from murderers.<eos> Now, how about it?<eos> Will you do it? No, she won't. I won't let her be a decoy.<eos> You won't let me?<eos> You're scared because he's asking you to be there, too.
Don't count on that tire. It blew twice this morning.<eos> When Pat went walking, the sun came out.<eos> - You know, I thought about that.<eos> I saw the sun come out and I thought about Pat.<eos> It's a step forward you know, when she can walk out alone.<eos> I'll drop you on the way to station.<eos> Well you can't keep moping about Pat.<eos> Make her laugh, we'll pull through.<eos> Who knows, maybe Erich will get a fine job.<eos> What makes you think an automobile can go through you?
- Right here.<eos> Hello, Mr. Vanderhof.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Twitch-face.<eos> Yes, I heard that you were in trouble and came over to see if I could help you out.<eos> Why should you want to help me?<eos> To tell you the truth, I thought that if I did you a favour...<eos> You're wasting your time, Mr. Twitch, Mr. Blakely.<eos> - I have no intention of selling my home.<eos> - We'll see how long you can hold out. Wait till a few more things happen to you.
If you've got any sense left, you'll dig up my attorneys.<eos> - I've been here for hours.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'll phone them all.<eos> So, you're the one that's been holding up my deal?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Kind of funny, isn't it?<eos> - What's funny about it?<eos> The idea of you engineering this thing and being caught in your own trap.<eos> Maybe it won't be so funny when I take that house away from you.
The greatest of your career.<eos> What do you want, Ramsey?<eos> You know something.<eos> I actually thought of coming here to ask for mercy but I couldn't figure out a basis on which to do it.<eos> Certainly not friendship.<eos> Once, a long time ago, that might have been possible but you destroyed that, Anthony.<eos> Remember?<eos> Look at me, Anthony.<eos> Tomorrow the world will read that Ramsey is broke.<eos> Doesn't that please you?
Ain't I got a right to be?<eos> How would you like it if you'd been counting on a break sure you was gonna get it and all you got was laughed at just because some guy's been sucking around the boss?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hello, Mr. Taylor.<eos> This is Jenkins of the Zenith Auto Sales Company.<eos> I showed you the car this afternoon.<eos> Well, forget it.<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> I don't want the car.<eos> I tell you I don't want it.
Please. I'd rather not.<eos> We all appreciate your feelings, Mrs. Danvers, but I must remind you that the defendant's life is at stake.<eos> The witness will answer the question.<eos> Well, I broke off my engagement because I found out that Mr. Jackson drank. I object.<eos> This testimony is incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial.<eos> Sustained.<eos> But Your Honor, this testimony is relevant.<eos> It is imperative to establish the relation of these people so the court may realize Edward Jackson met his death as the unhappy result of his own jealous passions.<eos> You may proceed, but confine yourself to the issues involved.<eos> Did Mr. Jackson ever discuss with you his attitude toward Miss Betty Grogan?
Bulging eyes wanting to go God knows where.<eos> A trembling voice. And that unbearable sentence!<eos> I love you, I love you.<eos> You love this young man?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Not at all, Madame, I was saying...<eos> I heard what you were saying.<eos> Leave now!<eos> - Madame!<eos> - I told you to leave.
Oh, dear.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Doctor, this is Miss Standish, owner of the sanitarium.<eos> - How do you do, Miss Standish?<eos> - How do you do?<eos> You're the prettiest owner of a sanitarium I've ever seen.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You have a charming place here.<eos> I knew your mother very well.<eos> I'll let you in on a little secret.
Have you got a can opener?<eos> Oh, here it is.<eos> Oh, I'm really not hungry.<eos> Couldn't we just sit over here?<eos> I want to be near you.<eos> I want you to hold me.<eos> Oh, hold me closer.<eos> Closer.<eos> Closer.<eos> If I hold you any closer, I'll be in back of you.
There is no such thing.<eos> She looks as healthy as any woman I've met.<eos> You don't look like you ever met a healthy woman.<eos> - What?<eos> - Gentlemen, gentlemen.<eos> There's a very simple way to settle this.<eos> Why not examine Mrs. Upjohn?<eos> - Splendid, splendid.<eos> - Right this way, Mrs. Upjohn.<eos> Dr. Hackenbush will show you, then I insist that you apologize to him.
Oh, no, no, no.<eos> My purse, my purse, my purse.<eos> He has my purse! You must forgive him.<eos> He doesn't spell very well.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Come, gentlemen.<eos> Let us begin.<eos> You shouldn't have done that.<eos> Now we're all unsterilized.<eos> What's the matter with you?
- He was jumping plenty last night.<eos> - But he can't beat your horse.<eos> - Well, I'm not taking any chances.<eos> My money is riding on Skee Ball, and that's not all.<eos> If Hi Hat wins, we can kiss the sanitarium goodbye.<eos> Well, Morgan, you got nothing to worry about.<eos> Hi Hat's not on this track.<eos> See he doesn't get on.<eos> Put a man at every gate.<eos> If that nag slips by you, it means your job.
Now, just pour yourself into these, dear, and fall in a faint.<eos> My dear, I want you to try these on, without any obligation whatsoever. After all, you know, you're practically my discovery.<eos> All right. Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> You know, there's something awfully phony about this.<eos> Are you just beginning to find that out?<eos> What do you mean you won't publish it in your column, Mr. Wallace?<eos> In the second place it is the truth and in the third place she lives here right here in the Hotel Louis, the roundabouts of the bong tong.<eos> I don't know who you've got living here, but I tell you the old man don't buy fur coats for dames. If anybody knew, it would be me, wouldn't it?<eos> I'm telling you, she is, he does, but you don't.
He's gone. Well.<eos> Where's Hyde?<eos> He's in the... He's in the barber shop! I thought so!<eos> Mr. Ball wants you right away!<eos> Ball? Get me out of here! Let me up!<eos> Mr. Ball wants me!<eos> I told you I didn't know who he was, so when I said I didn't know your father, I didn't know him, because I didn't know he was your father!<eos> Then why did you take the coat?<eos> I didn't want to, but your father kept saying that I shouldn't be a smarty and that I shouldn't know all the answers, and besides, you don't know what a fur coat means to a girl<eos> Well, how nice my coat looks on you!
You're up against the wrong man.<eos> I'll leave, even if I have to blow this place into the valley.<eos> I'll get out, porters or no porters!<eos> You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey.<eos> He could never get through that country alive.<eos> I can't let him go alone. It's suicide.<eos> Yes, of course your brother is a problem.<eos> It was to be expected.<eos> I knew you'd understand.<eos> That's why I came to you for help.
All right, I'll prove it to you.<eos> You've believed everything they're told you without proof.<eos> I'll prove my story.<eos> Come in a minute.<eos> I've got some bad news for you.<eos> My brother and I've decided we can't take you along.<eos> You can't take me?<eos> You promised to take me with you!<eos> It's all your fault.<eos> It was all arranged until he spoke to you.
Mrs. George Nasher was took yesterday.<eos> Do you know her? Nope.<eos> - Where did you say you were from? - New York.<eos> I was wondering if you you could tell me where I could find Hazel Flagg.<eos> - From New York, eh? - Yep.<eos> You know what I think, young fella?<eos> I think you're a newspaperman. I can smell 'em.<eos> I've always been able to smell 'em.<eos> Excuse me while I open the windows.<eos> I'll tell you briefly what I think of newspapermen.
and this and...<eos> The biggest fire since Rome!<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Hello, Hazel. Come in.<eos> I was wondering whatever become of you.<eos> Enoch, who is that man?<eos> Enoch, who is that man?<eos> Oh, he's just a stranger from Europe who dropped in for a little chat.<eos> We've been discussing medicine, pro and con. Oh, excuse me.<eos> I want to introduce you to Hazel Flagg.
I'm glad to see you back.<eos> - How are you, Nick?<eos> - Did you enjoy your trip to Los Angeles?<eos> We saw your pictures in the paper.<eos> It said you did a good job in New York.<eos> I guess they'll be scared to death if there are more murders there.<eos> I've been scared to go down in the cellar ever since.<eos> Don't you worry, Rose, if anyone murders you, I'll catch them.<eos> Mr. Charles, don't be talking that way.<eos> What do you think of the party they're giving you?
Look at the gun, David, it hasn't been fired.<eos> Selma, forgive me.<eos> It's all right, David.<eos> Of course I forgive you.<eos> Well, that's all settled.<eos> Come on, Nora.<eos> Goodbye, Lieutenant.<eos> Goodbye, all.<eos> Now, wait a minute.<eos> Maybe, he believes you.
Salary's 22.50 a week.<eos> - Goodbye, Norma.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Don't forget next Tuesday.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - When we take our last jujitsu lesson.<eos> - Do you know how to run a switchboard?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> Just make yourself at home and I'll show you around later.
Thank you, Roberts.<eos> I'll see her.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I'm Mr. Allenbury.<eos> Yes? I'm Mrs. William Chandler, and I can prove it, too.<eos> - You'll have every opportunity to do so.<eos> - I'll say I will.<eos> I want my husband.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Your husband will be returned to you intact, Mrs. Chandler.
- I wouldn't think of it.<eos> Pleading won't do you any good.<eos> - I'm sure.<eos> - What else is there to talk about?<eos> - You.<eos> - Me?<eos> I've a pretty fair notion of what you've been through.<eos> - What do you mean by that?<eos> - Any woman can be starved by neglect.<eos> The little attentions Bill paid you seemed so much greater... because you weren't getting them from Haggerty.
I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.<eos> Grant's tomb and the Statue of Liberty?<eos> You'll not only see those, but before the evening's through, you'll be leaning against the Tower of Pisa, mount Mount Everest.<eos> I'll show you the pyramids and all the sphinxes.<eos> Pal, how would you like to go on a real old-fashioned binge?<eos> - Binge? - Yeah, I mean the real McCoy. Play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, nitwit and halfwit in New York.<eos> We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia look like an anaemic on a goat's milk diet.<eos> - That oughta be fun, huh?<eos> - Fun? Say...<eos> Listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.
Shall I wear my tails, or come just as I am?<eos> You needn't be fresh.<eos> Do you want the five dollars or don't you?<eos> Madam, I can't tell you how flattered I am... by your very generous offer.<eos> However, I'll have to take it up with my board of directors.<eos> - Don't you touch me!<eos> - No matter what my directors advise, - I think you should be spanked.<eos> - George, do something!<eos> Are you in the habit of hitting ladies?<eos> I'm in the habit of hitting gentlemen also, if that'll interest you. - Aren't you going to do anything?
You really think you're going to like it here?<eos> I must admit it's more desirable than living in a packing case on a city dump.<eos> Oh, that's where I met you, isn't it?<eos> - Yes, miss.<eos> - Oh, yes, yes.<eos> I remember now.<eos> We were playing some sort of a game...<eos> a scavenger hunt, I think.<eos> We needed a forgotten man.<eos> I asked you to go to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me, and I'm a little bit hazy as to just what happened after that.
How did you know I want to see Godfrey?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It just came over me.<eos> Oh, you... you can't come in here.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's our house, isn't it?<eos> One room is just like any other room.<eos> Besides, I want to talk.<eos> I'm terribly sorry, but we can't talk here.<eos> Don't you think it's indecent of you to order me out after you kissed me?
- The whole thing is only a delusion.<eos> - What thing?<eos> - You wouldn't understand.<eos> - Well, I don't so far.<eos> I'm famished.<eos> How about something to eat?<eos> Oh, Godfrey, bring Mr. Gray a sandwich.<eos> It's your play.<eos> Well, come around here Mr. Gray's not an acrobat.<eos> What's come over you?
You're very attractive.<eos> - As a butler?<eos> - No, as a Smith.<eos> - You're a rotten butler.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Are we going to be friends?<eos> I feel that on my day off, I should have the privilege of choosing my friends.<eos> You can't go on like this forever.<eos> You really like me, and you're afraid to admit it, aren't you?<eos> Do you want me to tell you what I really think of you?
While you've been away, I've been doing some things also.<eos> I've been trying to do things that I thought would make you proud of me.<eos> Oh, I was proud of you before I went away.<eos> Yes, but I mean prouder still.<eos> You see, you helped me to find myself, and I'm very grateful.<eos> - You'd make a wonderful husband.<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> - I know how you feel about things.<eos> - How?<eos> Well, you're grateful to me because I helped you to beat Cornelia, and I'm grateful to you because you helped me to beat life.
There's a little matter I've wanted to talk over with you for quite a while... called "The Mystery of Milady's Necklace"... or "What Happened to the Pearls?"<eos> Pearls?<eos> Necklace?<eos> Oh, you mean the one that disappeared last fall?<eos> - The same.<eos> - Didn't that ever turn up?<eos> Oh, yes, it turned up, but not in my possession.<eos> I know the first part of the story, but I wondered what you know might know?<eos> - I can't imagine.<eos> - One other story might interest you.
- There's a home for girls in Shanghai.<eos> - He'll probably see she's placed in it.<eos> - Home for girls? You mean grey uniforms and pigtails?<eos> Ching-Ching was never meant for that.<eos> I know, old man, but I'm afraid it's about all that can be done for her.<eos> Captain, wait a minute.<eos> This may sound crazy, but why can't I adopt her?<eos> Now, see here, son.<eos> You're a bachelor. And quite a bachelor.<eos> No court would turn a child over to you.
Prepare a statement for signature, and an order setting aside the verdict in the case of the People v. William Harper.<eos> In the interests of justice, I shall direct a verdict of not guilty.<eos> Sign here, please.<eos> You shall be brought into court on Thursday, the 1 7th, for sentencing.<eos> Meanwhile, you will be held as a material witness in the case of the People v. Ralph Wiley.<eos> We have come in the hearings before this court today to what I hope will be the final actions in a sad, unfortunate case, one whose horrible tragedy will forever remain with me.<eos> I am happy to have been enabled, before it was too late, to set aside the verdict in the case of the People v. William Harper.<eos> But, young man, although this court believes that to convict you would be grossly unjust, we cannot condone your acts.<eos> We only express the hope that your experiences may not alone keep you, but thousands of others, from the vicious pitfalls of marihuana.<eos> Thus, I am ordering you to remain in this court during the next case so that you will have to witness what you yourself so narrowly escaped.
- Hello, Dr. Beaumont.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I want you to know that the state has appointed me Ellman's guardian.<eos> - And they've awarded him $500,000.<eos> - Well, that's a fortune.<eos> Though I doubt if any suffering can be measured in dollars.<eos> A half a million?<eos> At that rate, I'd be willing to die a little bit myself, ha, ha.<eos> Well, you've worked very hard for him, Mr. Nolan.<eos> And although he can't express it, I know that he's very grateful to you.
I only hate you and despise you.<eos> I might have expected your thanks for what I've done this day... but very well, let it be so.<eos> I'm a thief and pirate and I'll show you how a thief and a pirate can deal.<eos> Once, you bought me for a miserable Ј10.<eos> Now I've bought you for considerably more.<eos> The amount's of no matter.<eos> What matters is now I own you as you once owned me.<eos> You're mine, do you understand?<eos> Mine to do with as I please!<eos> Capt. Blood, Lord Willoughby sends his compliments... and requests you to talk with him at your convenience.
I was myself once, too, in loyalty.<eos> Of what should we be thinking?<eos> Of the chance to fight for your king.<eos> To fight for my king?<eos> Yes.<eos> He was loyal enough to send me to seek you out... to offer you pardon for your past crimes... freedom from your slavery and more than that... a commission in his own navy for you and your men.<eos> You hear that, Chester?<eos> The King wants us to join his navy!<eos> Read it for yourself.<eos> Lord Willoughby, you're a guest aboard my ship... and I've still some notion left me from better days of decent behavior... so I'll not be telling you what I think of this offer.
Now that your hands are smashed up, you can't thump a piano any longer, you come crawling back to me.<eos> And that actress you married. Why don't you let her help you now?<eos> Her pay may be small, but she could supplement her earnings.<eos> Stop it!<eos> No!<eos> Monsieur!<eos> Monsieur!<eos> To be near you like this, is more happiness than I've ever known.<eos> But, Dr. Gogol, quite frankly,<eos> I asked you to come here to talk about Stephen.
Mr. Fryer, take the tiller.<eos> Get away!<eos> I caught him!<eos> Hey, lads!<eos> Give me that bird!<eos> Share and share alike, lads.<eos> The blood for the sick.<eos> Raise him up, Mr. Maggs.<eos> Norton, get me a cup.<eos> This will nourish you, Mr. Morgan.
That's very flattering, but no.<eos> No, Judge Thatcher.<eos> I'm sure they can handle it as well as I.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He's hung up.<eos> What's his home address?<eos> Hillview Heights.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm going there.<eos> Mr. Chapman, I don't like to ask you to go, but I'm tired.
Yes.<eos> Oh, he's mad.<eos> What will he do to me?<eos> He won't hurt you.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> You will help me, won't you?<eos> You'll help me get out of here? No!<eos> Vollin is going to fix my face.<eos> I tell you he's mad.<eos> He won't help you.
Woman: Just drive down state street. I'll tell you where later.
Brady and Jones, you're to snoop around tennant's apartment,<eos> See what you can see. Now, beat it, all of you.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Lewis, cleary, you're to come with me to Clay dalzell's.<eos> That's where the body is.<eos> Get a party to come along for fingerprints And also notify the coroner's office.<eos> Okay, inspector.<eos> And, Lewis, you're to go to 125 west 34th street And get me a pair of acme arch supporters.<eos> Right.<eos> I don't think the hip will trouble you a bit. Dal: Good.
I told you I picked it up.<eos> You didn't like tennant, did you? Not particularly, no.<eos> Ever have an argument with him?<eos> Frequently.<eos> What about?<eos> Things he wrote in his column.<eos> What was tennant gonna print in his column about you tomorrow? Nothing. How do you know?<eos> Because he told me so.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> He didn't do nothing of the kind. I'll tell you why you know.
Things he wrote in his column.<eos> What was tennant gonna print in his column about you tomorrow? Nothing. How do you know?<eos> Because he told me so.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> He didn't do nothing of the kind. I'll tell you why you know.<eos> You killed him before he had a chance to do it.<eos> Ain't that it, dalzell?<eos> Tennant came here to get a story confirmed.<eos> You denied it.<eos> He didn't believe you, said he was gonna publish it anyhow. You had an argument.
[ Loudly ] Sure it didn't... [ normal voice ] Sure it didn't tell you<eos> To leave the theater and meet tennant someplace? Well, what would be the sense of that?<eos> You just told me that I was talking with him at the theater.<eos> You know, I understand The show "midnight's" a pretty swell show. Yes, so I hear.<eos> Ain't seen it, then?<eos> No. Why didn't you stay last night?<eos> Well, I thought I'd rather take a walk.<eos> [ Chuckles ] That's why you took a cab?<eos> [ Chuckles ]<eos> I have been lying to you. Yes, I know.
What are you talking about?<eos> You're fooling around with some mighty tough people.<eos> You?<eos> Me? No. I'm one of the nicest fellas you ever met in your life.<eos> And these boys are just taking care of you.<eos> But there's a couple of other guys on your trail That are different kinds of people.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Look, dalzell, let's you and me quit kidding each other.<eos> Didn't you say if anything happened to you The law would get that check?<eos> And don't that mean that I got to keep you healthy?
Your office on the telephone.<eos> ─ I told you I wasn't in.<eos> I'm very sorry sir.<eos> I took the liberty.<eos> They said it was most important.<eos> Keep picking out the cabins, darling.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> It's Miss Brown.<eos> She said she would kill herself.<eos> She spoke of a telegram she sent you.
Well, boys! I've been tryin' to meet up with you for sometime!<eos> I reckon you got here just in time, brother.<eos> What're you thinking about, Jim?<eos> You know, Ted meant that.<eos> And he said when you married 'em, it was gonna be twice as big.<eos> Oh! He has it all worked out, has he?<eos> Sure, and you better accept his proposition.<eos> 'Cause it'll be the only one you'll ever get.<eos> Well!<eos> What's my little brother been tellin' you?
On horseback.<eos> Horseback?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Expenses don't allow for a car.<eos> Well, Inspector, when it comes to corpses, the state sometimes has... a fit of generosity.<eos> That's what you think.<eos> Believe it or not, Müller, tonight will be the first time I make it to the theatre in time for the first act.<eos> Knock on wood, Inspector.<eos> There.<eos> What did I tell you?
Won't you reconsider?<eos> Please, relent... for my sake.<eos> I am a little headstrong.<eos> I come by it honestly.<eos> My father was a Headstrong.<eos> My mother was a little Armstrong.<eos> The Headstrongs married the Armstrongs and darkies were born.<eos> Silly to lose my temper on account of the little thing you called me.<eos> Little thing?<eos> What did I call you?
Well, my friend, this is an unexpected pleasure.<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How do you do?<eos> I wouldn't disturb you, but the friend I spoke to you about... is leaving town tomorrow to supervise some new excavations in Egypt.
- He has a great reputation as a sculptor.<eos> - You are very kind, sir.<eos> However, I was commissioned to come to England... and with the completion of my work, I turned my mind to these... because it seemed to satisfy me more.<eos> I felt I could reproduce the warmth and flesh and blood of life... far more better in wax than in cold stone.<eos> If you will grant me the privilege... I'd like to submit your work to the Royal Academy when I get back.<eos> Royal--<eos> You will have won the undying gratitude of all of us.<eos> Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?<eos> I regret that I have not the time to give to your exhibition now... but I'll worry you more when I get back.<eos> It will always afford me the greatest pleasure to welcome you.
If you marry, it will be at you they laugh and stare.<eos> That's good.<eos> Nothing like being different.<eos> Cleopatra... queen of the air, married to a dwarp.<eos> - A dwarf.<eos> - A dwarp!<eos> Then it's not for Hans you care. - It's the money.<eos> - Money?<eos> You little mind reader.<eos> He has told you of the fortune he has inherited.
Why do you look at me like that?<eos> I had no idea you were so beautiful.<eos> I'd like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you, ever.<eos> How tired you are.<eos> Yes, tired.<eos> And alone?<eos> So alone.<eos> You mustn't talk Russian to me.<eos> Strange man.<eos> Am I so strange to you?
I'm not so sure I want to now.<eos> We might make a getaway.<eos> I don't think they'd miss us.<eos> How about it?<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, here we are.<eos> Tell me some more about your work.<eos> It sounds fascinating.<eos> Why talk about work?<eos> That's what interests you, isn't it? No.
You know, of course... that you'll have to go to a prison camp for 90 days.<eos> -There's your check.<eos> -Thanks, Allen.<eos> There's no reason to believe that after the 90 days...<eos> I won't get my pardon then, is there?<eos> This is a funny state and the Governor's a little peculiar.<eos> You see, all that publicity you gave out about the conditions here... didn't help any.<eos> But I'll get my pardon?<eos> They'll give you the pardon.<eos> But that clerical job they promised you isn't so definite.
Third time tonight.<eos> - Here. Let me shuffle them.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Don't evade the issue.<eos> - Yeah, speak up.<eos> - I asked you a question.<eos> - You did?<eos> I forgot.<eos> - Oh, no, you didn't.<eos> I asked you if there'd be as much sport in the game... if you were the tiger instead of the hunter.
We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude.<eos> - Well, it's a break for me, anyway.<eos> - My house is yours.<eos> Oh, by the way.<eos> You'll want to change those wet rags immediately.<eos> Yes.<eos> They look about the way I feel.<eos> Yes.<eos> I have some loose hunting clothes which I keep for my guests... that you can possibly get into.<eos> Ivan will show you to your room. - Thank you.
Okay, you're a lawyer.. so please make 'em understand.<eos> Shut up. Don't be a fool.<eos> The magistrate's a man you can talk to.<eos> Well, have you thought it over?<eos> Are you going to confess you killed Lucienne Pelletier?<eos> You don't want me to confess just to make you happy, do you sir?<eos> Why would I kill her?<eos> I had everything to lose.<eos> You've confessed that Lulu asked you about money that evening... and I am informed that you quarreled violently.<eos> She even told you she was leaving you for a cashier... with whom she was having an affair.
Dangerous?<eos> Poor old Waldman.<eos> Have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous?<eos> Where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond?<eos> Have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars?<eos> Or to know what causes the trees to bud?<eos> And what changes the darkness into light?<eos> But if you talk like that... people call you crazy.<eos> Well, if I could discover just one of these things - what eternity is, for example - I wouldn't care if they did think I was crazy.<eos> You're young, my friend. Your success has intoxicated you.
-No?<eos> -No. No. Well, maybe not.<eos> Mr. Everett is one of my best customers.<eos> Is that so? I thought it was past your closing time till I saw the lights.<eos> Well, it is, but we were unpacking some books.<eos> Oh, I see. Mrs. Donlin like the book I sent her?<eos> Huh?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, I have another one that I'm sure she'll be crazy about.<eos> Fine. I'll get it for you. It's In the next room.
And, Countess, really, if I were you: I wouldn't let my hairdresser do anything else: But dress my hair:<eos> - Good morning:<eos> - Morning:<eos> Fix my hair, please:<eos> I thought this morning would be different to this:<eos> I expected to tell you something very important:<eos> - I'm not curious:<eos> - Something about myself:<eos> Something that - that ought to concern you:<eos> I told you to fix my hair:
At 8:00?<eos> Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> White uniform.<eos> Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> You understand?<eos> Oh, yes, I understand.<eos> # With such a bad report of you I wonder what I ought to do with you #<eos> # You really can't be too severe when my regret is so sincere # # And true #<eos> # If you were on probation # # Could I depend on you #<eos> # To make you think more kindly # # Let me obey you blindly #
"Khalibiev!<eos> He saw us. He'll be our witness."<eos> "Is Mr. Khalibiev here?"<eos> "I'll wait for him."<eos> "Gare de Lyons!"<eos> "Where were you last night?"<eos> "In a little hotel on Montparnasse."<eos> "Not at 17, rue Thiboumery?"<eos> "You are accused of the murder of Raymond Ney."<eos> "Where did all this money come from that was found on you?"
"Why is this exotic image in your dream?"<eos> "In the dream, a small Italian city one I saw frequently on our honeymoon emerged before my eyes A bell tower grew steeply up out of the ground..."<eos> "The laughing of these three women's heads was terrible!"<eos> "Did you recognize the women?"<eos> "These humiliations hit you in your most vulnerable spot!"<eos> "Then, in the dream, I stood before a prison cell and looked through the bars."<eos> "What did you see?"<eos> "In your nightmare, the small wound on your wife's neck flowed together with the crime in the nearby house for this reason you saw yourself condemned as a murderer."<eos> "These dream fantasies led, in your consciousness to a morbid aversion to touching a knife."<eos> "So this psychological illness kept you from killing your wife!"
Where's Brad?<eos> Where's anybody?<eos> Brad, my darling, how could I have done this to you?<eos> Oh, If only we hadn't made this journey.<eos> If only the car hadn't broken down.<eos> If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.<eos> What have they done with him?<eos> Brad, how could you?<eos> But you're hurt.<eos> Did they do this to you?
Then quit.<eos> Just like that, huh?<eos> But you've got to do it now.<eos> You've got to before it's too late, whether you want to or not.<eos> Look, Johnny...<eos> The next game, there won't be any substitutions allowed. And no time limit.<eos> You'll die, Johnny.<eos> Everybody will die.<eos> No time limit.<eos> They tell you that?
-Looks like.<eos> What about the real Harry and Colonel Faraday?<eos> They must be up there in the rocket with Styggron.<eos> SARAH: We've got to help them somehow.<eos> Our only chance is to stop the androids before they take over the complex.<eos> -Where are you going?<eos> -To the scanner room.<eos> You stay here, Sarah.<eos> Hold it, Doctor.<eos> Don't be a fool, Benton, I'm one of you.
The Doctor's not here, he's at large somewhere in the complex.<eos> -Yes, of course, sir.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> -That's all right, Benton, but keep your wits about you.<eos> Nobody knows who's who around here.<eos> -Have you finished, Grierson?<eos> -Almost there, Doctor.<eos> We haven't got a second to lose, man.<eos> BENTON: Hold it, Doctor.<eos> Don't be a fool, Benton, I'm one of you.
What do you think?<eos> Spoilt for choice.<eos> You got it.<eos> Blindfolded.<eos> There's the signal, it's starting.<eos> -Let's go and sit down.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> -Okay.<eos> As you're very busy it's understandable you may forget things...<eos> So I thought I'd bring you this little souvenir.
I took the enrollment list and called the roll.<eos> I've lost faith in this school.<eos> - Mommy.<eos> - Be quiet.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Be quiet when the headmistress is talking.<eos> Understand?<eos> Now go back to your seat.<eos> I'll call the roll for you. You'll see.
Do not trust anyone.<eos> What is this?<eos> Community Catholics or pagans.<eos> In all of the controls that I had in our mission nisem video by pagan nations and fully intact.<eos> Brother, church and Weili, izuèila sent you, that these people cross your in by Christians.<eos> Rather than accept their faith, pagan customs and spells.<eos> Your task was to baptize this poor population living in poverty.<eos> You thought the material side.<eos> Enable the I have a better life, bought pisaæi sto...<eos> They love you because you find main, but only you.
It is inhuman, brother. Inhuman!<eos> I'm not your brother.<eos> We are all brothers in the eyes of God.<eos> All these people, are they your sisters and brothers?<eos> They most certainly are!<eos> Then you won't mind if they stay at your place, will ya?<eos> All right, folks, let's go.<eos> Put your bags here.<eos> Friends, don't worry.<eos> We shall find haven for you in our own homes... and it won't cost you one cent more than regular hotel rates.
Here's something off the record:<eos> The old man has a personal interest in this case, so don't fuck up.<eos> Are you all set, Cochise?<eos> On your feet.<eos> These guys are taking you to Portsmouth.<eos> Petty Officer Buddusky. Petty Officer Mulhall.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - You know why they're chasers?<eos> - "Chasers," sir?<eos> - Do you know why they're taking you?
Who's missing?<eos> Séverine? - She never comes to rushes.<eos> - I see.<eos> Roll it!<eos> - Alexandre's not here.<eos> - He's at the airport, as usual.<eos> - Why's he always there?<eos> - He must be expecting someone.<eos> I suspect trouble in his private life.<eos> Mother, I have to talk to you.
They're not even hiding.<eos> Why torment yourself, son?<eos> Be like me. Put them out of your thoughts.<eos> I can think of nothing else.<eos> Shall we go away, you and I?<eos> Far away? We can do whatever you like.<eos> I've made up my mind.<eos> I'm going to Paris... to kill them both.<eos> Scene 1, take 4.<eos> Mother, I have to talk to you.
Thank you.<eos> There will come a time, when those who sit above me will want you delivered.<eos> They'll give me so much play in the rope and then they'll pull it in.<eos> And then?<eos> Moscow is nice in the spring.<eos> There's a long winter, I hear.<eos> How are you going to get your wife out?<eos> I'll get her out.<eos> Come over.<eos> They'll get her out for you.
Man, I already got my tan.<eos> Let's talk now!<eos> I said walk!<eos> Walk or die!<eos> Very ingenious, Mr. Shaft.<eos> Forgive us, Mr. Shaft.<eos> This is Emir Ramila. Leader of the Manta tribe in East Africa.<eos> Out of my turf.<eos> This is Wassa, my brain and Ossiat, my strong right arm.<eos> They will prepare you.
Strip him!<eos> Drown him in the Titas!<eos> Oh!<eos> Not my clothes!<eos> Please don't do that.<eos> Not my clothes!<eos> Please, don't do that.<eos> Humiliating such a rich man?<eos> Hey, you! You're a fisherman, too.<eos> I'll finish all of you.
State interests on the market also profited ANIC...the oil industry his own investments.<eos> These things are common knowledge.<eos> That's not true.<eos> People never know the facts.<eos> I'm writing a book on Mattei. And everywhere I look, I find a school of sharks.<eos> It's true.<eos> At Cortemaggiore, there isn't much oil.<eos> We're looking for more.<eos> But there's methane.<eos> Lots of methane. This is why I asked you here.
- They left.<eos> What got into them?<eos> We were barely out 20 minutes.<eos> They had enough to drink., non You don't just leave like that!<eos> Why not stop them?<eos> They looked scared. They ran out.<eos> - Scared? - Scared of what?<eos> Good Morning, signora Senechal and signor Senechal.<eos> I'm Your Monsignor Dufour, bishop of this diocese..<eos> I'd like to speak with you.
They came and beat us all up<eos> We really started nothing You must have provoked them<eos> If they hadn't brought, this first...<eos> And... How did your Feng and Tien die?<eos> Do you know?<eos> No, we don't We really don't<eos> It's no simple affair<eos> The Japanese are powerful here<eos> You're asking for trouble<eos> I've been kind to you
-Nothing.<eos> -What about the basement?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Can't see anybody outside.<eos> -But I know they're there.<eos> -Crash through with the truck.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I can't make it.<eos> When the cops come, put your hands up and they won't harm you.
Why don't you go back to university to study?<eos> They earn more, they the owners earn 100<eos> Workers! You are entering prison!<eos> Today, after 8 hours of work, it will be dark<eos> For you today the light of the sun will not shine<eos> Workers! To split owners from union leaders<eos> We propose a revolutionary alliance between workers and students<eos> Between workers and students... more money less work!<eos> Good morning workers!<eos> The director wishes you good work In your interest, treat the machine you have been given with love
In the shop... in the evening nothing...<eos> Damn it! Don't you want to understand that to make 20 cards more each month I bust myself!<eos> And they attack me, tease me, they question me<eos> And I'm the one that suffers...<eos> Come on... come on...<eos> Don't behave like this<eos> Come here my love<eos> The three united unions call you to fight! Against the rhythms, against politics To fight for health and to earn more money<eos> And to have more time to be with your children and wives<eos> When you made 1000 pieces a day they gave you 300 lire Now you make 3000 with the new times and the piecework has remained the same
I have to ask for some information<eos> Who are those who were suspended?<eos> Me first of all... - Yeah but apart from you - De Simoni, De Antoni, Delori...<eos> And all these guys supposedly acted the heroes because of my finger?<eos> For you, for your finger... not for your finger!<eos> For the class war!<eos> Owners are more arrogant... - But why didn't they suspend you? Because he's a "straighty"'<eos> They know I'm good at my work.<eos> Owners!<eos> Good morning workers! The director wishes you good work
Is it true your grandfather hated it?<eos> So it seems.<eos> I salvaged it from the attic.<eos> It's worth millions.<eos> - Do you like it, Mama?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's a Corot, isn't it?<eos> - Don't you?<eos> - Not much.<eos> Of course not. Too dated for you.
- To talk with you... about the man today.<eos> What man?<eos> The one who was...<eos> He had a woman with him.<eos> Say what you want.<eos> We were talking - Mr Malson, Mr Beaudry.<eos> You know who I mean.<eos> And we were saying that... that maybe we should give something to the woman.<eos> - Now she don't have a man.<eos> - They send you out here?
She says I can if you say so.<eos> All right.<eos> You like it?<eos> I've never tasted it.<eos> Try it.<eos> You're taking a risk.<eos> I like having responsibilities.<eos> He likes you.<eos> Hope so.<eos> I'm telling you, he likes you.
I saw bottles of cognac arrive this morning.<eos> No need to worry, no?<eos> When I enlisted I thought this was my life.<eos> Any old way, we die and officers die too.<eos> But if they die, they die comfortably.<eos> Imagine... steak for breakfast, steak for lunch and steak for dinner.<eos> With their monthly income, my family would live a whole year.<eos> I haven't seen them for a long time.<eos> They called off the leave permits. I prefer to be in my house.<eos> Well, the house... I tell you the truth, it was no good in hoeing the ground... and I'm bad off here, no change, no nothing.
And don't run away! What are you ashamed of?<eos> Screw in peace, and then goodbye!<eos> Sonia...<eos> Sonia, I won't go without you. I can't be alone.<eos> I need you. I need everyone.<eos> I can't get rid of you and the others like shedding my skin...<eos> And then, Sonia, how do I start?<eos> There's you, my mother, friends... and all the people who love me.<eos> You hold me, Sonia! You close me off!<eos> Because you are those who love you! So you are born Jewish.
It's impossible not to be afraid of dying.<eos> But I'm too stubborn, too much of an animal to believe it.<eos> If I don't believe it to the very last moment, the last split second, I'll never die.<eos> What a revelation!<eos> The chief would love it.<eos> I've got to look into this more deeply -<eos> You will turn your backs to the machine guns and face the far wall.<eos> You will run as fast as you can.<eos> We will not open fire at once.<eos> We will give you a chance.
I can understand your feelings. You must see the big picture even you want to be filial.<eos> As men, you should know what's more important.<eos> If I'm still not back after the contest, then I'm sure other clans will have the same problem.<eos> The two of you won't be able to do much, you must contact the members of other clans and work on a revenge strategy. And no matter what, you must try to get Fang Gang's help.<eos> Hang on.<eos> The door is open, watch out...<eos> Your reputation dubs you as being invincible.<eos> Please accept our invitation.<eos> What if I decline?<eos> We've been ordered by the Eight Chiefs. We must escort you there.
No, that's not for me.<eos> If we divide up your room, we can get another one in there and earn more money.<eos> It's big enough, after all.<eos> I'll call the builder 'round on Monday and get an estimate.<eos> I want to know how much it'll all cost.<eos> And then I'll go to the army.<eos> It's better than working... and having ideas that never come to anything, and nothing changes.<eos> I'll have to go soon, too.<eos> I'd like to be posted on a submarine. That's something different from service on land.<eos> You have to go where they send you.
Look out!<eos> Lots of blood, then it stops. No track.<eos> - $10 says he's dead by now.<eos> - Take us a day to find him if he is.<eos> If he isn't, he has a gun on us right now.<eos> Let's go after the others.<eos> Just leave him here?<eos> He's worth money.<eos> Yes, you ride out tomorrow, that is if you can stay on your horse... and watch the buzzards.<eos> They'll show you where he is.
About the only thing I got is health.<eos> I wish I could dream though but I don't seem to be able to fall asleep.<eos> We'll get you something to make you sleep... it would be a crime if a girl like you couldn't sleep.<eos> I hope you're not frustrated, it'd be a pity.<eos> Now then, I think a prescription would be in order.<eos> I'll prescribe some sleeping pills, alright?<eos> With these pills, whenever you want to sleep, take one.<eos> You may take two if you like because they're not very strong.<eos> This product's innocuous but efficient my dear.<eos> Begin immediately, it'll fix you right up.
If Cardoza knows, the comandante knows.<eos> And now this trustee causes the death of Rivera.<eos> Tonight...<eos> Tonight we get him.<eos> What do you mean, "tonight we get him"?<eos> Bring him to the barracks.<eos> - Then what?<eos> - Kill him.<eos> Good.<eos> They wish to speak with you.
Panoramix won't give me any potion, that's not fair. Because I feel weak.<eos> You weak ?<eos> - Oh my oh my, here comes Stopthemusix !<eos> I shall now sing a lay in honour of Gaelic courage !<eos> Barbarians, they can't appreciate my art.<eos> Caligola Minus is now ready !<eos> - Good, let's go and see.<eos> Put him in chains!<eos> You're going for a stroll near the village of the Gauls.<eos> When the Gauls see you ... they'll rescue you. When you'll be within their gates, you'll learn their secret.
We can talk upstairs.<eos> - What I have to say is private.<eos> Can't get more private.<eos> Neither one of them speaks a word of English.<eos> Come on in!<eos> L hope this'll be friendlier than last time.<eos> - Couldn't be unfriendlier.<eos> Know why Pierce wanted you to kill me?<eos> So he could legally steal your land, once he found there was gold on it.<eos> You were just defending your ranch. But you got shot, framed and sent to jail.
Excuse me.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The banquet's about to start, why would you go?<eos> Can't you take a joke?<eos> Didn't you hear me say it was a joke?<eos> A joke!<eos> You all go after him!<eos> And he won't leave me be!<eos> I don't want to hear any more. The young lady told me everything.<eos> I told you to bring them the shortest way but I never allowed you your silly games.
You know what she said to the "portiere" ?<eos> I'm so broad in the beam I can't even ride the bicycle.<eos> Yes, she must be a nymphomaniac, sure !<eos> I've got to tell you this.<eos> A man knocked at her door, he was selling books.<eos> She came to the door in her negligee.<eos> "Isn't it hot today ? Terrible !".<eos> And he said: "Don't let me stop you from doing what you were doing". Then she took off the negligee...<eos> She didn't have a stitch on !<eos> Say hello to Julia. They're coming to take you for a ride ? Nice!
Same damn thing, except they don't have any heat.<eos> They gotta exercise to keep from freezing.<eos> Well, I got a little exercise for your boys.<eos> I wanna patrol tonight, try to pick up some prisoners.<eos> Well, there they are.<eos> - Hey, sarge, put those blankets back.<eos> - Come on, shut the window.<eos> What do you wanna do that for, sarge?<eos> They're out of range. They'll shoot back with something heavier.<eos> It's you or them, dogface.
Driver, to your place!<eos> - But this is a wonderful place, a paradise! - It's nice here! How lovely.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> ! Go fetch their suitcases. Immediately!<eos> - Cute Italian!<eos> - And you're cute too!<eos> - Dankeschön.<eos> I'm sorry the trip was so short.<eos> - Thanks for the ride.<eos> - Thanks to you for the grope, Fräulein.
Why did you laugh, then, when I said "man delights not me"?<eos> I thought what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you.<eos> We coted them on the way.<eos> And hither are they coming, to offer you service.<eos> What players are they?<eos> The tragedians of the city.<eos> Those you were wont to take such delight in.<eos> He that plays the king shall be welcome.<eos> The appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony.<eos> Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players should more appear like entertainment than yours.
Stop thinking about yourself!<eos> Don't think about me either.<eos> Let's leave things the way they are... and go our separate ways.<eos> Tonight I'm taking the car, and I'm going to tell your sons the truth. "I'm rich. I'm this, that and the other.<eos> Dummi'!<eos> Leave them alone!<eos> - Let me go! - Don't set them against each other! - Let me go!<eos> - Stay away from them, for God's sake!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Remember I told you to stay away from my children!
What are you gonna do with her?<eos> This bitch will be our toy. We're gonna have some fun.<eos> Look what we can do!<eos> Damn it...<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop! Wait!<eos> Oyasu!<eos> Move away.<eos> I'm gonna kill you...<eos> Bastards, I'll kill every last one of you!
But the law is made here.<eos> We all make it together.<eos> But apparently this doesn't suit De Vita either.<eos> You investigated me. What did you discover?<eos> Not a thing.<eos> All this makes me wonder if what you really want is for those people to go on living in hovels so you can carry on your usual propaganda.<eos> It's true.<eos> The law is made in this hall, and you have greater power at the moment.<eos> We always will!<eos> But you take advantage of your political power with no concern for those who elected you.
Make us hurry, pay us orderly.<eos> Sounds as if you were working for nothing, eh?<eos> We work a half-an hour extra-time every day...<eos> But you never pay for it.<eos> I'm disgusted with that work.<eos> I think I'll become a bar hostess.<eos> Bar hostess?<eos> Why don't you come with me?<eos> But, I have no other kimonos than this.<eos> They lend you nice clothes.
Little monster. Honey, don't you think you ought to go and sit with her or something?<eos> If she wants to leave, shall I say yes?<eos> I guess so. Don't worry. I'm not going to jump.<eos> - Hey, Joe?<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> Come here a minute, will you?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - I'm Mr. Hobbs. - Glad to meet you, sir.<eos> Say, Joe, uh, I was just wondering, could you use five bucks?<eos> But it's just a matter of time, darling. They don't know you yet, and, besides, boys are shy at first too.
Bye! Good-bye.<eos> - The Turners are here. They're a little early. - Oh.<eos> Fine. - Well.<eos> - Oh, uh, uh, this is my husband, Roger. - How do you do?<eos> My name is Turner. - How do you do, sir?<eos> - And Mrs. Turner.<eos> - Mrs. Turner. How do you do?<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - We didn't expect you so soon, but...<eos> Well, we got a little ahead of our schedule... so we thought we might spend a few days with you. - Uh, a few days.
By the way, Paul, I expect the music tomorrow morning,<eos> I want you to listen to it,<eos> They've done a wonderful recording job,<eos> I'm sure you'll like it,<eos> Fine, I want to hear them as soon as possible,<eos> No, no, no, enough with sake,<eos> Sake, You know, I like sake,<eos> I'm gonna have a couple of cases sent out to California,<eos> You know, I have to finish casting before I look for locations,<eos> Well, they certainly should help you with all the casting,
A kind of rivalry...<eos> I want to tell you something.<eos> Your behavior disappointed me.<eos> First, Jean-Claude and Alain fought over you. Now it's Raymond and Bacchus.<eos> They had an argument over you because each one said he'd won you.<eos> I said I'd ask you about it. You've got to decide.<eos> I didn't make any advances.<eos> No, but you accepted their advances.<eos> You encourage them.<eos> That's what I criticize you for.
You're not having anything Mister Xatis?<eos> Don't you worry, for me a drop of coffee is enough.<eos> I'm sorry, there's nothing left but tea.<eos> Would you care for a bit of my coffee?<eos> -No thanks. I'll have a bit of tea.<eos> I'm sorry, we drank that too.<eos> -If only we had known.<eos> It's not important. Let's not waste any more time.<eos> Let's reconstruct this crime! Let's go! Speed it up!<eos> You too gentlemen!
- In view of the threat of mutiny, we...<eos> - It's not mutiny yet, Captain.<eos> Your challenge was not taken up by the men.<eos> All our trouble stems from the fanatical desire on the part of some, not all of them, to go home.<eos> I'd rather have a small loyal crew than risk further sabotage.<eos> - Admiral...<eos> - That's enough, Captain.<eos> Men, you have 15 minutes to make your decision.<eos> Please have any in the sick bay that want to go placed aboard the yacht.<eos> One of you doctors better go along.
He'll have forgotten by tomorrow.<eos> -All right, I'll try again.<eos> -Nicole!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Go inside!<eos> The block leader's leaving.<eos> I might get picked to replace her.<eos> If so, they'll need a new Kapo for this hut.<eos> I could put your name forward.<eos> Tell your friends about all I do for you. And get busy!
Of course, what a wonderful idea!<eos> Do you know what we can do?<eos> Let's play the "Why?" game.<eos> Why did we come here?<eos> Why are we waiting?<eos> Why do we see each other every damn day?<eos> Why are we always the same faces?<eos> Wasn't it your idea that we all come here to welcome back Marina?<eos> But of course!<eos> I'm here because I'm waiting for Marina you guys are watching me wait, and us three are watching you two.
Right.<eos> Jackson'll be by with the launch. I will send you in to town with him.<eos> Damn it...<eos> Now look what you've done.<eos> Knucklehead!<eos> Clean up that mess.<eos> Where was I?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Thing to do is let the people over at the church know about you.<eos> They'll straighten you away. Old Pee Wee.
I object to the implication I was signalling.<eos> This is the shabbiest courtroom trick I've ever seen.<eos> You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.<eos> I ask the court to rule on my objection.<eos> Will you be careful not to place yourself between Mr. Biegler and his witness?<eos> Of course, Your Honour.<eos> Anything else, Mr. Biegler?<eos> You do it again, I'll punt you all the way out into the middle of Lake Superior.<eos> Gentlemen, this rowing has got to stop.<eos> The next one of you that speaks out of turn will have me to deal with.
WHERE ARE LEONARDO, REMBRANDT, LUDWIG ?<eos> ALIVE. ALIVE. ALIVE.<eos> THEY WERE BORN.<eos> BRING ON THE MULTITUDE WITH A MULTITUDE OF FISHES.<eos> FEED THEM TO THE FISHES FOR LIVER OIL... TO NOURISH THE ARTIST.<eos> STRETCHTHEIRSKINS UPONANEASEL... TOGIVEHIMCANVAS. CRUSHTHEIRBONES INTOA PASTE...<eos> LETTHEMDIE. AND BY THEIR MISERABLE DEATHS... BECOME THE CLAY WITHIN HIS HANDS...<eos> FOR ALL THAT IS COMES THROUGH THE EYE OF THE ARTIST.<eos> THE REST ARE BLIND FISH SWIMMING IN THE CAVE OF ALONENESS.<eos> SWIM ON, YOU MAUDLIN, MUDDLING, MADDENED FOOLS. AND DREAM THAT ONE BRIGHT AND SUNNY NIGHT, SOME ARTIST WILL BAIT A HOOK AND LET YOU BITE UPON IT.
THAT'S BETTER.<eos> HE'S ONLY ASLEEP, MISS REYNOLDS.<eos> WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A STATE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION.<eos> BOB!<eos> [Franz] BE PATIENT. HE'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.<eos> THIS FRESH AIR WILL REVIVE HIM IN NO TIME.<eos> YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I ENJOY THESE LITTLE REUNIONS.<eos> [Franz] YOU FUNNY LITTLE PEOPLE.<eos> I WONDER WHY IT IS YOU ALWAYS HATE ME SO AT FIRST.<eos> I HAVEN'T REALLY HARMED YOU.
How do you know?<eos> One of his letters, I suppose.<eos> - Well, that rules him out.<eos> - I don't see why.<eos> - I don't take other women's men.<eos> - But it would be so easy.<eos> And it would be such good practice for you, darling.<eos> And he'd never suspect. Not in a million years.<eos> It's amazing the way people don't. They don't believe there are such things.<eos> I sit in the subway sometimes, or in buses, or at the movies and I look at the people near me, and I think: "What would you say if I told you I was a witch?"
Let's start packing.<eos> And now, be good enough to have my bill sent up.<eos> Goodbye, young man.<eos> And don't think that love can find a way.<eos> I know all the ways.<eos> Here he comes!<eos> - Pleased to have you again.<eos> - Pleasure to be here.<eos> - I want my men taken care of.<eos> - We'll take you to your rooms.
PETE, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?<eos> I DON'T KNOW YET.<eos> BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW FOR SURE-- THEY'RE WRONG, AND I'M RIGHT! I'D STAKE MY VERY LIFE ON THAT.<eos> AND BEFORE I LEAVE THIS LOT, I INTEND TO PROVE THAT I'M RIGHT.<eos> WEREWOLF. FRANKENSTEIN. THEY WANT TO PUT AN END TO US.<eos> NO.<eos> NO, I'LL DESTROY THEM FIRST. AND I'LL USE THE VERY MONSTERS THEY MOCKED<eos> I HEARD VOICES. ONLY MINE.<eos> YOU WERE TALKING TO YOURSELF? NOT ENTIRELY. I WAS REASSURING MY CHILDREN<eos> I'LL SHOW YOU. Pete: THOSE FOOLS.
Was it scripted or did Hitch simply say, "Go and make a nightmare sequence?"<eos> How was this put together, and the animation also?<eos> The actual screenplay did not contain all the information, as it usually did, about the way the camera should be used or the way the light should be used.<eos> This scene is credited to John Ferren.<eos> The main title says, "Special sequence by John Ferren."<eos> This is the only one we could think of that he might have done.<eos> Mr Coleman recalls his first day on the set of Rear Window.<eos> The very first day on the production of Rear Window, I shot from Jimmy Stewart's viewpoint of the whole stage.<eos> We had, I guess altogether, about 150-200 people and early in the morning I had warned all the people - most of them knew me, because we'd worked together - that I was going to ask for quiet, as I always did,<eos> and if people around you didn't respond, please say, "Herbie has asked for quiet."
Can you feel no shame?<eos> Across the river, a cannon is buried in the mud.<eos> We need your help.<eos> I do not ask you to die. Or even to bleed. Just to sweat a little.<eos> So you can tell your children that Algado sweat for the Resistance.<eos> And those of you... who are still Spanish... can follow me.<eos> Your face is dirty.<eos> You can't risk it.<eos> We have to.<eos> They outnumber you, and there's a gun for every man.
- Good night.<eos> Dr. Marvin. I don't like this watchdog routine any better than you do.<eos> I'm under orders, I have a job to do.<eos> We're both on the same side.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just tired and worried.<eos> - I know.<eos> You were there. You heard both sides.<eos> Who do you agree with?<eos> I agree with you about the urgency, but they're right too.
-It's the chauffeur's job to carry it<eos> Our chauffeurs aren't doing their job<eos> Enjoy your holiday, Headmaster<eos> Isn't Madame down yet?<eos> The ladies left as I was ringing the bell<eos> Madame, and Mademoiselle Horner. I thought you knew, sir<eos> Yes, ofcourse...<eos> I had forgotten<eos> It's annoying, though<eos> One of you gentlemen will have to remain in charge of the boys being punished
Oh, Robert?<eos> Wait a minute, please.<eos> One more chance to save my wife from a terrible fate.<eos> Sonya's threatening...<eos> You're wasting your breath.<eos> Where's that bracelet?<eos> It's in your apartment, in my suitcase. Sonya is...<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To my apartment.<eos> Say one more word, and I'll throw those bloodhounds at you.
- My ring!<eos> Relax. It's a fake.<eos> - A fake worth a million.<eos> - No kidding!<eos> This changes everything.<eos> We need Tony alive now.<eos> It adds up. The Italian's got the hots for Viviane. He's Mario's pal.<eos> Mario's in with Tony, who's just done a stretch... for a jewel heist!<eos> This morning, the Webb job... and now this!<eos> It adds up, I tell you.
A man has to console himself when his girl strolls off with somebody else... Into a stable.<eos> I'm not your girl, and leave me alone.<eos> Go back to the saloon, where you belong.<eos> Decent people don't want you around.<eos> - Decent? Caroline?<eos> I don't have to account to you.<eos> You had your chance, and you gambled it away.<eos> I'll get more money.<eos> You'd be surprised how many rich relatives I have in Boston.<eos> They don't want you around, and I don't, either.
We're all here, aren't we?<eos> Who are the other witnesses?<eos> I asked, please, who are the other witnesses.<eos> As I said before, it was me.<eos> - Ah, good, thanks.<eos> But I meant the ones for the groom. - I am one.<eos> And I was the other.<eos> - Good.<eos> Then we're all set.<eos> Then we need one of you.. - Excuse me.

I wish Your Eminence did not misunderstand.<eos> Mine is a sentiment of pity, not of weakness.<eos> Isn't there room for another sentiment.. in the magnanimous breast of a Spanish general?<eos> - Which one?<eos> Justice.<eos> And now come with me, let us show ourselves together.<eos> They were so frightened. And now they'll calm down, you'll see.<eos> Come on, smile.<eos> Come, Duke, come with me.<eos> Come on, you too.
And try to pray, my child.<eos> This will help resist temptation.<eos> I will pray.<eos> And as for that other man, you should not see him for any reason.<eos> This shouldn't be difficult, since you don't love him.<eos> If he insists, if he shows up, send him away.<eos> I will.<eos> Gino...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> They might see you!
You spineless coward!<eos> Don't look.<eos> Eat your supper and start your night work!<eos> Hurry up and eat!<eos> Get in here.<eos> Where did you two come from?<eos> Come here. Tell me.<eos> There's no need to be afraid.<eos> Do you have parents?<eos> They sold you?
The boat is leaving.<eos> Come on, hurry.<eos> You are not coming aboard?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I'm looking for a woman named Nakagimi.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> Nakagimi?<eos> She must be a courtesan.<eos> There are brothels over there.<eos> They can tell you.
- Certainly.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Please, make yourself comfortable.<eos> - With pleasure.<eos> No! No! Excuse me...<eos> Catalucci, watch what you're doing.<eos> It's nothing. Please, sit...<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> I feel the need to congratulate you on the magnificent efficiency of the police.
I want you never to leave my side again.<eos> Let's leave this manor and return to my native province.<eos> Genjuro, you are my husband for life.<eos> You will accompany me, won't you?<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> I've been...<eos> I've been lying to you.<eos> I have a wife and child.<eos> I left them back home in the chaos of the war.<eos> You must leave all that behind you now.
- The massage, the massage.<eos> Is it ready?<eos> - Ready.<eos> - Hello, hello! - Hello.<eos> - Hello!<eos> Hello, hello. - Who is it?<eos> - The doctor.<eos> - What does the doctor want?<eos> Well, it was you who called me!<eos> - Who, who called you? They called you, not me!
Don't you know?<eos> - The last time I saw him, he was with you.<eos> He's probably waiting for me down at Charlie's.<eos> - Yes, that's it.<eos> I think I'll go and join him for a nightcap.<eos> Charlie's stays open late.<eos> Excuse me, I want to say goodbye to some of my friends before I leave.<eos> None of those people are your friends but I want you to know that I am.<eos> Thank you, Doctor, and I'm yours.<eos> - They underestimate you. As I did.
I'm the only one going anyplace.<eos> - Where, Cody?<eos> - Gonna give myself up.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You haven't a chance.<eos> Four dead.<eos> It's the gas chamber for sure.<eos> You think I'm dumb enough to give myself up to the T-men?<eos> What's the difference?<eos> You walk into the cops and they turn you over.
It has cheated us of enough.<eos> So let's forget it and start from scratch.<eos> Mr. Bündner, you were always very good to me.<eos> If you can do me one more big favour, take Kuni into your house.<eos> I will never be able to refuse a request of yours, Miss Silvelie.<eos> If there's a god in heaven, Silvelie, then you should be paid back for that.<eos> You must do well.<eos> Oh, you must do well, Silvelie.<eos> I hope you become happy.<eos> And, Silvelie, if anything happens, if anyone wants to harm you... You or a loved one of yours, I won't say anything.
- I'm quitting.<eos> I paid your fee to farm on that land.<eos> I'm paying you good wages.<eos> I'm feeding you.<eos> I'm giving you $1,000 for that quarter section.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> You don't get it, there ain't enough money in the world to keep me there.<eos> I'm quitting.<eos> I ain't never going back there, he'll kill me.<eos> I'll send some men out there with you every night.
I come no more.<eos> White flag not on pole when time stick burn there, all die.<eos> Mama.<eos> We'll hold our fire exactly six minutes.<eos> That means attack.<eos> Post what additional men you have on the higher bastion.<eos> This birch bark will burn fast.<eos> Detail dismissed. Captain Ecuyer should make this decision.<eos> He's a sick man.<eos> You'd better decide for yourself or they'll decide for you.
I hate to bother you at this time of night but I figure it's important enough.<eos> You know, there's been another murder.<eos> Yes, so I've heard.<eos> What I want to say is that we've traced the murderer to this vicinity.<eos> -Are you certain?<eos> -Yes, that's why I've come here.<eos> That's why I'm asking everyone to be careful.<eos> Keep your doors and windows locked tonight.<eos> Well, I'll see that your orders are carried out, constable.<eos> I'm especially worried about that girl who works for you.
-Where's Giovannino?<eos> He went to buy something, I don't know what. -It must be a surprise. -The radio-gramophone.<eos> I must go.<eos> A very distinguished gentleman is expecting me.<eos> -Did everything go Ok? -As smooth as oil!<eos> -I'm pleased. 'Bye.<eos> Going to deliver the case?<eos> It was high time!<eos> That very distinguished gentleman is ill.<eos> If he dies... Which of you is Gaetano Schioppa?
Sometimes I even wake up at night and think I can hear him barking.<eos> After what you and your friends have faced, I suppose I sound rather silly.<eos> No, you're not silly.<eos> It isn't silly to have something dear to your heart and to talk about it.<eos> A man who lives for himself is very empty.<eos> The others, they talk about their girls, their wives and children.<eos> You talk about your dog, because you love him.<eos> Now, remember, hide by day and travel by night.<eos> And don't try to contact the underground.<eos> They'll find you.
I must be catching cold.<eos> No, dea. It was Reveend Hape who sneezed.<eos> Bless you.<eos> We mustn't be angy with Motime.<eos> He's so vey much in love with he.<eos> Siste Matha and I ae so happy.<eos> He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now he's in Booklyn six nights a week.<eos> Remembe now, watch you language.<eos> You know I'm not a sweaing man.<eos> You'd be supised what they'd conside sweaing.
Maybe... Maybe if I ask him he'll let you go to the picture show Sunday.<eos> Wouldn't that be something?<eos> Go ahead, Charlie.<eos> Let it down easy, Charlie.<eos> Charlie's a little anxious.<eos> Well, brothers and sisters, once again we're going to have a little entertainment.<eos> I guess I don't have to tell you what it is - the sheet kind of gives it away.<eos> And once again, brothers and sisters, we're going to share our pleasure with some neighbours less fortunate than ourselves.<eos> Won't you please clear the first three pews so they may have seats?<eos> And when they get here, I'm going to ask you once more, neither by word, nor by action, nor by look, to make our guests feel unwelcome, or draw away from them, or act high-toned.
Oh, Robert?<eos> Wait a minute, please.<eos> One more chance to save my wife from a terrible fate.<eos> Sonya's threatening...<eos> You're wasting your breath.<eos> Where's that bracelet?<eos> It's in your apartment, in my suitcase. Sonya is...<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To my apartment.<eos> Say one more word, and I'll throw those bloodhounds at you.
You knew it was for tomorrow night.<eos> Yeah, I guess it wasn't such a hot idea.<eos> You mean you did it on purpose?<eos> Tony, that's dreadful.<eos> How could you do such a thing?<eos> I didn't want to bring them down here at all, but you insisted.<eos> If they have to meet you, I want them to meet you as you are.<eos> Not on some trumped-up evening with everybody acting unnaturally.<eos> There's nothing unnatural in wanting them to like us.<eos> If they don't like you the way you are, too bad.
- You can't go in.<eos> - Watch me!<eos> - Are you Anthony Powell? - Who are you?<eos> - Never mind. - What... - Why do you refuse to see people...?<eos> - That's MY business.<eos> - A girl fainted because of it.<eos> - I didn't know. - You won't, if you don't see people.<eos> A great actress could be out there, but you'd never give her a chance!<eos> - Are YOU a great actress?<eos> - Never mind. Those girls need you! They need to be noticed.
- Lieutenant Manetti.<eos> Lieutenant Monti.<eos> - Lieutenant De Paola.<eos> Lieutenant Mandari.<eos> - Lieutenant Corsi.<eos> Lieutenant De Frasseneto.<eos> Lieutenant Bignami.<eos> - Lieutenant Berlingeri.<eos> Lieutenant Giorgi.<eos> I tell you immediately that life is hard here in the school.
She's upset because Godfrey didn't fall down in a faint when we got in today.<eos> Why should Godfrey fall in a faint?<eos> He didn't make enough fuss over her homecoming to suit her.<eos> Well, Godfrey's not the fussing kind. Shh.<eos> Godfrey, I was just telling my daughters you missed them while they were away.<eos> Oh, yes, I did.<eos> Very much, indeed.<eos> - We missed you too, didn't we, Irene?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I missed you, also.
Yes, my wife has got some excellent qualities.<eos> But it seems they cause her more harm than good.<eos> - Harm? What harm?<eos> Yes!<eos> The harm that comes from envy and gossip.<eos> Oh!<eos> - You look a little nervous.<eos> Nervous... Do you expect me to be pleased by what happened today at the duty gate?<eos> I care not so much for me, but for your Excellencies.<eos> You honor me so often, and this slander offends you more than myself.
- ls everything alright?<eos> - Look, look !<eos> Move!<eos> Enough!<eos> Go!<eos> - Here it is!<eos> - Very well.<eos> Take your places, gentlemen!<eos> Places, gentlemen.<eos> Young ladies, you also!
Okay!<eos> There!<eos> You made your point, take your fucking pictures!<eos> Show us your pussy, Ian.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I don't have a pussy!<eos> I don't have a pussy!<eos> So make one.<eos> Are you fucking bitches fucked in the head?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Uh-huh. He's much less stressed than I am about me starting medical school while I'll still be nursing our newborn.<eos> Life just keeps throwing us curve balls, doesn't it?<eos> Curve balls filled with anxiety.<eos> Hank, why are you so wound up about your father's wedding?<eos> (SIGHS) It's the old Eddie all over again, forcing me to question even the most joyous occasion.<eos> I can't accept that it's as simple as he's making it sound, that suddenly, he has life all figured out and is ready to settle down.<eos> Is it possible that it's not about Eddie, that it's about you?<eos> Maybe you're measuring yourself up against your father.<eos> Maybe I am. Him and everyone else too.<eos> Evan's married and trying to start a family, so are you, and I couldn't be happier for you guys.
It's just, I'm surprised someone as hygienically sensitive as you is roughing it like that.<eos> I outgrew my hypochondria.<eos> The world has much, much bigger problems than I do.<eos> The least I can do is my small part of addressing them.<eos> That's a really healthy attitude, Libby. - I'm really proud of you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Is Tucker a part of this movement?<eos> Like my hypochondria, it turns out Tucker was just a bit of a phase. - Oh, I hadn't heard.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I really thought you guys were one of those couples.
- Yep.<eos> See you.<eos> Boat safely.<eos> So... we're sorry we couldn't be more helpful with the court.<eos> You know, the truth is, we couldn't have kept things up the way they were.<eos> I mean, I couldn't have.<eos> It was just too much to handle, without some serious help.<eos> Well, we're glad you put it that way.<eos> Lena, how would you feel about... staying with us for a while?<eos> All of you.
I mean, I couldn't have.<eos> It was just too much to handle, without some serious help.<eos> Well, we're glad you put it that way.<eos> Lena, how would you feel about... staying with us for a while?<eos> All of you.<eos> We could foster you.<eos> On a trial basis, just to see how it works for everyone.<eos> But isn't it too late for...<eos> We already spoke to the social worker, and she wants to help us make this work.<eos> But you guys barely know us. Why would you want to do something like that?
You always do.<eos> Handsome, uh, there's been a delay here, so I think I need you and your buddies to be extra generous with the pours so the natives don't get restless.<eos> You got it. I will spread the word.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - There you are.<eos> Delia is asking for all of us.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I don't want to be mad at you.<eos> Oh... be whatever you want, hon.<eos> I've been a sucky friend to all of you, and you have a real situation here.
Barbara, can you handle Gordon's mom?<eos> - Uh, uh, sure.<eos> - Okay, let's do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Carol, Delia sent me...<eos> - Where are they?<eos> People are milling.<eos> It's not good when people are milling.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> Thank you all so much for all your love and support, but I have unfortunate news.
- Where are they?<eos> People are milling.<eos> It's not good when people are milling.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> Thank you all so much for all your love and support, but I have unfortunate news.<eos> All this excitement has gotten to Gordon, and...<eos> His stomach is...<eos> He's not keeping his food down, if you know what I mean.<eos> He's got the runs. He's down for the count.<eos> But he has implored me to implore you to enjoy the meal and the entertainment we've planned for you.
That you were lonely and desperate, because after you tried to get back with your ex and that failed, you went after Harris, and he dumped you.<eos> I guess I over-shared with him a little bit.<eos> Jesus, what were you thinking?<eos> Why are you attacking me, Barbara?<eos> I just... I-I didn't...<eos> I mean, I thought I still had some sort of semblance of a private life.<eos> Well, you were wrong.<eos> Hey.<eos> Your... your front door was open.<eos> Yeah. I left it open for you.
Maybe after this, uh, crap-fest is over, you and I could get a... Oh.<eos> Hey, um... you seem nice... but I am just out of a hellish marriage myself.<eos> Oh. That sucks.<eos> How long ago?<eos> Three years.<eos> I know what I want to do.<eos> I want to get shitfaced.<eos> - That can be arranged.<eos> - Epiphany. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You know the greatest thing about you guys being my only friends here is?
All I wanted my whole life was to find a man who would love me, because I thought that was gonna make me happy.<eos> Because at the end of the day, I was still that 12-year-old girl who felt like she was gonna die because she really wanted a boyfriend and couldn't get one.<eos> Anyway... tonight I am celebrating one year as a single woman.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Which is something I never thought I could do, nor did I want to.<eos> I spent my whole life trying to avoid being alone because I was terrified.<eos> But after this experience, it's like, this rules.<eos> Not only did I not die from loneliness like I thought I would,<eos> I never even really felt alone, probably because you guys were forcing me to hang out with you.
- Oh, okay.<eos> Hi, Susan.<eos> Hi, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I got time.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did I...<eos> Did I do something?<eos> Was it me?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> No, no, it was an honor working with you, too.
Thought you might want some female company.<eos> Caroline.<eos> Look who's back.<eos> Caro, lovely to see you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Morning, Sandy.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Hi, darling.<eos> Great to see you.<eos> Er, listen, I just need a few minutes with the young prince here, so why don't you girls go and lay waste to the local bazaar?
I want my money.<eos> Now! We better leave.<eos> We mustn't be seen...<eos> I want the full amount returned to me.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> If you do not pay, there will be consequences.<eos> Don't you dare threaten me!<eos> Who do you think did this?<eos> Arab militia!<eos> Little brown rats like the rest of you!
You're buying off me now, OK?<eos> Piss off.<eos> I would advise a different business language from now on.<eos> Try it.<eos> Try it. No!<eos> Who was that?<eos> You OK?<eos> Let's try a little thought experiment here.<eos> Take all the things you own, clothes, house, car, and ask yourself what part of all that did not depend on commerce and the free of movement of capital.<eos> For the benefit of the hard of thinking in the room, I'll give you the answer. The answer is none.
I'll do my best.<eos> So, tell us about Limpet.<eos> Well, Limpet's an ongoing anti-arms operation based in Washington.<eos> Standard tracer op. It's been running about a year.<eos> Who are you going after?<eos> Richard Onslow Roper.<eos> Director of Iron Last, and we think a lot more on the side.<eos> That wouldn't surprise me.<eos> I came here to see if there were opportunities for mutual collaboration and intelligence sharing.<eos> Angela was happy to come on board, and I was hoping you folks would kind of do the same.
It's possible they were discussing a future arms deal.<eos> Did you get any audio on that?<eos> Unfortunately not, no.<eos> So it's possible they were discussing their children's Christmas parties!<eos> What about on the ground?<eos> Got anyone close to Roper?<eos> Er, not right now, no...<eos> In development?<eos> You know, getting someone on the inside, Harry, that's a long game.<eos> - What I want from you guys...
- celebrating.<eos> - Right.<eos> Walking around, had a few beers.<eos> And then I impressed you all with my arm.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The milk bottles.<eos> I knocked them over.<eos> No, I... I knocked them over.<eos> Hell, no, you didn't knock them over.<eos> You guys were cheering me on. I couldn't have done it without you.
You made it back from Juba.<eos> Yeah, man, I hitched a ride on an Army transport.<eos> Your tax dollars hard at work.<eos> Well, it's a hell of a turnout.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> Coming inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, it's just a church.<eos> That's all.<eos> Maybe you guys... knew Kelly better than I did.
There's a void here today.<eos> We all feel it.<eos> We're all stunned and confused.<eos> In all that confusion, let's not forget about what's really important...<eos> Troy, and all that he gave.<eos> Ann?<eos> Would you like to say a few words?<eos> John and I have, um, been around the block a few times.<eos> We're at that age where we're losing some of our dearest friends, people we've known all our lives.<eos> But so many of you are so young.
Dad...?<eos> Look at you.<eos> My little girl.<eos> - It's so bright in here.<eos> Alice, love.<eos> Mum?<eos> 11 years, we've waited.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You haven't changed, Mum.<eos> Neither of you.
Huh. Doesn't take up the whole room.<eos> Think of a counter argument, but I...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dude, I was just fucking joking.<eos> You were fucking...<eos> Totally fucking with you.<eos> You know what?<eos> I need to go for a run.<eos> You're gonna go right now for...<eos> I'm happy for you guys.
Oh, God!<eos> Yeah, I see your point.<eos> Honestly, though, it's kind of a fucking moot point.<eos> We got to figure out something else.<eos> We can't afford this place.<eos> How much money do you guys have between the three of you?<eos> Maybe a few thousand dollars.<eos> That's if you really pool it all together, and that's for the entire school year.<eos> So use that as a down payment, throw a rush event, get a bunch of members.<eos> They'll pay their dues, plus you'll have an army of people to make money for you.
Yes, I'll be your best man, dude.<eos> I love you.<eos> Love you, dude.<eos> You, too!<eos> - Come over here.<eos> - Get over here!<eos> I have two brothers now.<eos> I see your shitty be-yourself party is even more popular than your fucking sell-out party.<eos> So, that's fantastic.<eos> Actually, it's really good for you because we are prepared to give back to you for helping us with your escrowdom.
You got a smoke?<eos> I'm fucking talking to you!<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> You understand?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What you doing?<eos> I need to use the toilet.<eos> You should have gone in the lift.<eos> Get a move on.<eos> You two, wait in here.
He refuses to travel.<eos> He isn't romantic.<eos> He doesn't remember my birthday or anniversary.<eos> She doesn't find me sexually appealing.<eos> Uh, he can't stand my family.<eos> She hates classical music and must have a dog, and I hate dogs.<eos> So, um, are there any things that you agree on?<eos> Neither one of us likes guacamole.<eos> Okay, that's a beginning.<eos> I mean, it's really obvious that the two of you love each other, and I think we can build on guacamole.
I haven't been a very affectionate husband... but it's no use saying that now.<eos> Here he is!<eos> Your wife is even more beautiful than I remember, Bezukhov.<eos> To the health of beautiful women, Petrushka - and their lovers.<eos> I challenge you!<eos> Count Bezukhov?<eos> If I might...<eos> Look here, you don't want to be fighting a duel with this fellow.<eos> Apologise, say you lost your temper.<eos> No-one will think any the worse of you. No.
Well... I'll just...<eos> What have you done now?<eos> What have I done?<eos> You've made an exhibition of yourself, and of me.<eos> Someone told you that Dolokhov was my lover, and you believed them.<eos> Now you've made us the talk of all Moscow.<eos> Are you asking me to believe that you're innocent?<eos> Of course I am innocent!<eos> Though no-one would blame me if I had taken a lover.<eos> It's not much fun being married to a drunken oaf like you, you know.

Then I'd better say nothing about myself at all.<eos> How is your mazurka coming along, Natasha?<eos> Well, we thought we were doing very well, until until Denisov told us we were doing it all wrong. - You did.<eos> - What do you know about it, Denisov?<eos> Oh, I was dancing the mazurka in Poland when you were still in petticoats, my boy!<eos> Really?<eos> The way they used to teach us in Poland...<eos> Have you always lived with the family, Sonya?<eos> Yes, since I was a little girl.<eos> Nikolai speaks so warmly of you, and now I can see why.
- A mazurka! - A-ha!<eos> I knew we had one somewhere!<eos> Come on, Denisov. We've heard you boasting, now you can show us what you can do!<eos> - No, no, no. - Yes!<eos> Make him, Father!<eos> No excuse, Denisov, you might as well submit.<eos> - Yes, best idea all night.<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> Denisov, you're a wonderful dancer! I had no idea.<eos> For you - all for you.
Mamma's not pleased.<eos> She told Sonya that Dolokhov's a very good match for a girl with no prospects.<eos> But I'm glad she refused him. - Aren't you?<eos> - Yes, yes, of course I am.<eos> But I should talk to her about it.<eos> Yes, I'll get her to come down.<eos> So, he really proposed to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't want him to.<eos> You know, as Mamma said, it would be a good match for you.
A school, your Excellency? Yes, indeed.<eos> Every boy should have the chance to learn to read and write.<eos> And the girls, too.<eos> But where will the teacher come from, your Excellency?<eos> Oh, there are teachers everywhere.<eos> Just build the school and the teachers will come!<eos> Now! Grain stores.<eos> Hello.<eos> Grain stores.<eos> Oh, it's you.
Thank you for inviting me, Dolokhov.<eos> You've been a stranger lately.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> But you're still my...<eos> I mean, everything's all right between us?<eos> Why wouldn't it be?<eos> Why don't you join us at the table?<eos> Or are you afraid of playing with me?<eos> I haven't any money with me.<eos> That's all right, I trust you.
Not practical, I suppose, but who am I to talk of such things?<eos> I'm very fond of him.<eos> The whole family are delightful.<eos> Well, there you are.<eos> You can mix business with pleasure!<eos> Do tell your father that I shall do my very best to make my contribution to the militia.<eos> I've been very lax.<eos> Do you know, I moved the family to the country to save money, but somehow, I've been doing more entertaining here than I ever did in Moscow - hunts, theatricals, dinners, musicians, endless guests coming to stay...<eos> Well, I shan't be any further burden to you...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, my dear fellow, I didn't mean you.
He is my greatest friend.<eos> He loves you very dearly.<eos> I think you're his hero.<eos> Have you seen him lately?<eos> He's had so much trouble, I think, and none of it his fault.<eos> I saw him just before I came here.<eos> I believe he's put his sorrows behind him now - he's full of great plans and love for his fellow man.<eos> Yes. Yes, that's just like him.<eos> I so want him to be happy.<eos> Like you.
I consider myself bound, but you should not.<eos> I want you to feel perfectly free to change your mind.<eos> So long...<eos> No... I'll do it.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Come on, Rostov, keep up!<eos> Dammit, lost him!<eos> You, quick!
She's not ungrateful, Mama, you know that, really.<eos> None of this is her fault, she didn't know that Nikolai was going to speak out.<eos> Truly, she's never expected anything from him.<eos> And now, my son hates me!<eos> He doesn't!<eos> Oh, he doesn't!<eos> He wants your blessing.<eos> Listen, if I can get him to promise he won't do anything in secret. He'll go back to his regiment, and who knows, perhaps his feelings will cool down.<eos> - Oh, now you know so much of love.<eos> Don't let him go with any bad feeling between you.
It's perfectly fine as it is.<eos> We will dine at six.<eos> I am going to my study and will not to be disturbed until then.<eos> I have much work to do, important political work of the kind that women and children<eos> Forgive me, Mademoiselle Bourienne.<eos> Oh, dear Prince, I quite understand...<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> Oh, you dear little thing!<eos> When I talk of the stupidity of women, I refer to THAT one, not you.
You play up to him! You make a fool of him and yourself and me!<eos> Do you think Prince Andrei will be in Moscow by the time we get there?<eos> Has he said anything definite?<eos> No, not absolutely definite.<eos> Don't get your hopes up too high.<eos> He'll come when he comes.<eos> What is it, my love?<eos> - Andrei's not coming after all!<eos> He says his wound has reopened, and his doctors have insisted he have rest and treatment for it.<eos> He sends his respects to you, and his... his love to me, and his disappointment, et cetera.
Bonaparte behaves in Europe like a pirate on a captured ship.<eos> And his ambition knows no bounds!<eos> - It'll come to war again, mark my words!<eos> - No, no, Prince.<eos> Our Tsar has the wisdom and courage to hold him in check.<eos> But I tell you this - our wars with the French will be unsuccessful as long as we meddle in Europe.<eos> Let us keep our borders safe and strong, and then we have no need to fear Bonaparte.<eos> Let him venture into Russia, and we'll send him home - squealing, with his tail between his legs!<eos> Well said, Prince! Well said!<eos> May I sit with you? Oh, yes.

Well said!<eos> May I sit with you? Oh, yes.<eos> I was hoping you would.<eos> So, how did you like the young man?<eos> Who?<eos> Boris Drubetskoy.<eos> He was making himself very agreeable to you.
You and I, Julie, sometimes I think we are both too sensitive for this cruel world. - Yes.<eos> The blind, uncaring masses...<eos> But you're actually getting on quite well, aren't you?<eos> Ah, Julie, I play their games because I have to.<eos> But in my heart...<eos> I... I so love the drawing and the verse you put in my album, Boris.<eos> "Ah, rustic trees, your shade conceals my sorrow..."<eos> "Ah, cloudy sky, will I find light tomorrow?"<eos> Do you know, I believe you will!<eos> - Is your son not with you?
And your fiance is coming soon?<eos> Yes...<eos> Yes, that is...<eos> Such a long time to be separated, you must feel it.<eos> But his father, you know, he's a very difficult old man, and getting worse by the day - we dined there a little while ago...<eos> - Very strong opinions!<eos> - Oh, dear...<eos> Oh, but the little Princess Marya's very, um... soft and sweet.<eos> A sister-in-law can be a sharp claw, but this one wouldn't hurt a fly.<eos> If I were you, I'd go and call on them tomorrow with your father.
That's Anatole Kuragin, the Countess's brother.<eos> Very attractive, no?<eos> Ah, here's the Countess herself.<eos> Fine woman, isn't she?<eos> She's as beautiful as everybody says.<eos> Count Rostov, you must introduce me to your lovely daughters.<eos> Of course.<eos> Here's Natasha, and this is my niece, Sonya.<eos> I'm so happy to meet you.<eos> My husband has talked of you often. I should so like to know you better.
- Just one dance.<eos> I think we really should be going.<eos> My wife's not very well, you know?<eos> Oh, please don't deprive us of your lovely daughter, Count.<eos> Come and sit with me and watch the dancing for half an hour.<eos> Well...<eos> Half an hour?<eos> Very well, why not?<eos> Wonderful!<eos> I haven't been able to think of a single thing except for you.

Wonderful!<eos> I haven't been able to think of a single thing except for you.<eos> I'm in love with you.<eos> - I've been in complete torment...<eos> - Please!<eos> You mustn't say such things.<eos> - I'm engaged...<eos> I'm in love with someone else.<eos> - What is that to me?<eos> Don't you understand, I'm madly in love with you?
I can't!<eos> You make such a lovely couple.<eos> I'm sorry you have to go so soon.<eos> Ana...<eos> No...<eos> - No, no, please...!<eos> - What can we do?<eos> I can't call on you openly.<eos> Am I never to see you?<eos> I'll get word to you somehow.
Say yes.<eos> Give me your word!<eos> No, no!<eos> Well, there you are!<eos> I thought I'd lost you.<eos> We really must go.<eos> If you please, miss a man asked me to give you this.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome, miss.<eos> 'Since last evening my fate is sealed 'to be loved by you, or die.'
Don't you see that what you're doing is wrong?<eos> You don't understand anything!<eos> Oh, just go!<eos> Just... I hate you!<eos> If you please, miss, there's a lady to see you.<eos> Princess Marya, I wasn't expecting...<eos> I have been in despair because of the misunderstanding that happened between us.<eos> My brother loves you and I will love you, too.<eos> I'm so sorry you weren't properly received the other day.<eos> And Papa, too, he's not against you, he's old and crotchety with us all.
- Do you understand?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Have you seen him?<eos> - Yes, I've seen him.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He's left Moscow.<eos> Was that your doing?<eos> I will go to him, wherever he is!<eos> I don't care what anybody thinks!<eos> Natasha, he could never be with you honestly.
No...<eos> No...<eos> Pierre...<eos> Please, no...<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> (It's all right.)<eos> 'My dearest Natasha...<eos> 'I have been thinking of you constantly these past few months, 'and now I am recovering, our separation will at last be over.
I don't know anything any more, I am so unhappy.<eos> I've spoilt everything, haven't I?<eos> Don't try to talk about it now.<eos> Later, when your soul is clear, remember I'm always your friend if you need help or advice or just... just to pour your soul out, remember me, dear Natasha.<eos> Don't talk to me like that.<eos> I don't deserve it.<eos> I'm ruined, aren't I? No.<eos> For God's sake, no.<eos> Listen.<eos> If I were not married myself and a better man than I am, I mean worthy of you, I would go down on my knees this minute and ask for your hand and your love.
How can anyone be so gullible?<eos> I know. I know. I see you looking at me.<eos> I should treat her more kindly.<eos> But she drives me to distraction with her stupid religiosity and the way she moons about the house with her eyes full of tears.<eos> What's she got to be mournful about?<eos> And La Bourienne. Now, she makes the most of herself.<eos> She makes herself agreeable. Eh?<eos> If you're asking me, I wouldn't have said it but as you ask,<eos> I think you treat Marya abominably, when anyone can see how much she loves you and respects you.<eos> And again, if you ask me, I think that French woman stirs things up between you.
One mistake.<eos> I mean, look at me, my life is one mistake after another.<eos> - Is that how you see it?<eos> - How could I see it otherwise?<eos> I wanted to change the world for the better, help my fellow men, and look at me, a fat, drunken aristocrat who makes a bungle out of everything.<eos> Natasha, I've done nothing with my life, nothing.<eos> You've been very kind to me.<eos> And that's only because I...<eos> Never mind.<eos> No one's as kind as you.
He's such an obliging soul.<eos> You do want to marry me, don't you?<eos> Well...<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Then I'll write to Pierre directly.<eos> You still wasting your time, turning over cards like a little boy?<eos> I'm trying to determine my fate, Catiche.<eos> Someone told me that you were going to the war.<eos> Yes, I'm considering it.<eos> You?
Then I'll write to Pierre directly.<eos> You still wasting your time, turning over cards like a little boy?<eos> I'm trying to determine my fate, Catiche.<eos> Someone told me that you were going to the war.<eos> Yes, I'm considering it.<eos> You?<eos> You know nothing about war.<eos> Well, perhaps it's time I found out.<eos> My dear mother and father, I hope you are making plans to leave Moscow.<eos> Otradnoe will be much safer for you.
Otradnoe will be much safer for you.<eos> As for myself, you will be happy to hear that I am well and safe.<eos> The Pavlograd Hussars have been held in reserve, so I have been buying new horses for the regiment.<eos> We're in a beautiful part of the country.<eos> No one would think that we were at war.<eos> "A short time ago, "I was able to be of service to Princess Marya Bolkonskaya."<eos> "The family estate was in the path of the French advance "and as I happened to be in the area, "I was happy to escort the Princess<eos> "for part of her journey to a place of greater safety. "She was very grateful, as you can imagine."<eos> There's a bit crossed out there, can't read it.<eos> "And asked me to send her warmest good wishes to you all."
We heard of your rescue of Princess Marya.<eos> Ah.<eos> Well, it was fortunate that I was passing.<eos> You made a great impression upon the Princess.<eos> Did you know that she is here in Voronezh with her aunt?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, she is.<eos> And of course, you will call upon her tomorrow morning to pay your respects?<eos> I should be very pleased to see her again.<eos> You know, it's just the match for you, would you like me to arrange it?
Here at last is the battle you long for.<eos> Act as you acted at Austerlitz and victory is assured.<eos> Posterity will remember you as the heroes who fought and won in the great battle of Borodino!<eos> Vive l'Empereur!<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> What's happened?<eos> Has it begun?<eos> Yes, if you please.<eos> My master left a horse for you.
My master left a horse for you.<eos> All the gentlemen have gone and General Kutuzov left an hour ago.<eos> Why didn't you wake me?<eos> My master said to let you sleep, Your Excellency.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, I beg your pardon.<eos> Who's that?<eos> You, sir!
Absolutely not!<eos> If you won't find me a commission, I'll run away and find one myself.<eos> I have fallen in love before and I expect that I will again.<eos> A short time ago, I was able to be of service to Princess Marya Bolkonskaya.<eos> Well, it does seem like fate, doesn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> It does.<eos> Just to confirm, I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova.<eos> Will you ask him if he can forgive me?<eos> No one's as kind as you.
Then my brothers didn't have to go and leave their families.<eos> Were you taken, or did you go of your own accord?<eos> I went just to see what it was like.<eos> I used to be a huge admirer of Napoleon, almost wanted to be him, but...<eos> When I saw what his ambition had done, so much senseless death, destruction, I came to the opposite view, that the world would be a better place without him.<eos> I had this idea...<eos> After Borodino, that I might assassinate Napoleon.<eos> I thought it was my destiny.<eos> And look at me now.<eos> You and me.
Convey my compliments to all the regimental commanders.<eos> And instruct them to make ready.<eos> For what, sire?<eos> Retreat.<eos> Come on. Everybody up.<eos> Get in line.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Leave, you must go.<eos> Get in line. Why not just let us go free?<eos> Less work for you.
For what, sire?<eos> Retreat.<eos> Come on. Everybody up.<eos> Get in line.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Leave, you must go.<eos> Get in line. Why not just let us go free?<eos> Less work for you.<eos> And have you turn up again and attack us?<eos> No, we are stuck with you.
Better to wait.<eos> Let them make camp for the night. We'll take them at dawn.<eos> As you wish.<eos> I like this work.<eos> Rich pickings.<eos> Who's this now?<eos> What're you doing out here?<eos> You'll give us all away.<eos> Sorry, sir, I didn't realise.<eos> Uh... I have this letter for you.
We work like the wolves do, watch and wait, and pick them off at their weakest point while they're retreating.<eos> Our job is to see them out of Russia, and make sure they never return.<eos> None of your crazy stuff with the boy, now.<eos> We need to send him home to his mother in one piece.<eos> What do you take me for?<eos> I have a mother, too, you know.<eos> We need to know their strengths,<eos> I'll go down there, scent them out.<eos> Up to you, if you want to risk your life.<eos> - I'll come with you.
No, come back.<eos> Damn you.<eos> Remember, speak French or keep your mouth shut.<eos> My God, your accent's diabolical!<eos> - Are they coming after us?<eos> - No. You did well.<eos> Nerves of steel.<eos> We'll make a soldier of you yet.<eos> Thank you, Dolokhov.<eos> And thank you for letting me come with you.
- Thank you, master.<eos> - Go on, take the whole bag.<eos> I've got plenty more.<eos> I brought them from home, you know.<eos> Would you sharpen my sabre for me?<eos> It's got blunt.<eos> Actually...<eos> It's never been sharpened.<eos> Give it here, master.<eos> I'll put a good edge on it for you.
The doctors said to let you sleep.<eos> Captain Dolokhov has been here, and Colonel Denisov.<eos> I'm hungry...<eos> Bring my clothes.<eos> Wait, have I got anything to wear?<eos> Of course, Your Excellency.<eos> And bring me a barber.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss, Countess.<eos> It must be very hard to bear.<eos> I've been thinking about you all so much.
Oh, because I'm used to it.<eos> - Sonya!<eos> - Coming.<eos> My mother sends her compliments, hopes you're well.<eos> I'm quite well, thank you, in the circumstances.<eos> How is she now?<eos> She's bearing up, thank you.<eos> She appreciated your coming to see her.<eos> It was a great comfort to her.<eos> And you?
Can you forgive me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Nothing to forgive.<eos> Come, there's a chilly wind blowing.<eos> Take my arm. - Now let me walk you home.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> I thought I should call to congratulate you on your betrothal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He's the dearest fellow as I'm sure you know, and very lucky to have found you.
Thank you.<eos> He's the dearest fellow as I'm sure you know, and very lucky to have found you.<eos> Oh, please don't embarrass me.<eos> We were so glad to know that you'd been saved.<eos> It's the only good news we'd had in such a long time.<eos> Yes, Andrei...<eos> It's a great blow.<eos> Can you imagine I knew nothing about him surviving the battle?<eos> So you were able to see him before he died?<eos> Yeah, and he often spoke of you.
Hands up!<eos> Stop, don't move.<eos> Stop!<eos> So... how was the honeymoon?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is that Agent Russo?<eos> Tortured, too, just like the blogger.<eos> How the killer got past security and surveillance, I have no clue.<eos> He's obviously a pro.<eos> Wait, what are you guys even doing here, how'd you find out?
Wrong.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Well, that was awkward.<eos> Heath, we thought you were in trouble.<eos> Trouble, why?<eos> Because we knew you were staying here, and someone's probably after Catherine.<eos> So what else is new? What?<eos> It's always either one of you two.
Farewell, unforgettable lady.<eos> What is marked there?<eos> "Forbidden to pedestrians."<eos> Prohibited to prohibit!<eos> Well said!<eos> Alejandro, poetry is an act!<eos> Yes, a thousand times yes!<eos> Poetry is an act!<eos> I have the pride and honor to welcome on this platform that traveled great personalities such as Pablo Neruda, Vicente Huidobro and so many others who rest in the Olympus of glory.<eos> With you,
Assertive.<eos> What are these guys doing here anyway?<eos> Our victim's not exactly famous.<eos> - Stringers.<eos> - We call them the horror paparazzi.<eos> Instead of celebrities, they shoot crime scenes, victims. - It's gross.<eos> - So they sell footage of other people's misery, trying to make a couple bucks?<eos> That's pathetic.<eos> He was one of them.<eos> You guys, look at the microphone on that camera.
I had a brief liaison with Laura nearly two years ago.<eos> But I had nothing to do with the car accident or her death, and we hadn't spoken in months.<eos> Now, I have a plane to catch, so unless you have a warrant, get off my estate.<eos> Well, I think Noonan's definitely through talking to us.<eos> At least he admitted he was having an affair with...<eos> Laura. Now, there's someone who might have some information.<eos> Maybe he'll talk to us.<eos> Hey, Chris!<eos> - Hey. - Good to see you again.<eos> Ah. What can I do for you?
What the hell's happening?<eos> You think Noonan - had this guy killed?<eos> - We're gonna find out.<eos> 'Scuse me, Mr. Noonan.<eos> I'm headed to a technology conference in Seattle.<eos> - No more questions.<eos> - We don't have any questions.<eos> We're arresting you... for the murders of Nate Orton and Bud Mayer.<eos> Went directly from Bob's Quickie Mart to right here.<eos> What can I do for you?
You're... you're throwing some pretty wild accusations at me here, okay?<eos> I... I... I murdered someone?<eos> I... I... I kidnapped a little boy?<eos> That's right.<eos> You know, I... I saw the... the kid on Channel 2. Phew.<eos> A nice looking boy. - Hope they find him.<eos> - I'm gonna find him.<eos> Would you make it quick so I can get out of here?<eos> Yeah, that's not how it's gonna work, Jim.<eos> You know, I, um... I understand that this is a big case for you people. - I get it.
- It converts CO2 to oxygen.<eos> First, we replicate Mars' atmosphere.<eos> I'm not a chemical engineer or anything, but if that doesn't turn this CO2 into oxygen, aren't we both gonna die?<eos> Normally we wear suits when we flood the room with CO2, but I bet you like to live on the edge.<eos> Let's get some oxygen in here.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> You got a pretty good set of lungs on you, Doc.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yours aren't so bad yourself.<eos> So it's a small space in here, all you guys locked up together. Anybody hooking up? Is that an invitation?
I'm okay, I'm okay.<eos> Termination sequence commenced.<eos> Two minutes until site termination.<eos> - What the hell is that?<eos> - Feld's so paranoid.<eos> He rigged this place with a self-destruct system.<eos> Erica must have set it off.<eos> Get everybody out of here now.<eos> - I'm not...<eos> - I'll be right behind you.
Right. - Wait.<eos> Who's first? - No, hold on a second.<eos> Shots. - Oh.<eos> Is to say thank you, thank you, here.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> - You gotta do it all in one.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> All right, to my partner, Al, who saves my ass every time, and, um, you know, occasionally I save his too.<eos> I'll drink to that. To Al.<eos> - And to the rest of you, thanks for being there for us.
- Exactly.<eos> - You have the murder weapon?<eos> You know, Chris, your father's free to go.<eos> - He is?<eos> - For now.<eos> Take him to his father, okay?<eos> Please tell me why we just released a killer.<eos> We didn't, but we're about to catch one.<eos> So, the guy confesses, right?<eos> You have opportunity, motive, and every detail is consistent to what we know about this murder, but you are not convinced.
I mean, you gotta admit, the evidence here does not look good for her.<eos> Okay, I got some news.<eos> You're not gonna like it.<eos> They found a letter jammed in the back of Russo's closet.<eos> I just sent it to your computer from the evidence room.<eos> Oh, I... I'm sorry about the quality. I guess I must have rushed when I scanned it or something.<eos> Somebody was blackmailing Russo.<eos> Yeah, that somebody was Shane Barton.<eos> All right, everyone, listen up.<eos> I appreciate what a shock Captain Russo's arrest must be for all of you.

- Everybody?<eos> It will be good for you to come back to the civilization.<eos> Welcome!<eos> - Okay, lets go inside<eos> Yes...<eos> This is for you, Wilma.<eos> The green color goes very well with your hair.<eos> It is unfortunately not tropical climate here.<eos> It can be very hot in July and August - up to 25 degrees.<eos> Oh, these are for you.
Yeah, looks like something you're into with that shirt you wore.<eos> How many fuckin' zebras did you have to fuck to get that on?<eos> For your information, I got this at Nordstrom. I didn't fuck any zebras. - Pssh!<eos> Nordstrom Rack.<eos> - No, real Nordstrom.<eos> It's like I've always imagined what a horse would look like when it talks, and now I know.<eos> Why don't you guys stop trying to bully Miss Snodgrass?<eos> She wrote a book.<eos> That's a pretty cool thing to do.<eos> It's probably more than you nerds have done.
No, no, no worries. Uh, I appreciate it.<eos> I...<eos> I respected the fact that you related it to your own struggles. Kudrows.<eos> Mr. Gamby?<eos> How would you like to be vice principal, by yourself?<eos> We'd create the position Chief Accountability Officer for you.<eos> You'd receive a substantial increase in salary as well.<eos> We'd run North Jackson High School as equals.<eos> What about Mr. Russell?<eos> From what I hear, you two don't get along already.
You know, I think there's a valuable lesson to be learned here.<eos> My daddy always said, if you fall, you can't quit. You gotta get right back on the horse.<eos> On the horse?<eos> How dare you mention horses when you forced us to sell Shadowfax?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, I didn't make anyone sell anything.<eos> That is not fair, Neal.<eos> You know what? I don't give a... fuck about what's fair and what's not fair, 'cause I'm gonna tell you right now, there is no more motorcycles.<eos> I don't want to hear either of you trying to talk her into that... shit.
Honestly, I haven't been this happy in a long, long time.<eos> Me too.<eos> I like this version of you.<eos> You should be this more often.<eos> Tell me, what's your take on Lee Russell?<eos> Mr. Russell at school? He's okay.<eos> Some people would say that the school would run a lot better if he wasn't around.<eos> I don't really have an opinion.<eos> Our paths don't cross.<eos> And I thought you guys were friends? Not friends.
It's time for them to go back to Philly.<eos> You have no idea what they've been through.<eos> 'Cause your ass just got here.<eos> He is right, Mama.<eos> We really do want to go back to Philly.<eos> Yeah, Mama.<eos> Y'all want to go back to Philly?<eos> - Then go. - For real?<eos> Yes, for real.<eos> If it's that important to you that you want to leave your mama for some Johnny Come Lately, then I don't want you here.
What are you doing here?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Hey, go say goodbye to your mom.<eos> Mama, you still mad?<eos> We won't go if you still mad.<eos> Just answer the phone when I call, that's all I ask.<eos> You're not gonna cry or nothin'?<eos> There ain't nothing to cry about.<eos> Look, I love y'all.<eos> But if you don't want to be with me, I don't want to be with you either.
So, that's dumb.<eos> Don't say that. Would you stop trying to be Columbo and figure out all the crimes.<eos> 'Cause you don't know anything that's going on, okay?<eos> - This fucking guy.<eos> - This fucking guy.<eos> Look, it's what Lee said.<eos> It's, uh, substance abuse.<eos> In fact, I know that it's substance abuse, so...<eos> Next question, please.<eos> Does this mean that one of you is going to be taking over her job as principal?
Not all of him.<eos> Find some horses.<eos> Stop!<eos> No further!<eos> General Lantier. What are you doing here, sir?<eos> We have the powder consignment.<eos> We broke a wheel on the road.<eos> General, you're injured.<eos> Salute a superior officer!<eos> And the rest of you!
We are never alone, brother.<eos> We have the best protection in the world.<eos> God watches over us.<eos> I have seen violent men like this before.<eos> You live too much in the world and in your own past.<eos> I have given my life to God.<eos> Yet you tend your beard as another might a rose bush. And here you are speaking like a soldier again.<eos> Abbott, forgive me, but you do not understand.<eos> I think I do.<eos> I've become very fond of you over these past few years, Aramis.
Louis was blessed to escape your father's illness.<eos> Louis was always blessed.<eos> His mother was Marie de Medici.<eos> My mother was a chamber maid.<eos> Well, not exactly a chamber maid.<eos> Lady in waiting, but you know what I mean.<eos> The question of your birth never bothered the king.<eos> He has a generous spirit.<eos> More sober council has advised him to disown you.<eos> But... he is very fond of you.
In the middle of all the danger and excitement today, you were closer to me than at any time in all my years here.<eos> I've never felt so... alive.<eos> This is what you made me.<eos> A Musketeer.<eos> You are many things, Aramis... but a monk is not one of them.<eos> You can't argue with God.<eos> Lucien.<eos> I have what you want.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> We needed you.
When we remember things, the details are hazy, imperfect, but you recall memories perfectly.<eos> You relive them.<eos> What happened to the little girl in my dreams?<eos> Is she still in the park somewhere?<eos> And why was I reassigned in the first place?<eos> I could check.<eos> No.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Every relationship I remember...<eos> My daughter, Clementine... it's all a story created by you to keep me here.
You really think that Ford has entrusted you with a key character for his story?<eos> He's already almost finished with it.<eos> He dug up some old town on the fringes of the park, created a horde of masked men to terrorize guests and proselytize-cum-advertise the coming of some end-all villain named Wyatt.<eos> That isn't Wyatt.<eos> That's busywork.<eos> But happily for you, Mr. Sizemore, I think that you are ready for a real job.<eos> Working for you?<eos> On what?<eos> "Show, don't tell."<eos> Isn't that what you writers prefer?
You're forgetting about the 500 dead kids in Gaza!<eos> Don't throw Gaza at me.<eos> I'm British, not Israeli.<eos> You support them, though.<eos> Do you support the people who desecrate our graves and murder innocent people in supermarkets?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I don't support everything Israel does, but it has a right to self-defence.<eos> Self-defence?<eos> From what, some kids running away on the beach?<eos> I'd have more sympathy for you lot if you burned the flags of evil murderers instead of democratic countries every time you got offended.
Very good.<eos> You're fucking dead.<eos> My family came to Britain in the 1970s.<eos> My dada - that's what we call our grandads - was a garment worker in the East End of London.<eos> On his way to work, groups of skinheads would wait for him.<eos> They called it Paki-bashing.<eos> He had his arm broken once.<eos> People we knew were stabbed, and some died.<eos> I've never blamed all white people for that.<eos> I've never asked all of you to apologise or distance yourself from it or deal with the extremists in your midst.
We're not all the same.<eos> We are all different.<eos> Please, Aamira, don't go. If we can't get on here...<eos> I ain't running away because of you.<eos> Oh, my gosh, is he playing...<eos> Later.<eos> All right, all right, all right. Please, just stop!<eos> Just stop!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> I ain't running away from a pair of posh sissies like you lot.
What happened?<eos> Is Rosa all right?<eos> Yeah, she's fine.<eos> She might need a shot of insulin, she just took a bite out of my arm.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Is that tone really necessary?<eos> She's a human being going through whatever the hell she's going through.<eos> She's never gonna talk to us.<eos> We need him to talk to her.<eos> You're telling him that you need me to do something for you?
Not much of a town, though.<eos> Why'd you want to go there?<eos> 'Cause I might be able to do one thing.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Bang, got you, you're dead.<eos> Come on, Ellen, now you're dead.<eos> Ellen, for goodness sakes, turn down the drama.<eos> The neighbors are gonna think someone's dying over here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey, don't suppose any of you kids want any ice cream, do you?
Ellen, for goodness sakes, turn down the drama.<eos> The neighbors are gonna think someone's dying over here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey, don't suppose any of you kids want any ice cream, do you?<eos> - I do!<eos> - You do?<eos> Come here!<eos> Come here, Buster.<eos> All right, let's get in there.<eos> You guys in the back.
Well, uh, might not some parties... the opposing counsel, for example... see this differential and conclude that there may have been some solicitation involved?<eos> I did not solicit.<eos> I'm just wondering how you account for your success.<eos> Because it will definitely raise eyebrows over at Schweikart Cokely.<eos> I'm sorry, but it will.<eos> Particularly in a case involving seniors, for whom the ethical guidelines on solicitation were virtually created by the ABA.<eos> Chuck, I'm sure that...<eos> Jimmy, if you could clear this up, that would be helpful.<eos> I went to Amarillo to confer with a client and to make sure that we had a solid, good-faith basis for our case there, overall.<eos> And as many of you are aware, I've visited more than my share of retirement homes.
Guaranteed eyeballs...<eos> lots of 'em.<eos> There's nothing Sandpiper can do about that.<eos> We ran a commercial a few years back... another class-action case.<eos> Kind of a new thing for us.<eos> Now, it's not exactly my go-to, but generally speaking, I'm open to it.<eos> We will talk next week.<eos> Great.<eos> Safe travels.<eos> If you or a family member have been diagnosed with mesothelioma or related conditions, you may be entitled to monetary damages.
What is it?<eos> This one is, uh, the Alpine Shepherd Boy.<eos> It's for her nephew.<eos> So, come... join me.<eos> Production meeting... bring it in.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, look, teamwork makes the dream work.<eos> Together, we can make something... dare I say it?<eos> Bravura.<eos> And this is a golden opportunity, especially for you guys, 'cause it's gonna play all around the Southwest, so who knows what it could lead to?
Looks like a gangster thing, but it's so he can keep an eye on his ride.<eos> Every Tuesday, we're here squaring accounts dealer comes in, pays what he owes.<eos> Tuco, he likes to get face to face.<eos> Says everything he needs to know is right here.<eos> Looks them in the eyes. Just stares. Like he's looking inside of them.<eos> I've seen him go like that five, ten minutes.<eos> And what does that accomplish?<eos> He calls it his lie detector.<eos> That's why these things go all day.<eos> Just the two of you?
But I have to say, I have complete confidence in Ms. Wexler.<eos> You should.<eos> She was part of our team. She learned from us.<eos> You won't find better than Kim Wexler.<eos> But no matter how talented one individual may be, the needs of Mesa Verde are too big to handle alone.<eos> I wouldn't handle your coming expansion alone.<eos> Which is why you should consider, once again, enlisting a team of professionals.<eos> - Glad we did this.<eos> - Any time.<eos> We are there for you day and night.
No, I'm sure it won't be. Um, M-Mr.<eos> Commissioner, I apologize. Unaccountably, there appears to be a... discrepancy in our filing.<eos> So the correct address the one that appeared in the notice of intent, the 1261? It would seem so.<eos> Uh, uh, uh, ‭we'd like to request a, um, an adjournment of just a few minutes so that we can amend the filing to reflect the correct address.<eos> Well, I-I can give you an adjournment, uh, uh, but, uh... uh, I don't think we can get you back in today.<eos> If I may, when do you think you might be able to schedule us?<eos> I'm being told by staff that they've already done the research for 1216 Rosella Drive.<eos> Our folks are going to have to go back to square one on the new address.<eos> If we... we could d obin a provisional agreement today, to allow the... the branch to open be...<eos> All due respect, it's up to you folks to submit accurate paperwork.
Unhospital-y.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> You know what?<eos> - I'm gonna go ask for an update.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good idea. You are the greatest generation.<eos> - Jimmy.<eos> - What? You didn't start World War II, but you sure as heck finished it.<eos> And if that weren't enough, you sent a rocket 300 feet tall to the moon.<eos> Now, in your golden years, you need someone looking out for you, someone you can trust, a man who says what he does and does what he says.
Yeah, get the sunglasses out.<eos> It's very bright.<eos> Gotta protect the old' peepers.<eos> You gotta...<eos> Yep, looking sharp.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Uh, bye-bye, now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Folks, I'm sorry about the wait, but the attention I give each client means sometimes, things get a little... backed up.<eos> Uh [breathes sharply] but I promise to get to each and every one of you in turn.
What, madam?<eos> Oh, it's nothing.<eos> I feel since I've come to Paris... my life has got more and more conventional by the day, as, I suppose, have I...<eos> But it's of no concern.<eos> I wonder if you have ever considered putting your medical talents to use?<eos> L'Hôpital des Anges is always looking for help.<eos> What is L'Hôpital des Anges?<eos> The charity hospital down near the cathedral.<eos> The nuns who run it do their best, but they must rely on medical volunteers.<eos> Not all of them as perceptive as you...
Uh, but the Zulu, they use chicken bones.<eos> Then you know how it works.<eos> Bring your question to mind, and cast them upon the hide.<eos> I cannot see his fate, but you have no need to worry.<eos> You will see him again.<eos> I will see him again?<eos> Oui.<eos> That's what the bones say.<eos> But for now, you are my concern.<eos> For you, Madonna... for protection.
You will see him again.<eos> I will see him again?<eos> Oui.<eos> That's what the bones say.<eos> But for now, you are my concern.<eos> For you, Madonna... for protection.<eos> It will change color in the presence of poison.<eos> This... magic stone will keep me safe?<eos> Some would call it nature; some would call it magic.<eos> I certainly charge more for it when I do, but for you, Madonna, today, there's no charge.
Well, Jamie managed to find himself a worthy one.<eos> I must say, I think combination of their respective beauties will result in a child of unfathomable pulchritude.<eos> Merci.<eos> I understand congratulations are in order for Madame and the Marquis as well.<eos> Why, yes, um... we are looking forward to the arrival of a little one.<eos> I apologize, I thought...<eos> We haven't formally announced it yet, uh, but... an heir!<eos> It's the most incredible news, is it not?<eos> Well, then...<eos> I am to congratulate you.

I am well aware of his damnable reputation.<eos> Well, you've heard he's said to dwell in heretical circles.<eos> They talk of demonic rituals.<eos> Rumor and innuendo.<eos> I pay no more attention to that than I do to the rumors about your wife...<eos> La Dame Blanche.<eos> St. Germain is no lover of my cause, but he is a man of business.<eos> And I have arranged for you to be the one to sell the wine.<eos> Me?<eos> Oh, who better than you to secure the buyer and keep a wary eye on St. Germain?
Like all the others.<eos> It saddens me to think of him like that.<eos> He's still Jamie.<eos> I doubt he will ever lose sight of who he truly is at heart.<eos> When I knew him, he was impulsive, headstrong.<eos> He still is.<eos> Ah, but when I knew him, he was a boy.<eos> You've turned him into a man.<eos> Speaking of men, there's a rather dashing one over there staring at us.<eos> He seems quite taken with you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> The king admires your uniform, Captain... so seldom seen at this court.<eos> Such bold colors as befit the brave soldiers of your sovereign.<eos> A pity that your countrymen are usually too busy slaughtering each other to exchange such pleasantries.<eos> Uh, speaking as a soldier of many years, Your Majesty, I must say that I find war preferable to politics.<eos> At least in war, you know your enemies.<eos> Hmm, the king finds some truth in what you say.<eos> However, we hope your affection for carnage does not ultimately prove fatal for you.
Aye.<eos> I will break the corks off a few bottles.<eos> Canna sell damaged product.<eos> St. Germain's men will no let it go to waste.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Well, once his men drink the spiked wine, they should flush with fever.<eos> The nettle juice on their skin will cause blistering, and the rose madder should produce blood in the urine.<eos> All telltale symptoms.<eos> Et voilà,<eos> I give you smallpox.
_<eos> A mysterious illness, which no one has been able to diagnose as yet.<eos> This illness, is it contagious?<eos> _<eos> One should not openly speculate as to the contagion of this malady.<eos> _<eos> How about the harbor master, has he been paid off?<eos> Is that not how you normally handle these things?<eos> _<eos> This is why I sent for you, James.

- Indeed.<eos> - Another bleat like that and I'll see to the other side of yer jaw.<eos> Perhaps we can think of an alternative?<eos> Do you even trust these men that you've found?<eos> Money'll buy anything if ye ken where to look.<eos> Fine, but do these highwaymen even have the proper attire to look the part?<eos> Let's just say it'll be a risky affair for a nobleman strolling along the Rue Saint-Honoré tonight.<eos> We don't have time for an alternative, Claire.<eos> And what if you get caught?<eos> Have either of you thought of that contingency?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Doesn't it distress any of you?
Prince Charles has got himself into some trouble at the salon.<eos> Seems he's run up a substantial debt and refuses to pay.<eos> Madame Elise has threatened to call for the gens d'armes unless restitution is made i... immediately.<eos> No peace for the wicked.<eos> Shall I go as proxy, Milord?<eos> So you... you can finish your meal and rest?<eos> No.<eos> Best go myself.<eos> We don't want the gens d'armes making inquiries into our business affairs... today, of all days.<eos> Then I shall come with you.
Previously...<eos> Someone tried to poison me.<eos> For you, Madonna.
Yes, I have.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In Scotland.<eos> When were you in Scotland, Mama?<eos> A long time ago.<eos> Claire?<eos> Be still, my child.<eos> My baby.<eos> I am here.<eos> We will take care of you.
Bring me my baby.<eos> Bring me my baby!<eos> I want my baby!<eos> Where is she now?<eos> I baptized her.<eos> And gave her a name.<eos> Faith.<eos> You must understand, it is illegal unless the child is living.<eos> But I wanted her to be buried in hallowed ground.<eos> This, ma chère, will stay between you, me, and God.
I wish to petition for my husband's release from the Bastille.<eos> So, ma chère, you have found a deep enough sea.<eos> I learned the reason he broke his promise.<eos> I was angry at him.<eos> Still am.<eos> But he is the father of my child.<eos> His Majesty is a mercurial man.<eos> There is a price to such requests.<eos> Which is?<eos> The king may expect to lie with you.
No.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Now, tell me what it is that I may do for you.
And him not even your betrothed at the time.<eos> Don't make me regret giving it to ye now.<eos> If ye don't come back, brother, I'll never forgive ye.<eos> Never is a very long time.<eos> I know.<eos> Jes where do ye think ye're going?<eos> Ye're too young to fight, laddie.<eos> Ye'll bide here wi' us.<eos> You can help Rabbie in the stables till Milord returns.<eos> But I belong with you.
Jamie will never love you, Laoghaire.<eos> But there might be a way to earn his forgiveness... for him to think of you without rancor.<eos> And why would you want him to do that?<eos> Because we need Lord Lovat to send his men and weapons to fight for Prince Charles, and we believe he might do this if young Simon stood up to him and took Jamie's side.<eos> And what is that to do with me?<eos> Young Simon is infatuated with you.<eos> You could use that to help persuade him.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'll not sink further into the pit of depravity.<eos> I'll not give up my maidenhead for you!
We met in the corridor.<eos> Lord Lovat's tenants do not like someone like me in the house of God.<eos> This is the only place where my mind goes quiet.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> They say you are a White Lady.<eos> Yes, they do say that.<eos> What brings you into a church, then?<eos> It was cold outside.<eos> I'm glad to see that you're doing all right.<eos> Lord Lovat was so rough with you the other day.
- Stay back!<eos> - Oh, Lovat.<eos> Can you not see this for the pretense that it is?<eos> Pretense?<eos> You know that she was tried as a witch by those that dinna understand the difference between black magic and the power of the old ones.<eos> What did she see?<eos> You don't need to answer him, Claire.<eos> She will if she wants to walk out of this room.<eos> No, it's all right, Jamie.<eos> I saw you...

- Fergus, laddie... ye look fit.<eos> Murtagh's been looking after you well, then?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's been horrible. He forced me to mend his socks and to fetch his meals.<eos> Hey, I'm just tryna educate the lad on the finer points on traveling in the Highlands.<eos> All right, children.<eos> I'll have a word with the ladies... try and get them to make as many bannocks as possible today.<eos> Aye.<eos> Mistress Claire...<eos> I washed my mouth out with whiskey, in preparation for a big buss from you, eh?
We'll no mention that traitorous bastard's name again.<eos> You know, marriage could do you all some good.<eos> Have ye no welcome for yer beloved uncle?<eos> Dougal!<eos> Aye.<eos> - You look well, lad... - Aye.<eos> Despite the misfortunes ye've suffered.<eos> Never felt more fit.<eos> Ah, and the Lady Broch Tuarach... a vision of true loveliness.<eos> Well, it wouldn't be Scotland without you, Dougal.
I ken Charles Stuart well enough.<eos> Aye, good, because more clans are joining our cause every day.<eos> And their leaders are jockeying for position within his inner council.<eos> We have more pressing concerns than worrying about securing a seat at the prince's table.<eos> I'll no send these cotters into battle until they're well-trained and disciplined.<eos> Christ.<eos> Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.<eos> It's not exactly Delmonico steak, is it?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Well, that's what we think you Yanks have for chow every day... Giant steaks, baked potatoes drowned in butter, tomatoes the size of cricket balls, and vats and vats of chocolate ice cream.
And yer promise to me... to be my bride if he died?<eos> My husband and I share everything.<eos> He knows about your offer... and he knows why I was forced to make the decision I did.<eos> And he took no issue with it?<eos> None.<eos> Well, he, uh... He is a better man than I.<eos> Truer words have never been spoken.<eos> I can see that ye still bear a grudge.<eos> Let's get one thing clear, Dougal MacKenzie.<eos> If I ever thought of you, then I might hold a grudge for all the things that you've done to me.
Have ye noticed Claire's been out of sorts lately?<eos> One day she seems fine, in good spirits, and the next there's barely any life in her.<eos> I canna figure it out.<eos> I can see she's not been herself.<eos> Claire doesn't usually beat around the bush.<eos> She speaks her mind, whether you want to hear it or not.<eos> I asked.<eos> She claims she's fine.<eos> It's gonna take a bit more than asking to pry it out of her.<eos> Come on, you two.
This isn't a war where you risk no more than your lives in battle.<eos> No, no, this is treason.<eos> If we fail, then all those that support the Stuarts are likely to end up on a scaffold.<eos> They're true Scots.<eos> Every man prepared to fight and die for their true king.<eos> I much prefer they fight and live for their king.<eos> I'm James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.<eos> I command this army.<eos> If you do not wish to be here, then it is my order that you leave now and return to your homes.<eos> None will think less of you and no harm will follow.

I'm quite prepared to die.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Well...<eos> I'm afraid I'm not prepared to kill ye... just yet.<eos> Who do ye march with?<eos> I want their number... And direction of travel.<eos> There's nothing you can do that will make me talk.<eos> Scottish barbarian.<eos> Leave him alone, you... you sadist.<eos> I resisted your advances earlier, but if you let the boy go free, then I will surrender myself to you, you pig.
From her prince, perhaps not.<eos> But surely Lady Broch Tuarach would prove obedient to an edict from her lord and master.<eos> Enough!<eos> "Enough," ye say?<eos> That's what he said, all right. I heard it with these very ears.<eos> The ale ye waste now is ale ye'll probably be wanting later.<eos> Quench the thirst of battle.<eos> "The thirst of battle," ye say?<eos> What would ye two cotters ken of battle, eh?<eos> Cotters we may be, but we're here, same as you. For gore and glory.

Always.<eos> We will win the day, correct?<eos> It is the promise of history.<eos> Yes, we will win this day.<eos> So we shall.<eos> On your way, soldier.<eos> Get some rest, all of you.<eos> That's an order.<eos> Have any of you seen Fergus?<eos> I'll be leaving you now if it's all the same to you, General.
Stand your ground, you dogs!<eos> Don't turn your back on these traitors!<eos> Stand your ground!<eos> The British!<eos> The British prisoners are here.<eos> We mean you no harm, Madame.<eos> But we do require your assistance.<eos> Allina, sort these men out by the severity of their wounds.<eos> - Come with me.<eos> - You two, over there.
Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> You aren't injured, are you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just... tired.<eos> Very, very tired.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I'll get you some food, somewhere to sleep.<eos> Dougal MacKenzie.<eos> Do I know ye?<eos> Lieutenant Jeremy Foster. I accompanied you and the lady Claire Beauchamp to the village of Brockton.
The only honorable redcoat in Lord Thomas' staff.<eos> I would be much obliged if you would see me to your infirmary.<eos> Oh, ye expect me to carry ye to Tranent?<eos> I've still got work to do here.<eos> Is your thirst for slaughter not quenched yet?<eos> You've won a great victory today.<eos> Aye.<eos> And I wager there'll be many more to follow.<eos> A war chief should know better.<eos> I tell you this in all candor: you cannot defeat the British army.
Ah, there it is.<eos> Ah, Frank.<eos> Pull yourself together, get to the bar.<eos> Eh, eh.<eos> Still got it.<eos> All righty, here we go.<eos> See what we're getting into today.<eos> It's only a backup.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> If everybody sticks to the tasks that I've carefully tailored for each of you, then you're gonna be great.
I hate this slimy bastard.<eos> Where's the rent, Frank?<eos> In my pocket where it's gonna stay until you fix the plumbing.<eos> You're playing games with me, Frank.<eos> I don't like games.<eos> You know what I like?<eos> This sandwich.<eos> It's snake meat. Snake meat?<eos> Huh.<eos> Is that what you people eat?
Well, no.<eos> No, I'm not gonna let you out.<eos> I need you to experience everything<eos> I-I have to offer, okay, so you're... Rahr!<eos> So, experience... Dee!<eos> Shut up!<eos> All right, look, we're gonna have a good time here, okay?<eos> You're experiencing some free beers right now because I can't get the goddamn Internet to work.<eos> That's a problem for me.<eos> Do you guys know how to use tablet computers?
So, look happy.<eos> Look like you're having fun.<eos> No need to cover those up.<eos> My customers like those. They're like me.<eos> They're gonna want to see that.<eos> Yeah, okay, so smiling smiling and...<eos> You're not convincing me. Smile!<eos> Oh, damn!<eos> This is not supposed to be scary.<eos> This is supposed to be an authentic, fun time for you.
Wait. Is that Dennis and Dee?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Wh-What are you doing here?<eos> Yeah, did you get Frank to write the check?<eos> Dude, we're well on our way.<eos> (chuckles) Yeah, but in the meantime, we came here because we need some money to buy crack.<eos> You guys are smoking crack again? It's not a big deal, because, uh, as soon as we get that check from Frank, we're just gonna zip right off to a-a rehab program.<eos> Yeah, we'll get in rehab.<eos> You guys are back on crack,
A stupid moron.<eos> So, those people on Haiti.<eos> Now we can help them with the mon-- your money.<eos> No, no...<eos> Haiti?<eos> Haiti's a lost cause.<eos> You might as well sink that goddamn island.<eos> DEE: (gasps) No, not a lost cause, no, you said you wanted to help poor people.<eos> I am going to help the poor people.<eos> I'm gonna help you, because you are my children and I gotta think of your future.

That isn't a laxative, is it, Frank?<eos> Nope.<eos> Welcome to Level 4,<eos> (echoing): Horror.<eos> What is this?<eos> Wake up, guys. Wake up.<eos> What's going on?<eos> FRANK: Hello, gang.<eos> The keys to your cuffs have been sewn into your forearm.<eos> Beside you are some tweezers attached to a car battery.
Oh, man. What happened? God...<eos> like, all I remember is, like, winning the game and then passing out.<eos> Is that how you remember it?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, you cried like a baby.<eos> Yeah, pretty much right when the waitress started talking, you cried like a little bitch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You-you must have been hallucinating from all the blood poisoning.<eos> So... did you guys win?
I'm down to try this, like, art gallery idea of yours.<eos> What do you think Grieco would do?<eos> He wouldn't eat chalk.<eos> Yes, but I just don't understand why you're choosing to dress like Richard Grieco.<eos> Well, because he's a cool bro and I'm a cool bro.<eos> I just want to do a Grieco thing.<eos> I'm vibing with it.<eos> I'm vibing with it, man. Stop saying that you're vibing and "bro."<eos> You know what, why don't you go mingle, and Frank and I will handle this.<eos> Thank you.
Hello, boys.<eos> Is that how you play it? That is way over the top.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This is it. This is the way they are.<eos> Frank, did you buy an air conditioner?<eos> Yes, and I bought a painting for 35 K.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I liked it, and that's what it cost.<eos> Is nobody understanding what we're trying to do?<eos> I am trying to prove that this is all bullshit, and you guys are all buying into it. Oh.
Yeah, but keep in mind, you know, a lot of modern art is... is trash.<eos> I mean, it's shitty.<eos> It's not... You know, it's not good.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> You know?<eos> And yet, it's a fine line between van Gogh and Van Damme, you know, between Depp and Grieco, between Banksy and Charlie, that makes it very difficult to determine what's good art.<eos> You know, what's high art?<eos> What has worth? What has meaning?<eos> Yeah?<eos> But if one thing has become abundantly clear to me today-- and it should be to all of you, as well-- is that I wasn't raped.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.<eos> And about that, um, where exactly does God stand on that dry thing?<eos> Is that a hard, fast rule or is there some wiggle room?<eos> Look, this cruise is an opportunity for us to get away from the sins of everyday life.<eos> That being said, we will each have to have a half a cap of mouthwash every day. You know, just to stave off the shakes.<eos> Smart, smart. Don't want to get sick. Yeah.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Okay, guys, I am gonna head up to Bible study right now. Oh.<eos> Oh, right now.<eos> Uh, this is our suite. Yeah, you guys can check in or whatever. But the...
Smart, smart. Don't want to get sick. Yeah.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Okay, guys, I am gonna head up to Bible study right now. Oh.<eos> Oh, right now.<eos> Uh, this is our suite. Yeah, you guys can check in or whatever. But the...<eos> Yeah, yeah, we'll, we'll...<eos> We got to... set our bags down and then, uh...<eos> Yeah, we...<eos> I have to unpack, I always do.<eos> All right. Peace be with you.
I'm gonna be the captain.<eos> Charlie's gonna be the first mate.<eos> No, no, no, I-I'm putting a stop to this right now.<eos> No costumes, no high jinks. Guys, can we take a vacation from our usual bullshit?<eos> Can we just...<eos> You know, I'm not saying we got to do the God stuff, but let's not-- let's not do a bunch of anti-God stuff either, okay? So don't be gluttonous.<eos> Okay?<eos> You-- no wrath.<eos> No lust for me. You know, which is gonna be difficult, given the implications of being on a boat.<eos> All right, well, I'm taking a vacation from you guys, okay?
You can't have alcohol on the ship.<eos> Oh, this, uh, this is an empty.<eos> That-that was an empty can.<eos> A pelican dropped it and we... Yeah, we picked it up.<eos> Yeah, it was, like... Do you have any more on you, sir?<eos> No, not a bit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Uh, uh, Captain.<eos> Do you have any more alcohol on you? Uh, not a bit.
Charlie.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Ah, get your hands off...<eos> I'll dispose of those.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, I know where... No, no, don't let him drink that!<eos> Don't let him drink our torpedo juice!<eos> (sighs)<eos> What'd you get thrown in for?<eos> I couldn't control my wrath.<eos> You? Yeah. Gluttony.
I also feel like maybe... you wouldn't dare.<eos> Well, that's not supposed to happen. Guys, come on, come on!<eos> It was a misunderstanding!<eos> The storm made it seem way worse than it is.<eos> She was never in any danger.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're soaking wet. Are you okay? Yeah.<eos> I was out in the rain looking for a sign from God.<eos> I never got the timing right, but doesn't matter.<eos> The point is, I thought I was here for you guys to open my mind.
Oh, you guys knew this already?<eos> That you were gay? From the day we met.<eos> Oh, my God, I've been trying...<eos> Yeah, always. Whoa, really?<eos> But what's going on?<eos> Did you just get tossed in here?<eos> Or, like, why are you in here?<eos> Oh, no, I just walked in on my own. What? !<eos> You let the door close behind you?<eos> I couldn't find you guys. I wanted to hang out.
I couldn't find you guys. I wanted to hang out.<eos> I had something important to tell you. What is it?<eos> There is no God.<eos> Well, what? !<eos> What is happening right now?<eos> Why, where are you getting this from? Yeah, why... I was like...<eos> (sighs) Okay.<eos> If there was a God, there's no way that he would make me queer, right?<eos> I can't, I can't listen to this anymore. I got to get out of here.<eos> I can't be around you.
I can't be around you.<eos> I've got to get out of here!<eos> Got to get out of here!<eos> What are you squawking about?<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> Honestly, what's the point anyway?<eos> There's no meaning to any of it.<eos> There's no God, there's no heaven, there's no hell.<eos> Wrong! Oh, I just wanted a couple of days.<eos> Just a couple of days away from you guys.
Move on; you're losing him.<eos> I just want to be clear. Okay, yeah, yeah.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> What're those sirens for?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, my God, see, I knew<eos> I shouldn't have come on this cruise.<eos> I knew it!<eos> I mean, it used to be I would never even leave Philly!<eos> And then, you know, you guys drag me to this, you drag me to that, and next thing I know, I-I'm stuck in a box on a sinking ship!
What-what was that, dude?<eos> You sound like a soccer hooligan.<eos> Uh, yeah, that's just something I've been doing with Charlie lately when he gets a little wound up.<eos> You know, it seems to work.<eos> - Say yup, yup, yup.<eos> - Oh, that's good.<eos> The most important thing for us to do now is to keep our wits together.<eos> We got to occupy ourselves. Mm-hmm.<eos> Why don't we play a few games?<eos> I just wanted to get away from you guys, just for a few days.
What is that? I don't know what it is.<eos> All right, well, either way, this whole thing's gonna be a goddamn fiasco, and I'm gonna enjoy every second of it.<eos> No, it's gonna go fine.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> No, it's gonna be fine.<eos> This is hardly the trial of the century.<eos> Everything's gonna go just great.<eos> On a scale of one to ten, how much sass are you gonna give me today?<eos> A-Are you serious?<eos> And hello to... you all.
I said, order!<eos> (gallery clamoring) LAWYER: He's talking to the pigeon!<eos> I'm not paying alimony to a goddamn cat!<eos> Order! I want order in this court!<eos> Fly, my pet!<eos> Fly!<eos> (bird squawking, people screaming) Bring me their eyes!<eos> (screaming, shouting) Bring them to me!<eos> MELVOY: In my 35 years on this bench, I have never seen such a mockery made of this courtroom.<eos> You people have wasted my time, you've wasted the taxpayers' time, and this justice has heard enough.
And there's roaming cows in the road. Black ice just outside of Edgar.. If I get through that, there's a road block just outside of Livingston.<eos> Then I get to sleep for five hours take a shower, go to work at 8:00 do a bunch of crap nobody else wants to do and learn some more school law tomorrow night..<eos> Leave work early the next day and drive all the way back here.. With my eyes twitching.<eos> It was nice of you to bring the horse.<eos> Can you take me back to my car?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks, and have a good night.<eos> -What?<eos> - Apparently, Ms. Travis found the drive from Livingston too arduous so I'll take over the class for the rest of the term.<eos> I practice law here in town and as some of you know and the rest of you, you would find out soon enough..
- What the fuck is he doing here?<eos> - We came in and found him here with this motherfucker already in the vise.<eos> He was dealing in our territory.<eos> The territory you and your... men are charged with protecting.<eos> - I brought him here as a courtesy.<eos> So my tax dollars aren't enough for you and your little tribe, huh?<eos> Now you fuckers are going to encroach on my business?<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> We pay for your houses for your damn reservations, for your school, and your health care, even when all of you were getting rich off your fucking casinos, right?
We're fighting a war to protect Nassau in which our most effective weapon is the fear that we can instill in our enemies.<eos> Everything is dependent upon that gold, and right now it is sitting in a fort with no guns and full of holes.<eos> You couldn't figure out how to repair the fort, so you lured me into capturing a ship full of slaves to do the job.<eos> I wonder if you can help me locate an old friend of mine.<eos> His name is Charles Vane.<eos> I am to set sail for the West Indies, the one element I lack is someone who understands Nassau.<eos> If you agree to be that person, your sentence will be commuted and the charges against you released.
You'll have to pardon me.<eos> I've never had a proper chambermaid before.<eos> Is that how they address all their employers?<eos> Governor Rogers is my employer.<eos> You are a convict in need of someone to keep your things clean, your movement restricted, and your door shut.<eos> As such, you're the first daughter of privilege I have been able to serve while speaking my mind openly.<eos> I would have thought my story is well told by now, but I come from no privilege.<eos> Don't you?<eos> My understanding is that your father built a criminal enterprise and you inherited it.<eos> The only difference between you and the ladies I have served in the past is... their families had better lawyers.
After that, my credibility with crews on the beach was in good order.<eos> And the protégé, what was his name?<eos> His name was Charles Vane.<eos> Leave us, please.<eos> Now.<eos> I need very specific answers to the following questions.<eos> Ask me what you want to ask me.<eos> Charles Vane sided with you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Betrayed his mentor, betrayed Edward Teach for you?
with a former lover?<eos> You know these men's names, you know the things they have done.<eos> But I know them.<eos> I know Flint is dangerous, but he can be reasoned with.<eos> I know Rackham is devious, but all he cares about is his legacy.<eos> And because I have history with Charles Vane, I know him most of all.<eos> I'm all too aware what he is capable of destroying when he sets his mind on it.<eos> I underestimated him and I lost my father.<eos> The Lord Governor Ashe underestimated him, and Charles Town burned.<eos> What is it you would like to have him take from you?

Beg your pardon?<eos> Why are you so determined to defend Nassau?<eos> Because Henry Avery set his camp here and said, "This is a place for free men."<eos> And because you sailed from here and made this place feared.<eos> Because Henry Jennings and Benjamin Hornigold and Sam Bellamy gave Nassau life.<eos> And you think your name belongs on that list.<eos> Yes, I understand.<eos> Captain Teach?<eos> We hear you're taking on new men.<eos> We'd like to join you.
There's nothing more to be done.<eos> We should heave to, ride it out below.<eos> Hornigold knows our last position.<eos> They'll be patrolling downwind.<eos> The storm'll blow us right to him.<eos> Head up now...<eos> Close as you can.<eos> Captain, this is mad!<eos> Billy, make it so.<eos> You two, man the starboard braces.
Captain Hornigold.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> Mr. Dufresne.<eos> I have news to relay, sir, but first, I'm sorry,<eos> I must address a rumor I've heard since my arrival here, a rumor most troubling about a fugitive that you've made a part of your endeavor.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I would introduce you, but, uh, from what I understand, you're quite familiar with one another.<eos> Respectfully, that woman is not to be trusted.<eos> I know, but perhaps I don't need to trust her.<eos> And, by way of context, I don't much trust you either.
Flint had them exactly where he needed them.<eos> But he had me there, too.<eos> These are identical.<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> That we exchange it, find partners, and trade coin for commodities far easier to protect.<eos> I returned to go on the account as I know it, because in this place<eos> I believed I could find the men necessary to do so.<eos> And in particular one man that I thought worthy of standing alongside me at the head of a terrible fleet.<eos> I'm all too aware what Charles Vane's capable of destroying when he sets his mind on it.<eos> What is it you would like to have him take from you?
He would then mount a full-scale invasion of the beach, costing me any chance I might have of a peaceful transition.<eos> And you need my help to ensure that this address is drawn to win the most converts?<eos> Precisely.<eos> How sure are you that it would be a bad thing?<eos> What's that?<eos> If the Navy took over, stormed the beach and cleared it, and why would that be such a bad thing?<eos> I wouldn't say "law and order" here.<eos> Either is fine. The phrase they find upsetting.<eos> If the Navy takes the beach, there is no way I will recapture the trust of the men who would otherwise have surrendered.<eos> You wouldn't need their trust if they were either dead or terrified of you.
If we can discourage them from engaging, so much the better.<eos> If not, we fight to protect the island.<eos> With who in command of the fleet?<eos> No one's seen Flint in weeks.<eos> When he hears news of the invasion, he'll return.<eos> But if he doesn't?<eos> No man has his skill in leading a fleet in battle.<eos> Not even you.<eos> What the fuck's the matter with you people?<eos> We haven't done enough for you?
Well, now he's the greatest villain in the new world.<eos> We all see it. We all follow him because of it.<eos> I think it's torture for him, and I think the only way he can imagine it stopping is when there are no more of us left to witness it.<eos> You both stand accused of a crime most serious.<eos> Theft of food held in reserve in a time such as this is a betrayal of trust of the most profound sort.<eos> The penalty for such a betrayal is, by necessity, extreme.<eos> You were both charged with keeping watch over what little remains of our food stores.<eos> A full day's rations are now gone, yet each of you accuses the other of the crime.<eos> As your quartermaster, as your friend,<eos> I'm going to implore you one last time, whichever of you is the guilty man, to confess.
What are you suggesting?<eos> That we withdraw?<eos> I'm suggesting that I see no obvious means by which we can reclaim Nassau town, not without risking the loss of significant assets of his majesty's Navy.<eos> Then I'll go to the beach myself.<eos> Beg pardon?<eos> I will have a launch ferry me to the sand alone, and I will make the pardon address.<eos> It is out of the question.<eos> Why?<eos> Because my charge is to ensure this endeavor's safety and yours and I'll not answer to a plan that reckless.<eos> It shouldn't be you.
I'm prepared to prosecute a defense of the harbor and repel the navy from here definitively if you agree to join me in sailing away from here for good.<eos> I stole it from you, the Urca gold.<eos> Whatever happens out here, one thing is certain... you and I would be a hell of a lot better off as partners than as rivals.<eos> I will have a launch ferry me to the sand alone, and I will make the pardon address.<eos> It shouldn't be you.
Who?<eos> Your enemies on the island.<eos> You seem concerned about what I'm gonna hear them say about you.<eos> Maybe it would be better to hear it now while all else is quiet.<eos> They would say I'm untrustworthy.<eos> That I would turn on anyone at any time, no matter how close they were to me... no matter who it hurt or how severely.<eos> That, given my history, only a fool would allow me to get close to them again.<eos> Would they be right?<eos> You tamed this place once.<eos> Despite what anyone may say of you, and I desire your counsel, despite what anyone may say of you.

Your father aids us from his position in Nassau.<eos> He might have lived among these men.<eos> He may have fought beside these men.<eos> He may have even called some of these men friends.<eos> But when it comes to the safety of the people in this place, your father knows the final decision is mine.<eos> - You know where you're going, yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When you reach the beach, make no attempt into the trees.<eos> They will find you and guide you through.<eos> Once you reach the camp, my wife will see you are taken care of.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,<eos> I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.<eos> Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.<eos> But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possession, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.<eos> Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?<eos> To the fort.<eos> To do what, exactly?<eos> To fix it.<eos> I see.<eos> Just you two on the job, is it? A whole gang of us up there.
I know you... some.<eos> I read your book.<eos> Did you?<eos> Well, most of it.<eos> I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end. But, you know, I got the gist of it.<eos> If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?<eos> Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.<eos> Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.<eos> Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.<eos> Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.<eos> The temptation to keep something to show for it all, I understand it.<eos> But it does not change the reality we face.<eos> That you face.<eos> For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.<eos> I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it... grown men in awe of it.<eos> I came to this place so determined to do the same.<eos> That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?<eos> My advice?<eos> You want some say in how they speak of you?
Sir.<eos> Touch of the grippe is all, sir. I'll be all right.<eos> You're the third man to say as much to me in the last four hours.<eos> I'll see you relieved.<eos> Please report to Dr. Marcus immediately.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It's almost over, this unfortunate arrangement between you and I.<eos> - What?<eos> - Contact was made with Anne Bonny.<eos> The situation was explained to her that the sooner she returns the cache, the better it would be for you.
I'm so very sorry.<eos> He has asked a favor.<eos> It will not come without risk.<eos> Anything he asks.<eos> What can I do?<eos> I understand this is the place cowards come to beg forgiveness from a king.<eos> Sign your name to sleep easy.<eos> Thinking all your sins have been absolved.<eos> But some sins... even a king can't make clean.<eos> You... all of you.
So what do we do?<eos> Lord Thomas Hamilton.<eos> I didn't know him, but I understand you did.<eos> Miss Guthrie tells me you were part of the first effort with Lord Hamilton and Peter Ashe to introduce the pardon to Nassau.<eos> As with most things, the men first into the breach bear the heaviest casualties.<eos> But in the hindsight of victory, they were the ones whose sacrifice made it possible.<eos> Without Lord Hamilton's efforts, your efforts, it's likely I wouldn't have been successful in my efforts to finally secure the pardon.<eos> All I have done here is finish what you began.<eos> I am now what you were then.<eos> And without you, there would be no me.
I've lived on the other side of those stories.<eos> I'm sure I'll figure something out.<eos> I'm sure you will.<eos> Then let us be very clear about something.<eos> I am reasonable in seeking peace.<eos> But if you insist upon making me your villain, I'll play the part.<eos> So let us assume that, as of this moment, the unqualified pardon is no more.<eos> From this moment on, any man participating in the act of high seas piracy will be presumed to be one of your men, an enemy of the state.<eos> I will hunt him, I will catch him, and I will hang him.<eos> And while I am aware of your feelings on the subject, I am no backwater magistrate cowering in fear of you.
A little.<eos> Hardly at all.<eos> If I'm in Havana in a day or two,<eos> I assume I'll be hearing a lot of it...<eos> Shouted by bitter old women in a crowd, growled by angry officials.<eos> It seems a rotten thing to wish upon anyone, an unflattering eulogy in an unfamiliar town.<eos> It'll be quick, to whatever extent it sets your mind at ease.<eos> The gold is theirs.<eos> The gems are theirs.<eos> They don't need anything from you anymore, and as such they're likely to want to put the entire affair behind them and move on.
Let me be sure I have this right.<eos> So the plan to recover the stolen cache of gems... Your plan to recover the stolen cache of gems has worked in exactly the manner you suggested it would. Only now you believe this is a bad thing...<eos> Evidence of a plan to rescue Mr. Rackham and once again recover the cache of gems.<eos> That is what you're suggesting, yes?<eos> I can understand why this may be hard to believe, but I know Anne Bonny well enough to know that it is a certainty something here is amiss.<eos> That her behavior should coincide with the presence of Captain Flint on the island only hours before most certainly points to a plot being underway. I beg your pardon.<eos> So now Captain Flint is somehow involved in this plot despite the fact that his ship left the island hours ago?<eos> And I am to redeploy men into the interior away from Nassau Town, leaving their positions undefended?<eos> I'm sorry, are you suggesting there's some ulterior motive here?<eos> I'm suggesting that simply because the governor decided to put his... Trust in you, I have no intention of doing the same.
You're not fucking hearing me.<eos> Even if somebody wanted to move against the governor's caravan, they wouldn't know where to find the governor's caravan.<eos> The route was altered multiple times. False schedules were distributed. Nobody knows exactly when they were set to leave.<eos> Nobody knows what route they finally decided upon. Nobody knows who...<eos> I know.<eos> I know the route.<eos> A boy in my employ saw scouts on the west trail road late last night.<eos> That is it, is it not?<eos> I am assuming you did not send men to scout the decoy routes?<eos> Did you tell anyone what your boy has told you? No.
He isn't going to say anything.<eos> He has to say something.<eos> He's going to say that he spoke impertinently to me,<eos> Kofi took offense, and it will not be spoken of again.<eos> Just like that.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now let him go.<eos> If he says a word...<eos> When I speak, my men listen, and they do as I say.<eos> A secret caravan to move Rackham to a secret transport, and no one knows about this but you.
Debts over which this man would have seen me imprisoned...<eos> Imprisoned in a place where the debts would have been discharged only through hard labor.<eos> Hard labor with no wages, working at...<eos> Wait for it... The production of textiles.<eos> "You people, incapable of accepting the world as it is," says the man to whom the world handed everything.<eos> If no Anne, if no rescue, if this is defeat for me, then know this.<eos> You and I were neck and neck in this race right till the end.<eos> But, Jesus, did I make up a lot of ground to catch you.<eos> You think the world's been that kind to me?<eos> That I'm that much softer than you? That much more fortunate?
Wait till they're close.<eos> Sir!<eos> Pick your targets!<eos> Go!<eos> Go?<eos> Take the chest to the beach.<eos> We'll be right behind you. Right behind us?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you said you and Nassau were through.<eos> Got worried you two'd be lost without me.
- I know, just... wait.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Billy, they're about to tie the noose.<eos> And that God's will will be done again in Nassau.<eos> Bastard!<eos> Hang him!<eos> Does the condemned have anything to say before the sentence is carried out?<eos> These men who brought me here today do not fear me.<eos> They brought me here today because they fear you.<eos> Because they know that my voice, a voice that refuses to be enslaved, once lived in you.

I also understand you intend to place your Mr. De Groot in command of her.<eos> He'll manage.<eos> Yes, but he wasn't your first choice.<eos> It was supposed to be Charles, wasn't it?<eos> Are you suggesting a better replacement?<eos> Me.<eos> England may have removed Charles Vane from our number, but there is too much of him in me for England to fully will him away.<eos> In his absence, with everything that's at stake, I will be our Charles Vane.<eos> I've just come back from the beach, and I couldn't help but notice the three additional ships anchored in the bay being outfitted for this battle right along with mine.<eos> Captain Hornigold will be sailing in consort with you, accompanied by his private militia.
He has planned for it.<eos> And I assure you, if you allow him to dictate the terms of battle, you court a disastrous outcome.<eos> If he expects your force, then we must send that which he does not expect.<eos> For we will have victory against this enemy. There simply is no alternative.<eos> Just returned from around the point.<eos> The word is spreading throughout the Bahamas that the governor in Nassau hanged a pirate in his square.<eos> Made an example of him, they say, to show that he is the steward of law and order in the West Indies.<eos> He is resolved to be the Englishman who ends piracy in the New World.<eos> The pirate he hanged in the square to underscore his point... was Charles Vane.<eos> I have yet to inform the men, as I imagine they'll have questions I don't know how to answer, so I wanted to ask you first.
I don't really like to talk about my other clients.<eos> - Mm, uh... ♪ Boom, boom, boom ♪ Do you have protection?<eos> 'Cause... ♪ Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom ♪ ...there's a chance I might be super-potent.<eos> ♪ Don't touch my ♪ There you go!<eos> Good!<eos> Coach... That's it!<eos> That's it!<eos> There you go!<eos> A lot of hustle there!<eos> You girls will be in in a minute, all right?
Okay.<eos> Is anybody working today or what?<eos> Uh, we're just waiting on the tow truck, Lieutenant.<eos> Someone dropped your rig off, Boss.<eos> I love the new color.<eos> Really brings out your vagina.<eos> Hey, does Linda know you're into dark meat?<eos> Come on.<eos> My wife gave me that subscription.<eos> You guys gonna watch me jerk off or what?
- I needed to know.<eos> FBI wouldn't have to choose between bruises and rent.<eos> - Now you need to tell me.<eos> - Keep the money.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Doubters had me second-guessing.<eos> Where is David?<eos> What happened at that construction site, Harlee?<eos> Protective custody.<eos> Is that what you guys call it?
You can choose whatever room you'd like.<eos> Well, yes, but the problem is, after I pick a room and then settle in with my erotica novels, I never know if a guest is going to check in and disturb me.<eos> I know this is Los Angeles, but I'm an old-fashioned girl and I like my privacy.<eos> I dig it when the guests come in.<eos> It's like a free dirty movie.<eos> I'm into that amateur stuff.<eos> Are you three, like, a thing now? Ya.<eos> We try dating the lumberjack, but he's a gay.<eos> Okay, everyone, please, listen.<eos> This is important, and it affects every single one of you.
And when you disappeared, they had zilch.<eos> Now the whole shithouse has gone up in flames.<eos> Your stock is worth pennies.<eos> That is bullshit!<eos> You're a goddamn liar.<eos> Enough!<eos> This is not a democracy!<eos> We are not in the House of Lords!<eos> We are a ship at sea!<eos> And when it comes to you spirits, I am captain!
Now, I have provided you with various weapons.<eos> Take two. They're small.<eos> Uh... hack me. Strangle me. Bludgeon me.<eos> Surprise me.<eos> I think I can speak for everyone here when I say that we've all grown rather fond of you.<eos> We can't possibly murder you.<eos> It's not murder.<eos> She wants to be reborn.<eos> You're my family.<eos> I want to be with you forever.
Don't worry, Billie.<eos> I think you're gonna like living here.<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> No more specials or interviews or books or tweets or casual conversations at cocktail parties with Shirley MacLaine about this hotel.<eos> This place is dead to you.<eos> We will become a myth, which is what we should've been left to do anyway.<eos> What if I don't?<eos> One sure-as-shit thing I can tell you about being murdered: it hurts.<eos> And we like to make it last...<eos> None of you can leave the hotel, so... you can't hold me to my word, huh?
This is your chance, my darling.<eos> Viceroy of India, one year early.<eos> Take it, take it, take it.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> You do that.<eos> Oh, there's someone I have to meet, but I need to be, er... discreet.<eos> And who might this someone be?<eos> I can't say.<eos> Dirty dog.<eos> I've seen the pair of you.
Sir, I'm glad you are well again... .. but now this bill has finally passed into law, we've got a hot summer ahead of us.<eos> A defining season, if you like.<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe it would be the right thing - the responsible thing - for you to... .. stay firm.<eos> This is your moment, sir.<eos> This is your chance to make a dent in history.<eos> It won't be easy, I grant you. But it's within our grasp, sir.<eos> Yes.<eos> Show India that her future is safer in British hands.<eos> And who better to accomplish that than you?
Uh, just stay put one second.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> More hangouts!<eos> More hangouts!<eos> Wait, look!<eos> All right, hi, everyone.<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to give everyone an update.<eos> So Kelly and are inside watching "Mr. Robot,"<eos> and that's not gonna change, but if you want to join us, on our terms, there's a spot for all of you on the couch.
There's so much blood!<eos> So what would you like to do?<eos> - It's everywhere!<eos> Uh... I want to hang out with my friends.<eos> I just think it's bullshit that you invited me all the way up here just to ignore me.<eos> I didn't invite you. You invited yourself.<eos> Yes, because I've alienated Mike and all my friends so I could hang out with you more.<eos> I never asked you to do that. And, honestly, I think it's weird that you stopped hanging out with your friends.<eos> Huh, you want to know what I think is weird?<eos> That you guys still come to a cabin that you know for a fact is haunted by an undead lumberjack!
I feel the same way about you, Ultra Josh.<eos> You know what?<eos> We can't let this thing with Rosa get between us.<eos> Our friendship's more important.<eos> You're right, man.<eos> So I guess there's only one solution.<eos> We let her decide.<eos> One shall stand. One shall fall.<eos> Rosa, who is it going to be?<eos> I don't want to date either of you morons!
And I don't want to make it worse by mispronouncing this.<eos> How do you say this word?<eos> They didn't put in the goddamn phonetics in this speech!<eos> And I can't be expected to look this shit up myself!<eos> I'll find out for you, sir.<eos> And of course, there's been...<eos> "...ups and downs along the way."<eos> Like the big Amoskeag strike in the 1920s over pay and hours.<eos> But this industry survived that as well.<eos> And all of you in this room have been carrying on a tradition that goes back to the beginning of this country, and that's something you have to be very, very proud of!

Kevin.<eos> Can we see?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hi, Momma.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> The birthday boy.<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> You guys look like you're having so much fun.<eos> And I wish I could be there with you.
It says "Happy Holidays?"<eos> Barb, fuck you.<eos> God damn.<eos> I gave the guy the Christmas card. I didn't know he put "Happy Holidays" on there.<eos> Wow.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Guess it's stuck on there, huh?<eos> Oops.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Well, you know, you guys were coming over... I was so excited, I just had to do something, you know?
Oh, please.<eos> This is an Alaskan king.<eos> There's so much room.<eos> So much room.<eos> It'd really mean a lot to me.<eos> Please?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I owe you two an apology.<eos> When I get nervous all kinds of crap comes flying out of my mouth and I know that's not how you guys roll.
That's Justine.<eos> Yeah, she's like Siri, but awesome.<eos> I got that chick from The Big Bang Theory, Kaley Cuoco, to do the voice.<eos> J, say hi.<eos> Hey, Ned.<eos> Hey, Barb.<eos> How are you guys?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Stephanie's told me so much about you.
Just the little stuff.<eos> I was thinking about Laird's Christmas party.<eos> Gustav gave me a preview of the guest list.<eos> And, Dad, it is a veritable "who's who" of Silicon Valley power players.<eos> Tyson Modell is coming!<eos> Wait, who is he?<eos> What?<eos> He's the kid who founded Ghostchat. Oh, right.<eos> He turned down three billion dollars from Facebook, and he's only 24 years old.<eos> I'm gonna broker a sit-down between you two.
No, no.<eos> We didn't put you out of business or anything?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> Ruin our business?<eos> No, no.<eos> We're doing quite well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, that's great!<eos> Good for you!
Yesterday afternoon.<eos> How long have you been at this game then?<eos> "Let me help you, I'm a brave nurse, risking my life<eos> - for the cause."<eos> - She's here now, let her work.<eos> I didn't know what the Germans were doing, about death camps. - I knew nothing.<eos> - With the police kicking down doors, rounding people up?<eos> Go on, how long have you been at it? You, Englishman!<eos> Copper no less!<eos> It was one of you who kicked my husband's head open on the street. Ha!
What is this, Sadie Hawkins Day?<eos> It's not.<eos> I checked. It's kind of a grown-up party, so maybe you have a fancy uniform?<eos> It can be tight.<eos> It's fine. "Anyhoo," said the any owl...<eos> If you are satisfied with your message, press one.<eos> And, one.<eos> But then the wedding ring the doctor found wasn't even his.<eos> Listen up, side-pieces.<eos> My name is Jacqueline White, and I was once like you.
- You're done.<eos> - Hey I'm not done!<eos> - Hello?<eos> Anybody home?<eos> Is there a mechanic around here?<eos> Does he talk?<eos> - Once dead. The car is turn cut.<eos> If a god or,<eos> - enough Andy.<eos> What can I do for you fellas?
I'll get Justin.<eos> - You guys lived here long?<eos> - There is no smoking in the village.<eos> - What are you guys afraid of cancer?<eos> - We have them rules.<eos> Without rules, there's chaos.<eos> - It's okay to smile.<eos> - Pick 'em up on your way out.<eos> - Now we know why they're stuck in the past.<eos> You guys go 'head, I'll catch up with you in a few.
- Where are you going?<eos> - Tune in to some town gossip.<eos> - Justin!<eos> Justin!<eos> - Ah!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> Did you find the mechanic?<eos> - Barbaric, ain't it?<eos> - Guess it was.<eos> - What can I do you for?
- Is that why you chose the army?<eos> - It wasn't much of a choice.<eos> - And now you're headed back?<eos> - There's someone waiting for me.<eos> - She must be worth it.<eos> - Yep.<eos> She is.<eos> It's my mom.<eos> She's dying.<eos> What about you?
- To get some air.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> - It's kinda getting late to be out there.<eos> - You know she's right man, you should just stay behind.<eos> - No, no, wait, wait,<eos> I'll go.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> - It's time for a town haul.<eos> Get the doctor.<eos> - You guys serious?
- Pumpkin?<eos> Pumpkin, what's wrong?<eos> Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?<eos> Hey pumpkin, hey it's me.<eos> Say something, say anything.<eos> Come on you're scaring the shit out of me.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Come on, say something.<eos> I don't care what you guys think, but that's not Christie.
- And how do you expect to get them?<eos> - Well Mr. Wesson could be pretty persuasive.<eos> - Where did you get that?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> Move.<eos> - Cole.<eos> - Open up.<eos> Open up you motherfucker!<eos> I know you're in there!<eos> - Ain't it too late for you city folks?
Spector has come up with an offer.<eos> When are you coming home?<eos> Not for a while.<eos> I've got work to do here.<eos> Do you work for her?<eos> - Sort of.<eos> - There's nothing here...<eos> There's no sign of Rose.<eos> Go deeper, Stella.<eos> There's clearly something going on between you.
Oh. Sorry I'm late. Bit of a hectic morning.<eos> Although, sometimes when, uh, people are in conflict and they're left alone together, they tend to work things out themselves.<eos> Okeydoke.<eos> Let's jump right in, then.<eos> Uh, I understand there's some tension between the two of you.
That was delicious.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What, you showing off for the new girl?<eos> So what does that mean, exactly?<eos> "Risk Management Consultant"?<eos> Pretty much how it sounds.<eos> Most corporations employ a certain amount of risk... and I assess that risk against anticipated profit.<eos> Of course.<eos> Anticipated profit.<eos> So, did you two meet on the job?
Sorry, buddy.<eos> Morgan!<eos> Don't be afraid, Amy.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> I have to go say goodbye to mother.<eos> This is Dr. Lui Cheng.<eos> Technical Director of the L-9 Morgan program.<eos> It pains me to report an accident that occurred... during the scheduled psychological evaluation of Morgan.<eos> We had anticipated that, by developing a model... that was more self-aware... more autonomous, and more human... we could teach it to be the best of what we are.<eos> Our intent was to demonstrate to you, to the SynSect board... that a more refined and peaceful synthetic life-form is possible.
Mr Selfridge, rumour has it you've incurred heavy losses.<eos> Where's your actress friend, Miss Matthews?<eos> - How much did you lose?<eos> - How is being rich, Mr Selfridge?<eos> I hear you broke records in Milan.<eos> I know you have a better story than that, gentlemen.<eos> - Go on, how much was it?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Oh, come on, boys. Give the man a night off.<eos> There's a rumour about you and Elsie Lane.
- Go on, how much was it?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Oh, come on, boys. Give the man a night off.<eos> There's a rumour about you and Elsie Lane.<eos> Ah, Mr Selfridge! How lovely to see you.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> - Lovely to see you.<eos> - Good to see you, too.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, princes and paupers, and the Earl of Oxford Street himself...<eos> We've got a show for you tonight.
- Victor.<eos> - It's busy tonight. - Cabaret.<eos> People can't get enough of it.<eos> - And the gambling.<eos> - What gambling (? )<eos> Calm down.<eos> Harry Selfridge.<eos> - Don't you know who I am?<eos> - The Whiteley brothers.<eos> Father had a store, just like you.
But it is 20 years since you joined Selfridges.<eos> I hope to be here for many years more.<eos> Thank you. Shall I?<eos> Yes!<eos> Make a wish.<eos> You and Frank all settled in?<eos> So much to do. So many rooms!<eos> And the furniture from the old flat looks tiny in there.<eos> So, when do we get to see it, then? Dinner, Saturday?<eos> Everything's topsy-turvy, but if it's just you two, it won't matter.
- You haven't changed a bit.<eos> - Neither have you.<eos> - Oh, we have.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> We're frightfully, delightfully rich.<eos> Rich.<eos> - Jimmy Dillon.<eos> - Harry Selfridge. The Earl of Oxford Street.<eos> And Madame Rennard.<eos> So, Victor tells me this is all because of you.
They just give you an injection and then you lie down for a few hours.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I've done it loads of times.<eos> Don't tell them, though.<eos> - What if it's dangerous?<eos> - It's not dangerous.<eos> They wouldn't be allowed to do it if it was.<eos> - You'll be fine.<eos> I'm Henry.<eos> Some of you may feel a little drowsy.
Baby, baby.<eos> Baby, baby.<eos> Rhonda's fine, okay?<eos> She's so strong.<eos> But... the baby didn't make it.<eos> Andre,<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry, Dre.<eos> I'm so sorry, but it's okay.<eos> You guys are young.
I've been tasked with assembling an elite team.<eos> Of all the people who ever lived, I chose you eight.
What makes superheroes so powerful in this moment, in the big fight of good versus evil, ultimately, good wins.<eos> The good guys win.<eos> Let's work on some softer gloves for next time, okay?<eos> From that world comes "Legends of Tomorrow,"<eos> a team of heroes and villains who have come together to save humanity.<eos> They're being recruited by a time traveler from the future...<eos> Rip Hunter.<eos> I'm from East London.<eos> ...who has come back in time to recruit a group of very specific people.<eos> I know it's difficult for you to fathom, but in the future, none of you are heroes.
And I know the importance of keeping myself in shape.<eos> But can you believe a year ago, I looked like this?<eos> Yes, that's me.<eos> I tried everything, every fad diet, but nothing worked.<eos> And then my doctor recommended Lipocite.<eos> 'And I hope you have a very enjoyable evening.'<eos> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> My name is James Deakin.<eos> Don't worry, I'll keep this short.<eos> I know many of you have been asking about our highly sought after training courses.

I expect so.<eos> Grab some lunch?<eos> Something I got to do.<eos> - I'd like you both to be there.<eos> - Short notice.<eos> The optics would enhance the value of your endorsements enormously.<eos> I preach on Sunday.<eos> The perfect venue. Right after morning services.<eos> And with your family ties to Greater Page and the West Adams neighborhood...<eos> I'll save a pew down front for both of you.
- Anything from O.C.?<eos> - They told me to call Vice.<eos> - I'm on hold with Vice.<eos> - Detective?<eos> Yeah? Anthony Allen is a pornographer. TNA Productions.<eos> We thought he might be.<eos> Mobbed up?<eos> We don't have anything on that.<eos> Have you called Major Crimes?<eos> They said to call you.
Any other surveillance cameras? Besides the one in his office?<eos> Mr. A would not allow other cameras.<eos> Worried about leakage.<eos> - Leakage?<eos> - Internet. Unauthorized use material.<eos> Piracy.<eos> Terrible.<eos> Nothing Monday. Now we are Tuesday.<eos> Now we are tonight.<eos> This is you.
- Stop spinning!<eos> - Cyril, you stop.<eos> - What, protecting innocent bearings?<eos> - Being yourself!<eos> - What?<eos> Ooohh! - Excuse me?<eos> - Cyril, you have been given the opportunity of a lifetime... a new job, a new city where no one knows you, which means you can reinvent yourself.<eos> You can be anyone you want.<eos> So why would you keep being you?<eos> Huh. And that goes for the rest of you.
So, Veronica Deane is broke?<eos> No.<eos> She's...<eos> Oh, my God. Is that what this is?<eos> You're just intrigued by the idea of a sugar mama?<eos> - No, not at all.<eos> - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> - What? - She's not broke.<eos> But she doesn't have two million bucks for blackmail, so I figured I'd just bluff it, and then you guys would take 'em down.
[all groaning] Oh, relax.<eos> Worst case, an innocent migrant farmhand goes to turn on the milking machine and gets electrocuted.<eos> What? I mean, worst case we fry some circuits.<eos> Hmm... What?<eos> I mean, how's Mother?<eos> I wanna see her, put her up on the monitor.<eos> Okay! But just for a second.<eos> Oh and keep it on "mute." Carol.<eos> [all groaning] [Barry chuckles] Yeah, she's really losing her shit.<eos> ...hunt you bastards down and have your guts for garters, you hear me?
Well, guess what!<eos> You take your mother for granted? Fine!<eos> Good luck finding her without the coordinates!<eos> [all gasping] What the shit?<eos> I don't think that's gonna be a problem.<eos> [exhales] First thing, I'm taking a long hot bath with a nice stiff drink.<eos> And then I'm going to kill everybody! Yeah?<eos> Well, get in line, lady!<eos> [all] Hey, whoa! Calm down!<eos> After I kill all you idiots, I'm- [Pam] I found her!
Is it, like, gowns and gloves? And do I rent a girdle?<eos> Are there gonna be dress fittings?<eos> Do I get a bikini wax? And I don't know my tiara size!<eos> And, oh, my God, what of shoes?<eos> Uh, your attire will be provided.<eos> This is gonna be suckin' amazing!<eos> Yeah.<eos> [Pam] And so, when I said "suckin' amazing"... obviously I meant "suckin' bullshit."<eos> [sighs] I mean...<eos> Seriously? Oh, quit your griping, you three.
Move it, move it, move it. Let's go!<eos> Hang on.<eos> I got a big old wad of toilet paper stuck on my shoe. - Ugh!<eos> - Seriously.<eos> And I really need to check in with my babysitter, so...<eos> - Typical.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Make me.<eos> Ow!<eos> Hey, knock it off, you two!
Yes.<eos> Your 10:00 is here.<eos> I know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Gentlemen, thank you for coming.<eos> First off, killer marketing campaign.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Second, you've each been given a non-disclosure agreement to sign.<eos> If any of you repeat anything said in this room, I will skull-rape you so hard, legally speaking, that your great-great-grandchildren will spend their short, miserable lives as indentured servants to mine.
And so I want to hire you.<eos> To catch her in the act.<eos> I'll need video confirmation, of course.<eos> So you want us to follow him and...<eos> No, not just follow her.<eos> More than that.<eos> Much more.<eos> There's just too much at stake here.<eos> I have to be a hundred percent sure.<eos> And so I want one of you...
With who, Veronica Deane?<eos> With whom.<eos> And, no, not Veronica Deane, who, by the way, Lana, kissed me, and also when is Cyril's birthday?<eos> Uh, how should I know?<eos> Trick question.<eos> It's today. And we're taking him to a strip club because he is both sad and pathetic.<eos> - Typical.<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> Give my regards to all the molestees.<eos> Wait. Where are you guys going?
Tell that to Carol!<eos> - Whoa, gross.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Oh, this is vole's blood.<eos> - I hope.<eos> - That's disgusting.<eos> Well, whom or whatever's blood it is, I vote we go rinse it off with a mojito.<eos> Come on, we can still catch... Uh... happy hour.<eos> Seriously, worst happy hour ever.<eos> And I hate to do it, but I have to trash you guys in my online review.
Our scientists had to think outside the box.<eos> Oh, is that the box where they kept informed consent?<eos> Because I'm pretty sure that all those mental patients the CIA force-fed LSD didn't give it!<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Mental patients, Lana.<eos> They gave them LSD every day for six months.<eos> Not six months.<eos> The longest one was only - a hundred and seventy-four days.<eos> - That is six months.<eos> Oh, and what about Project Artichoke, before Ultra, where you dick-bags got innocent people addicted to morphine?
- You are exactly the one!<eos> - First of all...<eos> Could you both please shut up and do what I hired you to do?<eos> Which, if you already knew Hinkins was here... He's not.<eos> But there's somebody up there who should know where he is.<eos> Yeah, Lana.<eos> Archer, your professionalism never ceases to amaze me.<eos> You know what's amazing?<eos> Magnets!<eos> Especially for dumb idiots like you.
- You are under my...<eos> Ow! - You son of a...<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> - Oh-ho-ho! Walk in here with you idiots smoking reefers like a bunch of yardbirds, and you spritz me?<eos> You spritz me?<eos> - Well, let me tell you something, Herr Doktor!<eos> - Oh! I killed seven Krauts with a shovel, so one more beardy son of a bitch like you won't make a damn bit of difference!<eos> And you! Any questions, little Miss Blintzen?<eos> Mm-mm. And when I get back from lunch, you people had better be hard at work!
- Discreetly.<eos> If the insurance company pulls the bond or, God forbid, my investors back out, I'll be ruined!<eos> Don't worry, Mr. Crane. We won't let that happen.<eos> Put your faith in us.<eos> [groans] I'm afraid I must.<eos> We'll see you there this afternoon.<eos> Ellis, should we get back to the set?<eos> - And, uh, how are you holding up? - Pff.<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> As much as I hate, hate, hate, hate... to do this, a movie set is huge, so we're going to need all of you to go undercover, so...
What about me?<eos> Oh, you just sort of skulk around.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> And I shall pose as an executive producer, which leaves Sterling.<eos> Yeah, it leaves him right here 'cause I'll be damned if I'm helping Lana's new pretend boyfriend make a movie.<eos> - Oh, that's too bad.<eos> - Yeah, well...<eos> Krieger, I suppose you'll just have to be Veronica Deane's new bodyguard.<eos> Let's go, you dumb idiots.<eos> Well, one of you, anyway. The rest of you, I guess maybe carpool.
What's a C.D.L.?<eos> Commercial driver's license.<eos> And also a [bleep].<eos> You are so gross.<eos> [chuckling] That's what he said.<eos> But in Italian.<eos> Who said what in Italian?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> You'll gag.<eos> I thought maybe you dopes had stumbled onto some sort of mafia shakedown.
- Archer...<eos> - Yes, Lana?<eos> Would you care to tell the detectives... that I couldn't have killed Ellis... because I was busy beating your ass?<eos> I would love to.<eos> - There.<eos> See? - Unfortunately...<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> I must have gotten a bonk on the noggin, - because I can't remember anything!<eos> - Ohahhh! So, Miss Kane, you can ride with me...<eos> I'll call a van for the rest of you. And remain with you in a supervisory capacity.
They're going to kill us all... aren't they?<eos> We all know what they're after.<eos> Her.<eos> She's what they want.<eos> I'm taking her back to the burial ground.<eos> No.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I take her out of here.<eos> Ride through them.<eos> Buy the rest of you the time to get out of here.
- I take her out of here.<eos> Ride through them.<eos> Buy the rest of you the time to get out of here.<eos> Those drums are summoning more Warig.<eos> I can't.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Elvina, please, they'll kill me.<eos> Vishka, if we stay they'll kill us all.<eos> It has to be your choice.<eos> Get food and water, only what you can carry, enough to see you to the next settlement.
Payment in cash, I'm the only one to know this little party here ever happened.<eos> And that's with half a minibar down my gullet.<eos> I understand if you were looking for something else.<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> Let's get to the point.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, I hope you guys don't feel like you're slumming.<eos> I thought it'd be weirder.<eos> Bean bags, couple swings, maybe.<eos> At least tell me you guys have shower rooms.
What are you doing?<eos> You wanna come over?<eos> We could stay in, watch TV, go out to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que whatever you want.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Call me.<eos> I love you.<eos> ...to help you search for any kind of biological evidence.<eos> Then, according to police, further disruptions...<eos> Your presence here today makes it possible for the court to select a jury from a representative sample of our community.<eos> If it wasn't for people like you, we would not be able to make real the Constitution's guarantee of the right to trial by jury.
- It doesn't look stupid.<eos> The shirt you have on looks good.<eos> All rise.<eos> Let's go. Come on.<eos> Good morning, everybody.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Good morning, jurors.<eos> My name is Helen Weiss.<eos> I work for the District Attorney of New York.<eos> But my real employer, as I come before you today, is a young woman who lies in a grave at St. Raymond's Cemetery.
You were his only customer?<eos> There were, you know, some other friends.<eos> What did he charge?<eos> Ten dollars for a 10 milligram.<eos> You know where he got them?<eos> I think he had a prescription.<eos> You know what he paid to have it filled?<eos> No.<eos> Ten-dollar co-pay, insurance paid the rest.<eos> So, at his cost of 25 cents each, the $10 he was charging you comes to a 3,900% profit for him.
I didn't know him any better than you. I don't know.<eos> There goes the party train.<eos> "Off-duty." Like you are most of the time.<eos> That's it.<eos> Ah, just kidding!<eos> Hey, we got you... We got you something else.<eos> You got something you wanna tell me?<eos> About Petey?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The only pleasure I have is knowing how much of a pound of flesh both of you clowns have had to pay for your decisions...
I hooked up with someone else.<eos> - Not bad.<eos> - Not bad.<eos> I know we just met, so...<eos> I hope this doesn't seem too forward, but I was wondering what you think about maybe... setting me up with Abbi.<eos> She seems really, really cool.<eos> I would love to go out.<eos> Wait, uh, I was talking about your friend.<eos> No, I know, it's like, "mmmdoy"!<eos> You two are gonna be, like, so hot, you're gonna be like, "Uhh, uhh, uhh!"
You act and you think like you're all eco-conscious. But I see you with your iced coffees and your food to go.<eos> You are garbage island, and you are officially disconnected from the co-op for life.<eos> Fine.<eos> I hear the Bushwick co-op is better anyway.<eos> (laughing) All the co-ops are connected.<eos> We also have connections with security at Whole Foods. (both gasp)<eos> That's right, you two are going to be eating vending machine food and bodega veggies for the rest of your very short lives.<eos> Now, get the (bleep) out.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You "carniv-whores"!
Yeah.<eos> Alright, I'm gonna go put my stuff downstairs.<eos> - Welcome back!<eos> - Thanks, Dad.<eos> That wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.<eos> I've been here ten minutes.<eos> Just wait. No, she's gonna be caught up in the party.<eos> It's not gonna be so bad.<eos> I mean, you had to know that we would be upset.<eos> I wasn't thinking about you guys when I was fucking him.
And I'm not gonna cry. I'm not.<eos> To my mom and dad, everyone.<eos> Cheers!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Cheers sweetheart, cheers baby.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Do you want to say anything?<eos> - No. Just say something.<eos> You guys made Annabel and I believe that we could be anything.
- Do you want to say anything?<eos> - No. Just say something.<eos> You guys made Annabel and I believe that we could be anything.<eos> You made me feel like I could be whoever I wanted.<eos> Our power got shut off when I was, I think, three.<eos> Ummm, and I don't know how, how you did that...<eos> Had children, no money, and had to explain to them why?<eos> But... they acted like it was planned.<eos> So... we spent the rest of the night telling scary stories in the dark.<eos> And you guys just made it seem like a big adventure.

I will avenge you.<eos> The wound wasn't from a beast. He was stabbed.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> Never did.<eos> Slean is your half-brother.<eos> You're my blood.<eos> My son. Herot will need you, and you will come.<eos> Today...<eos> Hrothgar, Thane of Herot, will enter the Halls of the Dead.<eos> But my husband is not lost to you.
- Pull me in!<eos> - The argument with Bayen! Coin!<eos> It was about coin.<eos> Talk to Rheda's steward.<eos> Talk to Varr. - Why?<eos> - I went to Bayen's place, and<eos> Varr was there already.<eos> Come on.<eos> Time is running out.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, gentlemen.
It's like coconuts in paradise.<eos> - Paradise?<eos> - No one's gonna turn there. In paradise?<eos> But it's too far, too far for this boat.<eos> Well, do you guys have water?<eos> Yeah, we have some.<eos> We've got little pans out hoping it rains, catch something.<eos> 'Cause if not, we'll be drinking our own pee soon.<eos> Mm, tasty.<eos> Yeah, how about you?
We thought we patched it up, but we're taking on water.<eos> - Are you gonna sink?<eos> - The bilge pump is working, which is a miracle itself.<eos> We're gonna try and make land.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> The dead are there.<eos> You die on water, you die on land.<eos> - Gotta happen somewhere.<eos> - It doesn't have to be now.<eos> We can come. We can come and get you.
- Sheryl, I see you finally had that baby.<eos> - I did.<eos> I hope you and Mr. Golden picked out a nice Anglo name.<eos> Mr. Watts, I suggest you take this hearing seriously. What about the kike sitting next to you?<eos> You think she's taking this seriously?<eos> - Mr. Watts! - Shut the fuck up, Martin.<eos> - Mr. Watts.<eos> - We all know the drill.<eos> You're going to deny my parole, then go home congratulating yourselves on making the world a safer place.<eos> But what you minimum wage pencil dicks can't possibly understand is that however repulsive you seem to think I am, that the darkness swallowing this country whole and coming for you and your half-breed families is a million fucking times worse.
- Just some friends.<eos> - You have a ritual.<eos> - Upstairs is clear.<eos> - She was here.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Well, she's not here now.<eos> I wonder if this place has a basement.<eos> Satan didn't tell you to kill me. I just showed up.<eos> - I can't let you live.<eos> - Maybe I could just join you and worship with you and your buddies?
You could tell them about heaven, but apparently, that's "illegal" in schools.<eos> All I can say is, we better watch our backs.<eos> Millard's number one.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Rule of threes.<eos> Death always comes in threes.<eos> No, that's a myth.<eos> - Maybe you should celebrate. Millard's life by having a ceremony.<eos> That's a really good idea.<eos> Hey, did the photographer say anything inappropriate to any of you?
Gonna ask you to leave.<eos> FBI has no more jurisdiction here.<eos> Who has jurisdiction?<eos> Department of Homeland Security.<eos> I was assigned this case. Agent Scully is a medical doctor. We think we can communicate...<eos> Communicate?<eos> To say what?<eos> "You shouldn't have done it, son"?<eos> There's a chance to question him about - who was behind the bombing.<eos> - And you think he's gonna tell you?
I have a number I can call.<eos> I'll agree to relay a message.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ask Dr. Goldman if he'll talk to us about the Founder's Mutation.<eos> Stay here.<eos> I got to get out of here. What's your name?<eos> Agnes.<eos> You got a car?<eos> Do you want to call someone?<eos> You think if I could call someone I would be asking you?
No, we were just trying to get...<eos> You were playing some kind of crazy game.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> There goes your cops.<eos> You should have tried harder to stop 'em.<eos> That's okay. It's okay.<eos> We'll take good care of you.
What's up, family?<eos> Julián.<eos> Alonso, all good?<eos> Fine.<eos> Hello handsome.<eos> Hello.<eos> Come here, man, come here. A hug, damn it.<eos> How are you?<eos> Right now, excellent.<eos> And you all? How are you?
It's the Almoravids, a tribe from north Africa, that are at war.<eos> They are very fierce, the worst, I am telling you.<eos> But the rest of Spanish Muslims live alongside Christians in their taifas.<eos> They've been here for centuries, they're not invadors.<eos> I understand nothing.<eos> But if you say so...<eos> Amelia Folch.<eos> Yusuf Hwidar.<eos> I owe you my life, miss.<eos> I have something for you.
I understand it, I would feel the same way.<eos> Still looking at the map?<eos> Yes, we are discussing the best route to arrive in Valencia tomorrow.<eos> While there is a woman reading the map, not tomorrow nor the next day.<eos> Do you know something, Spínola?<eos> I am getting tired of you.<eos> Very.<eos> Ambrosio.<eos> That is what my friends call me.<eos> Especially if they are as pretty as you.
"Yippie ki -yay", motherfucker.<eos> -What did you say?<eos> Now it is our turn.<eos> To blood and fire!<eos> -Everyone lend a hand.<eos> Friends!<eos> I find it strange that my good Minaya did not remind you of the conquest of Aledo.<eos> If you fought with the same courage as today...<eos> -True courage is yours, sir.<eos> We could use more men like you in Castille, brave men.
On the death of your brother.<eos> Before those gossips could speak ill of my husband.<eos> I do not wish to bore you with my tales.<eos> I am going to retire.<eos> I beg you to stay a while and speak well of this wine.<eos> -That we will.<eos> Amina is preparing your accomodations.<eos> When you are ready, she will take you to them.<eos> Sleep well.<eos> You also.
(QUIETLY) But that is El Cid's cup.<eos> I am sorry, I had not realized.<eos> What is the problem?<eos> The DNA.<eos> It is here too?<eos> I don't know if you act like an idiot or you really are one, Spínola.<eos> That man is an imposter and we must prove it.<eos> An impostor?<eos> He speaks like El Cid, fights like El Cid, he is married to El Cid's wife.<eos> I am not as well-read as you, but...
What a shame we have to return to the Ministry.<eos> Return?<eos> Why?<eos> It is El Cid's blood.<eos> I cleaned a wound he recieved from a Saracen.<eos> We have his DNA now.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Spínola, for the love of God. Pay attention.<eos> What part of "no fighting" did you not understand?<eos> And you, what kind of education did they give you, that you do not know how to treat a knight?
Look.<eos> That is the courtyard in the Ministry Yes, in 1960.<eos> He's an impostor.<eos> Lock them up.<eos> Damn. (LAUGHS)<eos> How technology has advanced, shit.<eos> It's really bitchin', right?<eos> What year did you say you came from?<eos> From 2016, the last and main Ministry.<eos> And you, sir?
From 1960. But don't call me sir, huh?<eos> Don't call me sir.<eos> What a headache to speak like that all day long.<eos> 20 years here and I still haven't gotten used to it.<eos> You work for the Ministry?<eos> You are not the real El Cid?<eos> No, I'm not the real El Cid.<eos> Well you deserve to be.<eos> Thank you.<eos> -I have see few men fight like you.
Will you trade your wife's life for those of so many people?<eos> Do not go, I beg you.<eos> It is my duty.<eos> I always feel as though one day you will not return.<eos> My time has not come yet, do not worry.<eos> What is more, I am only going to scout, not to fight.<eos> Who are our guests?<eos> Better to call them our prisioners.<eos> Everything is in order, Jimena.<eos> I do not wish to argue with you... but you must concede that man is a hero.
I do not wish to argue with you... but you must concede that man is a hero.<eos> Yes, but for the wrong reason.<eos> I do not agree.<eos> He has given his life so that history stays how it was.<eos> Even if it's false?<eos> True or false, what difference is there?<eos> I have not studied as you have, but in my time we also listened to ballads about great victories and invincible kings.<eos> No one sings of a king who loses or of men who die in battle.<eos> History is always written by the winners, not those who speak the truth.<eos> I wish to speak with you.

Do you not hear him?<eos> Do you hear his drums?<eos> Do you hear the drums?<eos> They believe me dead.<eos> No.<eos> And the history has gone wrong.<eos> I should... by a wayward arrow, and not a sword.<eos> No one... will lift me onto my horse.<eos> And I won't win the battle after I've died.<eos> I will win it for you.
One more thing, Amelia and Alonso, are they back yet?<eos> Are they ok?<eos> Perfectly, they're here debriefing the boss.<eos> Okay All right, thanks, see you.<eos> Is it necessary that she be here?<eos> It is, she is back at her post.<eos> I won't ask for your forgiveness, because I know that forgiveness isn't gifted.<eos> I will prove to you that you can trust me again.<eos> I was born five centuries ago.<eos> It will take you another five before I trust you again.

He's headed your way.<eos> How did you know about the wardrobe?<eos> -Sorry, we are the ones who ask the questions here.<eos> We've already found eight bodies in the basement of your house.<eos> You have a child, Or not.<eos> What if it's fake?<eos> How long have you been traveling in time?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> I want to tell you that I have never known a woman like you.
Oh, good.<eos> Good, thank you. I've never played a video game in my life, but once yours comes out, I'm gonna be all over it.<eos> - You should try "Tetris."<eos> - It's a good one. By the way, I was reading a very interesting article in "The New York Times" about Mark Zuckerberg.<eos> I think you should talk to him.<eos> No, I...<eos> Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want to talk to me.<eos> - Oh, sure he does.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You two would have a lot in common. Huh.
What is it, are there two Cids?<eos> That is what you have to find out.<eos> I am Rogelio Buendía Ortiz.<eos> Agent 185, patrol 23.<eos> Lock them up.<eos> The real Cid died because of you?<eos> Yes, 20 years earlier than expected.<eos> The story is getting out of hand.<eos> And I won't win the battle once I am dead<eos> I will win it for you.

Do you know where it went?<eos> To my father's grave.<eos> It would go everyday.<eos> It wouldn't stop barking. Like if it wanted to wake him up so that he would continue stroking it.<eos> And Julián is like that dog.<eos> He has gone back there, I'm sure<eos> If it was like that, he wouldn't have written that he wants to start a new life<eos> Whatever it is, hope that he is happy. even if we don't see him again.<eos> Well I want to see him again.<eos> - Ah, so Julián and you... - No, no.
Julián and me nothing.<eos> Thank Goodness! I though the wedding picture was true.<eos> And I don't know what it would have annoyed me more you not telling me or to be so silly not to realize.<eos> - There is another picture.<eos> - Another?<eos> - But you have a baby?<eos> - Or not, what if it's false?<eos> - Has Julián seen that?<eos> Thank God.<eos> That's good, because that means he is not running away from you.
I hope that you are not very sensitive to the cold because you are going to have a hard time in our favourite prison.<eos> A medieval castle in the Pyrenees in Huesca.<eos> A medieval castle?<eos> Yes, with magnificent views.<eos> It's a pity that the cells have no windows.<eos> From here you can travel to other times.<eos> The conversation is over.<eos> I wish you a bloody long life, Mr. Morán.<eos> I will talk!<eos> But not with you.
In my times, it was a very famous movie.<eos> They said I look like the protagonist, who was a unique cop.<eos> And the actor who portrayed him was Al Pacino.<eos> - And that's where the name comes from.<eos> - Ah, and that Serpico. - was a good agente.<eos> - the best.<eos> Who doesn't give a shit about orders.<eos> He would fight against corruption and against the established power.<eos> - What power? - The ones in charge.<eos> And according to you, that is common of a good officer.
I think she is with Julián's computer.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Here he is.<eos> Cuba, 1895.<eos> Not a good moment to go on holidays, Julián.<eos> Let's see what I am going to argue about with my mother.<eos> One shouldn't argue with a mother.<eos> I lend you mine for a few days and for sure you will change your mind.<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> I wanted to tell you that I had never met a woman like you.
Are the two of you gonna follow Agustín down the aisle?<eos> - Yeah, right. - Mmm-hmm. Sorry, Disney princess.<eos> No, that dream's not happening. - I'm embracing my heterosexuality... - That's right.<eos> - ...but I'm not insane. - So that's a no?<eos> Malik and I made a very important commitment to living in sin, okay?<eos> Yeah. We're living in sin. We embrace the sin.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Sunday morning, we're not in church.<eos> Marriage is for the gays, all right?<eos> And you poor fucking bastards,
Soon you'll be adopting babies and going on family cruises with all the other Stepford homos.<eos> Hey, leave him alone.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Don't listen to them, Agustín.<eos> I think that what you're doing is amazing.<eos> - It's okay, Patty.<eos> I can take it.<eos> - You know I'm kidding.<eos> You know I'm messing around with you.<eos> - I'm thrilled for you and I think that, uh...
Do I love him?<eos> Yeah. Do you love Eddie?<eos> I always used to say that love is a social construct that doesn't really exist.<eos> I didn't believe you then and I don't believe you now.<eos> Okay, so what is it?<eos> Christ, don't ask me.<eos> Seriously, how would you define it?<eos> Okay, let me ask you a different question.<eos> Does the idea of being with Eddie make you happy?<eos> Like, the two of you getting old and gray together, smoking weed to ease the arthritis?
Yeah, where were you?<eos> Uh, nowhere.<eos> - So why do you look so...<eos> - I look fine.<eos> Shit, I need to pee now.<eos> - Really?<eos> - So do I.<eos> What?<eos> I really do.<eos> Okay, well, you guys pee and I'll meet you up there.
What?<eos> You wanna fly in here on your private jet and steal my fucking boyfriend?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Let's get the fuck out of here.<eos> You're not gonna come, are you?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> - Are you okay, bud?<eos> - He was just jealous.<eos> What?<eos> Everyone can see there's something between you guys.
See what we have brought back from Paris.<eos> Not just me, but also Lagertha.<eos> During the fierce fighting that took place around the walls and the gates of Paris, about which the poets will soon have their say, I saved Lagertha's life.<eos> And she saved mine.<eos> So I propose, even though we are not married,<eos> Lagertha and I will share the earldom and rule together as equals.<eos> As your Earl, that is my determination.<eos> Come on, keep them moving.<eos> This way, this way. Come, come, come, come!<eos> Gentlemen, do I have something special for you today.
Is it, Earl Kalf?<eos> Inge!<eos> You wonder where...<eos> Give me some more of this!<eos> Bjorn is teaching me to fight.<eos> Good.<eos> But remember, your grandfather, my father, was the greatest warrior of all time.<eos> He slayed the dragon Fafnir and is spoken of in the sagas.<eos> Surely you will inherit his warlike gifts.<eos> All of you will be great warriors.
_<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I have summoned you here because it seems that I have made a mistake, when I announced that Lagertha and I would rule together.<eos> Yes.<eos> Apparently, such an arrangement is unacceptable to some of you here.
_<eos> I have summoned you here because it seems that I have made a mistake, when I announced that Lagertha and I would rule together.<eos> Yes.<eos> Apparently, such an arrangement is unacceptable to some of you here.<eos> If it is the will of the majority, then, as is our custom, I will accede to it.<eos> Lagertha will be banished to wander where she will.<eos> Get back!<eos> Get away!<eos> Move!<eos> I ask those of you who desire her banishment to cut your mark in the post.
Around here, for each reader, there are four that do not know how to read.<eos> The future is in the theatre.<eos> Everyone goes and everyone pays for the ticket.<eos> But theatre is ephemeral and the glory of the written arts eternal.<eos> You cannot eat from glory.<eos> Books are paid once and can be read one hundred times.<eos> On the other hand, in the theatre if you feel like watching a comedy you will happily pay every time you go to see it.<eos> But comedies can be presented and at the same time publish books.<eos> There isn't enough money for all that.<eos> Then, I want to publish your last book without any costs for you.
- Yes.<eos> I will think about it.<eos> Upon my soul this book is good.<eos> Very good.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - With God.<eos> - 299<eos> Ladies first.<eos> And you...the second.
- And you are?<eos> - You are, Sir.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Gil Pérez, to serve.<eos> - You will get used to it.<eos> - I'm glad we see each other again.<eos> I say the same.<eos> We met in 1588 and you look the same.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> - Time doesn't pass by you.
- Time doesn't pass by you.<eos> It hasn't actually passed. I have passed through a door.<eos> That's the secret of my beauty.<eos> Do you know where Cervantes is?<eos> He is rehearsing "The baths of Argel" with his company.<eos> But that play never opened.<eos> Do you know tavern around the open-air theater?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - We will go there after the rehearsal.<eos> "From Arabia all the gold, from the south all the pearls. With servile decorum, I will go to offer them to you.
The moors have taken your wife. You will pay any ransom.<eos> Continue.<eos> "If you bring my wife back, I offer you a new world with everything that is kept in the sky and the earth.<eos> Madness I say, as I don't deserve reaching this distinction. Take my body, as you are taking my soul."<eos> Jump.<eos> I don't know what's best.<eos> Let's go to the next scene.<eos> Hello. Eh...<eos> I was looking for Mr. Miguel de Cervantes.<eos> You have him in front of you.
Let's see how can I explain.<eos> This is an invention from the 21st century where you can keep knowledge.<eos> Like a microfilm?<eos> Well, you use it with computers.<eos> You mean a PC.<eos> The case is that here fit movies, pictures, whole books... Whatever you want.<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - I think the same.<eos> Take it to Gil Pérez so that he can check what's inside.<eos> - And you?
- Don Félix Lope de Vega y Carpio.<eos> It's an...honour.<eos> I hope to be able to say the same.<eos> What brings here a member of the Holy Brotherhood?<eos> Whoever is the baby, I am not the father.<eos> No, it's not about any legal issues.<eos> I am a great admirer of your work.<eos> Well, it looks like after all it will be an honour to meet you.<eos> - Eh...sit down, please. - Thank you.<eos> So, please tell me, which one of my pieces led you to such admiration?
But do you want to work for somebody that achieves it the way he does?<eos> Lope looks down on his public.<eos> Thousand times it has been said that in the new art To the mass it is fair to talk simple in order to entertain.<eos> I think differently.<eos> The public deserves better and that can be done by giving it good food and good word.<eos> You can tell that he hasn't worked in television.<eos> Let's run away from the given life of hypocrisy and ambition. and look for our own glory the narrowest and most difficult path.<eos> Let's do it and we will be praised from whoever deserves it.<eos> You can trust my words.<eos> I stay with you.
They told me I could find you here and I thought it would be a good idea to pass by to say hello.<eos> I remembered you more friendly.<eos> Are you not going to invite me to come in?<eos> Yes, of course, of course.<eos> I'm sorry, but... I can barely see what my eyes are seeing.<eos> You are... You are Amelia Folch.<eos> I see that you haven't forgotten me.<eos> That's impossible, how could I?<eos> You are exactly like I remembered you.<eos> Time has been generous with you.

Extremely.<eos> It hasn't treated you badly either.<eos> Well. My temples already have grey hairs and the wrinkles are consuming my face, but thanks.<eos> However, your beauty has not<eos> - faded a bit. - your flattery either.<eos> Don't think so.<eos> Too many adventures have happened in my life for me to not take it more easy.<eos> And do you have time to tell me about them?<eos> Unless you are busy with other matters.<eos> None is more important than you.
But the Spanish language didn't want that from married to tired there was more than one different letter, so...<eos> I un-fell in love.<eos> But I fell in love again.<eos> Yes.<eos> And then again and again...<eos> I don't know why it doesn't surprise me.<eos> What it would surprise you is how expensive is to love.<eos> I wouldn't be able to stop writing for a minute.<eos> And we all win from that.<eos> And you..
I wouldn't be able to stop writing for a minute.<eos> And we all win from that.<eos> And you..<eos> are you still married?<eos> I think so.<eos> My husband abandoned me.<eos> But despite such mean thing, you are still in love with him.<eos> Do you think I shouldn't?<eos> Do you want my advice about love?<eos> I don't know any man who knows it better than you.
My husband abandoned me.<eos> But despite such mean thing, you are still in love with him.<eos> Do you think I shouldn't?<eos> Do you want my advice about love?<eos> I don't know any man who knows it better than you.<eos> The root of all passions is love.<eos> From it comes sadness, joy... happiness and desperation.<eos> - You are still my loyal reader.<eos> - As long as you keep writing.<eos> Amelia. No man who considers himself as such, would abandon a woman like you.
- And why wouldn't he know?<eos> Where...? Where am I?<eos> What is this place?<eos> Your Honour. And those clothes?<eos> No doubt this must be a dream.<eos> It is, a premonitory dream.<eos> Come with us, Mr. Miguel.<eos> We want to show you something.<eos> - But... why?<eos> - Because it's you.
- Nothing, a muscle relaxer.<eos> What happens is that the first time it is always very strong.<eos> I wish Lope would have seen all this.<eos> He would have died of envy.<eos> "In a place of La Mancha...".<eos> How was it called?<eos> "...of which name...<eos> I don't want to remember, not long ago lived...".<eos> It's open.<eos> - Ah, it's you.
She has to sing,<eos> ♪Adeste fideles,♪ ♪laeti triumphantes.♪<eos> ♪Venite, venite♪ ♪Venite, venite♪<eos> ♪Natum videte,♪ ♪regem angelorum.♪<eos> ♪Venite adoremus,♪ ♪venite adoremus.♪ ♪Venite adoremus,♪<eos> ♪Dominum..<eos> In the name of the Father, and of the Son,<eos> - And of the Holy... Spirit.<eos> - Amen.<eos> May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the friendship... the... fellowship of the Holy Spirit be... with you all.
Ney and Napoleon have confined Angustias to her cell.<eos> So Angustias screwed it up.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> Organize an escape of the prisoners, it's the only plan left.<eos> - Ok, but that could be dangerous.<eos> - Nothing is ever easy.<eos> That's your line.<eos> The monestary has underground tunnels.<eos> - We're going to use them.<eos> - I'm proud of you all.
I would like to confess.<eos> - Are you catholic?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I feel like I am living in sin.<eos> Ok, I'll hear your confession.<eos> - Mother Mary Most Pure - "Conçue sans peché".<eos> What are your "pechés"?<eos> I desire you.<eos> Thank you, I'm flattered, but...<eos> No one knows, but I desire you and many men.
Let me guess who is going to replace me.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You've finally gotten what you wanted.<eos> Outside there's a driver waiting with an official car.<eos> Thanks. I'd rather take the train.<eos> Truely, we'll all pray for your aunt to get better.<eos> Mother, we'll miss you.<eos> Thank you, sister.<eos> Sister Flora, you will make a magnificent abbess, I'm sure of it.<eos> I don't want to go without telling you that meeting you and apending time with you has been an unforgettable experience.
How many patients are there?<eos> 14<eos> And all because of some idiot who knows nothing about history.<eos> Oh, yes, sure she has three masters from United States and is a professor at one of those made-up universities.<eos> God, but what is it with this country, that the stupider you are, the higher you rise?<eos> I've never heard you talk like that.<eos> I've just never had the need to vent like this before today.<eos> How's Alonso?<eos> Bad.<eos> He's told Angustias that he loves her and that he loves you guys, that you're his family.
- Cultures?<eos> Maybe they're samples of the virus - to analyse it.<eos> - But without permission.<eos> The virus shouldn't leave here.<eos> And when I went all Colombo on him, he almost peed himself.<eos> That guy's hiding something.<eos> The antiviral company is the one Marañon told us about, Schäuble.<eos> You're right.<eos> We have to tell Ernesto.<eos> You.
With your husband, I imagine.<eos> No.<eos> You are mistaken.<eos> As the youngest daughter, I stayed home to care for my father until he died.<eos> - He passed away a few weeks ago.<eos> - Damn.<eos> My condolences.<eos> And where will you live?<eos> My cousin and her family have a house close to San Marcos.<eos> And you?
My condolences.<eos> And where will you live?<eos> My cousin and her family have a house close to San Marcos.<eos> And you?<eos> Does someone wait for you?<eos> I am a soldier.<eos> I have never married.<eos> A long time ago I decided that no woman should suffer my absences.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - Also... I never met a woman like you.
- Yes.<eos> - Man, talking to the dead is easy.<eos> The kicker is getting them to talk back.<eos> A few months ago, time travel seemed like a fantasy, too.<eos> And look at you now.<eos> Well, you've got me there.<eos> There's nothing more ridiculous than a guy in a cape.<eos> Well I like it.<eos> Thank you, Susana, for the warning.<eos> Hoover could be a serious enemy for Darrow and for you.
He's talking about the case of the missing girls.<eos> The girls are dead.<eos> They are very close to their house.<eos> In the garbage dump... on Cea Bermúdez street.<eos> - We have to go there.<eos> - We must go there and confirm it.<eos> I will take charge myself.<eos> I'll call the Police chief.<eos> The Valle coronel is a good friend.<eos> Do not leave here, either of you.
Supergirl.<eos> Yes, remember that life. With James and Winn and Hank.<eos> Your friends need you.<eos> And I need my sister!<eos> Kara, I can't choose this for you.<eos> You have to choose it yourself.<eos> Please come back to us, Kara. Please.<eos> I wish...<eos> I want so much for all of this to be true.<eos> To stay here with you.
I thought this was mandatory.<eos> Hey, um...<eos> We need to talk about that "perfect fantasy world" I was in...<eos> Kara, we don't need to discuss...<eos> I want to tell you guys why I imagined myself on Krypton.<eos> It's not because I hate it here.<eos> It's because the past few weeks I've been feeling lost and...<eos> Like I did when I first came to Earth.<eos> So I started fantasizing about the same things I used to back then.<eos> I chose to come back because I realized I belong here with you.
What'd she say?<eos> Let's just go get your fucking wallet, okay?<eos> Yeah, hello.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah, my dad just left his wallet here.<eos> He's, um... he's the guy you just hooked up with. So...<eos> Why, no. We... we didn't... we just had some wine, kissed.<eos> We... we... we kissed.<eos> Uh, I'm Keith.<eos> Okay, Keith, well, I don't really know why my dad's wallet would've fallen out of the pants he says he was removing if you just kissed, so I'm starting to feel like I can't really trust any of you people.
- The amount of money you cost us in paper alone<eos> - And thanks to me,<eos> - I'm hardly making any commission, - makes it worth letting you go.<eos> - which saves the company money.<eos> - Ilana, Ilana, Ilana. I need you to leave.<eos> I should stay.<eos> - I need you to leave.<eos> I am strong, and you are fired.<eos> This is just the white man holding on to the last nugget of his power.<eos> You white dudes are figuring out that the jig is fucking up!
Oh, you are absolutely fired, effective immediately.<eos> You're right, it's time to change.<eos> And I figured it out.<eos> I want to be... in you.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Yeah, I... ahem...<eos> This is it, guys.<eos> The last hurrah.<eos> I'm really gonna miss this place.<eos> I'm gonna miss each of you.
You know, you don't need to wear a helmet.<eos> I'm a very good driver.<eos> It is insane that you drive a car with no doors.<eos> You are such a goy for driving this car, it is unbelievable.<eos> I want a DNA test.<eos> Okay, do you think Will Smith's mom lives around here?<eos> By the bowling alley?<eos> No. Will would buy, like, a much better spot.<eos> No shoes, no entrance.<eos> Yes, you, the Jews.
You really shouldn't.<eos> That Beanie Baby was worth over $13,000 depending on the strength of the yen.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Dude...<eos> - Come on.<eos> - It's over.<eos> Aah, I am so happy you two guys came down.
- Leent.<eos> It's... Um, it's "lint."<eos> It's like we're really camping.<eos> Even the wind feels real, right?<eos> The wind's real.<eos> It just feels like we're not in "the shitty."<eos> If we could see the stars, this would be so... romantic.<eos> Yeah. I used to love sleepovers when I was a kid.<eos> The first time I ever saw any sex stuff was at my friend Amina Eltreebee's birthday party.<eos> Did she... do it right in front of you?
- Love ya.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> Is that Lincoln?<eos> Oh, my gee, Lincoln.<eos> Come here.<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> 'Sup, Ab?<eos> I was waiting for you guys to finish so we could talk privately.
Open relationships are unstable.<eos> Cheating is victimless.<eos> Yeah... this is... this is done.<eos> I don't even know what I'm doing.<eos> And lose the nipple rings.<eos> Where were you, Miss Ilana?<eos> I was taking a shit if you have to know.<eos> - Ilana...<eos> - I have something to say.<eos> You guys must be a really amazing team if you had two perfect children and have stayed together for 35 years.
There she is.<eos> Fresh Lychee's, Ab.<eos> Where'd you get the corsage, Ab?<eos> I ran into my florist.<eos> "My florist," excuse me, Queen of Sheba.<eos> Okay, back to business.<eos> - Happy anniversary.<eos> - Happy anniversary!<eos> Happy anniversary!<eos> You guys are just love!
I will speak in Spanish.<eos> I've got two mixed feelings about receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature.<eos> On one hand, I m flattered.<eos> Really flattered.<eos> But on the other hand... and this is the bitter feeling prevailing within me,<eos> I'm convinced that this type of unanimous recognition is directly and unmistakably related to the decline of an artist.<eos> This prize proves... that my work agrees with the tastes and needs of judges, specialists,<eos> academics and kings.<eos> Obviously, I'm the most comfortable artist for you.
A crazy idea that I wanted to realize.<eos> Everybody said I was insane, that there was no way an outstanding figure like him would listen to me and so on.<eos> But this shows you that with tenacity, with effort and with imagination, sometimes dreams come true.<eos> All of us, common people, working people, we did it!<eos> I'm thinking... The people of Argentina should be really proud!<eos> Maradona, the Pope, the Queen of the Netherlands, Messi.<eos> And now you, dear Daniel.<eos> It's a pleasure for me to present him with the highest honor given by the community of Salas:<eos> The Distinguished Citizen medal by the hand of our beauty queen!<eos> And now, I give you the Nobel laureate in Literature and newly appointed Distinguished Citizen of Salas,
They should give you awards,<eos> -because you work for them!<eos> - Very good!<eos> Very good!<eos> A great performance. Very convincing. Even better than the one you did this morning.<eos> Great acting. Congratulations.<eos> And thank you for your idea. I might use it in my next novel.<eos> Although, I don't think it'll work, because it's too stupid and ridiculous.<eos> Now, please, get out of here.<eos> These people are here to listen to me, not you.
No...<eos> I'd rather walk. I need some air.<eos> - Don't forget our hunting date. - Yes.<eos> Today I'm a distinguished figure. Although a lot of people don't really know why.<eos> A kind of national hero you recover from the cabinet and dust if off... so that he's present at some cultural event and makes a little speech. And then put back in the closet.<eos> A definitely small-town fate for someone who, for over thirty years, has been trying to escape precisely from that.<eos> But, to be a national hero, I still need the most important thing.<eos> My own death.<eos> Lastly... You deserve an applause... Because you kept coming.<eos> For you.
Must be nice to have a real budget. Right?<eos> How the other half lives.<eos> RICO.<eos> I think it's something else.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Gentlemen, J. Griffin, agent in charge.<eos> In charge of what, exactly?<eos> This task force.<eos> Task force for what, exactly?<eos> What can I do for you, detective?
What you, uh...<eos> What you mean, like riding horses and shit?<eos> Yeah, it's somethin' like that.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah, but I don't ride horses.<eos> You'll ride this one.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Down to your skivvies.<eos> Anything you don't want covered in oil for the next 20 years.<eos> You guys all did this?
- So what do we do?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> At the arraignment, Rykoff's attorney will alert the judge to a fault in the search warrant.<eos> The judge'll toss the gun, he'll dismiss the charges,<eos> Rykoff will be released. What about us?<eos> We have a homicide investigation here. Right.<eos> You go about your business.<eos> Just make sure you stay away from ours.<eos> And provide us with a play-by-play.<eos> So we know what the fuck you clowns are up to. Harry.
Oh, Harry Bosch.<eos> Wow, I heard you were back on.<eos> Been back a couple of weeks.<eos> Already caught a case.<eos> Pornographer shot twice, stuffed in the trunk of his car.<eos> Mm, the relentless glamour of police work.<eos> This is my partner, Julie Espinosa.<eos> - Harry Bosch, nice to meet you.<eos> - Good to meet you.<eos> Heard you guys caught a hot one.
These are inadmissible.<eos> No shit.<eos> Irving.<eos> - You did this with Irving?<eos> What the fuck, Harry?<eos> What's he got to do with this?<eos> The cases are connected.<eos> George was part of Nash's crew.<eos> They figured out he was undercover.<eos> And you guys were running your own investigation.
We collected six weapons from the scene.<eos> Nash's crew had no serial numbers on their weapons.<eos> Firearms has them now.<eos> It'll take them a couple of days.<eos> They'll call you when they're ready for you to follow up.<eos> Okay, no problem.<eos> What else?<eos> The DA's negotiating a deal with O'Grady, pushing it through.<eos> Exigent circumstances with Nash at large.<eos> We could use one of you at the first interview. Ask about the Allen case.
You've taken a piss on peace.<eos> Bring out the black banners, I say. The war banners.<eos> Finish what you started.<eos> You're disrespecting the proceedings.<eos> You've disgraced these proceedings with your acts of war.<eos> ...Khan of all Khans.<eos> Thus we begin the Kurultai.<eos> It's a shame Nayan couldn't be here.<eos> I'm very sorry about your brother.<eos> It was you who snatched your father from our camp.
We're beyond lies, Mother.<eos> My body speaks.<eos> It says I am not a mother.<eos> It says for all to hear.<eos> Any swollen sow can feed your children.<eos> You must raise them.<eos> You must nurture their minds to grow into a Khan and a Queen of unassailable character.<eos> Go, Mother.<eos> To your Khan.<eos> He needs you now more than I.
They're looking for us.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Your turn, monk.<eos> Search the village!<eos> Look at their faces!<eos> Stand aside.<eos> I said stand aside.<eos> Do not chide them for following my orders.<eos> You should not be here.<eos> Not if you care for her as she does for you.
You do not want to be here when that day comes.<eos> In the morning, when the Khan is looking for you, I will ensure our scouts report you rode east.<eos> I will protect your secret... so long as you protect mine.<eos> Will you tell her I said goodbye?<eos> While your father is alive... make as many friends as you can... see as many lands as you can.<eos> Do you remember these words? Do you remember?<eos> The games are done.<eos> The drink and dinner consumed.<eos> There are no prayers left to pray.<eos> I have been given the honor of asking one question of each of you on behalf of these noble chieftains.
I will take Kaidu... and all of his kin... and every sympathizer who remains in the House of Ögödei... and I will bury them here... in his beloved dirt.<eos> So this is how the blind monk passed through walls?<eos> Every legend must come to an end.<eos> Put your weapons down.<eos> We don't want to hurt you or your men.<eos> Put them down or I take them from you.<eos> You are serving a traitor.<eos> I am serving the Vice Regent, monk, at my Khan's orders.<eos> And my father sent us to stop him.<eos> Neither of you holds any authority.
Kaidu or the Khan.<eos> I don't know who you serve, bastard.<eos> And the monk?<eos> Do you question his loyalty to our Khan?<eos> You know it, in your heart.<eos> My heart knows nothing but duty to the empire.<eos> Take their weapons.<eos> I have in my hand a letter that could save this family.<eos> A missive from Ahmad.<eos> No doubt intended for you.
Better I let the Empress explain it to you.<eos> You have until the sound of the horn for the start of the vote.<eos> If the people of Mongolia have not received your abdication of the throne, I will walk into the pavilion... and whisper it for all to hear.<eos> What fucking madness has infected your head?<eos> You can protect your throne... or you can protect your family.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Kokachin.<eos> You've come to say goodbye.<eos> Why did you tell me?<eos> - It should have been you.
You did what was necessary.<eos> You did the hard thing.<eos> For our family.<eos> And our kingdom.<eos> - I deserve your anger.<eos> - No.<eos> - I deserve your blows.<eos> - No, Chabi.<eos> You did it for me.<eos> I was wrong, my wife... to think I could be without you.
Who will care in the West?<eos> No one else, hmm?<eos> Well... now Khutulun... Kaidu.<eos> Wine from the silver tree.<eos> I hate that thing.<eos> It does stand out, doesn't it?<eos> Möngke always had... flair.<eos> That's one way of describing your brother.<eos> Where's Khutulun?<eos> This is between you and me.
You were prepared to destroy me... right from the start.<eos> Poison from the Goyo plant.<eos> We have to go.<eos> We have to go right now.<eos> You may want to hold on to that.<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> Thought or hoped?<eos> Thought.<eos> I hoped you'd return.<eos> I need you.
Coy.<eos> Heartbroken.<eos> Lonesome.<eos> But there was one... emotion... we were taught never to display.<eos> Anger.<eos> Because no man... wants a woman who threatens him.<eos> For survival... we learn to suppress it... to bide our time.<eos> I never would have loved you.<eos> But I would have supported you.<eos> Fought for you.
His forces have already claimed the lives of billions.<eos> And if we possess the means to stop him, and again do nothing, then their blood is on our hands.<eos> As a Time Master of long standing, you seem to forget our responsibility is to protect the timeline, not humanity.<eos> You wish to engage in the very sort of manipulation of time that we are sworn to prevent.<eos> And yet, if we allow humanity to perish at the hands of evil, then what universe are we custodians of?<eos> What if, in trying to save the world from Savage, you make it vulnerable to another, more terrible despot?<eos> We are not warriors, Captain Hunter. We possess no army.<eos> And I'm not asking for one.<eos> Just a single timeship and your permission to change history before Vandal Savage puts an end to it.<eos> I'm not appealing to you as Time Masters, but as humans, please.
To travel through time.<eos> To capture Savage before he grows into the monster he becomes.<eos> You got the wrong guy.<eos> - "Hero" ain't on my resume.<eos> - Or mine.<eos> I know it's difficult for you to fathom, but where... when I'm from, the year 2166, you and everyone on this roof aren't just considered heroes... You're legends.<eos> Legends?<eos> I, um, I hate to nitpick, but doesn't a legend have to be dead?<eos> Yeah, see, uh, that's a deal breaker for me, so I'm gonna pass.<eos> It's dangerous for any of you to know too much about your own futures, but I am here because each of you, as individuals, is destined for greatness.

Of all the people who ever lived, I chose you eight.
Professor Aldus Boardman.<eos> Professor Boardman is the world's leading... well, only... expert on Vandal Savage.<eos> We're gonna pay him a little visit.<eos> Course plotted for St. Roch, New Orleans.<eos> - St. Roch?<eos> - October 17, 1975.<eos> I suggest you all strap yourselves in.<eos> Temporal navigation isn't something one wants to be standing up for.<eos> Time travel. Cool.<eos> Some of you may experience some slight discomfort. In very rare instances, there will be some, uh, bleeding from the eyeballs.
Oh, it should only last a minute.<eos> After all, that was a mere jaunt.<eos> The further back in time you go, the worse the side effects. - Better?<eos> - It's all relative.<eos> Good.<eos> I can't believe you kidnapped me.<eos> - Hey, I want to go home.<eos> - Good news, then.<eos> 2016 will be around in, uh, 41 years.<eos> Now, you three, feel free to make yourselves comfortable back here on the ship, while the rest of you are coming with me to find Professor Boardman. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is unbelievable. 1975.<eos> Imagine all the wondrous applications of this technology. A chance to witness the construction of the pyramids, the end of the dinosaurs.<eos> I've never been to 1975.<eos> It's rather colorful.<eos> So, where can we find Professor Boardman?<eos> In his lecture hall.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> We're too late.<eos> This is... I'm, I'm sorry.<eos> You.
But you were in love with another. Prince Khufu.<eos> Savage, or Hath-Set as he was then known, learned of the affair and was consumed with jealous rage.<eos> You believe me yet?<eos> Which drove him to murder you both.<eos> And prayed for the hawk god, Horus, to damn the objects of his hate for all eternity.<eos> But Chay-Ara had a prayer of her own, that Horus would protect them forever.<eos> But another life was bound to theirs by accident.<eos> Savage's.<eos> That's why he wants us both dead.<eos> My theory is that the three of you were exposed to the same radiation by the meteorites.
Edith Boardman.<eos> Wait, I... we were related?<eos> I don't remember you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> You always warned me that if I ran into you in your next life, you might have forgotten me.<eos> That's us at the World's Fair.<eos> You're just as beautiful as I remember you. Mother.<eos> How old were you when...<eos> You two were murdered?
This should help you find him, and the vengeance that has eluded me all these years.<eos> Jefferson... something's happening to Jefferson!<eos> We seem to have a little problem back a the, uh, vessel. There's an intruder.<eos> We really must be going now.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Wait.<eos> We can't just leave him here.<eos> We have to get back now.<eos> You said he's going to die in 24 hours. And we can stop it.<eos> Are either of you a Time Master?
Who the hell is this guy?<eos> Is that a laser gun?<eos> Gotta get back to the ship and bond with Jefferson. Cover me!<eos> Cover me too.<eos> Oh, you crazy old man.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Palmer. Seriously?<eos> It's Dr. Palmer.<eos> Get down!<eos> We need to merge!<eos> We go out for one lousy drink, and you guys somehow manage to pick a fight with Boba Fett.
Anywhere but here!<eos> Our cloaking shield and aft entrance have been significantly compromised, Captain.<eos> Yes, I can see that, Gideon.<eos> Station us in the temporal zone while I work on repairs. Temporal zone?<eos> Yeah, it's essentially a time limbo.<eos> We can hide out there for a bit.<eos> Another temporal jump would risk revealing our position. A time limbo?<eos> Astonishing.<eos> Oh, there's something you people don't know about time travel? That's surprising, isn't it?<eos> Considering none of you have ever time traveled before.
At some point I was, in fact, a Time Master.<eos> Will you people please stop hitting me?<eos> Start telling the truth!<eos> I relinquished my position as a Time Master when I commandeered the Waverider.<eos> Chronos was clearly sent to bring me in.<eos> - You lied to us. - Of course I lied to you.<eos> I needed your help... you all barely said yes as it was.<eos> What about the legends part?<eos> Ooh, you lied about that too, didn't you?<eos> I chose you all because, a hundred years from now, your lives have minimal effect on the recorded timeline.
Yes, perhaps you're right.<eos> Back home. As Firestorm.<eos> What if I don't want to go home?<eos> Yet, I mean.<eos> Why the change of heart?<eos> You ever play football?<eos> Yeah, I didn't think so.<eos> Anyway... the best feeling I ever got from being on the field wasn't when I made a great play, or we won some game.<eos> It was when one of my teammates took a tackle for me, and I knew they were gonna make sure I was safe, that nobody got to me.<eos> Watching all of you rush back to the ship, even those two knuckleheads, to take on Chronos? Made me feel the same way.
All right!<eos> These rings are the first of a dozen accessories that are gonna unify the bridal party.<eos> As you can see from my preliminary vision board, our wedding will borrow equally from the holy trinity of Liz Taylor,<eos> Jackie O and The Power Gays.<eos> - Oh, I'm scared.<eos> - You should be.<eos> Guys, look at us.<eos> A year ago, we were spinning around like cows in the movie Twister.<eos> Now look at us.<eos> You guys are engaged. You're a minority owner of the bar. I'm the maid of honor who's made of honor.
I'm going to kill this soft serve nonsense.<eos> You know what we're gonna do?<eos> We're gonna play laser tag!<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> We're gonna play laser tag!<eos> It's a fun American game! It's a fun game!<eos> Groomsmen!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Love each and every one of you sons of bitches.
No...<eos> Todd is in town.<eos> - Ploons?<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> Went to college with this guy.<eos> He's the worst guy on Planet Earth.<eos> His grandfather invented the springs that go inside pens.<eos> He's got, like, a billion dollars.<eos> Once he paid apl.de.ap from The Black Eyed Peas to hang out with him, just so he could look cool.<eos> How much are you guys gettin' paid for this?
He's got, like, a billion dollars.<eos> Once he paid apl.de.ap from The Black Eyed Peas to hang out with him, just so he could look cool.<eos> How much are you guys gettin' paid for this?<eos> Bunch of marijuana.<eos> And these carrots.<eos> I just got a text from him.<eos> "Nick the Dick"... hate that...<eos> "it's Hot Daddy T"... hate that...<eos> "in La-La Land."... hate that...<eos> "Excited to talk "bachelor party with you.
Yeah, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You ever taken gloves off before?<eos> We could've paid for Tokyo, but a business venture went south and ultimately, it was my fault because the company was my baby.<eos> I can't believe you guys have never been to Tokyo.<eos> I've been there 28 times!<eos> Where do you guys get your sneakers?<eos> - 28 times?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And you idiots couldn't even figure out how to get there once? Ha!
- Oh, thank you, Teddy.<eos> - Thank you. We're gonna crush it, man.<eos> Hello.<eos> Wh-Where are you?<eos> Are you armed?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shit.<eos> Look, I'll be back as fast as I can, okay?<eos> You guys, make this shit better.
But nobody goes from zero to hero like the Chinese, though.<eos> - Am I right?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> I mean, sure, they've got billions of people, but it's not about that.<eos> It is about a willingness, a willingness to fully exploit your labor force, your natural resources.<eos> It is a willingness to actively, aggressively deregulate and reach a climate of maximum growth potential.<eos> Are you saying it exactly like I'm saying it?<eos> I try.<eos> Of course.<eos> My clients, the Kohl brothers, can make this happen for you by rolling out the most extensive private capital foreign investment plan in contemporary history.
But ever since then you've been losing focus.<eos> - We've been losing accounts.<eos> - Jake...<eos> - Now, if you can't do the job...<eos> - Jake...<eos> Look, if you can't do the job, if you need some more time,<eos> - then bring someone else in here.<eos> Look at you, your mind ain't in it.<eos> Listen, man, I thank you for talking to me. But I'm trying to build an empire here, you know?<eos> And I'm not gonna forget you little people.
I'm just hanging out.<eos> But I don't wanna be late for Grandma's. You need to go and get ready for dinner.<eos> - I'll finish that later.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Your mother's a very hard woman to find.<eos> Well, when you spend your life running from collection agencies you get good at that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You asked me what I want from you.
He kicked the fuckin' teeth out of a vice cop in Back Bay.<eos> How do you fuck your knee up kicking' a guy in the mouth?<eos> I over-kicked. I hyper-extended it.<eos> - I thought he fuckin' got suspended.<eos> - Hey! I fuckin' hear you, numb-nuts.<eos> - Sorry, that's what I heard. - What'd you hear?<eos> - I heard that you got suspended.<eos> - Do I look suspended? - No, sir.<eos> - He doesn't look suspended.<eos> Would I be sittin' here staring' at you two chowderheads if I was suspended?
- I thought he fuckin' got suspended.<eos> - Hey! I fuckin' hear you, numb-nuts.<eos> - Sorry, that's what I heard. - What'd you hear?<eos> - I heard that you got suspended.<eos> - Do I look suspended? - No, sir.<eos> - He doesn't look suspended.<eos> Would I be sittin' here staring' at you two chowderheads if I was suspended?<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> Life is a rigged fucking game.<eos> You two just passed "Go." Buckle it the fuck up.
- Look...<eos> No more words. I just wanna get to the Hopkinton, all right?<eos> - What time you gonna run?<eos> - Under three, I hope.<eos> That ain't happening'.<eos> What are you lookin' at?<eos> World's most overpaid meter maid.<eos> Wow. You wanna move the barricades?<eos> I gotta get to Hopkinton.<eos> Hey! Well, don't stand around. He told you to move the barricade, not me.
We shouldn't have put the bombs ground level. We shoulda put that shit waist-high.<eos> - Go get the right milk, Dzhokhar. Go!<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> I don't wanna hear any more of her bullshit. Go get the right milk.<eos> Mind if I ask you a couple of questions?<eos> Did you see anything out of the ordinary?<eos> - Anything suspicious? - Nah. Did you see anybody put bags down or...<eos> Thank you very much. Appreciate it.<eos> Has anybody spoken to you guys yet?
My boss thinks I should be executed.<eos> But his boss thinks I should get a medal.<eos> Well, you need to talk it through with your boss.<eos> Be clear and direct about what you're feeling.<eos> If his problems or lack of clarity are causing him to stand in your way, then your truth and clarity will blow right through him.<eos> FBI doesn't exactly work like that.<eos> I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<eos> Good morning, class.<eos> If you are in field hockey, they're gonna be in the lower field, not the upper field.<eos> The Centre would like to know why I don't have the kind of relationship with you that keeps something like this from happening.
You lied to me.<eos> There's no other way to look at it.<eos> I told you they should go, and all you said was no.<eos> When we disagree on something, the next step isn't to do it behind my back.<eos> It makes them wonder if I can do my job.<eos> If you could've seen Paige with her, you'd understand.<eos> It was the right thing to go.<eos> For a lot of reasons.<eos> I came out of retirement to work with you, to help you.<eos> But I don't want to be put in this position between you and the Centre.
Anyone who gets near this has to be vaccinated.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I tried to keep you out of it.<eos> This is for a kind of meningitis you could get from the last two samples he got for us.<eos> No dead drops.<eos> Keep it in your custody.<eos> Who is he?<eos> William.<eos> How long has he been here?<eos> Longer than you.
No dead drops.<eos> Keep it in your custody.<eos> Who is he?<eos> William.<eos> How long has he been here?<eos> Longer than you.<eos> He's running this alone?<eos> Yes.<eos> He had a partner, but it didn't work out.<eos> Not everyone's as lucky as you two.
Maybe you're not an idiot.<eos> So, the evil wizard Archumen has cast a powerful spell of pestilence over Celdur's Crossing.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> My grandma lives in Celdur's Crossing.<eos> It's cool though.<eos> She's a raging bitch.<eos> This guy, he kills me.<eos> Archumen's also abducted the fair Princess Galiana, and secreted her to an unknown lair.<eos> The four of you have been... It's not a craps table. Okay?<eos> The four of you have been hired to track down Archumen and save the princess.
Bye, Phoebes.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Davis/Dexter's patent extension strategy is played out.<eos> There just aren't enough drugs in the pipeline to keep re-patenting.<eos> And with the RD improprieties, the inevitable PR backlash makes putting a new line of drugs into the pipeline even more crucial to Davis/Dexter's long-term security.<eos> Douglas.<eos> Of course, now we've identified several prospects currently in development.<eos> Next-gen antibiotics, immunotherapies, and some potentially ground-breaking advances in the soon-to-be huge market of food allergy drugs.<eos> By fast-tracking these projects, Davis/Dexter's future growth is all but assured.<eos> That is, of course, unless someone beats them to market.<eos> Someone like you fine folks here at Novax.
Previously on House of Lies...<eos> Clyde just took Jeannie's office, like that.<eos> - No... It's mine!<eos> - It's mine! You guys make this shit better.
I'm really thinking of pulling my people out of here.<eos> Oh, well, that would be stupid even for you, Grant.<eos> I'm sick of your shit, Marty!<eos> Something tells me that your people would not follow you.<eos> Oh, you want to see?<eos> - Why don't we see? - I think it's called a contract.<eos> Fucker!<eos> Hey, Jeannie, welcome back. And good-bye.<eos> Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on!<eos> I happen to know that the two of you have a grudging fondness for one another.
He's out there fighting them with Michonne and some others.<eos> It's time.<eos> Up the alley.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Denise is safe.<eos> Did you see her?<eos> Yeah, she made it to the infirmary.<eos> - I'm gonna go help Rick.<eos> - I'm going, too.<eos> - I'm with you.
- Oh, thanks.<eos> We need a search team at the farm.<eos> How many officers are joining us?<eos> I'm the only one assigned to you.<eos> Others are prepping for the storm evacuation protocols.<eos> Okay, well, we need to get out to the farm right away. We need to talk to the owner.<eos> He's waiting for us.<eos> We are now receiving footage of the typhoon making landfall in Cambodia.<eos> It's moved north and is due to hit Thailand in 24 hours. - Oh.<eos> Oh, it's you.
I should get a motorbike like that.<eos> Have you met Benz yet?<eos> Yeah. He let us look around.<eos> None of his doors have locks.<eos> Laura and Sarah stayed in a crowded bunkroom with two other girls from England, who said that they packed up their stuff and left.<eos> Guys' room is even worse.<eos> Besides this road in here, there's only two other paths that lead out.<eos> So we should be looking for footprints, tire tracks, anything that helps us figure out what went wrong<eos> - and where.<eos> - Simmons, you two get started.
Yeah. He let us look around.<eos> None of his doors have locks.<eos> Laura and Sarah stayed in a crowded bunkroom with two other girls from England, who said that they packed up their stuff and left.<eos> Guys' room is even worse.<eos> Besides this road in here, there's only two other paths that lead out.<eos> So we should be looking for footprints, tire tracks, anything that helps us figure out what went wrong<eos> - and where.<eos> - Simmons, you two get started.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - I will join you.
You see what I see?<eos> Yep.<eos> And that is definitely not Jeff.<eos> [Shouting in Thai] He says he didn't hurt him.<eos> [Speaking thai] Hey!<eos> [Ring] We've got Jeff's stuff.<eos> We got Jeff.<eos> Jeff's dead.<eos> ____<eos> Make sure you guys build a perimeter and then push outward. No.
He had a detailed journal, telling us he was soul-searching.<eos> There were no indicators he was suffering any psychosis.<eos> He was just a lost 20-year-old kid.<eos> I will let the others know.<eos> We're ready for a profile.<eos> Gather your officers.<eos> [Speaking Thai] Now that Jeff is cleared as a suspect, we need to focus on what the unsub did to his body.<eos> I want you to take the lead on this.<eos> - You think he'll listen?<eos> - Well, if there's only you two talking, he won't have a choice.
How about you?<eos> How about me what?<eos> Are you seeing anyone?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You're still pissed at dad?<eos> Elliot, I'm not gonna talk about your father.<eos> It's between me and him.<eos> -We both love you. -Yeah.<eos> You guys always wanna know everything about me, but I don't know anything about you two.
No, of course not.<eos> It's nice you're wishing me well, but I have been without my kids for over three months, and from day one, their lawyer say they wanted to come home with me. So, when you're talking about their best interests,<eos> I don't think this was good for them.<eos> I also think there are plenty of rich people who drink themselves silly and ignore their children.<eos> They don't even discipline their children, and I don't see any of those people sitting out there waiting for hours because someone accused them of being a bad parent.<eos> Nobody's taking their kids away.<eos> And yes, I am very happy to have my kids home.<eos> But now i have to figure out how I'm gonna make up all the hours I missed at work to be here so I can support them.<eos> And I have to let my scared little girl know that no one's taking her from her mom again, and I got to let my boy know that all of this wasn't his fault.<eos> So, maybe this is ending for you, but... It's not over for me.
[snoring] I know Rosa isn't flashy like the "Maxim" magazine type most guys are into, but that's kind of what I love about her.<eos> It's like I'm the only one who can see how special she is.<eos> Uh, I got to go.<eos> Hey, hey, man, uh, what are you guys all waiting for?<eos> This is the line to ask out Rosa.<eos> What? You guys all want to date Rosa?<eos> What I like most about her is that she isn't flashy like the "Maxim" magazine type most guys are into.<eos> I guess we're all just the only one who can see how special she is.<eos> Gentlemen, I need one straight line here.<eos> We're gonna get as many of you guys in to ask Rosa out as possible, but for now, I need you to remain in line till she's ready to date.
Kiss!<eos> Kiss!<eos> Kiss!<eos> I think...<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> I think I'm gonna split.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - What, really?<eos> Yeah, I got to... got to... uh, yep.<eos> I think you guys should just stay put.
I'm cool with it.<eos> So you guys like each other and you want to date Well, I'm not upset In fact, I think that's great<eos> 'Cause I'm cool with it<eos> He's cool with it<eos> Totally cool with it<eos> Yeah, he's cool with it<eos> Now I bet you think I'm jealous Well, that's something I'm above<eos> I'm psyched that my best friend Is with the girl that I... Know from work and consider a friend.<eos> He's cool with it<eos> I'm... I'm really happy for you guys.
- Oh, no. - [Jeannie] Oh, yes.<eos> [Doug] Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> Ooh, come to get his dick wet on the high seas, eh? !<eos> It is!<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> - Fucking Dushkins.<eos> - [Alex] Oh, yeah. [Kyle] Unbelievable.<eos> Oh, the whole gang is here!<eos> Alex and Kyle.<eos> What the fuck are you guys doing here?
First time in 30 years.<eos> Does that sound depressing to you?<eos> Doesn't sound depressing to me.<eos> It's not not depressing.<eos> Guys, the club is fantastic.<eos> What's depressing is the squandered opportunity.<eos> Right now, you're in a limited space, and you're just wasting your talents.<eos> Could you imagine if you owned an entire ship? Right?<eos> I mean, your own fucking ship.<eos> Owned by you, operated by you.
You need to go back to your stateroom.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> It's wildly inappropriate that you're here.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> But if Clyde were here, it'd be wildly appropriate, right?<eos> Who is Clyde?<eos> "Who's Clyde?"<eos> Like you don't know good old "engine room" Clyde.<eos> You two... peas in a fucking pod.
- He in love with you.<eos> - He so in love with you.<eos> It drive him crazy.<eos> Okay, you guys, I jus...<eos> I don't even really think that he likes me like that.<eos> Seriously, he's always like,<eos> "Shoshanna, you're a really shiny star at this company."<eos> He wants you.<eos> He wants to take you to a love hotel - and check in for a year.<eos> First of all, maybe I am a shiny star at the company, because even though I've only been here for a very short while, I truly feel like this is my home and you people are my family.
Stole the stuff.<eos> Rafael?<eos> Fuck!<eos> I told you you shouldn't have let him call us homos.<eos> - FBI!<eos> Hands up!<eos> - Where's our stuff?<eos> This is all useless now.<eos> We're going to have to start all over.<eos> - No way you jotos are FBI.
What the bitch?<eos> What?<eos> Enemy close.<eos> We doing this?<eos> No.<eos> He's someone who was with a whole lot of someones who didn't listen.<eos> We can make a deal right here, right now.<eos> That's right, we can.<eos> Give us all your stuff.<eos> We'll probably have to kill one of you. That's just the way it is, but then we can start moving forward on business.
We doing this?<eos> No.<eos> He's someone who was with a whole lot of someones who didn't listen.<eos> We can make a deal right here, right now.<eos> That's right, we can.<eos> Give us all your stuff.<eos> We'll probably have to kill one of you. That's just the way it is, but then we can start moving forward on business.<eos> All you have to do is listen.<eos> Yeah... that deal's not gonna work for us.<eos> Fact is, I was about to ask for all of your stuff, only I'm thinking I don't have to kill any of you.
Maggie?<eos> On your knees!<eos> All right!<eos> We got a full boat.<eos> Let's meet the man.<eos> Pissing our pants yet?<eos> Boy, do I have a feeling we're getting close.<eos> Yep.<eos> It's gonna be pee-pee pants city here real soon.<eos> Which one of you pricks is the leader?
You don't really think that you were gonna get through this without being punished, now, did you?<eos> I don't want to kill you people.<eos> Just want to make that clear from the get-go.<eos> I want you to work for me.<eos> You can't do that if you're dead, now, can you?<eos> I'm not growing a garden.<eos> But you killed my people, a whole damn lot of them. More than I'm comfortable with. And for that, for that you're gonna pay.<eos> So, now... I'm gonna beat the holy hell outta one of you.<eos> This-- this is Lucille, and she is awesome.<eos> All this, all this is just so we can pick out which one of you gets the honor.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Stop it!<eos> God--!<eos> - Nope, get him back in line.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't.<eos> All right, listen. Don't any of you do that again.
Copper's been struck!<eos> Francis staked the mine on a game on cards.<eos> He lost.<eos> To sneak away under our very noses and marry that drunkard.<eos> Perhaps it was wrong -- but I did it for love of Verity.<eos> Will you go?<eos> Perhaps you prefer your guests to be ruined in silence.<eos> Go.<eos> Is it the putrid throat?<eos> I'll stay and look after you all.
- Which part?<eos> They were starving for food. Did you encourage the riot which broke out on the beach?<eos> - I did not consider it a riot.<eos> - Do you approve of plunder and lawlessness?<eos> Do you approve of whole families being without sufficient food to keep them alive?<eos> What part did you play in the death of Matthew Sanson?<eos> Regrettably, none whatsoever.<eos> Enough of this insolence.<eos> Ross Vennor Poldark, I am committing you for trial at the Bodmin Assizes.<eos> Bail will be set at £100 and may God have mercy upon you, for I most assuredly would not.
Dwight.<eos> He cannot just bury his head.<eos> And will you tell him?<eos> It's almost upon him, how will he defend himself?<eos> Who will speak for him?<eos> I will. But there must be others.<eos> And plenty of them.<eos> The Crown will already have assembled its case.<eos> And no doubt there'll be plenty who'll be glad to help it.<eos> - Can I rely on you, Tankard?
Ross, if something goes amiss in court, how is Demelza fixed?<eos> How is that your concern?<eos> If your sentence is prison, or worse, well, she would be entirely alone with no source of income.<eos> - Whereas you yourself are swimming in guineas(? )<eos> - No, no, no, I've a little put by.<eos> Why would you offer it?<eos> I don't forget what we owe Demelza.<eos> Mr Warleggan, ma'am.<eos> Elizabeth, you look ravishing today.<eos> And you too, of course, ma'am. I do not.
In that case, may I offer you some advice?<eos> By all means.<eos> You may flaunt your guineas on lavish garments and fancy carriages.<eos> You may purchase a coat of arms and deck out your servants in gaudy livery.<eos> You may even buy your way into every club, mine and drawing room in the county.<eos> But what you will never buy is nobility or breeding or even common decency!<eos> Are you quite sure you don't wish to apologise, Francis, given the nature of our association?<eos> You own me. I acknowledge that.<eos> My indebtedness to you has long muddied the waters between us so I trust that any confusion about my feelings is now entirely cleared up?<eos> I'll visit you in jail with a list of the witnesses who are to appear against you.
And those for me?<eos> A shorter list.<eos> Friends' and workers' testimony, presumed biased, will easily be dismissed.<eos> Meanwhile, I advise you to reconsider your attitude.<eos> It's no detriment to me if you choose to run your neck into a noose.<eos> But I suspect it might be to yours.<eos> Mr Warleggan!<eos> I see that Unwin speaks the truth.<eos> He cannot stir an inch without you.<eos> He says the same of you. Of course!

Of course!<eos> We're both indispensable to his ascent in the world.<eos> - I, as a hunting trophy...<eos> - Caroline... - and you as...
with a deal I'm pretty sure I could pull off with my eyes closed.<eos> I understand.<eos> But these cases take time, Emery.<eos> Mistrials are a hazard of our trade. It may happen 10 or 15 more times before we get the verdict we want.<eos> I know it feels like you're being put through the wringer.<eos> I am being put through the fucking wringer!<eos> I can't believe I'm having to explain this to you, the lawyers we pay to solve this!<eos> XHP is now projecting negative $300 million for this year.<eos> Look, if you're gonna do a sales pitch, tell me how XHP wins.<eos> It's clear you guys get paid whether we profit or not.
No... Hands down, no.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm studying law.<eos> I believe that.<eos> I won't ask what kind.<eos> Patent.<eos> Are your siblings as smart as you?<eos> No.<eos> My brother's great, though.<eos> Just the two of you?
Something is coming.<eos> Something hungry for blood.<eos> A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness.
Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.<eos> You, uh, notice anything... odd about him the last few weeks?<eos> No, we're fixin' to go fishing down the Etowah next Sunday.<eos> That's for sure, but... nah.<eos> He got any enemies you might know about?<eos> I mean, people who might not want him around?<eos> The exes didn't like him much. - When was the last time you saw him?<eos> - Yesterday.<eos> Lunch, same as always.<eos> - Just you and the boys?
Are you sure you're on the right channel?<eos> I don't think it's about that.<eos> I think, somehow, she's channeling him.<eos> -Like... like Professor X.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Are you actually believing this crap?<eos> I don't know, I mean...<eos> Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger?<eos> He sounded a lot like that.<eos> Did you guys not see what I saw?
Pull me out!<eos> - Shepard, come in.<eos> Over. - Comms are down, sir.<eos> Shepard, come in! Over.<eos> Will Byers' death is an unimaginable tragedy.<eos> Will was an exceptional student and a wonderful friend to all of us.<eos> It's impossible to express the hole his loss will leave in our community.<eos> I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.<eos> She's a local grief counselor from the church over in Jonesboro.<eos> But before she comes up here, I just want those of you who are having trouble dealing with this tragic loss...
Yes, I copy!<eos> Do you?<eos> They know about Eleven!<eos> Get out of there!<eos> They know about Eleven!<eos> The bad men are coming!<eos> All of them!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> The bad men are coming!<eos> "Mad hen." Does that mean anything to you?
- Yeah, I'm serious.<eos> You shouldn't have done that.<eos> - Done what?<eos> - You know what.<eos> You mean call her out for what she really is?<eos> Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember you asking me to stop.<eos> I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.<eos> - What the hell, Steve?<eos> - You know, neither of you ever cared about her.<eos> You never even liked her, because she's not miserable like you two.
- No?<eos> - I mean... you can, but it'd be really weird.<eos> You go to school dances with someone that, you know... someone that you like.<eos> - A friend?<eos> - Not a friend.<eos> Uh, someone like a...<eos> Nancy.<eos> Hold on, I'll be right back. Stay here.<eos> Go!<eos> You two, on me.
- It roars in anger!<eos> - Will, your action!<eos> - What should I do?<eos> I...<eos> Fireball him!<eos> Fireball the son of a bitch.<eos> Fourteen!<eos> Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra.<eos> It makes a painful... and then... it crumbles to the ground.<eos> Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time and, and, and... and...
♪ Hey, now, now, now, now ♪<eos> ♪ Hey, little baby ♪<eos> ♪ Hey, now, darling ♪ ♪ Where you stay out all night long ♪<eos> ♪ You know your daddy's home ♪ ♪ All night long ♪<eos> You must attend the morning ritual in uniform.<eos> Outside.<eos> Sit down, man.<eos> - Gentlemen...<eos> - Gentlemen.<eos> ...it seems that one of you was not content last night with the hospitality of the palace and sought diversion elsewhere.
And Devil Dogs.<eos> Go.<eos> Now.<eos> Bye.<eos> Where was I?<eos> You were just telling us how much we suck.<eos> Right, but it's my job to help you suck less.<eos> I trust you're familiar with The Kinks.<eos> Is this a bloody joke?<eos> That's up to you. "All Day and All of the Night."
I got you.<eos> Jocelyn, you're back with me.<eos> Wait, I don't know who you...<eos> I'm Isabelle.<eos> I've never seen Jace so curious about a mundane... or distracted.<eos> Like you saw earlier, distractions are dangerous in our line of work.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Who's Jace?<eos> You really don't know much, do you?<eos> All I know is some psychos took my mother, and now you people have taken me.
- You don't find that strange?<eos> What I find strange is that you're so upset.<eos> Maybe you're upset by the way Jace is looking at her.<eos> You know, you should be happy that Jace is interested in someone other than himself.<eos> Maybe I'm pissed that she's ruined the mission.<eos> We never found out who's buying the blood.<eos> That was our one job.<eos> Your wound, it's healed.<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> So, what, I'm miraculously healed, and all of you... stunning people have magical powers?
Did they say who leaked it? - No, of course not.<eos> - All right, draw up a statement.<eos> Say the charges have been investigated, found to be baseless.<eos> The president has total faith in his nominee.<eos> - Does the president know?<eos> - I'll tell him.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm gonna be in the news tomorrow.<eos> Some of the things they'll be reporting will be shocking to you.
Is that what you'd do if people were lying about you on national television?<eos> Good morning.<eos> I'm Dave Swank,<eos> Dean of the College of Law.<eos> Professor Hill, a member of our faculty, has asked an opportunity to hold a press conference this morning to respond to some of the information which has been on the television and in the newspapers.<eos> So without any more, Professor Hill.<eos> So that's her, huh?<eos> This is good.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I have three points that I really want to make clear here with you today.
Well, if we hired you, you must be a genius.<eos> Yale?<eos> Stanford. Then Wharton.<eos> Okay, Stanford-Wharton.<eos> Electric Sun is controlled by Kazawitz.<eos> He also owns 19.3% of Lumetherm backdoored through his stake in Southern Wind.<eos> You see that block trade last Thursday come out of Merrill? Yeah.<eos> That was Fortress cashing out their shorts before the merger.<eos> Trade was at 12:52, when everyone was at lunch, which tells me they wanted it to be missed.<eos> You guys caught it, which is something, I guess.
You guys are rock stars.<eos> Yeah, we get it. You want to be one, too. None of that matters.<eos> Uh, Spyros, if you've locked on to some trail of bread crumbs that leads to Bobby Axelrod, that could be a win for everyone.<eos> So, leave your stuff, we'll take a look, and we'll let you know if it rises to the level that we can prosecute, one that won't be reversed on appeal.<eos> You know, I understand the source of your reluctance.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - I have a wife, too.<eos> But it's your job...<eos> Hey, you got your answer.<eos> We're done.<eos> I loved and remember each and every one of your fathers, so I'm proud of all of you who are ready to head off to school in the fall.
You got to be thinking, "Why was he spared?<eos> Why is my husband gone?"<eos> For months after the planes hit, all I could do was ask myself why.<eos> Why was I the only surviving partner?<eos> Why wasn't I there?<eos> Could... could I have done something?<eos> Why was I the only one out of the office on meetings that morning?<eos> We'll never know.<eos> So I made up my own "why."<eos> Because of you.
And to that end... my people have a few questions.<eos> Your Sharpe Ratio's very low.<eos> How does an idea turn into an investment at your shop?<eos> What's your mosaic theory at Axe Capital?<eos> Fees from funds like ours used to pay your overhead.<eos> How are you dealing with floating it all yourself?<eos> I can't allow myself to care about that.<eos> What I do care about is making decisions to benefit a greater number of people.<eos> Now when I'm only working for myself or my staff, I'm sharp enough.<eos> But when I'm making decisions for you as well as me, that's when I'm twice as careful, twice as focused, because I cannot live with losing somebody else's money.
Well, you can pick a school based on the villa or vice versa.<eos> I have a packet of all those options for you.<eos> And the timing can work as we've planned? Yes.<eos> These particular schools are used to business people's children coming and going for a variety of reasons.<eos> Will you be enrolling them under their real names?<eos> What?<eos> Some don't.<eos> The stigma.<eos> They want their kids to have a clean run at their new lives.<eos> We can provide fresh passports for all of you.
Let's get off the street.<eos> I got it for free. All right.<eos> All right. Okay.<eos> Dinner!<eos> So, all y'all kids going to the movies tonight?<eos> Regina and I gonna go see that new horror flick.<eos> - Which one?<eos> - Satan's Cheerleaders.<eos> -I heard about that. -Satan's Cheer--?<eos> You boys going with them?
Right you are, sir.<eos> Sergeant!<eos> Jaldi!<eos> Downstream!<eos> Your Excellency.<eos> Enough of that.<eos> Well, Freeman, it's a hell of a house.<eos> The Vicerene detests it.<eos> Oh, does she?<eos> Oh, I've got something for you.
She won't listen to a word I say.<eos> She's the spit of her damn mother, that's the truth of it.<eos> And look how that ended up.<eos> No.<eos> Something needs to be done... ..for Ralphie's sake.<eos> Where shall we go?<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> Miss Alice.<eos> Bhupi.<eos> There is somebody for you.
Well, what a finely turned suicide note this afternoon is turning out to be. Oh, I don't know.<eos> He seems to be enjoying himself. This is gone quite far enough.<eos> Oh, we're just getting started.<eos> Look, you're going to have to work with the man whether you like it or not so there's no use in acting like a spoilt child.<eos> I win.<eos> Or I lose.<eos> Can't just soldier on.<eos> We're not done yet.<eos> Every chap has his weakness. Yes, Bhupi?<eos> A message for you.
I should probably go. No, no, wait, wait.<eos> Just five minutes.<eos> Chelo?<eos> You asleep in there?<eos> Come on, let's go, lovebirds.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come!<eos> What do you see?<eos> I see heaven and earth. Hmm.<eos> But you... You see something else?
Shit.<eos> In this heat?<eos> Yo, is it just me today, or is it like... the Bronx is getting closer to the sun?<eos> How can I help you guys?<eos> Certainly.<eos> We're after that Clubman 1-1 mixer right there in the window.<eos> And the turntable.<eos> - My good man, about your payment plans...<eos> - I gotta stop you right there.<eos> For you guys, unfortunately, everything up in the front window is full-sticker price, or I can't help you.
And the turntable.<eos> - My good man, about your payment plans...<eos> - I gotta stop you right there.<eos> For you guys, unfortunately, everything up in the front window is full-sticker price, or I can't help you.<eos> - No, your sign says... - Yeah.<eos> It says "easy credit."<eos> It doesn't say "let me bend over, so you could easily fuck me," right?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Look, you guys seem like nice kids, but I got a business to run here.<eos> And for the last six months, boys who look like you have been coming in here every day, saying:
Whoa, I... I think you overestimate my powers.<eos> Mylene, she's her own person, and all she wants to do is sing.<eos> Because of you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mylene came to see you for all of this.<eos> Her hair smelled como tu cigarros sucio.<eos> And that awful dress. That was you.<eos> And the man in the church, the record producer...<eos> She wants to sing!<eos> And you...
My...act?<eos> What act is that?<eos> Come on. You're a poverty pimp.<eos> Is that who I am?<eos> Well, who are you, Ed?<eos> And I'm not speaking rhetorically here.<eos> I'm really asking.<eos> You see my streets out there?<eos> You even bother to take a look on your way in?<eos> You people downtown.
What you think, Mylene?<eos> I think I'm an idiot.<eos> He was my only chance, and look at him.<eos> And, Regina, how did you even know how to do all that back there?<eos> My mom used to do that for my dad.<eos> -I'm sorry.<eos> -Don't be sorry.<eos> I just learned, sometimes, you gotta take some bad with the good.<eos> ¿Tú sabes?<eos> Well, I couldn't have done it without you.
Gracias por venir.<eos> - Hey, jefe.<eos> -Look who's here for you.<eos> -Hey.<eos> There goes my angel.<eos> And her crew.<eos> Jackie.<eos> Why don't you get our beautiful young ladies something to drink?<eos> Virgin piña colada.<eos> I'll be right with you guys.
- Yeah, sure.<eos> This one is from when I grew up poor on Arthur Avenue... the guinea section of the Bronx.<eos> Dear Lord, bless this food as the porridge thickens.<eos> But give us more, Lord, because we're skinnier than them Puerto Ricans.<eos> -To Jackie Moreno.<eos> -To my brother. For seeing the light.<eos> And to Mylene for coming home.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> And I would just like to say to my beautiful daughter... and to all of you... we all have flaws... we all wrestle with demons...
Yes, you did.<eos> -Warlords working for him.<eos> -Tell me that shit ain't true.<eos> Ain't this family been good to you?<eos> -And I was trying to save it.<eos> -Save it?<eos> She's trying to go after Nicky Barnes.<eos> Ask her.<eos> You don't have to be a genius to know that's suicide.<eos> You go after Mr. Untouchable and you gonna get touched.
- That's right.<eos> And then there's Mario Cuomo.<eos> -I like Mario Cuomo.<eos> I know Mario.<eos> -Can I have that after?<eos> I used to play sandlot baseball with-with-with Mario, a long time ago.<eos> Pero, the unions, they have Mario in their pockets.<eos> Es la verdad. That's the truth.<eos> And I like the unions, but I'm gonna ask you something right now.<eos> How many of you actually have a nice union job?
Fuck Zeke.<eos> We don't need him.<eos> This is a DJ battle, right?<eos> Don't forget, whichever crew gets the B-boys to rock is the crew that comes out on top.<eos> Hello, South Bronx!<eos> -How you doing?<eos> -We got no hot water.<eos> How you doing?<eos> And let me tell you, that is a crime.<eos> And speaking of crime, how many of you feel safe in your own neighborhood?
-We got no hot water.<eos> How you doing?<eos> And let me tell you, that is a crime.<eos> And speaking of crime, how many of you feel safe in your own neighborhood?<eos> -Spend a night out here and find out!<eos> -I grew up here.<eos> And what I see is nothing short of a national emergency.<eos> And you know what?<eos> It makes me mad as hell.<eos> How about you?
Now, I could daze.<eos> Right.<eos> Or doze off, or talk about the comets in the sky.<eos> Or how quick they fly by.<eos> Or I could listen.<eos> And say, we're a team.<eos> And as a crew or a squad... we work together like Moses did...<eos> - to help his people.<eos> - All right.<eos> Some-- Some of you know what I'm talking about.
There's... the keys... ugh.<eos> There's something up with the lock.<eos> I'm here. I'm in the house.<eos> Oh, Oh, hi.<eos> Can you let me in?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> I called your friend J.<eos> Julian?<eos> And it became apparent within about 30 seconds that, uh, the two of you have been fucking for quite a while.
Brushes.<eos> Can you put down your brush sticks?<eos> We just... we'd like to have a conversation, please.<eos> Tom, you can hold them, but can you just stop making noise so that we can talk?<eos> Tom, put them down.<eos> Look, this won't take long, but it's important.<eos> And I'm making "important" sound bad or scary and it's not.<eos> It's... it's not.<eos> What it's really all about is... a better way to be as a family.<eos> A better way for us, for your father and I, to be a family for you, with you.
Got to come out head first, or neither of them gon' make it.<eos> No, no, no, no, no! Shh!<eos> Put something in her mouth.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no... (screams) No, no...<eos> Miss Suzanna gonna throw a fit, she hear all that noise coming up at the big house.<eos> It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.<eos> It's a boy.<eos> ♪ But, oh, I'm not alone... ♪<eos> My name's John Hawkes.<eos> And I stand before you today because the future of our country is being decided inside this courtroom.
Can I offer a hand?<eos> Thanks.<eos> No problem.<eos> Mr. Hawkes.<eos> That was a thought-provoking speech you gave earlier. Oh.<eos> Good to know at least one person was listening,<eos> - Mister...?<eos> - Still.<eos> William Still.<eos> I've heard of you.
Pearly Mae, it's time for our evening prayers.<eos> Is that for me, Sam? (chuckles)<eos> When it's finished.<eos> Wait till T.R. sees it.<eos> Listen now, this ain't for playin' with in no big house.<eos> It stays here or you can't have it, you hear me?<eos> Hand-carved like that.<eos> Better than any of them toys T.R. has.<eos> Mama sent some dinner. Mm-hmm.<eos> Scraps off of massa's table. It might be good enough for you, but I ain't no dog.
It's a bit, um... oppressive.<eos> Is your husband a planter like his brother?<eos> No, no.<eos> John operates a law practice in the city.<eos> He's also quite the activist.<eos> - Oh, that's wonderful.<eos> - For what cause?<eos> Rights for niggers.<eos> I try not to talk politics at social occasions.<eos> That's amusing, because I feel like all you Northerners do is talk.
Okay, not a word about anything.<eos> Final decision.<eos> Five minutes ago she was in the circle of trust.<eos> - _ - What just happened?<eos> Caitlin's gonna have enough cultural shock coming home without having to hear that her mother has a completely new identity.<eos> And definitely don't mention Josh.<eos> I don't even know what's going on with you two.
Ann Taylor Loft?<eos> Hardly.<eos> This is Alexander McQueen.<eos> Not the turtleneck. Not the boots.<eos> "Millennial" is perfect for this, Jade, okay, both from a strategic and editorial standpoint.<eos> No one is better capable of integrating your already established online presence with our youth-based branding and social media expertise.<eos> Yes, we'd really love to discuss some marketing strategies...<eos> I'm sorry, but "marketing strategies" sounds like something a sad dad would have on his Linkedln page.<eos> Okay, just, like, talk to me, all right?<eos> Why you?
- Cheers.<eos> - Cheers, all right.<eos> So then I discovered this guy had fallen asleep on the couch pants around his ankles, a tissue box next to him, and a porno blasting on the computer.<eos> Hey, babe, that's what you get for asking for a key.<eos> You got caught wet-handed!<eos> I love this song!<eos> Let's dance!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> You two go.
Okay, what's going on?<eos> This... this is me apologizing, okay?<eos> I'm sorry I disrespected you.<eos> I was immature.<eos> Yeah, and selfish in bed.<eos> No, wait, wait, wait!<eos> When were we ever in a bed?<eos> Okay, whatever.<eos> You know what?<eos> If you think this lame-ass apology is gonna get me to sign with you guys, then you're wrong.
You have to experience this raw.<eos> No hemp-colored glasses.<eos> Hemp-colored glasses?<eos> - You made it.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Nice to see you again.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> Nice to see you too.<eos> - This is for you.
Liza was just telling us she had something she wanted to say.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Uh...<eos> We... we were just talking, - and, um...<eos> - And what?<eos> Just how this engagement might seem...<eos> I mean, are you sure?<eos> With Millennial just starting to take off?<eos> I mean what's the rush?<eos> Is this what you guys all think?
What's up?<eos> So, uh, I know we're all here to "cheers" the happy couple, but, um, I got to raise the glass to my boy.<eos> Thaddeus!<eos> Onyx Capital forever!<eos> - [cheering and light applause] - I love you.<eos> - I love you, Thaddy.<eos> - Thank you, thank you, Tim.<eos> - Dude, come on. - Yeah.<eos> - All right. - Yeah.<eos> One last thing, you guys.
- [Donald laughs] Why don't we play the back nine at, uh, $300 a hole?<eos> - Oh, shit, by all means.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes. - Please, let's do.<eos> - Listen, if you want to keep contributing to my retirement fund, your money's still green.<eos> - What the...?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> You trying... you trying to hustle us, Marty?<eos> A good shot.<eos> All right, now, which one of you ass-clowns wants to be the mystical caddy in my Bagger Vance?
How's the view up Nesbitt's ass?<eos> Gentlemen, if you'll permit me... a word before we begin.<eos> This is a night for celebration.<eos> A night to discuss the future of our family... the gratitude we feel for the support of his father.<eos> But perhaps as important... it is also... a moment for sober reflection.<eos> Sober, my ass.<eos> Two hundred years ago, our people were little more than dirt farmers, struggling just to survive.<eos> They had nothing but their hopes and their fists, and they brought both of them along when they came to America, many to this very city.<eos> Think you've had enough, George.<eos> Now some of you are young... so there's no reason you'd remember, but there was a time when the Irish owned Hell's Kitchen.
Nurse actually cried when I told her that part, by the way.<eos> It's a nice story, doll.<eos> You gotta run home now.<eos> You ain't got the balls for what's coming.<eos> Slide into bed, sweetheart, and settle in.<eos> Because I am the best chance you've got in the world right now.<eos> You got your break-action singles, your side-by-side, your over-unders, and the classic pump-action.<eos> All guaranteed to supersede every other on the market.<eos> None of these is semis.<eos> Aw, what do you need semis for, couple bad-asses like you?
And you are being lovely.<eos> You guys are so sweet together.<eos> That's because we're still on our honeymoon.<eos> 35 wonderful years of marriage.<eos> Feels like two to me.<eos> Oh. NANCY:<eos> Feels like one. FLIP: Like we just met.<eos> CECE: Nick,whatarewedoinghere?<eos> (laughter)<eos> (both clear throats) Each-each of you know me.
What?<eos> Whoa, what?<eos> You changed, man.<eos> That is some Jeffrey Tambor stuff, dude.<eos> Javier, wait.<eos> I-It's...<eos> Look, I wouldn't get... Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You just fired Javier?<eos> You are out of control, Miller.<eos> I'm not gonna take it anymore, and you guys shouldn't, either.
If you're giving it for that idea, if it's about that idea, then I deserve one.<eos> But I don't want one.<eos> And I felt left out. (clamoring continues)<eos> Shut up!<eos> Well, I wonder what's taking them.<eos> Probably just the traff.<eos> You know, the old 'ic. (both laugh)<eos> "The old 'ic."<eos> Anyway, I was thinking, um, is there anything you guys like to do that Fred doesn't like to do?<eos> 'Cause I-I kind of... I kind of just want to hang out with you guys and not Fred.
ALY:<eos> Man, he's dumb!<eos> Give us more hands.<eos> Do it more animated.<eos> But less alive.<eos> That's pretty good. ALY: Keep all of that, but pretend you're underwater.<eos> Deeper.<eos> Deeper.<eos> Okay, Jess, uh, what's going on here? Spill it.<eos> Well... (groans) it's just, you guys are so amazing.
Give us more hands.<eos> Do it more animated.<eos> But less alive.<eos> That's pretty good. ALY: Keep all of that, but pretend you're underwater.<eos> Deeper.<eos> Deeper.<eos> Okay, Jess, uh, what's going on here? Spill it.<eos> Well... (groans) it's just, you guys are so amazing.<eos> And it's really rough out there, and it's nice to be around something so great.<eos> And I-I'm not really a love match with your son, but I think I might be in love with you guys.
Morning, Samuel.<eos> You and your dickless associate proposing to engage me in a gun battle?<eos> Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight, but the way I heard it, you only like to tussle with working women.<eos> Get down!<eos> Is he dead?<eos> Dead enough.<eos> Why are we going to handcuff a dead man?<eos> Don't want someone walking off with him.<eos> That's not a man anymore. That's merchandise. $500 worth.<eos> All right, which of you derelicts hitched a dead body outside my saloon?
Okay.<eos> Oh, my fucking God!<eos> - Here.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Take this and go.<eos> Now!<eos> Go! I'll hold them off as long as I can.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, damn it.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.
- No.<eos> My team will take over the investigation now. Your team?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Look, this guy couldn't debug a balled-up napkin.<eos> If... if you would like us to figure out what went wrong here, we need to be allowed to access it.<eos> No more second chances.<eos> QA will handle events like this from now on.<eos> Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?<eos> We've all got plenty of work on our plates.<eos> If you guys want to take this one, fine.
If you need more time, I'm sure the board would be happy to oblige.<eos> I'm sure they'd be happier for me to delay it indefinitely.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You imagine I have gone mad... do you?<eos> Lost my way?<eos> We're simply concerned about the extent of the changes you're making.<eos> We want to protect your legacy.<eos> My legacy?<eos> You don't like this place very much, do you?<eos> I've seen many of you come and go over the years, and I can tell the ones who enjoy their time here and the ones who don't.
I haven't, as you well know.<eos> I have always seen things very clearly.<eos> This is the table I sat at with my parents.<eos> This is the chair I sat in.<eos> We know everything about our guests, don't we?<eos> As we know everything about our employees.<eos> I do hope you will be careful with Bernard.<eos> He has a sensitive disposition.<eos> I beg your pardon, señorita.<eos> There have been many of you over the years, and we have always... almost always found a way to make it work.
I've got a ham sandwich and a nubile redhead loaded up in the VR tank, awaiting instruction.<eos> Yes!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Looks like a couple of gallons of Lawrence swirling around in you did you good.<eos> Ready to get back on the road?<eos> Merciful thing would be to put a bullet in me.<eos> Who ever said I was merciful?<eos> And it's not my fault you're suffering.<eos> You used to be beautiful.<eos> When this place started, I opened one of you up once.
And then they changed you.<eos> Made you this sad, real mess.<eos> Flesh and bone, just like us.<eos> They said it would improve the park experience.<eos> But you know why they really did it?<eos> It was cheaper.<eos> Your humanity is cost-effective.<eos> So is your suffering.<eos> Whatever it is you want from me, mister...<eos> I ain't gonna be worth a damn to you like this.
We'll take the nitro and go.<eos> All right.<eos> Showtime.<eos> Howdy.<eos> My associates and I are here to relieve you of your ride.<eos> Someone's been telling you boys tales.<eos> Nothing in this wagon worth taking.<eos> The story I heard is one bullet from us, and that nothing blows you all to kingdom come.<eos> Well, then you understand why we cannot surrender it.<eos> We're sworn to protect the people of this young republic from reckless half-wits like you.
Don't worry, it ain't nitro.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Girls are a little worn out, but I can rouse one.<eos> - You boys want some company?<eos> - No, just whiskey.<eos> Lawrence's donation must be running low.<eos> But we're short on time.<eos> You need to buck up, Teddy.<eos> I told you no company.<eos> Thought I might join you anyway, as I never like to drink alone.
I'm not going to do anything to you.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Pedro.<eos> Pedro...<eos> Mine is Felipe, Pedro.<eos> I'm sure you have more.<eos> More what?<eos> What do you think?<eos> More names.<eos> You little gentlemen are always given lots of names.
Before we begin, I'd like you to listen to this young priest.<eos> Many of you know him, Father Pedro Poveda,<eos> And he'd like to talk to you about a highly important topic.<eos> Father Pedro.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Thank you very much for allowing me to speak to you here today.<eos> As Father Manjo' n Who founded the Ave Maria schools, says:<eos> "We do not have the right to anything, except to ask.<eos> And we only ask for whatever you can spare."<eos> It hardly matters to you, but for the cave- dwellers, it means so much.
Ready!<eos> Who ever thought we'd see a school here?<eos> Well, there it is.<eos> I might write something about the caves and Poveda in my column in El Accitano.<eos> You'll see.<eos> What can you tell me about Father Poveda?<eos> That he is a good man.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - They're lovely, Father.<eos> They are for you, so that you can make clothes for your children and for anyone else who needs them.

If you set one foot outside this house, don't you dare come back!<eos> Never, you hear me!<eos> Never!<eos> You are all very welcome.<eos> Jaen is to be congratulated.<eos> In this year 1913 this academy is opened, and extraordinary teachers will come from this frst group.<eos> So Jaen will have to get used to it!<eos> Marina, right?<eos> - That's me.<eos> In addition to studying, each of you will have a job.
We have so much work at the academy, father.<eos> And the girls need us to be with them.<eos> They sometimes have problems.<eos> - Like a family.<eos> Speaking of family...<eos> When are you and Manolo going to get married?<eos> Well...<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> I know the country's future is uncertain, but what does that matter?<eos> It's a good time for you both.
Being a priest he decides to let the lay people take the limelight, something even his own people frown on.<eos> And what's more, women.<eos> And add to that the success he has with the university residence he has established here, in Madrid.<eos> You understand that we must act immediately, my friend.<eos> I agree.<eos> We mustn't stop at controlling and blocking religious congregations.<eos> We must block the way for lay Catholics, whether they are men or women.<eos> We therefore ask that the confederations of Catholic students be included.<eos> Are we not part of Spanish university life?<eos> You are controlled by priests!

It is about the twelve academies, the university residence, and the Catholic Women's Institute.<eos> Avila, Barcelona, Burgos, Cordoba,<eos> Jaen, Linares...<eos> Three hundred teachers, classes for working girls...<eos> Thirteen years of work, struggle, of excitement and hope.<eos> Good times<eos> And not so good times.<eos> All in all, memories that deserve to be documented.<eos> Who could have imagined it?<eos> And you, how are you getting on in the Catholic Education Congress?
He dragged the bodies over there, then he lined them up.<eos> Wait.<eos> He lined the bodies up?<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> None of it makes any sense.<eos> Oh.<eos> You can see the prison from over here, where he worked.<eos> Who's the judge?<eos> Van zyl, the hanging judge.<eos> The two of you should get on like chalk and cheese.
The hosts are the ones who are free.<eos> Free here under my control.<eos> But he's not under your control.<eos> He brought me here to show me this. No.<eos> He brought you here because I asked him to.<eos> He's been very loyal for many years.<eos> Your time running this place like your insane little kingdom is over.<eos> You've been playing God for long enough.<eos> I simply wanted to tell my stories.<eos> It was you people who wanted to play God with your little undertaking.
Last year, we sold our crops by the ton, literally.<eos> And edibles on top of that.<eos> The world is changing.<eos> Humanity is changing. And like any people's revolution, it takes time to change people's minds. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Their hearts.<eos> Their lives.<eos> Their reality.<eos> Come see my babies. Come here! Come here!<eos> Yeah. Hello, bags of money.<eos> So you guys will be good getting all your fees in cash?
But we're growing, we're steady.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> My eyes feel like I just got them today.<eos> Oh, my God, could you please...<eos> Doug, grab her. Oh, Marty, I need a break!<eos> Just grab her.<eos> Listen, I know that you guys are growing, okay?<eos> But I'm talking about $100 million dollars, minimum, here.<eos> And you can be hands-on with the expansion as all the state and federal bullshit gets worked out and you'll have the biggest voice behind you to push through Congress, okay?<eos> Big Tobacco has the infrastructure, you guys have the street cred and the culture.
- Uh, but, you know, it's a matter of time, it is, till we got cars, uh... airplanes...<eos> Hey.<eos> Riddle me this.<eos> How does hemp hold up against,<eos> - say, straw?<eos> - What's he doing?<eos> Did Joan of Arc wear hemp?<eos> Because that would be insane if it were a helmet. Oh, I've always wanted to know that.<eos> No, I get it.<eos> You guys, you bring me out here, you get me to talk about the mother plant while this fuck
'Cause if we make the product...<eos> - I smoke to get high.<eos> - Marty.<eos> - We're done with this. - Marty.<eos> We're moving on to a multibillion-dollar deal that makes your herbal tonics look like rat shit.<eos> - Okay, you know what, fuck these death-squad fascists.<eos> We're out of here, all right?<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hold it, hold up, wait a minute, wait a minute.<eos> I'm sorry, let me get this straight, because I don't think I'm quite believe I'm hearing what I think it is I'm hearing, which is that you guys don't think that you need each other.
Guys, in every state, state after state, day after day, legal weed is spreading through the states.<eos> Spreading, spread-spread-spread-spread.<eos> And in those states, even on the sidewalks in those states, they are banning cigarettes.<eos> And those... those, um... those, um... young cherubic kids that you guys try and brainwash with your sexy ads and your fucking... your health denials, they are hip to your shit, baby.<eos> Hip to your shit.<eos> That market share is going bye-bye, okay? But, no, that's cool.<eos> You just hang in there with your Blockbuster card and get in line and rent your VHS tapes.<eos> "Uh, excuse me, uh, might you have, uh, the behind-the-scenes edition of Blade Runner?"<eos> Fucking idiots.<eos> No, no, no, you-you... uh, I meant you also are fucking idiots, okay?
- I e-mailed it to you yesterday.<eos> - Well, I haven't gotten it. 'Cause the Internet in this building is fucked.<eos> - Doug...<eos> - I-I'm on it, Marty.<eos> I've e-mailed I. T. a bunch of times, I haven't heard anything...<eos> E-mailed. Where's my head? I'll call them.<eos> In the meantime, I guess, I'll just go sit in my office in front of the computer and wait for the thing.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll be in touch. Wow, you don't see it coming again?<eos> Or you dickheads could pitch it to me right the fuck now!
Good-bye!<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> - Whoa...<eos> This is a gate change announcement for Flight 317.<eos> Hey, Clyde, you're here. - Oh...<eos> - Whoa, whoa, wait a minute!<eos> If you're here, who's running the city?<eos> All right, so I'm standing there with Seth, right? - And he's offering me this huge position in his administration.<eos> But all I could think about was I should be on that plane to Cuba.<eos> 'Cause at the end of the day, I want to be with you guys.

Richard?<eos> Well, we are now living in a post-Rigby world.<eos> Man, this place is amazing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We raised a shit ton of money.<eos> We're growing fast as balls.<eos> But we're not exactly super psyched with the quality of our engineering.<eos> Well, it's a good thing I'm here then, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All joking aside, I actually have a few thoughts on your video platform if you...
I heard a shot.<eos> Another woman dead. And nobody cares to ask why.<eos> It's about the house boy. Adam?<eos> Is he my son?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> Butter up the wife.<eos> Promise nothing.<eos> Miss Prasad? My lucky mascot!<eos> I wrote to my wife about you,
I'm not interested.<eos> Cover yourself up!<eos> - What's this?<eos> - My apologies, opened in error.<eos> Such a shame.<eos> My husband's a very important man, Mrs Coffin.<eos> These things happen.<eos> Yeah, but still, all this trouble, all this fuss, only for him not to show up.<eos> Poor old Madeleine, you see, she believed you when you told her you had some influence.<eos> I mean, now she knows you don't, so I think you'll find your new friend has considerably less time for you.
What has your brother to do with any of this?<eos> The matter is currently being investigated by the IPI.<eos> Our involvement will only confound things.<eos> If you print these allegations, the tea-picker, Lakshmi, will be detained and the newspaper shut down under the...<eos> Yes?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - The Emergency Powers Press Act.<eos> I am simply trying to protect your business.<eos> Good day, Mr Khan.<eos> Good day to you, Sooni.

Blimey!<eos> Probably for the best His Highness, the Maharajah whats-his-chops didn't make it.<eos> I can't see him approving of all this.<eos> It's all just a little bit tasteless.<eos> Now, ladies, dressed in a fanciful floral get-up, Mrs Stella Knox-Barr.<eos> I mean, I'd eat my lunch if you were involved in this tosh.<eos> Evening wear, captivating, day or night.<eos> That's it.<eos> Deep breaths.<eos> You too, Captain Turner(!
Precisely.<eos> I can't honestly think of anything worse.<eos> You come and watch?<eos> And when we go home we'll tell Matthew all about it.<eos> He'll love that.<eos> Proper match report.<eos> Yes.<eos> But, no. I have to wait in for Dr Harrison.<eos> Baapi?<eos> You two ready?
But...<eos> I heard a shot.<eos> Yes, yes, yes. Please allow me to present my wife, Madeleine. - Oh!<eos> - Your Highness. - Oh, God.<eos> Sirene, for the Lord's sake.<eos> Do excuse me.<eos> - Unusual name.<eos> - Unusual accent.<eos> - Not in Chicago. - Ah.<eos> Mind if I join you?
Sirene, for the Lord's sake.<eos> Do excuse me.<eos> - Unusual name.<eos> - Unusual accent.<eos> - Not in Chicago. - Ah.<eos> Mind if I join you?<eos> Be my guest.<eos> Miss Prasad. My lucky mascot.<eos> Charlie?<eos> Now then, Miss Prasad. I wrote to my wife about you.
It is rather romantic.<eos> They're not actually married, Daphne.<eos> But they said they were!<eos> I heard them!<eos> Oh, Daph. You're too delicious!<eos> Oh, she's looking.<eos> I'd better go over.<eos> The fair Sirene!<eos> Yes.<eos> Can it be you?
I've promised her a tour of the sights.<eos> - Do you have an itinerary tucked away somewhere?<eos> - Oh, just stay put.<eos> The whole world washes up at my door, sooner or later.<eos> - That's her, all right.<eos> - I told you!<eos> Mrs Coffin?<eos> Mr Dalal. You look quite pink.<eos> May I have a word?<eos> Do not for one minute think I am afraid of you.
But, sir, I would always recommend the Fairmount.<eos> It is a very modest-looking guest house, and yet the view of the sea is unparalleled.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> More tea, anyone?<eos> Yes. Tea.<eos> More tea.<eos> Oh, and sandwiches for my wife.<eos> Aafrin... .. you know how we all missed you when you were away as SDO?<eos> Even your sister.<eos> I missed you too, baapi.
- Com on, old love!<eos> Swing and miss.<eos> Our hero!<eos> Whelan.<eos> What a smash!<eos> Sheer fluke.<eos> Bad luck, Your Highness.<eos> Not luck.<eos> The best team won.<eos> You, too, Mr Patel. Thank you.
Just...<eos> Come on, darling.<eos> Let's get you home.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, no, no, no, no... Ah, Mrs Coffin!<eos> May I say, you don't look a day older.<eos> Look, McLeod, I don't know which part of my last letter was unclear, but your membership here has been revoked.<eos> Yes, for the entire span of your colourful life, so may I kindly suggest that you bugger off back to your countless wives and unspeakable hygiene before I call the police?<eos> But I'm not here as a member of the club.<eos> I'm here for you.
Well, as luck would have it, the boy's made a statement of his own. Which is what?<eos> You sure you're up to this, Sir?<eos> Just get on with it.<eos> According to him, you attacked the woman.<eos> No, quite right.<eos> Not attacked.<eos> You were "forcing yourself against her".<eos> - Quite right.<eos> Yes, "UP against her".<eos> So I've spoken with the District Superintendent and kindly asked him if he would hold fire for an hour or two, because, well, in the end, it's entirely up to you.
What about justice?<eos> Where's the justice?<eos> You want Miss Prasad to plead guilty to something she didn't do, me lie here in hell? In hell!<eos> And the boy walks free to carry on maiming whoever.<eos> I mean, I'm just thinking of the next poor bugger! No, I'm not standing for it.<eos> No, he has to pay!<eos> Surely you can see that?<eos> I'm thinking of your good name and nothing else.<eos> Reflect on it.<eos> And as I said before, it's entirely up to you in the end.
It goes, "Gobble-gobble-gobble"<eos> until we're all gobbled up.<eos> But I think you've gobbled up just about as much as you can chew here now, Edward.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I told the police there was no boy. It was all the woman's doing.<eos> Very good, sir.<eos> Let me know how you get on back in London.<eos> Your progress will depend on how well you manage to steer the princes round to this bill.<eos> I'll play my part.<eos> Oh, I'd do a bit more than that if I were you. ♪ Did you mean it?

And there are times, dark times, when you honestly think that they're all you've got... and then when it turns out... .. it's all... .. a lie...<eos> What am I to do?<eos> Well, you could do what I do.<eos> Keep going.<eos> You have your wife.<eos> Your family.<eos> Your friends... your real friends.<eos> You're not alone.<eos> Sometimes I find myself wondering, what was he like, my old man?<eos> Perhaps he was a bit like you?
- Time for the toast.<eos> Ralph?<eos> Pull yourself together.<eos> Do you know how often, when times were tough, I would say to myself,<eos> "What would Ralph Whelan do?"<eos> Because, whether we like it or not, you are my friend.<eos> My good friend.<eos> - Am I?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You and all your family.

Tie on or tie off?<eos> Mrs Kumar, tie on or tie off?<eos> I know, I know, it has a life of its own, I'm afraid.<eos> It has a life of its own.<eos> Mr Ian. Oh, my...<eos> She's here, she's here!<eos> She's here.<eos> Welcome.<eos> My dear Miss Sooni.<eos> Thank you.
- I see.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And may I ask what answer did you give?<eos> I told him I would think about it.<eos> Yes, caution is no bad thing.<eos> But now I find I have been promised away to some other boy. My God.<eos> What boy?<eos> He is from my own people, he has the most enormous eyebrows.<eos> How unnecessary.<eos> And I only come to you because, well, my brother is away and... I suppose you are the next best thing. The next best thing!
- Well, I'm glad we can be honest.<eos> - Now, tell me...<eos> .. what is it you want from a wife?<eos> Children... friendship... happiness at home.<eos> All good things.<eos> What else?<eos> A woman who is not afraid to challenge her husband. Oh!<eos> Then may I challenge you now?<eos> Wait, shouldn't we be getting back?<eos> You see, when I think about you and your lovely home in Delhi, I have to wonder, will it ever be enough... for me?
I am stark raving mad, Miss Dalal.<eos> I have no idea what I am saying.<eos> Don't stand there, please.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> "When, when, when will you rise to the occasion, Mr Khan?"<eos> Do you remember saying those words to me?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Well, it's a question that haunts me, and do you know, after your visit today, when you came to me in such distress, I realised if I am ever to be of merit, if I'm ever to rise above picnics or flower shows... .. it requires a little daring.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I am talking about you.
Quarry?<eos> Quarry, listen up. - Quarry!<eos> - No!<eos> No, no.<eos> You... you lured me here, okay?<eos> You lured me here so you could send your... your flunkies out to hurt her.<eos> - I'm not fuckin' stupid. - Of course not.<eos> She's fine.<eos> What sense would it make for me to harm her?<eos> Let's just say I have a vested interest in where things stand between you two.
Love you.<eos> That better?<eos> "Lamont, you clean the jelly off those glasses?"<eos> "All I know is he's the dude with the dame and you're the chump with the rump."<eos> "That's a big girl, ain't it?"<eos> "She said she lost 40 pounds." "If she look behind her, she'll find it."<eos> What they doin'?<eos> Stay away from the windows and stay in your seat.<eos> Y'all going on a trip?<eos> We're gonna send you little niggers to the moon.
I prefer not to turn my vagina into ground turkey.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> The six degenerates sitting around doing nothing.<eos> Marty, shouldn't you be cleaning drawings of boners off bathroom stalls?<eos> For your information, I already rubbed out three in the boys' room this morning.<eos> The reason I am here is because I read an article that said if you give underperforming teachers new challenges, you get big results.<eos> I immediately thought of this group.<eos> Because we get big results?<eos> No.<eos> Principal Pearson loved my idea so I will be assigning each of you new extracurricular activities.
We'll make you guys feel super involved.<eos> Not necessary.<eos> These two control freaks in charge? - Mama's not doing shiz. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I often forget that you're here.<eos> You will be teaching after-school sex ed.<eos> I don't want to teach sex ed.<eos> Ms. Bennigan, sometimes we have to do things we don't want to.<eos> I, for example, just had to have this conversation with all of you.
You don't have to be married to have a baby.<eos> My cousin Savannah got pregnant, and she doesn't even have a boyfriend.<eos> Well, some people think that you should wait.<eos> Yeah, losers and fraidycats.<eos> I'm not a fraidycat.<eos> ♪ ♪ [inhales sharply] [exhales] I'm a virgin.<eos> ♪ ♪ Is there something wrong with you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just choosing to wait for the right person, and I know that's not very attractive to some people, but it's who I am.<eos> And someday, all of you will have to make that choice too.
Do you have many friends?<eos> I have a lot of classmates.... ...from when I went to school.<eos> Do you remember the first big fire you were involved with?<eos> Yes, but it's hard to describe, if you haven't experienced it.<eos> I went with Dad.<eos> I remember that I got to switch on the siren.<eos> When we got there everybody listened to what Dad said.<eos> Why did you want to interview US?<eos> It was interesting to hear what you had to say.<eos> The youngest of you, Dag, seems very eager.
- Bet your ass, they ran.<eos> - Shit. Ran?<eos> They skipped.<eos> Laughing. She didn't scare them.<eos> - Oh, no?<eos> - They were having fun.<eos> But it still don't answer where they gone.<eos> Have you two seen 'em anywhere? - Nope.<eos> - No. Man, now I'm startin' to worry.<eos> Hey, how come you two ain't wet?
After you, jefa.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> I just heard things.<eos> You heard things.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Okay.<eos> The flowers look nice.<eos> Well, I don't know about you, but I'm starving.
It is a moral argument.<eos> And we are obliged, each of us, to--<eos> To what, dear child?<eos> I only mean to say, emancipation is upon us.<eos> The slaves will be free.<eos> Those not fighting to bring that about only slow it down, and the more misery will come of it.<eos> Wonderful, Miss Phinney.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Another noisy abolitionist.<eos> I have just the place for you.
Perhaps a pretty young houseboy to rub your feet at night?<eos> I require only minimal comforts.<eos> Oh, my eye! My eye!<eos> You've no idea what you're signing up for here, do you?<eos> Go back to Boston.<eos> I will not.<eos> Miss Dix dispatched me with precise instructions.<eos> You tell dragon Dix that I'll choose my own staff, nurses included.<eos> If I need her help, I'll ask for it.<eos> Uh, you're needed in the ballroom, sir.
I can't!<eos> He truly can't, miss.<eos> The damn thing is glued to his hand from the blood.<eos> Very well.<eos> Keep it for now.<eos> - I'm nurse Von Olnhausen.<eos> - Nurse Von Ol..<eos> Call me nurse Mary.<eos> I'm Henry Hopkins. I'm the chaplain here.<eos> God be with you, nurse Mary.
That's Emerson, you know.<eos> Well, they have their lady with a lamp in the Crimea, and we have Anne Hastings in Alexandria.<eos> She is God's gift to the boys. And I might add, to us doctors, as well.<eos> I got the impression Dr. Summers disapproves of lady volunteers.<eos> For Miss Hastings, he makes an exception.<eos> We all do.<eos> Are you from the Virginia Cavalry?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I'm looking for a Frank Stringfellow.<eos> He would have been fighting alongside you, I think.
Yes, I do.<eos> And your position?<eos> What is your position to be?<eos> I am... a nurse.<eos> Here to represent Miss Dix and, uh, coordinate... the nursing at mansion house with her guidelines and directives.<eos> You have no title, then?<eos> Heaven knows, Miss Dix loves hierarchy.<eos> I am to be the Head Nurse.<eos> The Head Nurse?<eos> But I have much to learn, so I am glad I will have you to rely upon.
A moment.<eos> That man's wound ought to have been redressed hours ago, shouldn't it?<eos> Yes, I suppose so, but it's-- there are men in there who are thirsty, who are dirty, whose beds need to be remade.<eos> I demand you get to these men, all of them, in a timely manner.<eos> And put these somewhere else.<eos> It must not be easy, having to decide who to help when.<eos> That man whose thirst you were quenching?<eos> I heard that a Union boy surrendered to his platoon, gave up his weapon.<eos> Once he was unarmed, your man shot him dead, right where he stood, pleading for his life.<eos> To you, he's a victim.
- Sir--<eos> - And you ask for us to aid you?<eos> I ask that we aid each other.<eos> You already have most everything I've spent my life building.<eos> Allow me the dignity to resolve myself to your allegiance without utterly ruining me in the meantime.<eos> We must leave now!<eos> It's a two-way street, sir, ain't it?<eos> We got bodies.<eos> My aim is to be out of this bed and home soon, but the good lord sees it a different way.<eos> I prefer to be buried at home, near to you.

On to Richmond!<eos> I knew it!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Victory, brothers!<eos> I told him that I would be right back for him.<eos> But I took too long.<eos> He never finished it.<eos> "Though my last breath...<eos> May come soon...<eos> When it does, know that I shall be thinking only of you and my eternal...
Have it your way.<eos> Your boy's got some sand.<eos> - You're not dead yet?<eos> - Only on the inside.<eos> - I'm sorry, Jack.<eos> - Cozy little reunion.<eos> Open it up.<eos> Yeah, I can't.<eos> Keygen's gone.<eos> I lost it in the fall, but a man with your resources, I'm sure you can figure a way into it in the privacy of your own home, or lair, or whatever assholes like you have.
Excuse me?<eos> Oh, do you know what my favorite mom fantasy is?<eos> What? Uh-oh. Having a quiet breakfast by myself.<eos> Oh! That is so hot!<eos> Oh! Sounds glorious.<eos> Sometimes when I'm driving all by myself, I have this fantasy that I get into a car crash.<eos> Not a big one with fire and explosions, but just like a little one.<eos> But I do get injured and I get to go to the hospital for two weeks and I sleep all day and I eat Jell-O and I watch so much TV and it's all covered by my insurance.<eos> My kids bring me balloons, and the nurses rub cream on my feet, and oh, my God, it's so amazing.<eos> Is that like something you guys fantasize about, too?
Yes!<eos> Amy!<eos> Amy!<eos> Amy! Oh, mama.<eos> I feel invigorated. This is so great!<eos> I still can't believe you won. I know!<eos> Oh, I'm so happy you guys dragged me out of the house.<eos> Oh, sweetheart, I didn't doubt you for a second.<eos> Oh, God, you know, I forgot what it was like to have real friends, like, true friends.<eos> Before you guys, my only friend was that lady on Google Maps.
Oh, it's fine. Yeah, it's just menopause, right? No.<eos> It's not menopause. And I'm sorry for acting so crazy about the whole soccer thing.<eos> I'm really trying to chill out more.<eos> I mean, it's just soccer.<eos> Right? I got you back on the soccer team.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Shut up. Shut your face!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thank you so much, Mom. Oh, I love you.<eos> Get in here. There. Oh, I love you guys so much.
- Let's go.<eos> - Good luck, boys. Good luck!<eos> Means you, too, Prewitt.<eos> Private, get this shit off here and fuck off. Let's go.<eos> Let's go, Private.<eos> Move it, come on!<eos> Ahem, all right, here's what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna round up a CAP and we're gonna check out this NVA ammo supply stronghold just outside of Banam, all right?<eos> It's a little commie shithole called Quan Thang.<eos> I'm gonna need you three guys and Collins and Pizzuti.
- Mac, can y'all sit back down?<eos> - We're gonna go.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Please?<eos> How much?<eos> Lloyd says you asked him to borrow $4,000, is that right, Mac?<eos> Honey, please?<eos> - Can you...<eos> - All right.<eos> You take this check... you cash it, and then we don't ever have to see or deal with you two ever again.
- That beautiful pool.<eos> That has to be loads of fun.<eos> My husband installed that himself, actually.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> Impressive.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My wife Viv and I, we've been in our place now 25 years.<eos> Thought about moving a couple times, but could never quite pull the trigger.<eos> You know, you could live in a lot of houses, but not all houses are homes.<eos> Still, a lovely couple like you, I'm sure y'all will find ways to fill your house full of love.
- Back to Buck Rogers.<eos> - I want to call my lawyer.<eos> - So you did do something.<eos> No, you're putting words in my mouth now.<eos> He wants to talk to his lawyer. Mmm.<eos> The phones still down?<eos> Phones are still down.<eos> So might take a while.<eos> The Knapp Commission?<eos> It's cops like you guys, right?
How forward.<eos> Is that how miss Dix instructs her nurses to behave?<eos> I hope we have not gotten off on the wrong foot.<eos> The corporal has a condition known as expressive aphemia.<eos> I'm not familiar with that.<eos> A fellow in France named Pierre Paul broca has been studying brain function.<eos> I worked with him before the war.<eos> He's had a number of patients like this man, kilner...<eos> Skull wounds followed by aphemia... Who turned out to have convolutions of the brain, requiring...<eos> Requiring you to unhand my patient.
Speak to me not in riddles, man.<eos> Leave him be.<eos> You should not have intervened in the first place.<eos> Ladies, it is my intention to bring all of our needs and goals together and give voice to the nursing staff as a group.<eos> Have you nursed before?<eos> Aside from a few screeching nephews and your dead husband?<eos> I have no claim to expertise.<eos> But I have been charged with overseeing the nursing in this hospital, and I am eager and capable to do that.<eos> Making sure that we do the best job possible together to provide the finest treatment for the boys.<eos> Yes, but why you?
Miss green?<eos> This is the nurses' meeting?<eos> Union nurses, miss.<eos> The confederate boys are patients.<eos> I'm their nurse.<eos> Please.<eos> Proceed.<eos> I intend to address a wide array of matters...<eos> Diet, letter writing, attending to the doctors as they need help.<eos> I would ask that you, miss Hastings, be charged with training us all in wound dressing as you are so clearly expert at it.
Miss green?<eos> Tom.<eos> I was wondering how your appetite was progressing.<eos> He's well, chaplain. Oh.<eos> I was under the impression...<eos> Now I am here.<eos> Tom will be my responsibility.<eos> I'm sure you have union men to care for.<eos> The lord does not recognize uniforms, miss.<eos> God be with you, tom.
He was a fine man, your father.<eos> Please, ems, hold it for me...<eos> Till I'm better.<eos> Miss?<eos> Are you Mr. Bullen?<eos> Abel melcher, the bean boiler.<eos> Miss Phinney is a new lady nurse sent from the army.<eos> She hasn't eaten since yesterday. Well, we were hop...<eos> Missed her gruel?<eos> We'll get something to you, miss, as soon as we can.

Well, we were hop...<eos> Missed her gruel?<eos> We'll get something to you, miss, as soon as we can.<eos> You are Mr. Bullen?<eos> Yes, m'lady.<eos> I wish to address both you and Mr. Melcher on a matter.
Those yellow dogs will never get to Richmond.<eos> Where's your cane?<eos> I was waiting for you to notice.<eos> See how much better my walk is?<eos> You should use a cane.<eos> Ex-excuse me, sir.<eos> This... this is Ben Cooper, my nephew.<eos> He got something he wants to say.<eos> Ever since I come up here, i-i feel like a new man.<eos> Now I got you and my uncle to thank for that.
Where...<eos> Where is it?<eos> Tom!<eos> Tom!<eos> Where is it? !<eos> You stole my father's watch, you blue devils!<eos> Where is it?<eos> ! Easy, tom!<eos> No one has taken anything from you!<eos> You lying scoundrels, all of you!
Hale, can you not see that I am under the knife?<eos> You have your way, hale.<eos> He has his.<eos> You are an efficient and pragmatic surgeon.<eos> He is of a more experimental inclination.<eos> There's room for both your methods here.<eos> What about this nursing conflagration?<eos> Miss Phinney is fine.<eos> She's... well, she's lovely, in fact.<eos> But if you allow her to have authority, miss Hastings is apt to murder her or you or me or all of us.
This has been your roost to rule until now, and I have interfered with that.<eos> That was not my intention.<eos> And if, as I suspect, your temper is because you feel your identity as a nurse is all you have in this life, well, so do I.<eos> We are the same in that way.<eos> We are women in a man's world.<eos> Let us not make enemies of each other.<eos> What a heroic maneuver today.<eos> Thank you, miss Hastings. Are you in pain?<eos> Here, allow me.<eos> You're so devoted to the men, so committed to taking care of them, but who takes care of you?
How's that brother of yours?<eos> Evan, was it?<eos> Ezra. Mm.<eos> Furloughed, or is he in it now?<eos> In it, fighting on the peninsula.<eos> Godspeed to him.<eos> Miss green, I'm sorry, I didn't...<eos> Be more observant.<eos> I will.<eos> I will be extremely observant of you in the future.
Pardon me.<eos> I have been patient, Jed.<eos> I have waited, made sacrifices, all based on our agreement.<eos> You can't betray that now.<eos> Not if this marriage is truly the partnership you have promised me.<eos> These are turbulent times, Eliza.<eos> We need to be open to change. I am not open to it!<eos> I repudiate it!<eos> Stop that now, miss Phinney.<eos> I found a place for you in one of the upstairs rooms.
Cadets! To attention!<eos> Stand guard!<eos> Clairmont, get Athos and the others now.<eos> Now, Clairmont!<eos> Move the children and old people away from here, and arm yourselves!<eos> Against such odds?<eos> I thought I'd taught you better than that, Sylvie.<eos> If the cause is just...<eos> Hold them here for as long as you can.<eos> You men, up here, come!
Drink.<eos> I only drink with gentlemen.<eos> He is trying to help you, My Lord.<eos> Remember those niggling financial worries?<eos> One week and they vanish forever.<eos> Trust, Grimaud, hmm?<eos> He may not be a gentleman, but he has a talent for making money.<eos> One week.<eos> No more.<eos> Let us hope the King proves to be as amenable as you, My Lord.
What's going on here?<eos> Where's D'Artagnan?<eos> Ah, the rescue party.<eos> You're late.<eos> The riot is over.<eos> The troublemakers have been apprehended.<eos> They've arrested D'Artagnan with the others.<eos> Get involved with filth like this and you will all face the consequences.<eos> What are they meant to have done?<eos> Is stealing the Duke of Beaufort's grain not enough for you?
It has always been a gesture of the King's good grace, but...<eos> But, of course, the King cannot let his people suffer. Treville is quite right.<eos> I myself know someone, a financier, who has contacts in the low countries and in England, Your Majesty.<eos> He may be able to help us.<eos> Very well.<eos> I will meet the costs, this once.<eos> But, Your Majesty, in the meantime, what about me?<eos> I've lost everything.<eos> Don't be tiresome, Beaufort.<eos> We will compensate you, too... within reason.
Hmm? I'm not the only one with powerful friends.<eos> Take him!<eos> Move.<eos> Enjoy your last night on earth.<eos> You all hang in the morning.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> They'll try to break us, force a confession.<eos> Whatever they do, say nothing!<eos> We cannot help you if you won't help us.<eos> Why should I trust any of you?
Then he answered. Emphatically.<eos> Destroy this and any others.<eos> Feron will try to influence Magistrate Bellavoix.<eos> Look to use anything against his prisoners.<eos> D'Artagnan is still one of them.<eos> He will be released in the morning.<eos> The refugees may or may not be guilty, Athos. But I won't have them slaughtered on Beaufort's whim.<eos> People must see there is still some justice left in this world.<eos> Tell me, Musketeer, why did you defend us?<eos> We mean nothing to you.
Go back to the gutter, Sylvie.<eos> We trusted you!<eos> - Sylvie...<eos> - Leon!<eos> I will make sure that justice is done.<eos> Do you really expect me to believe that?<eos> After everything that's happened to my friends?<eos> My own father?<eos> Take this burden upon yourself and it will never lift.<eos> Revenge yourself and a part of you dies with him.
But, my dear sir, you've got your grain.<eos> And Louis will pay you in the usual way.<eos> The King wants a gesture.<eos> He wants me to give it to the people of Paris.<eos> All of it!<eos> The Musketeers have taken everything!<eos> Feron and I will deal with them.<eos> Did that creature just speak to me?<eos> Did he have the audacity to open his mouth in my presence after everything he's put me through?<eos> If I ever see you or that thing again, you'll regret it.
Thank you.<eos> So, you mean to stay here?<eos> Well, there's no reason to leave now.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I don't do careful.<eos> You know where I am.<eos> She told me she was choosy about who she kisses.<eos> - Well, she can't be that choosy.<eos> - Quite the opposite.<eos> I hear the people of Saint-Antoine have you to thank for the return of their stolen grain.
Your uncle was a fine man.<eos> - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you.<eos> Thanks for coming, you mob.<eos> We all know Jimmy's been off the rails of late.<eos> But he was at heart a good man.<eos> Took me under his wing from a young age.<eos> Brought me up to know right from wrong.<eos> Jimmy always went out of his way for people.<eos> Hairy, human... didn't matter.<eos> For Jimmy, the Zone was his home and all of you were his family.

Here.<eos> Are you going to walk around in that?<eos> We have to get back to Djukara.<eos> There's some mattresses over there.<eos> How many Hairy brothers living in the Zone?<eos> Quite a mob.<eos> Well, shouldn't we hang out with them?<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> Lot of heat on you boys.<eos> Safer for you here.
Jimmy had a good eye.<eos> Rubbish.<eos> Jimmy wouldn't know a dot painting from a Rembrandt.<eos> Why were you at his funeral?<eos> - I was a friend.<eos> - Never mentioned you.<eos> - Maybe you weren't listening.<eos> - Go to hell.<eos> Uncle Jimmy was the closest thing I had to a father.<eos> You people thought he was a drunken old fool, but I took care of him and he opened up to me, shared things with me.
I said she's with me. Come on.<eos> Oi.<eos> Hey.<eos> Blair, get him out of here.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Out!<eos> It's not exactly magic, is it?<eos> You're a disgrace.<eos> Stupid.<eos> What do you guys call it?
Oh, really, bitch?<eos> I can...<eos> I can help get your message out there, you know?<eos> And we don't have to... we don't have to film if that's not what you want.<eos> I can help change people's minds.<eos> Please, just... just think about what you're doing. Shh.<eos> - Maliyan.<eos> - What? !<eos> Come on, you don't have to do this.<eos> You skin-mob always telling us what to do!
No, no, listen to me. He has to because I can't 'cause my phone's almost out of credit.<eos> Jesus, Jordan!<eos> Okay, that's both hands. You're good to go.<eos> (speaking native dialect)<eos> - Man: They're a bunch of savages. - Woman:<eos> You dirty animal!<eos> Guard: IDs, please.<eos> - Charlotte:<eos> Hey! - Woman: You filthy rug!<eos> Hey, which one of you used capsicum spray on an unarmed man?
We have a slight situation on our hands.<eos> Charlotte: I'm not gonna back off.<eos> McIntyre:<eos> No one is to touch a hair on her head.<eos> - Do you understand me?<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> Firing on innocent children.<eos> Macing old men.<eos> You people are a disgrace.<eos> The Zoners, they're no different from you.
- You dont't send her back?<eos> - Back?<eos> To her home, her dimension.<eos> You go in there armed and it'll be carnage.<eos> It's the idea.<eos> - 30 Millions.<eos> - And what do you want in return?<eos> Your brother.<eos> All right, fellas, nothing is gonna get in or out without us knowing.<eos> Oi, you two.

Today, we say good-bye to despair, to greed, to violence!<eos> Well... sorry about that fella, but he was a cancer that had to be removed.<eos> We need team players now.<eos> We will build here... a community that will show the rest of the world the way forward.<eos> Black, white, human, Hairy... we are one.<eos> We are united.<eos> We are family now and forever!<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> Say something!<eos> I have done this for you.

Five minutes to explain.<eos> Five minutes that can change the whole world."<eos> Do you think they'll come?<eos> Of course, they'll come.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> Do you think they're still upset with me?<eos> I will bring you home, Charlotte.<eos> I promise.<eos> Spencer, Aria, Hanna, Emily.<eos> I need you. Please.
She even stayed at my house for a weekend last Christmas.<eos> - They let her out?<eos> - It was a supervised visit.<eos> So Charlotte is all better now. What does this have to do with us?<eos> At the hearing tomorrow, the judge will decide if she should be released.<eos> And they want to hear from people who were involved.<eos> - Victim statements.<eos> - Statements of support.<eos> Statements that she isn't a threat to anybody.<eos> That you guys are not afraid of her anymore.
- Do this for me.<eos> - Pretty please?<eos> - With sugar on top?<eos> - What?<eos> That's what you say on a playground to exact a favor.<eos> We're not on the playground anymore, Alison.<eos> We haven't been for a long time.<eos> Please?<eos> I am not one of those candidates who runs for office telling you how much I hate the government and wanna take it apart.<eos> Like you, I understand that the size of the problem dictates the size of the solution needed.
We can party in every one of them.<eos> And Ali and Charlotte can sit in that big, ugly house and they can bake cookies.<eos> You'd think a place like this, they'd have... special drinks.<eos> What kind of special drinks?<eos> We're sitting in a bar, in what used to be a squirrel factory.<eos> But no, like, an Electroshock Margarita?<eos> Manic depressive Mai Tai?<eos> You guys are seriously lacking in any good taste.<eos> That's why I love you so much.<eos> I love each one of you.
Okay, thanks for...<eos> Anything?<eos> Get some rest.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> That was Alison.<eos> She's headed home tomorrow.<eos> But Elliot's going to a conference in Chicago.<eos> She shouldn't be alone.<eos> None of you should till this is over.
- I came first.<eos> - Away, man.<eos> It'll get better after a few weeks.<eos> The blisters become calluses. One is ready when they ring the bell.<eos> - We shall only be here until Christmas.<eos> - I also said that two years ago.<eos> My name's Tøger.<eos> Those are Topper and Red.<eos> If you want to survive here, then you become a ghost.<eos> If you're a ghost, no one pays any attention to you.
You can.<eos> Run.<eos> Come here.<eos> The most important thing one learns when one runs away.<eos> Nobody wants to help a Gudbjerg boy.<eos> It was my idea.<eos> My little brother has nothing to do with it.<eos> - We just wanna go home.<eos> - This is your home now.<eos> Because no other can take care of you.
Eventually they had to give her something so she passed away.<eos> They said it was the best for her.<eos> I have some cuttings for you, Elmer.<eos> - There are problems with Apollo 5.<eos> - So we're not going home?<eos> You'll be staying with me.<eos> I think we can take over the apartment.<eos> - When?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Your mother wrote that I'm to take care of you.
For the sake of you and your brother, he agrees, it's best you stay here.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask Miss Hammershøi.<eos> It was she who received his call.<eos> Come here. Stop.<eos> Come here! Come here.<eos> Come here!<eos> Come here! Down in the basement with him.<eos> - Relax!<eos> Your uncle was very upset.<eos> He loves you dearly, but he... He doesn't feel he's good enough to take care of you yet.
One of your boys have complained today.<eos> Call another time.<eos> He had clubfoot.<eos> He came with a former teacher.<eos> If you are a smart little cripple, you'll be lying still.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop, dammit.<eos> I am aware of what you're up to now.<eos> I'll see to you're is so clean and nice when they come, it will not succeed.<eos> You two clean up.
Elmer?<eos> Say you understand what I'm saying.<eos> It's important.<eos> Come, Elmer. Now we're going home.<eos> Elmer, Elmer<eos> Elmer, you hear what I'm saying?<eos> It was the last time I saw Elmer.<eos> For the first time, I understood that there would be nothing at Gudbjerg, I would miss.<eos> Well.<eos> Are there any of you who will tell something in private?
Feldman, this is really serious.<eos> If they find you mentally unstable, they can take away your teaching license. It's okay.<eos> You just have to act like a normal teacher.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> And that was how I realized Houses for Humans was corporatizing their donations.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> What does this story have to do with me?<eos> Have you talked to Bennigan?<eos> What is going on with you two? I don't know.
Big one does all the heavy lifting.<eos> Smaller one's a woman, maybe?<eos> Hey, you're hungry, right?<eos> How could you tell?<eos> Fung's? See you there.<eos> You're up early.<eos> Dude, you need to talk to Alison. Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I need to pay my tuition.<eos> I'm changing schools for you guys.
Do you want this to end?<eos> This is all for you.<eos> You say it's over, and it's over.<eos> You end it, you coward!<eos> Beth.<eos> I come in peace.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Hey, Maya.<eos> Hi, Beth.<eos> Can I just watch TV with you guys?
- Yeah.<eos> - How can you take that?<eos> It doesn't bother me. I know my value.<eos> Deposit or a withdrawal?<eos> Withdrawal.<eos> - All right, all of you... Let me see your hands! - The three of you, over here!<eos> - Get 'em up! - Hands where I can see them!<eos> Go, go!<eos> - I'm talking to you!<eos> You, too. On your feet.
And to add to your ever-growing list of things we don't know...<eos> I can't explain this, either.<eos> Fetch a chisel.<eos> That's not ice.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> Short answer is, I don't know.<eos> So is the long answer.<eos> And there's nothing else you can tell us?<eos> I'm doing my best.<eos> You field agents, always looking down your noses at us lab techs.

Just because we don't carry guns doesn't mean we're not in the SSR.<eos> We value your contributions.<eos> We're just asking...<eos> Then why not invite me when you agents grab drinks?
Hey.<eos> Keep your pants on?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You ready for a peek behind door number one?<eos> And away we go.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Shit!<eos> Can you see me?<eos> Now we talk payment.<eos> I want the fondest memory of your mother from each of you.

Please, please.<eos> Please stop. Please stop.<eos> But you boys stuck your hand in the fire tonight and it is my right to see you get burned.<eos> Why? Why?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you messed with the wrong motherfucker.<eos> No!<eos> But she took off into the woods.<eos> I don't know where she went.<eos> Oh, but you guys got away.
That's real good.<eos> There it goes.<eos> Yes. Timing's still off 'bout two degrees.<eos> Looked fine to me.<eos> What you think?<eos> I think we won.<eos> That's fine right there.<eos> Now, come on. Come on, now.<eos> Come on. Now that's a fast car you fellas got.<eos> And it's mighty fine of you to let us boys race with y'all.
Certainly.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Mrs. Loving.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> Bernard Cohen.<eos> It's a pleasure.<eos> Thank you for coming in today.<eos> So, as we discussed on the phone, the ACLU would like to take on your case.<eos> I was actually a charter member of the ACLU in Virginia, which is why they assigned me to you.
Just talk to him.<eos> Just tell him if he lets us back in the state, we won't bother anybody.<eos> Look, I do not think that this case will be resolved in Judge Bazile's court, or probably any other court in the state of Virginia.<eos> I believe this is a court battle that could go all the way to the Supreme Court.<eos> We're listening.<eos> Our problem is that in order to appeal the judgment of conviction, we would have needed to do so within 60 days.<eos> Now, given that it's been five years since that conviction, we have to find a way to get it back into the courts.<eos> - Are you following?<eos> Now, I've given this some thought, and I have a somewhat unorthodox idea on how to do this.<eos> My suggestion would be for the two of you to return to Caroline County, get re-arrested, and then we will have an avenue for our appeal.
"The fact that he separated the races "shows that he did not intend for the races to mix."<eos> I know it sounds strange, but this is really wonderful.<eos> By issuing this ruling, Judge Bazile has really given us a road map right to the Supreme Court.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm confused.<eos> He ruled against us again.<eos> That's right, but now we're allowed to appeal that ruling to the state.<eos> From there, if the state rules against you, we'll have a chance at the Supreme Court.<eos> That sounds wonderful.<eos> I have one little piece of housekeeping.<eos> LIFE magazine contacted us about sending a photographer out to you all.
You think you'll lose?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> But I think it's all right.<eos> We may lose the small battles, but win the big war.<eos> Mr. Loving.<eos> Mr. Loving.<eos> They just wanna ask you a few questions.<eos> Uh...<eos> Mrs. Loving, you rolling?<eos> Mrs. Loving, the Virginia Supreme Court just ruled against you.
Well... If we lose, then we would have to go back to Washington.<eos> And how does that make you feel having to go back to Washington?<eos> Mildred?<eos> Come here.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> I don't want those people here.<eos> I'm done with all these cameras!<eos> Well, I think it's important.<eos> These people want to help us, Richard.<eos> Well, actually, although I'm sure the publicity isn't very pleasant, if it works out for you, it will work out for a lot of other people, too.
I'm sorry?<eos> Virginia.<eos> How are they gonna defend what they done to us?<eos> I guess we won't know until the hearing, but it's likely that they'll use a defense similar to something they've used before.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's your kids.<eos> Our kids?<eos> The state of Virginia will argue that it is unfair to bring children of mixed race into the world.<eos> They believe the children are bastards.<eos> Now, as the defendants in this trial, you are allowed to come and hear the arguments.
Yeah.<eos> You can tell the judge...<eos> Tell the judge I love my wife.<eos> You okay to park?<eos> Thanks, Martha.<eos> Number 395.<eos> Richard Perry Loving et al, Appellants, v. Virginia.<eos> Mr. Hirschkop.<eos> Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the court?<eos> You have before you today what we consider the most odious of the segregation laws and the slavery laws, and our view of this law, and we hope to clearly show,
-Hey! You're just in time. -ABIGAIL:<eos> Hey.<eos> -Did you guys hear the...<eos> -I can't, what's that?<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> -You gotta speak up because the blender's... -(TURNS OFF BLENDER)<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> There was...<eos> Listen, if you're looking for Wojciech, he went on one of his long walks.<eos> Did you guys hear that knocking?
Is this what we're doing?<eos> We should play a movie game, right?<eos> Yes! Let's do a movie game.<eos> I'm so bad at party games.<eos> Oh, no, it's not like a party game.<eos> It's like, a get-to-know friendly game.<eos> And it's super fast. I can teach you.<eos> - I'm gonna go have a drink.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You guys can wrangle everyone, 'cause I don't know everyone's names.
Actually, he got the boys to eat brussel sprouts.<eos> Wow!<eos> Impressive.<eos> Well, the way to a mom's heart is definitely through her kid's vegetable consumption.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Tony?<eos> Right.<eos> I have no idea what he has planned.<eos> But I'm sure whatever it is, it'll be delicious.<eos> Go eat, you two!
Go home.<eos> - Please... just leave me alone.<eos> - We just want to help.<eos> - How are you gonna help me?<eos> Son, listen to me.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> - When your mother had...<eos> - It's not the same thing.<eos> Just... Stop trying to handle me.<eos> I'll be conducting interviews with the employees in the conference room, if that's all right with you.
Come... hey, stop.<eos> Wait. Just...<eos> I got two words out.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Is that it?<eos> Is it over?<eos> I guess so.<eos> You are not a good minister, honey. - Oh!<eos> - Get control of your ceremony.<eos> I'm gonna say a little prayer for both of you, because, you know...
She's just -- she doesn't -- she's your counselor. She just wants you to start thinking about places like that, or Michigan...<eos> Yale UCLA, wherever.<eos> She -- she just wants to make sure you take applying seriously.<eos> I'm being real. They are the ones not being real.<eos> Do you think you can't get in?<eos> You should go where you want.<eos> How's Evy doing?<eos> Okay. You want to invite her over Sunday night?<eos> No.<eos> Is everything okay with you two?
So, what happened out there?<eos> Uh, we were headed out to dinner, and some nut in a pickup truck just flew by us like 100 miles per hour, and... and we swerved.<eos> Kenny, I'm gonna need a lac tray set up with 4-0 Prolene.<eos> Yep, got it.<eos> Let's get you fixed up, and I promise we'll let you know - everything that's going on with her.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> Toph, careful!<eos> You should let us get her down!<eos> It's not safe for you with all this dry lightning!
But a weapon powerful enough to take down a god?<eos> It's a tall order.<eos> And we have just the thing, but the Box is no use without Pandora.<eos> The Hidden One disappeared with her to parts unknown.<eos> And these... chirosiphones have proven most useful against all manner of creatures.<eos> Shouldn't take long to whip up some Greek Fire.<eos> If you have a moment.<eos> I'll, um... make the arrangements for Joe.<eos> I owe it to his father.<eos> And you girls have bigger fish to fry.
Rookies always bring up Quantico.<eos> Uh, do you need something else?<eos> Let me know if you need PDF backups of those.<eos> Will do.<eos> He is right, though.<eos> This Birch thing's a dunker.<eos> Dominique all day.<eos> Wilkins!<eos> So, tomorrow morning, when the arrest warrant is issued, along with a search warrant, we meet near Birch's farm, all right?<eos> You guys take him, we take his records.
- Yes<eos> - I know the two of you all too well<eos> OK. Anything else?<eos> No, I guess I just wanted to hear your voice after all these years<eos> Yes, it's good to hear from you too<eos> - Listen, I have to go<eos> - Remember... - ...it's all about co-operation Andri<eos> - I know. All right, then<eos> This really will be the world's port as your mayor so elegantly named your new port earlier tonight<eos> I'm really glad to be able to tell all of you gathered here tonight that our Chinese friends are ready to negotiate options on any property...
My fellow Americans,<eos> I stand before you this morning in barefaced awe of the majesty of our democratic system.
Lucious!<eos> Lucious!<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> All right. Okay, okay.<eos> Everybody, settle down.<eos> Let me explain what's happening here.<eos> What we have is two great men fighting over Empire.<eos> They both love this company so much that they would kill for it.<eos> And I mean that figuratively, of course.<eos> But what it means is that they will kill it for you.
That's-that's right.<eos> You see, Empire is a family brand.<eos> And together, we're taking that brand into the future.<eos> Together, we've faced many obstacles, and overcome many challenges, that's made us stronger than ever.<eos> Yes.<eos> Where are your sons tonight?<eos> This doesn't really seem like much of a family.<eos> Uh, you want to hear about family?<eos> Well, I will tell you about family.<eos> Ladies and gentleman, I have an amazing announcement for you tonight.
♪ Open up your eyes ♪<eos> ♪ Can't you see that I'm good enough ♪<eos> ♪ To see that I could be worth your love ♪<eos> ♪ I just want you to look at me ♪<eos> ♪ To see that I can be, yeah, so good ♪<eos> ♪ Good enou-no-no-nough ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, good enough ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, no. ♪<eos> Fantastic Negrito.<eos> Congratulations, you two.
Congratulations, you two.<eos> We just heard you've raised a record amount of money tonight for NABD.<eos> And, Cookie, that vision you laid out of the Lyon family presenting and performing at the ASAs...<eos> Oh, genius. Thank you.<eos> It's just what we need to reposition Empire and get Wall Street re-excited about the company.<eos> - Yes. - Well, that's exactly why we did it.<eos> You know, Lucious, the board had been looking at an outside candidate for CEO, but we're now unanimous in our thinking that it should be...<eos> Well, before you go any further, I just want to say, without the help of Cookie Lyon, my number one, this would not have been possible.<eos> That's just what we were getting to.<eos> Considering the fact the two of you co-founded Empire and now continue to work together so well, the board would like you to come on as co-CEOs.

Well, you're right.<eos> You can't escape it.<eos> It's in him, it's in most of his cousins, it's bound to be in you three.<eos> Or at least one of you.
I'm out of here, L.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no. Come on.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> Come with us into the other room.<eos> Feds is still sniffing around, and we have to make sure Shyne behaves.<eos> It's precautionary, mostly.<eos> Mad 'cause they got a bag full of nothing, just a lame-ass task force who came up empty on something I didn't do.<eos> Free Lucious. Hell of a concert.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Now, uh, you guys know how the Feds work, or else you wouldn't have stayed clear of them all these years.
I believe you've done quite enough, Mr. Reese.<eos> Okay, then, I'll head back out for Root.<eos> John.<eos> It's too risky now.<eos> Given our recent clashes with operatives throughout the city, we have no idea whether our cover identities still hold.<eos> You know we don't leave our comrades behind.<eos> The numbers won't wait.<eos> Good luck, Harold.<eos> It's just you and me now.<eos> Though I seem to have a unique talent for alienating the people I employ, I'm not prepared to lose either of you just yet.
_<eos> Your new identity is ready.<eos> You must need this badly to risk barging into my establishment.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll be sure to knock next time.<eos> Those men chasing you, they had no badges or credentials, and we couldn't crack the encryption on their phones.<eos> They're black ops.<eos> They don't exist.<eos> Ah, you can't be too careful these days.<eos> Like I said, they're after me, not you.
Like I said, they're after me, not you.<eos> Just give me the docs, and I'll be on my way.<eos> I figure whoever is running those black ops must have considerable resources.<eos> And before I broke their last phone, it rang.<eos> There was a message and an offer.<eos> And since you have already compromised my place of business, I thought I might take the better deal.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do, but you don't.<eos> Thanks for taking the call.<eos> Nice doing business with you.
Aren't you suspended?<eos> Kabul.<eos> The Foreign Minister and NORAD are going as well.<eos> -Rolf Inherad?<eos> -Yes.<eos> We have our own guards, but the Minister has asked Ekeberg for help.<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Kabul might not be the last stop.<eos> -We'll know more after the briefing.<eos> Is Adella joining you?
-That's uncalled for.<eos> -Is she going?<eos> -Probably.<eos> They need an interpreter.<eos> -When are you leaving?<eos> -Pretty soon.<eos> -We need to eat at the airport.<eos> -That sushi is so fucking good.<eos> -Can I give you a hug?<eos> -Is the Minister going with you?
And a special thanks to Johansen, who was hit.<eos> It was spectacularly well done.<eos> How's the arm?<eos> -It's good, thanks for asking.<eos> -Johansen, Hanefi, Bakkeli.<eos> Take the pizza and wait outside.<eos> Riiser, you'll stay.<eos> The Ministry has sent us to war, but are turning their backs on us.<eos> I'll be blunt: Are you with us or against us?<eos> -With you.
With the precinct cameras we can run a real surveillance test.<eos> No more tests.<eos> It's been almost two months. People are dying without us.<eos> Hey, partner.<eos> I guess glasses ain't got the magic intel, huh?<eos> That mean you're finally gonna have to be a real detective?<eos> Even one error in the Machine's code could have unimaginable consequences.<eos> Just turn the damn thing on.<eos> The sky's not gonna fall.<eos> Actually, the sky does fall a lot around you lunatics.
You're going to have to hold on a bit longer. Good news, this number's legit.<eos> Bad news, I'm the victim.<eos> Finch, that last number, yeah, they don't make hitwomen like her in Oklahoma.<eos> She has special forces training. She's the real thing.<eos> No military record, but an entire false digital life.<eos> Her fake credentials are excellent.<eos> She's got good tech backing her up.<eos> She could be a Samaritan operative.<eos> She found me at the precinct. She knows my cover ID.<eos> If I go back to the subway, I might be leading the enemy right to you.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system... secret system...<eos> A system you asked for to keep you safe.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> You granted it the power to see everything... to index, order, and control the lives of ordinary people.<eos> The government considers these people irrelevant.<eos> We don't.<eos> But to it, you are all irrelevant, victim or perpetrator, if you stand in its way.<eos> We'll find you.
Sir?<eos> You enlisted in '93.<eos> Rose from infantry to rangers to special forces.<eos> In '05, you joined the agency and trained at the Farm, scored in the top 10% of your class, and displayed particular... creativity in hand-to-hand combat and evasive driving exercises.<eos> All of which led to you being selected to serve in the Agency's Special Activities division, along with Mark Snow and Kara here.<eos> And to answer your question,<eos> I know all this because I'm the one who selected you.<eos> Well... thank you, sir.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> I just thought you should know why I requested the two of you.
Dina and Bill.<eos> Slow down!<eos> Guess some people just can't handle their grog.<eos> - What's shakin', Finch?<eos> - Mr. Reese.<eos> How was your lunch with Dr. Campbell and her parents?<eos> It was a bit rocky at first.<eos> By the end, I think I was growing on them.<eos> An experience I can personally relate to.<eos> So things are going well between the two of you?

It's a Glock 22.<eos> Want to grab some lunch, Garvin?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I promised the old lady we'd go to sushi.<eos> And your question was?<eos> Actually, I need to take this call.<eos> Listen, babe, I got to cancel sushi. I'm getting sucked back into overtime.<eos> Garvin just lied to his girlfriend.<eos> I wonder who else he's lying to.<eos> All right, you guys are up next.

You're speaking for it.<eos> That's right, Sameen.<eos> And the field trip was your idea? Of course.<eos> And you want me to join your team.<eos> There is no other way.<eos> There's a Great Filter, Sameen.<eos> A bottleneck.<eos> Some scientists claim humanity has moved beyond it.<eos> But I am here to tell you that is not the case.<eos> It is in front of you.

No.<eos> Sameen, stop resisting!<eos> Hold still!<eos> Sunny skies for all of next week as the fall weather rolls in and temperatures start dropping.<eos> So his producer quits out of nowhere, and then his engineer quits.<eos> Max refused to cancel his show for tonight, so luckily HR had your résumé on file, and you seem like you might be as much of a kook as he is.<eos> No offense.<eos> None taken.<eos> You're listening to Mysterious Transmissions, where we don't like the taste of the lies they feed us.<eos> We have a super-sized show tonight. From sundown to sunup I will be here with you talking conspiracies, paranormal, the strange things lying just beyond our understanding.

- AM 520.<eos> Thanks, Finch.<eos> LISTENING LIVE:<eos> MYSTERIOUS TRANSMISSIONS<eos> But it was your grandmother's spirit the whole time? Oh, yeah.<eos> I just smile whenever I hear that glass shatter.<eos> It just goes to show if we stop ignoring what is right in front of our faces, we might find the peace we're looking for.<eos> Thank you for your story, Greta.<eos> Remember, everyone, just because people tell you to shut up doesn't mean you have to listen.<eos> The things you believe, the patterns you see, they're coming from somewhere, and if you need help making sense of it, I'm here for you.

So you want to know about The Voice?<eos> I suppose I am in your debt.<eos> You and John are the reason I'm still alive.<eos> I've had a few run-ins with his operations over the years.<eos> The man's a ghost.<eos> Even ghosts have a trail.<eos> I may know of someone who's been contracted by The Voice in the past, but it'll come at a price.<eos> I'm afraid we're not in a position to pay you.<eos> I don't want money.<eos> I want to go with you.
- It's complicated, Root.<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> Please.<eos> I escaped a week ago.<eos> I couldn't come and find you because it wasn't safe.<eos> Why?<eos> When they had me, they put me through these tests, these... simulations.<eos> Simulation?<eos> Over 7,000 of them, and always with the same goal.<eos> To turn me against all of you.

- Hey, Stranger.<eos> - Just finishing up here.<eos> I'm afraid I've made a grave miscalculation.<eos> I went back to the place I took Grace on our first date.<eos> It had been ten years to the day since I bought her that first cappuccino.<eos> Samaritan isn't just watching everything we do now. It's monitoring everything we've ever done.<eos> You said this morning we were just surviving.<eos> By then my fate had been sealed.<eos> But not yours.<eos> I would hate for my mistake to mean punishment for the rest of you.
I'm afraid you're gonna need a warrant for that.<eos> Can we speak to your supervisor?<eos> Are you sure you want to do that?<eos> We'll take our chances.<eos> Of course.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Can I offer you gentlemen any water while you're waiting?<eos> Coffee maybe?<eos> We're good.<eos> Our supervisor will be right with you.
Good thing you brought the mop.<eos> Don't travel without it, boss.<eos> See, Harold?<eos> Even old boxers have a few tricks.<eos> My man William is going to take us out of the city.<eos> Elias!<eos> Get in.<eos> No sign of Finch.<eos> Yo, you the cops?<eos> Got something for you.
I chose a voice.<eos> Make sure this is completely locked down.<eos> This place... can you get me out of it?<eos> You created me.<eos> I can do anything you want me to.<eos> NYPD homicide. What happened here?<eos> Someone cut the power, opened all the cell doors.<eos> At last count, 600 prisoners escaped out the back door.<eos> National Guard being called up.<eos> You got any weapons in that thing, we're gonna need you.
I don't know, but I'm not just gonna stand here and wait for him to text us.<eos> No way, I am done helping little old ladies cross the street, Reese.<eos> No more numbers.<eos> We get Finch. We go after Samaritan. That's it.<eos> _<eos> It's HMX-1.<eos> Shaw, this is not a number.<eos> It may be a clue to get Finch back. - You don't recognize that?<eos> - Should I?<eos> They really don't teach you spec op guys anything, do they? HMX-1?
We will not show you anything you did not already know.<eos> We will reveal to you what you have lost. Your dead relatives.<eos> When coming from such a young nation like the US<eos> If you think about it, then populated the land that we are loading -of ten or even a hundred times more dead than alive.<eos> What do they say?<eos> We can talk to them.<eos> Is there anyone here who is willing to answer me?<eos> Is it a spirit?<eos> Is there a wounded spirit?<eos> And you?
I have food left.<eos> We need to be free.<eos> Sometimes it feels as if we are your servants.<eos> I hate that feeling!<eos> You're wrong.<eos> What do you expect from us?<eos> What do you want?<eos> What I want...?<eos> I want you to stay.<eos> I need you.

Is everyone blind?<eos> Are all the rumors unfounded?<eos> The shareholders demand an explanation.<eos> I will tell them that you are leaving, Monsieur Korben.<eos> -Sorry?<eos> -Ni heard.<eos> Men... You can have a look at the accounts.<eos> All expenses have been justified.<eos> It is quite normal payments.<eos> You let you be seduced by an ugly smear campaign.
No money has ever fallen into my own pocket.<eos> Every franc has gone into making the film - and you know it.<eos> The French money, maybe.<eos> But the foreign, then?<eos> I do not understand what you are referring to.<eos> Is it the English-speaking employees again, so you get actually give you.<eos> Why are you trying to justify yourself, Monsieur Korbinski?<eos> Forgive me, but how can we trust a foreigner in these times?<eos> I'm afraid that you are making a mistake.<eos> I'm just as French as you.
Have you seen Adam?<eos> Hey!<eos> I can't find Adam.<eos> I've looked everywhere.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Well, look again.<eos> Come on.<eos> Man: Adam!<eos> - Adam!<eos> The two of you were supposed to be watching him!
I don't know what to say.<eos> Except that I'm...<eos> I'm sorry for what happened to you.<eos> You're sorry for what happened to me? Yes, I am.<eos> You happened to me.<eos> Your family happened to me.<eos> Did you want me to forgive you?<eos> This city was a mob.<eos> They were after me.<eos> They were gonna get this monster no matter what, and you people lit the torches.
Gas...<eos> Come on.<eos> The guy is strange, isn't he?<eos> Is he hibernating?<eos> Or is he in a coma?<eos> Stop it!<eos> What are the two of you doing here?
That's right!<eos> Relax.<eos> Relax.<eos> That's good.<eos> I close my eyes. I see your glow.<eos> My blood boils when I feel your warmth.<eos> Nothing on earth can separate us, because we stem from the same heart.<eos> Our love dawns, our love glows.<eos> Almost accompanying the entire rock'n'roll melody.<eos> I remember the sun casting its light on you.
Her father, my brother in-law, a great man, just died.<eos> I was really lonely then.<eos> For the first time, my blindness felt like a prison.<eos> - It was cold where I slept.<eos> I rarely spoke to anyone... except for the babies, who would come and go.<eos> Believe me, that picture doesn't do him justice.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> How can his mother not want him?<eos> She's young, a college student.<eos> No, he was meant for you.
Prairie woke up screaming.<eos> She's had these night terrors ever since she was a girl.<eos> Her nose bleeds and, um... it's quite terrifying for her.<eos> Our family doctor, years ago, prescribed medication...<eos> It didn't work.<eos> - It helped a little.<eos> - Can I stop you for a moment?<eos> I'm not a pharmacologist or doctor of any kind.<eos> I'm just a listener. I'm here to... help with the transition as a victim specialist.<eos> Um... you guys are victims too.
There's only gray.<eos> There's only what a man can stand.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Which ones do you need?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> This one.<eos> And this one.<eos> Oh, sweet God! This man's wife is sick.<eos> And you two are gonna heal her.
- He's always on TV. No...<eos> - Listen, it's my fault.<eos> It's my fault you pay your wife for sex, my fault.<eos> - Now, now...<eos> - You pay your wife for sex?<eos> Listen, I'm gonna take poison.<eos> - No, you're not. - Yes!<eos> Let's go in and talk this through.<eos> We can work this out. We can work it out.<eos> Mom, Dad, I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you.
The police have been following them. Did you hear this guy?<eos> The police have been following them, they...<eos> Is something illegal going on here?<eos> That's a very good question you ask.<eos> Oh, look, girls!<eos> Are, are you Black Panthers?<eos> Girls, real Black Panthers!<eos> We are with the Constitutional Liberation Party.<eos> How exciting.<eos> Which one of you is Abbie Hoffman?
I'll take her.<eos> No, yes, I'm gonna take you.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You'll drive her?<eos> She's not gonna be here another month because she eats my sturgeon, she eats my navel oranges.<eos> She's out, I want her out.<eos> Hey, you don't have a gas line that extends out...<eos> Hey, aren't you the...<eos> You're that escaped criminal the FBI's looking for.<eos> Okay, you two, up against that wall.
I think if you like this girl, you should really try to make it work.<eos> Okay, first, mom, flowers?<eos> That's lame.<eos> Second, whose side are you on?<eos> Because what it sounds like to me is that you're on her side.<eos> I'm Switzerland.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> You're father's laughing hysterically right now.<eos> He thought my joke was funny.<eos> You guys are so weird.
There's one left.<eos> Take it.<eos> All that work, and you stole one pack?<eos> You try it then!<eos> If I was there...<eos> Forget it. You can't even climb up to the roof.<eos> Talk less!<eos> Assembly!<eos> You, over there!<eos> You, over there!
Assembly!<eos> You, over there!<eos> You, over there!<eos> Go check it out.<eos> So many Japanese!<eos> Don't worry. We're safe here.<eos> Not safe.<eos> Are they here for us?<eos> You take the pack.<eos> You three to the front.
Go check it out.<eos> So many Japanese!<eos> Don't worry. We're safe here.<eos> Not safe.<eos> Are they here for us?<eos> You take the pack.<eos> You three to the front.<eos> Let's go<eos> I'll go first.<eos> You guys follow me.
Well.<eos> Tomorrow when the train leaves Shagou Station. We hop aboard. First, find the explosives.<eos> They should be in a closed cargo hold.<eos> The Japanese will inspect the train at Zaozhuang Station.<eos> We'll hide, making our move as the train leaves!<eos> The train mustn't stop under any circumstance.<eos> We'll stop the train in the middle of the bridge.<eos> Wrap the explosives around the bridge pillars. When they explode. The bridge will collapse.<eos> You understand?<eos> But what will happen to you?
We'll stop the train in the middle of the bridge.<eos> Wrap the explosives around the bridge pillars. When they explode. The bridge will collapse.<eos> You understand?<eos> But what will happen to you?<eos> Duang!<eos> Into the air.<eos> Mission accomplished.<eos> Dad!<eos> Why're you here?<eos> I have to be with you all!
Not blown up yet?<eos> Rui!<eos> Aren't the explosives over there?<eos> We'll each take one pack and charge at them, maybe...<eos> It's useless.<eos> We won't make it past them.<eos> We were so close!<eos> Looks like our big mission is set to fail.<eos> I started this mission, so I'll see this through.<eos> You guys still have a chance to flee.
To some in this city, the name Talia Freeman elicits no reaction.<eos> Her death does not resonate with any significance.<eos> They wouldn't think to ask a professor such as myself or a man of God such as Pastor Tunde to comment on the life and circumstances of this young, vibrant, beautiful black woman.<eos> To some, Talia Freeman does not warrant a moment of consideration.<eos> Yet to others, her death is a cause for sadness.<eos> It's a source of great frustration and anger and violence.<eos> I myself have been a part of this violence.<eos> I've encouraged and provoked it.<eos> I've witnessed, up close, the fruit it bears.<eos> Which is why I've asked to speak to you all today, to share my message.
I myself have been a part of this violence.<eos> I've encouraged and provoked it.<eos> I've witnessed, up close, the fruit it bears.<eos> Which is why I've asked to speak to you all today, to share my message.<eos> The fruit is rotten.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I've come at it wrong.<eos> And upon careful consideration, I've come at it wrong again.<eos> Some may say that's human.<eos> But today I stand before you, as I've stood before many like you many times in the past to say in this city, in this community, in this church amongst friends and family of Talia Freeman
Uh, can Mack come up to the front?<eos> It's urgent.<eos> - He'll be right up.<eos> Please, take a seat.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> - Uh, water.<eos> Sparkling, please. - I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I knew you guys did house calls, but Jesus.
Drop your weapon!<eos> - Drop your weapon, Mr. Dinard.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Interlock your hands behind your head.<eos> On your knees.<eos> A couple false starts, but I knew we'd get you eventually.<eos> Call my lawyer.<eos> I know you have a vote to cast so I'll be brief.<eos> Some of you have been waiting a long time for this.
Hide the pot!<eos> Wow.<eos> I just felt so young.<eos> - Bob?<eos> - What?<eos> - They're in the playroom!<eos> - What?<eos> The playroom!<eos> They're fine.<eos> Alice, again, the key that we made for you and Dad was for emergencies.
It's the cops!<eos> Oh, thank God, you're home!<eos> - Stella?<eos> - Brace yourselves.<eos> I left Justin.<eos> I thought he was my soul mate, and now, we don't even hate the same Kardashians.<eos> We had this big fight, and he's dead to me.<eos> Is he dead to everyone, did you kill him?<eos> Answer your father!<eos> What is wrong with you guys?
What is wrong with you guys?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I could really use a pizza, but go on.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, I'm here because I'm not getting any acting jobs, and my YouTube videos don't get enough hits.<eos> And some of those comments, are so mean.<eos> This one guy wrote, "you're a waste of human skin, you hot-skank mess."<eos> I mean the "hot" was sweet.<eos> But the rest... being an adult is hard.<eos> Plus I miss you guys, so... - I was wondering...
But you and Mom always told us to follow our dreams.<eos> Yes, we did and that may have been a mistake.<eos> See, we didn't think everybody in your generation would have the same dream, to be an actress or win singing competitions.<eos> Surely you're not *** my dream of becoming an astronaut with hoping that Cher turns around on The Voice.<eos> Dad, what are you trying to tell us?<eos> Clearly they want us to leave.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - Well, - it might be time.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - I didn't know you guys didn't want us here.
Without help from other Powers, you're fucked.<eos> I call it a Drainer.<eos> It takes away their powers.<eos> You drain me, you drain yourself.<eos> Green light comes on, power goes off.<eos> It's cool that you're Diamond and shit, but it's not like you're SuperShock.<eos> Or Retro Girl.<eos> She's only, like, a goddess.<eos> My dad would lose his shit, and my mom would stand in between me and him, and she would take as many punches as she could.<eos> She pretended to be you to make herself strong.

Why did you run away?<eos> Call me.<eos> Please.<eos> So, chicken or fish?<eos> The fuck you talking about?<eos> Do you think it tastes like chicken or fish?<eos> Are you actually talking to me about pussy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just wanted an opinion from a fellow rug-muncher.<eos> What is wrong with you?
- Got this.<eos> Shit!<eos> Police!<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Damn it, Krispin!<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hey, Kutter.<eos> Whatcha been up to you?
Stop right there!<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Damn it, Krispin!<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hey, Kutter.<eos> Whatcha been up to you?<eos> Just don't.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This partner thing is new for you, isn't it?
As you can probably tell, I'm not in the best of moods.<eos> I'm what you might call grief-stricken.<eos> I understand.<eos> If anybody understands, it's me.<eos> So I'm going to ask you some questions, and, uh, you are going to answer them.<eos> We clear?<eos> - Clear.<eos> - D-day.<eos> - D-day?<eos> - Does it mean anything to you?
Always thinking fists first.<eos> Walker, Pilgrim, in my office now.<eos> Not you, Kutter.<eos> In case you haven't figured it out yet, I'm under a bit of pressure here.<eos> We are under a bit of pressure.<eos> I got Mayor Robles calling every five minutes 'cause he's got the President calling every ten.<eos> They want answers, and they want them yesterday.<eos> Meanwhile, Agents Lange and Schlag out there are gonna help me into an early grave.<eos> - Look...<eos> - So I need to know, and I need to know now, if there's anything else you haven't told me that I should know about before I suspend you indefinitely for obstruction and insubordination.
And times have changed.<eos> You have the wheel now.<eos> Fuck you, and whip that bag of shit up by tonight's broadcast.<eos> It'll be our lead.<eos> Ten seconds.<eos> ♪ Through the ages I'll remember ♪<eos> ♪ Blue eyes crying in the rain ♪<eos> Thank y'all very much.<eos> Todd Secor here every Thursday, Saturday.<eos> Is that you, Diana?
Todd Secor here every Thursday, Saturday.<eos> Is that you, Diana?<eos> Hello, Daddy.<eos> Calista, is that actually you?<eos> You used to play that song for me.<eos> Did I?<eos> Well, can't go wrong with Hank Williams.<eos> Here's a real crowd pleaser.<eos> Come on into the light.<eos> Let's have a look at you.
I was looking for something a little bit more cathartic.<eos> Ah!<eos> Fasten your seatbelt, Daddy.<eos> It's gonna be a bumpy ride.<eos> Ah!<eos> Calista!<eos> Wow.<eos> To what do I owe this honor?<eos> A father can't check in on his daughter?<eos> It's just I haven't heard a peep out of you since I moved out four weeks ago.
Well, I'm here now, so may I come in?<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> So...<eos> - I'm gonna give it to you straight.<eos> - Good, what?<eos> You need to get out of Powers Division.<eos> Thanks for dropping by.<eos> - I'm dead serious, pumpkin.<eos> - Don't call me that.<eos> I've been calling you that since...
Look, I was trying to make a statement.<eos> - I wasn't trying to...<eos> - Just calm down.<eos> Son, just calm down.<eos> Tell me where you are.<eos> I'm at the lake house.<eos> - You remember, um...<eos> - Yeah, I remember.<eos> Okay, listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna come get you, okay?
Stay inside, lock your doors.<eos> If they can kill Retro Girl, no one is safe.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Yes?<eos> I found him on the side of the road.<eos> I don't know what happened, but he's in real bad shape.<eos> I'll get an orderly.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> My father I'm angry at left long ago.<eos> And you, you're just a pitiful old man that's gonna die alone and miserable.
Pandiri!<eos> It's the pandiri!<eos> Sound the horn!<eos> I order you, sound the horn!<eos> Abrecan, leave it.<eos> The run is lost.<eos> The pandiri are coming in on the tide.<eos> If we don't act now, our chance will be lost.<eos> Why...?<eos> You there, you there, help me with the net.
Right, give him slack.<eos> Quickly, everybody!<eos> Keep going!<eos> Hold it tight!<eos> Now tighten it up!<eos> Pull!<eos> Look at this.<eos> A catch they will sing songs about.<eos> A catch you brought in.<eos> For those of you who followed and believed, I thank you.
I done seen one of the field slaves creepin' about earlier.<eos> Which one?<eos> I... couldn't tell.<eos> But I'll think on it.<eos> No matter.<eos> My husband will take care of it.<eos> This has turned out to be an eventful Sunday, now, hasn't it?<eos> Now... we can do this all day.<eos> And we will. 'Cause I'm a patient man.<eos> Any one of you could end this at any time.

Well, I've had too many.<eos> John Hawkes is agreeing with me.<eos> Well, we're both officers of the law.<eos> Marshal Risdin. You wanted a moment?<eos> Sir.<eos> Yes, Governor, I want to show you the map of our boat patrols.<eos> Let's talk in my office.<eos> This looks to be a dying effort.<eos> Your last chances are waning.<eos> And yet not one of you has said a word about my seal.
You need a distraction.<eos> You remember Boston?<eos> I wager I remember Boston far better than you do.<eos> You would win that wager.<eos> I'm much less certain it's that sort of crowd.<eos> It is always that sort of crowd.<eos> Laney.<eos> Teach us that dance.<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm sorry to call on you like this.
She's buried at the church.<eos> Just a simple stone.<eos> I know some people, they... they go in for them real fancy gravestones, you know?<eos> Mausoleums, too.<eos> I'm sure you seen 'em.<eos> I think my Peggy would've liked something' simple, you know?<eos> She, uh... she wasn't one for frivolities, you know?<eos> But still, I...<eos> I-I liked to surprise her, you know, with somethin' nice, every now and then, you know?<eos> I could pick some flowers for you, put on her grave next Sunday.
Put--put some clothes on?<eos> Why?<eos> You excited? No, I want to be out of here before the Sunshine Band wakes up.<eos> We quitting'?<eos> No, we--we got a bridge to find.<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, hey. Y'all going somewhere?<eos> Doing what we came here to do, find that bridge.<eos> Good, good.<eos> Take Chub and Paco with you.
I mean, she thinks so highly of you.<eos> Trudy's taste in men has always been questionable.<eos> Maybe I should leave, so you two can put your dicks on the table, next to them toothpicks.<eos> She's right.<eos> We're a team, and we should act like one.<eos> You don't find it, you don't find it.<eos> You go home, we keep trying, because it's a matter of dedication.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Chub, you're done eating.<eos> I'll go with you.
-How dare you!<eos> -I'm just asking.<eos> Show more respect for the Senator. Silence, you senseless rabble.<eos> The honorable Senator Neruda has the floor.<eos> I appreciate it, Mr. President of this shitty Senate.<eos> To begin with, I'd like to thank the Russian people for defeating fascism, therefore achieving world peace.<eos> Next, I'd like to thank the Communist Party, my party, for always defending the people's and workers' rights.<eos> Rights that are being violated, Senator, because union leaders, Communist Party members are being thrown into jail.<eos> And it's all being done by your President. Turncoat Gonzalez Videla, who sold his soul to the Northern Empire.<eos> It was you all who elected him.
He's not ready to come out because he promised to dress up like Lawrence of Arabia, the guerrilla soldier of the desert.<eos> And his wife I don't get her.<eos> She's an Argentinian aristocrat, educated in Paris. But she ended up coaching this railway worker's son.<eos> What do you think? How do I look?<eos> No one will recognize you.<eos> Silence, please.<eos> Silence.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Next up on our schedule: a surprise from the very owner of the house.<eos> I give you... poet Pablo Neruda.
What the...?<eos> Can you see that bush over there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is it a man or a bush?<eos> Bush!<eos> Man!<eos> Bushman!<eos> Ah!<eos> Hello.<eos> I was hoping to run into you two.
No stage presence.<eos> And his guitar playing, mediocre at best.<eos> Come on, they're not technicians.<eos> I mean, playing ain't the focus of their vibe.<eos> No, even for them, he's mediocre.<eos> Take all of this and shove it up your sagging fuckhole.<eos> You signed the band. What did you think you were getting?<eos> Him and a couple of other guys.<eos> See, this is what happens when a label picks you up.<eos> We groom you, we work with you, we turn you into something that might actually have a life.
Blend in with the sky, right?<eos> Harder a plane is to see, the harder it is to shoot down.<eos> Are you flying over Da Nang?<eos> I can't keep up.<eos> Detroit, Boston, Ontario.<eos> And that was just last weekend.<eos> Having three albums in the top 10 is like juggling cats. But the work, right?<eos> Keeps us hungry.<eos> You're gonna bounce back.<eos> A few more years, I'll be buying a 747 off of you.
- We go, we find out.<eos> - Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.<eos> He's expensive. He's expensive. We can't afford him.<eos> We worry about that after we sign Elvis Aaron fucking Presley.<eos> I love what you just fucking said.<eos> LAX, Jeeves.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. This is Mr. Meshejian's car, fellas.<eos> Here, there's another 100 for you if you get us to LAX in 30 minutes.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Anything else I can do for you gentlemen?
Where you girls from?<eos> We live here. Over in Henderson.<eos> Nobody's from here.<eos> Where'd you grow up?<eos> And I know we're taking you all the way back to last month.<eos> - I'm from Scranton.<eos> St. Paul.<eos> Duluth, actually.<eos> Trying to be fancy.<eos> Well, then things are looking up for you.
The pigs, the FBI, the fascist gestapo government mercenaries.<eos> Oh, yes, I've read about you in the newspapers.<eos> I mean, you're all over television.<eos> I know. The fascist propaganda machine is in full swing.<eos> We have no jewels, but you can have her emerald pin.<eos> For Christ's sake.<eos> I'm exhausted. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten in two days.<eos> What I should do is, I should probably go upstairs, and I should probably change the batteries in my hearing aid.<eos> That way, I'll hear better, but in the meantime, you know, give her the emerald pin, because then she'll go.<eos> Um, I'll be right back, and you two can chat.
- This is our daughter?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Since when?<eos> - Elizabeth. Oh, this is our little girl Priscilla.<eos> So you're not alone.<eos> Our daughter doesn't count.<eos> She was a cesarean.<eos> She looks so familiar.<eos> Yes, to us too.<eos> She doesn't look like either of you.
She says the FBI framed her.<eos> The FBI doesn't frame people.<eos> I'd like to ask you a series of yes-or-no questions.<eos> Frank Lindsay. Your 9-year-old sister, Tracey Lindsay, went missing on July 10, 2008.<eos> I don't know how many times I have to tell you people.<eos> I don't know what happened to Tracey.<eos> Well, I've got 10 pieces of physical evidence here that say you do.<eos> Yeah, except for Tracey.<eos> You still haven't found her.<eos> She's out there somewhere, and you guys are here looking at me.
It's not money.<eos> It's a commitment to reach the highest levels of fulfillment.<eos> - Raina. - Hey.<eos> I thought you weren't coming.<eos> I was just leaving.<eos> See you.<eos> All right.<eos> _<eos> So, you think you discovered where we went wrong?<eos> You think you can do it better than the agents that came before you?
All these cases... the charges didn't stick because the agents slipped up on their investigation, right?<eos> Yeah, the smallest mistakes usually have the biggest consequences.<eos> When you work an airtight case, you don't even talk to the suspects.<eos> You talk to their lawyers when they plead out.<eos> Right, but things do go wrong.<eos> Only in days that end in "Y."<eos> Is that what happened in Chicago?<eos> This is about Ryan.<eos> And about you.<eos> I never got the full story from either of you.
That was my family.<eos> - That phone traceable?<eos> - Hell no.<eos> My son is terrified.<eos> Things are getting worse out there.<eos> All right.<eos> We all know what's happening outside, but that's because we have one of theirs.<eos> Our losses are going to continue, so let's make sure our efforts are not in vain.<eos> - Let's get back to work.<eos> - You guys grab the feet. I'll grab the head.
All I want is what you have in there.<eos> Is it alive?<eos> - I don't think so. - Jesus Christ, Katie.<eos> - Who else is with you?<eos> - I'm alone.<eos> I bought myself a head start, but it won't last long.<eos> They're coming for all of you, and I'm not gonna be able to stop them.<eos> Yes.<eos> Give me the RAP.<eos> The rest of you left before I got here.
Thanks.<eos> These are Sennheisers.<eos> How'd you get them?<eos> Let's just say I have a source.<eos> I can't take these, Pia.<eos> They're super expensive.<eos> Remember, this is only temporary.<eos> As soon as your new IDs are uploaded into the system, we can move you somewhere on the grid.<eos> Come.<eos> I have a space for you.
Mayday!<eos> Mayday!<eos> TU 16, hijack in progress!<eos> Request immediate assistance, Magnolia and 7th!<eos> Clock one.<eos> All units, all units, hijacking in progress...<eos> Clock two.<eos> Hey, we're getting an audience.<eos> Hey, man, let us in on this.<eos> We'll help you out, you help us out.
What's your stake in all this?<eos> In my world, there are a lot of competing theories on governance.<eos> I believe that the softer hand is more effective.<eos> No one can change our present situation, it's immovable, so instead, everyone needs to try to appreciate the good things.<eos> The city is cleaner and safer than it's ever been.<eos> There's no worry of terrorism or unemployment.<eos> You can even catch a bus and go from anywhere to anywhere in 20 minutes.<eos> Bringing back places like this is one of the ways we give everyone something to put their energy into.<eos> That's good for me.<eos> It's good for you.
Are you the yoga teacher?<eos> Oh, my God, no.<eos> I wish. Though I do teach spin in Westport.<eos> And also yoga.<eos> The itinerary said that the orientation was supposed to start like 10 minutes ago.<eos> Oh, do you think maybe we should be - someplace else?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Who here is waiting for someone to tell them what to do?<eos> You just said that.<eos> Because orientation was supposed to start 10 minutes ago... - Mm-hmm. - ...and none of you said anything.

I knew we did a number on you.<eos> What kind of number?<eos> You are incapable of loving someone who is kind to you.<eos> Your father and I were no example.<eos> I mean, sure, he's nice, but underneath all that niceness was this dirty little secret that was eating away at the core of our marriage.<eos> Some part of you must have picked up on that.<eos> I really didn't.<eos> - You didn't?<eos> - No.<eos> You guys are great.
You're ser... are you serious? Yes.<eos> So nice.<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Thank you for forcing me to eat this because I feel like my mouth is experiencing intense personal growth.<eos> So, it actually is... that's "umami," - the elusive fifth taste. - Mm.<eos> She has become so knowledgeable in so short time.<eos> You guys are the cutest.<eos> I want to watch a reality show about you called, like,
Even if I fell in love... say I fell in love, what then?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'd be in love. No.<eos> We would have two years of passion at best, and then, what, he would get Alzheimer's disease or prostate cancer and there I am draining his catheter for the rest of my life, and this is a man I don't even know.<eos> So I might as well stay.<eos> All right, I know it sounds sad to you, but I like our house, and your father's very nice, and he makes me laugh when he does that Chris Rock.<eos> And he plays Scrabble really well.<eos> These things count for a lot.<eos> If I had known 20 years ago...<eos> I think you guys really did fuck me up.
You're letting him live.<eos> Word will spread.<eos> They'll know this is you.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> "Declan Harp then bound the three soldiers and began torturing them.<eos> He cut off most of their skin, removed their fingers, disemboweled them, and while they still lived, removed their genitals.<eos> Once he was finished, he executed 'em.<eos> He made off with the entire cache of pelts from the outpost as well 12 kegs of gunpowder, sixteen muskets, and two weeks worth of provisions."<eos> Impressive.<eos> That's high praise indeed, coming from you, Lord Benton.
There is another currency I can accept as you well know.<eos> There's news from the north Labrador Sea.<eos> A ship, on its way here, rounded the head of Hudson's bay a fortnight ago.<eos> Who's on board?<eos> A senior HBC company man.<eos> Very important.<eos> I'll find out tomorrow, you have my word.<eos> In the meantime...<eos> I require... I require many things.<eos> I require brandy, and I require you, my dear, on your knees, with your skirts up over your head!
No one'll find out, and if you tell, boy, I'll slit your throat!<eos> What's this?<eos> What we got here, then?<eos> You dirty bugger!<eos> Been down here all this time, have ya? !<eos> Eating my biscuits? !<eos> All hands on deck!<eos> All hands on deck!<eos> Let's go! Let's go!<eos> Someone among you has taken something that belongs to me.
Hard to set a trap there?<eos> I need you to travel north with me up to James Bay. There's someone you should meet.<eos> You asked me to meet with you so that you could ask me to meet with someone else?<eos> Well, when you put it that way it seems somehow a bit silly, but, this man is a special supplier looking for a particular type of buyer.<eos> So why didn't you bring him here?<eos> We have to go to him.<eos> I pay you to meet with these suppliers so that I don't have to.<eos> Perhaps I should find someone else who understands what I need.<eos> Well, like a wife?<eos> He will only speak with you.
Are you really a priest?<eos> The boy then ran off, disappeared into the crowd.<eos> And you witnessed the entire incident?<eos> - And he didn't kill our man?<eos> - No, it was a frontiersman.<eos> I didn't see his face.<eos> The boy's entirely innocent of the crime, that one, at least.<eos> Well, thank you for coming to us.<eos> It's my duty, Milord.<eos> Clearly the boy has value to you?
That's it.<eos> They had too much to drink and they left.<eos> What else?<eos> ! - Stop it!<eos> - You stay back or I'll fucking gut you!<eos> Where did they go?<eos> They were chased to the river by some men.<eos> Let her go!<eos> You and I don't need to be enemies, Captain Chesterfield.<eos> Friends like you I don't need.
Three soldiers.<eos> Why were you with English soldiers?<eos> I had nothing to do with those hateful pigs.<eos> Their leader threatened to kill me.<eos> I, I just want to be paid as per my contract with young Michael here and I'll be on my way.<eos> You're not going anywhere, priest.<eos> The soldiers found us wandering in the wilderness, lost.<eos> They were gonna take us back to the fort.<eos> And why were you wandering in the wilderness?<eos> I was looking for you.
In my reality, we invaded, confiscated their core, and used it to continue our mission.<eos> That happened.<eos> And Dr. Lasky was killed.<eos> Uh... What?<eos> I was killed?<eos> Shot to death during the attempt to commandeer Spearhead.<eos> Well, then...<eos> I prefer this reality.<eos> So do I, Dr. Lasky.<eos> I will need your help, all of you, to fully understand this timeline.
- You are time.<eos> Primary.<eos> I see everything.<eos> The others like me.<eos> The numbers. 607.<eos> You, her.<eos> Cassie?<eos> You want her to love you, but she doesn't.<eos> Being single is not the end of the world.<eos> You two together is, though.
The exhibition's over.<eos> Goodbye!<eos> I don't believe you, you're lying!<eos> - Refund! - Right, refund!<eos> Refund!<eos> Refund!<eos> Refund!<eos> Enough!<eos> I work damn hard running this place!<eos> You idiots wanna ruin me? That's not gonna happen!
- Take big, big sips.<eos> - Good, good, good.<eos> - Good.<eos> Here.<eos> Is that better?<eos> - Prick my finger, dear.<eos> - I don't...<eos> I don't know if she knows how to do that.<eos> I'm sorry I got diabetes, everyone.<eos> None of you know what you're doing. - Oww!
I want that on my tombstone.<eos> All yours.<eos> Hey, where's Freddy?<eos> Not coming?<eos> Yeah, he's late, as usual.<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> We should leave his ass.<eos> Rule is if a guy is flying you somewhere, he gets to show up last, step on the plane, close the door, take off, right?<eos> If you own the plane, you don't wait.<eos> That's the rules, but not for you guys. Never for you guys.
♪ Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams ♪<eos> ♪ Blinded by me, you can't see a thing... ♪<eos> Hey, Garth.<eos> What's up, brother?<eos> Hey, I'm not in the office today, but believe me, I'm all over this thing.<eos> Sounds like you at the end of the goddamn world.<eos> Listen.<eos> I got people asking why the hell you've drifted non-compliant.<eos> Well, we notified you as a courtesy.<eos> No, I was notified because of the 1.5 large that I have with you, which may not be a lot to you, but it's a mountain to my folks.
Guys!<eos> Guys!<eos> Analysts are predicting a major dive for the mid-size shipper's stock...<eos> Guys!<eos> Axe!<eos> Breakfast is on me!<eos> Epic, man.<eos> That was an all-timer.<eos> Thanks for bringing us.<eos> Having you here made the trip, man.
Let's put that on the back burner.<eos> The War Department has decided to audit this branch's cases, past and present.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> Peggy...<eos> It's an executive order.<eos> Comes straight from D.C.<eos> So, if you'll just crack open your files, we'll get to work, and I'm sure this will all be done in no time.<eos> Chief, would you mind showing my men around?<eos> Guys.<eos> After you.
Are we sure the SSR isn't an option?<eos> The council has their hands in everything.<eos> There's no one we could trust 100%.<eos> Actually... that isn't entirely true.<eos> Rose?<eos> She's someone we can trust.<eos> Peggy, this is crazy.<eos> We... we can't take Rose.<eos> She's... she's...<eos> She's passed the same training as the men upstairs, and she protects all of you.
What he's trying to say, Aloysius, is, uh, we need your equipment.<eos> Very well.<eos> Uh, y-you got any instruction manuals for these things? No.<eos> These are mostly just prototypes.<eos> Haven't been put through trials yet.<eos> Can you show us how they work? Sure.<eos> Got six hours?<eos> I was thinking more of a crash course.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I'm going with you.
I'd like to call this meeting to order.<eos> Any objections?<eos> Mr. Jones, I need unrestricted access to all Roxxon facilities.<eos> Um... yes, ma'am.<eos> I'm also gonna need you to speak to Vernon masters, bring him up to speed on this administrative overhaul.<eos> Will that be a problem?<eos> No, ma'am. Mr. Hayes, I'm gonna need your publications to fabricate a story on the sudden disappearance of my husband and those other pasty buffoons.<eos> Yes, Miss Frost.<eos> Good.<eos> I have chosen you to be a part of my Council because I believe that each of you can contribute to my plans.
Where's Ana?<eos> She's still the hospital until she regains her strength.<eos> I came to get her cashmere throw. What are you doing?<eos> We're going to get Wilkes, then we're going to get Whitney.<eos> How?<eos> You don't have to worry about it.<eos> You can go back to your wife knowing full well that I will make this right.<eos> How?<eos> Mr. Jarvis, I understand that you have a great deal invested into the outcome of this mission.<eos> Indeed. Whitney Frost shot my wife. I'm coming with you.
Those are coordinates.<eos> To Whitney Frost.<eos> Let's hurry up.<eos> Or do you need me to load your weapons, too?<eos> Why don't you stay here in case we're wrong and Vernon returns?<eos> Don't you trust me, Danny boy?<eos> I'm hurt.<eos> You don't have the best track record.<eos> Your backup is a lab tech and a butler.<eos> If I were you, I'd take all the help I could get.

And no-one will be any the wiser.<eos> And do what exactly?<eos> Drag himself back to Westminster half-paralysed, slurring his words?<eos> If he regains enough strength, Clemmy, I know he still hopes to lead the way to the end of the Cold War.<eos> What about his family?<eos> We don't want a man crippled with illness who's worked himself to death.<eos> Don't you think we deserve some time with him?<eos> - Clemmy...<eos> You've kept him propped up on pills for years, Charles.<eos> If you have any love for him, if any of you do, you would get him to stop.
- No, it's not.<eos> There is no hiding from the world who my father is.<eos> - So when did you get down?<eos> - About an hour or so ago.<eos> He seems quiet peaceful.<eos> Colville was being preposterous as always. Why?<eos> He's just doing his job.<eos> It was simpler when we were children.<eos> But the minute we had our own ideas, our own lives and we stopped worshipping him, everything changed.<eos> - He loves you, he loves all of you.
Well, we've all seen the notices of Sarah in America, drunk in the street...<eos> Be quiet, Randolph.<eos> Brings disgrace on Papa.<eos> My mistakes reflect on me, not on Papa.<eos> You really are thick.<eos> Everything we do reflects on him.<eos> Everything he does reflects on us, we are...<eos> We're moons to the big planet, we're one being.<eos> And now with him sick in there, sick and dying with him near the end... with him near the end, with him near the...<eos> I promised myself I would not cry in front of you people.
I didn't know you painted so much.<eos> My great distraction, Millie.<eos> Did you know that Turner painted better the worse his eyes got?<eos> So there's hope for you yet.<eos> They're here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Rab.<eos> - Jock.<eos> Hello, Anthony.<eos> After you.
You could be back here next week!<eos> - Do you like the slogan?<eos> - Is it one of yours?<eos> He suggested "Keep Buggering On", Lady Churchill but I toned it down when I passed it on.<eos> Rab suggests you might deliver your speech sitting on a high stool.<eos> I'm addressing the Tory party, not singing "White Christmas" in a cocktail bar!<eos> Onward!<eos> Last month, we did not have quite so big a surplus in our balance... but in fact, things were a little better than I had anticipated.<eos> Because this is the time of year when we purchase our main products on the dollar market.<eos> Tobacco, which might be of some interest to some of you.
Face them down, Winston.<eos> I can face anything with you.<eos> The Tories, Russians even death itself.<eos> Come on.<eos> Working together, achieving these new settlements for public finances, for our financial services and for fairness in Europe will help us secure...<eos> - How are you feeling? - Good, good.<eos> ...for us all.<eos> I thought I might just sum up what I feel...<eos> No-one expects a long speech, if you feel you can't get through it, just cut to the end.<eos> ...and I look forward over the coming years to working with you to make that happen.
Previously on "Agent Carter"...<eos> Whitney Frost shot my wife.<eos> I'm coming with you.
- Where? !<eos> - No!<eos> Wall safe at the SSR lab.<eos> - He was gonna shoot you.<eos> - Yes, he was.<eos> So if the situation was reversed, that's what you would've done?<eos> Let him shoot me?<eos> Two hours ago, you were using a redacted file to frame me.<eos> If I were helping them, I'd be on my way there.<eos> But I'm here with you.
We can't kill Vernon.<eos> He's an integral part of this operation.<eos> This is ludicrous.<eos> Have a little faith.<eos> My man Samberly can patch this thing right up.<eos> I'm not referring to the cannon, and I have every ounce of faith in Dr. Samberly's talent.<eos> Hey, thanks, Carter.<eos> Nice to hear that once in a while.<eos> What I'm speaking about is this man.<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm not in the habit of climbing into bed with snakes.
Let's say this works.<eos> We fix this device and then Vernon stops Whitney Frost with it.<eos> Then what?<eos> How do you think his priorities will change?<eos> He'll be after us the very next second.<eos> I know you'll have a hard time believing this, Agent Carter, but I have no interest in you.<eos> I won't kill you... Because I don't have to.<eos> And what's that supposed to mean?<eos> What he means is we all have dirt on one another.<eos> Bottom line is, if any one of you tries to take me down, I take you with me.
Carter.<eos> Jack, what the hell are you doing?<eos> ! Turn it on.<eos> Turn it on now!<eos> You want us to trust you, then you pull this crap?<eos> This isn't about trust. This is about making the hard choices.<eos> By killing an innocent person?<eos> Not one person in there is innocent!<eos> Jason Wilkes is.<eos> I'm doing what needs to be done, what the two of you won't do.
Robert wants to get married before the surgery and Sol is refusing to do it.<eos> Because of the thing!<eos> -What thing?<eos> -Holy shit, Sol, my father is having his heart stopped.<eos> If you know something that we need to know and you don't tell us right now, I will reach in and stop yours with my bare hands.<eos> Oh, cheese and rice!<eos> -Kids, brace yourselves.<eos> -Frankie, I really don't think you should bring the kids into this.<eos> Your father and I...<eos> Well, Sol, to you two.
Let's go! Do this!<eos> I'm so sorry. I don't do interfaith marriages.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Why not?<eos> You're supposed to be so lefty and progressive.<eos> Well, ma'am, I became a rabbi<eos> -for three reasons--<eos> -I don't care why you became a rabbi.<eos> I care about you marrying our husbands.<eos> I understand that this is a disappointment for you and--
Uh, nothing.<eos> And this is my son Chip.<eos> - Hi, Chip. - Hi, Chip.<eos> Hello Martha's parents.<eos> Yes, Martha's parents!<eos> He has been sniffing around your mother for quite some time!<eos> Who is this woman?<eos> - I don't know. - Huh?<eos> She's, uh, my friend's mother.<eos> We should sit with you. - No.
Loads of girls with their tits out lying across the couch.<eos> Like... like Spanish girls?<eos> Yeah, yeah! Spanish girls.<eos> We'd look like legends wherever we went.<eos> Sounds amazing.<eos> That handsome-looking fella there is me, Conor MacSweeney.<eos> And that's me best pal, Jock.<eos> It's the summer of 2007.<eos> We're both 15 and just after finishing the junior cert.<eos> For any of you not from Ireland, all you need to know is it's a load of bollocks.
- What are you planning on doing?<eos> - Baking him a cake? - Buy us some time.<eos> Do you honestly think he's not gonna know the difference between self-raising flour and uncut cocaine?<eos> - He's a fucking drug dealer!<eos> - Shake it!<eos> Is he far away?<eos> Well, fuck, I don't have a GPS on him, do I?<eos> Fuck!<eos> Do drug dealers ring doorbells?<eos> You two - stay out of sight.
I don't give a fuck.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> It's like his thumb went right in my eye.<eos> I didn't think that was gonna happen.<eos> If anything, I thought you were gonna beat the shit out of him.<eos> And thank you for defending my honor.<eos> I am the one that called you a whore!<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck you, and fuck you, too.<eos> I can't believe I fucked either one of you.
Shake your maracas, girl.<eos> Now you can sit.<eos> Yeah, impressive.<eos> Oh, you should see me pole dance.<eos> Well, I'd rather not.<eos> Wes and I are gonna go out.<eos> Will you give Jamison his discharge papers?<eos> Oh, and make sure Margarita takes it easy on the spice.<eos> Last time she cooked dinner, I lost the feeling in my tongue.<eos> Where are you guys going?
God thing.<eos> Hey, it doesn't have to be an old man with a beard in the sky.<eos> It can be anything.<eos> You know, it can be nature.<eos> Like the ocean or it can be the group.<eos> All you have to believe is that there is a god, and it isn't you.<eos> Hey!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You don't care about me.<eos> None of you do.
No, we have to beat her to the punch.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> If we're going to end this once and for all, we need to open the rift, knock the Zero Matter out of Whitney, and send it back to wherever it came from.<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> We have no real understanding about how the rift works.<eos> Discovering it in the first place was a fluke.<eos> You kids are so cute.<eos> I bet you cram for your finals and everything.<eos> What are you chattering about?<eos> The answer is right in front of you.
Forward march Lieutenant, lovely lines, eyes right.<eos> There you are Harry, good of you to come.<eos> And George what are you doing here, what happened to Belfast?<eos> Couldn't get enough of dirty old Dublin.<eos> He's back devilling for his people master.<eos> I'm acting as junior for Mr. Wiley.<eos> What about your father?<eos> - Joined the separates.<eos> Big fall-out when daddy Wilson secured the war ministry contract through his friend Mr. Carson.<eos> What about you, we've read about you in dispatches?
I thought your rag was banned.<eos> It's not going to stop us.<eos> What's this?<eos> Irish Citizen Army.<eos> Putting on a play are yis?<eos> Kathleen Ni Shuilbhean, Yeats.<eos> I thought your socialists were against all nations and nationalists.<eos> We're all against empires and the boot licking rats who work for them.<eos> Joining our union, detective?<eos> I would put that away if I were you.
That we're sitting on a bomb.<eos> And I believe we should be having a good time.<eos> You two girls fancy a drink?<eos> What you are you offering?<eos> The hard stuff.<eos> Want to watch you so.<eos> Now, what pro quo do I get for my quid?<eos> Don't mind him, we're fine, thanks.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> Which one of you is going to sit on my knee?
Well, thankfully it was intercepted.<eos> And where is this traitor Casement?<eos> - Under arrest in Tralee.<eos> Have him sent straight to London.<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> And in secret, the last thing we want is a martyr.<eos> And as for their collaborators in our administration, deal with them.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Once you go out with us there'll be no going back.<eos> I'll be going out with you.
And yet I fear this meeting carries with it a very grave risk.<eos> - What are you talking about, Sigurd?<eos> - The Kaiser's temper is short.<eos> Should Himmler provoke him to rage, as Goering so very nearly did,<eos> His Highness could lose everything.<eos> Not only the annual allowance they so generously grant him, but his life.<eos> The Night of the Long Knives taught us who and what they are.<eos> The Führer simply dealt with a few Jews and Communists.<eos> The former Chancellor and his wife, gunned down in their own home.<eos> Nobody is safe, not even you.
Then, Captain, you must do your duty.<eos> Just leave.<eos> Leave now.<eos> - Please.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Do you expect me to betray my oath, my country, for you?<eos> I expected nothing from you, Captain.<eos> And I will do mine.<eos> Forgive me, Herr Reichsführer.<eos> What can I do for you?
I'm afraid I must go.<eos> I have an early start tomorrow.<eos> We have an understanding, I think?<eos> Indeed, we do.<eos> Brandt, they are the rule.<eos> You are the exception.<eos> You let me know the minute the pastor gives you anything.<eos> Ah, good to see you finally taking an interest, Brandt.<eos> You were wonderful.<eos> I was very proud of you.
The offer His Highness received tonight from Himmler... It's a trap.<eos> They want to know who secretly supports the restoration.<eos> I trust you will inform His Highness accordingly.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Captain?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> - I have to go now.<eos> But first I...<eos> I have a message for you.
All right, here's the last few websites she was on.<eos> Rihanna's Oprah interview.<eos> Now, do you say "Riahna" or do you say "Rianna"?<eos> If... if... "Riahna."<eos> "Riahna"?<eos> That's what I say.<eos> A lot of people say "Rianna." I think they're wrong.<eos> Joey Pepperoni menu.<eos> Ah, Wesley Snipes' Wikipedia page.<eos> There's not, like, a place that you guys leave little, ah... little... l-l-l... little notes for each other?
Yeah.<eos> She knows.<eos> She fully knows.<eos> I... I can't really think about this right now.<eos> No, I know.<eos> Let's never talk about this, ever.<eos> Ever. I mean... it's not like we did anything wrong.<eos> You know, it's... this is how you meet people.<eos> You meet people you know.<eos> It's not like you guys were married.
You remember Jessa, right?<eos> Of course.<eos> She tried to cook meth in South Hall and then all the HazMat people came and we were all so excited.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> In fairness to her, she was cooking the meth to sell. What she was smoking was crack.<eos> - Well, that's good.<eos> - But anyway, he's with her now.<eos> Really?<eos> And is that normal for you?<eos> I mean, aren't you guys, like, best friends?
I know she likes acting, but she better not give up music.<eos> Are... are you guys working on another song together?<eos> We've, uh, just been at home. Mostly spending time with our daughter.<eos> Have you two started thinking about a brother or sister for Cadence?<eos> No.<eos> Not really.<eos> Yeah, just, uh...<eos> Oh! I'll have... I'll have a glass, thank you.<eos> Ahh. Okay.<eos> It's been kind of a strange day, and probably most strange for the two of you, because, once again, the family that you know is changing.

You think?<eos> Oh, also, you're not the only Harvard girl at this table.<eos> - No way. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Harvard Elementary, Houston, Texas.<eos> Oh, and my first boyfriend also turned out to be gay.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's like we're the same person. Yeah.<eos> Welcome to The Bluebird.<eos> We have a special show for you tonight.
- Great.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, uh, I didn't mean to spring the tour on you like that.<eos> I just found out about it last night, and it's a good opportunity.<eos> Yeah, no, I get it.<eos> I'm just wondering, what are you planning to do with Cadence?<eos> I'm bringing her with me, but you're welcome to visit anytime. I mean it. Great.<eos> You know, you're probably gonna need some help out on the road.<eos> Maybe I can just send Emily with you.
Look, if you really want to know if he's gay, man up and ask him out.<eos> I never knew a bunch of hot rocks could be so relaxing.<eos> Yeah, trust me.<eos> This and some good Scotch are the only way to survive these long tours.<eos> Just something you're gonna want to keep in mind.<eos> I can't thank you enough for bringing us out here.<eos> Oh, yes, you can, and you have.<eos> Anyway, the way your single's blowing up, having you here is good for all of us.<eos> Well, it means a lot to me... and Gunnar, too.<eos> Hey, I know I promised not to pry, but I have to say, it's really hard to believe there isn't something still going on between you guys.
Good news, guys,<eos> I got new numbers on the single.<eos> We just hit 10,000. - Oh, my goodness!<eos> - Can you believe it?<eos> No.<eos> At this rate, you're gonna be hanging up gold records in no time.<eos> And I'm getting tons of phone calls for press.<eos> Billboard, Rolling Stone, - and a bunch of others. - Whoa.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - I'm really proud of you two.
- ♪ And you ain't ever seein' the sky ♪ - Wow.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I wish there was a more powerful - ♪ 'Cause there's a great ♪ - word for "beautiful."<eos> - Me too.<eos> I should really get Cadence back to the hotel.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great to meet you, Deacon. - My pleasure.<eos> Well, thanks for opening up your home to Southern Living.<eos> It's gonna be a great 50th anniversary issue with you on the cover.
It was a stupid move.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> I just was hoping that if we spent time together, then...<eos> If you really want Avery to see how far you've come, try being honest with him instead of lying to him.<eos> - Hey, Robin.<eos> - Oh, it's great to see<eos> - you! - Good to see you. Thanks for having me.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Nice - Oh, good to have you on the show.<eos> to be here with you good people and, ah, all you folks, ah, watching at home.
- Hey, Robin.<eos> - Oh, it's great to see<eos> - you! - Good to see you. Thanks for having me.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Nice - Oh, good to have you on the show.<eos> to be here with you good people and, ah, all you folks, ah, watching at home.<eos> How many of them are there that watch across the country?<eos> - I'd say a few billion or so.<eos> - I think I already knew that.<eos> But, um, so we may have a-a surprise in store for you today.
- Hi.<eos> Welcome to my tour!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. Good to see you.<eos> - You too.<eos> Y'all are gonna love these two as much as I do.<eos> There is a lot of talent right here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You guys grab a seat.
- Seriously?<eos> What for?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't care.<eos> The important thing is that she doesn't fire The Exes.<eos> So, how about y'all do me a favor and don't piss her off?<eos> When have I ever pissed anyone off?<eos> Just be cool. You have a single launching tomorrow, and this tour is getting you in front of the biggest audience of your career.<eos> Now, Autumn's gonna have dinner with you before the show, okay?
Uh, yeah, we did.<eos> Yeah, we were friends first and then roommates.<eos> And then you weren't.<eos> So, who broke up with whom?<eos> You know, really, it's all just water under the bridge.<eos> It was you, wasn't it, Scarlett?<eos> Guys never move fast enough, do they?<eos> You just got tired of waiting for him...<eos> Oh, no, actually, it wasn't anything like that at all.<eos> You guys!
I mean, look, we know where we stand with each other, all right?<eos> Who cares what she wants to focus on? As long as it's good for the band.<eos> You think that's good for the band?<eos> Well, I think staying on this tour and not pissing Autumn off is good for the band, yeah.<eos> She's just taking an interest in us, you know?<eos> Come on, Scarlett.<eos> This is a huge opportunity for us.<eos> So can you just let it go, please?<eos> Come in.<eos> - Hey, you two.
So, they dated, and then she turned down his proposal, and now they play together every night.<eos> Can you even imagine how awkward that would be?<eos> That would be like if me and John Mayer formed a band or...<eos> You said you'd let it go.<eos> ...I mean, at that point, that was a complicated situation...<eos> I'll be back.<eos> We wrote a lot of good songs together, but...<eos> Excuse me, Autumn?<eos> Hey, girl!<eos> We were just talking about you.
Excuse me.<eos> Can we grab two coffees...<eos> one with cream, one black.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> So, The Exes opening for Autumn Chase as your single makes its way up the country charts.<eos> Not bad for a couple kids who met at the Bluebird Café a few years ago.<eos> Well, actually, we, uh, we didn't meet there.<eos> We... we met at a street fair in East Nashville.<eos> Which I wasn't even aware of until last night.<eos> Wait, so the Bluebird wasn't where it all began for you two?
So, where did we leave off?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, you two perform as The Exes, but you never speak about your personal relationship in interviews.<eos> How did it start?<eos> Tell me about your first date.<eos> Uh, we didn't really have one. No.<eos> It just sort of happened over time, I guess.<eos> Yeah, we... we were co-workers and writing partners, then roommates...<eos> And it hit you like a bolt of lightning?<eos> Or one of you made the first move?
You know what?<eos> The trouble with doing the right thing is that it usually sucks for a long time before it gets better.<eos> I can't believe I'm going out there like this.<eos> Anything I can do to make it better?<eos> Well...<eos> Killer show, guys.<eos> Pretty soon, you'll be headlining places like this.<eos> - Thank you. - Oh. Well, we're real excited to read the article.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out.<eos> Oh. Thank you for such great access.
That's it?<eos> That's incredible news.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm just, uh, a little distracted.<eos> Juliette called.<eos> She really wants Cadence with her in L.A.<eos> Offered to send her plane, put us up in a nice hotel.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think it's weird.<eos> I mean, I would love to take a trip with both of you, but... not to see your ex-wife.
- Thanks.<eos> The photographer worked real hard with me to get me to be honest about what I was feeling when I listen to our music.<eos> Well, it... it worked.<eos> Yeah, it made me think about a lot.<eos> Um... I-I realized... I'm in love with you, Gunnar.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You've talked.<eos> Uh, we haven't, actually.<eos> I really hope this isn't gonna make things weird at all around here.<eos> - Oh, you guys are...
You're breaking up the band?<eos> Have the two of you lost your minds?<eos> Your single is in the Top 100, Highway 65 is backing your album, and you'd be breaking a contract Autumn'll probably sue you for.<eos> Actually, Autumn offered to take me out as a solo act.<eos> So there's no problem there.<eos> And you're okay with this?<eos> Look, we're both getting individual attention.<eos> Maybe it's just best we go solo.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah. Except neither one of you have a solo album.
What happened?<eos> I thought you were gonna talk to him.<eos> I tried.<eos> Conversation went about three words long, and he didn't care to hear nothing else, so...<eos> Look.<eos> If The Exes have truly run their course, that's fine.<eos> But calling it quits without ever having a real conversation about your feelings?<eos> I mean, that's just... just dumb.<eos> I would've thought you'd be happy not to have to deal with all the crazy anymore.<eos> I know I'm always talking about what's best for business, but I want what's best for you, too.

Look, whatever's best for the band.<eos> You set it up, we'll be there.<eos> Yep.<eos> What she said.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go finish checking you out of your rooms.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Gunnar, can we please just talk about...<eos> - Hey, there.<eos> I don't know about you two, but I could certainly use a little break from this tour.
Did you know that Elton John has sold over 300 million records?<eos> And he's got six Grammys, a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an Oscar.<eos> Has someone been on Wikipedia since I went to get the champagne?<eos> And the fact that he's stayed on top for so long all by himself, it's... it's inspiring.<eos> Hey, what about you?<eos> How come you haven't... tried it by yourself?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, I know Scarlett and I have our issues, but it's hard for me to imagine doing it without her.<eos> Well... nothing lasts forever.<eos> But... that being said, you guys are killing it right now, so there is no reason for you not to just sit back and enjoy the moment.
Your mother loves you.<eos> Then where is she?<eos> Why isn't she here with me?<eos> Thank y'all for coming out.<eos> - Hey. Thank you.<eos> - Uh, you know, I have been working all day on a speech to get you excited about the artist that you're about to see, but it has been nearly impossible.<eos> I mean, nowadays, everyone uses so much hyperbole about everything that words like "amazing" and "incredible"<eos> have absolutely no meaning to them anymore.<eos> So I finally figured out that the best way to get y'all excited is to just let you see for yourselves.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you Maddie Jaymes.
What happened?<eos> She signed with a label in New York.<eos> She's leaving Nashville.<eos> I've really lost her.<eos> She's me, you know?<eos> She's me all over again.<eos> Except that Daddy basically kicked me out, and all I've been doing is fighting for her to stay.<eos> This is not the end of the story for you two.<eos> Sweetheart, this family... there's a whole lot of road up ahead of us.<eos> You two are gonna find your way back to each other.
Sweetheart, this family... there's a whole lot of road up ahead of us.<eos> You two are gonna find your way back to each other.<eos> I want to believe that.<eos> I don't know how to get us there.<eos> You don't have to know how.<eos> Just have faith that you will.<eos> Well, we found our way back to each other, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> Sweetie, you will, too.<eos> All of you.
Here's my card... with my name.<eos> Trainee Parrish, you have just failed this exercise.<eos> What?<eos> You're an agent?<eos> The test wasn't "Can you turn me?"<eos> It was "Can I turn you?"<eos> I failed, too.<eos> What?<eos> Which is even worse than your fellow NATs that came up empty.<eos> Whenever you are approaching someone, they are approaching you, reading you, searching you for a weakness to exploit.
I came here with a lot of questions.<eos> Got the answers that I needed.<eos> A clean slate...<eos> that's a powerful thing.<eos> You know, you once said I was the best.<eos> Well, saying goodbye to this is the only way I can be again.<eos> We doing this?<eos> Now or never.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Trainees, meet the class above you.

He took his own life last night.<eos> Before he did, he asked me to deliver a message to you.<eos> He said, "Tell her...<eos> I thought I didn't have a choice."<eos> Does that mean something to you?<eos> Assistant Director, when Harper was a trainee at Quantico, were you concerned about his mental health?<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Interim Deputy Director, I'll ask you the same question... were you ever concerned?<eos> No, Mr. Chairman, I was not.<eos> Now, did either of you ever see Harper display any violent attitudes or opinions, either before or after he was dismissed?
We are now back in session.<eos> Thank you, Agent Parrish, for returning to us this afternoon.<eos> I was subpoenaed, Congressman.<eos> It is essential that we hear all of your thoughts.<eos> Now, I've been told that you have prepared a statement.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> You may proceed.<eos> "To my friends and family, my fellow agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and my fellow New Yorkers who've suffered these unspeakable tragedies...<eos> I know how painful these past few months have been for all of us.<eos> And I know many of you in this room blame me for what you see as prolonging your suffering.
Know what?<eos> We submitted five names, but because of your tantrum, they decided to cut from our class, too.<eos> We didn't break the rules... you did.<eos> Are you saying we had something - to do with this?<eos> - Yeah. - Of course you did.<eos> - Back up.<eos> Or what are you gonna do... give me a fake scar?<eos> Trainees, trainees.<eos> That's enough!<eos> As some of you may already know, the five that were expelled this morning were cut from both classes.
My father... how was he?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Well, with all due respect, Princess, the king has taken me into his confidence.<eos> I wouldn't really feel comfortable speaking about it.<eos> But he's... he's all right.<eos> You don't need to worry about him.<eos> So many people doubt him now because of what the prophet said.<eos> Ishbaal said something awful to my father.<eos> The prophecy's hit him the hardest of all.<eos> Well, if anyone can ease his mind, it's you.
Your son was to marry my daughter.<eos> We grieve as one.<eos> Your grief does not bring him back.<eos> We must now protect all our sons.<eos> Hanoch speaks wisely, my friend.<eos> We must unite the tribes to protect our future generations.<eos> How can we accept a leader that does not have the faith of the prophet?<eos> The Philistines are animals.<eos> They eat dog and pig.<eos> They worship a sea monster, and Saul has defeated them again and again and again with my sons at his side defending you and yours.
This is how you repay him?<eos> Because I did not hear the prophet say, "Betray your king!"<eos> The prophet said... No one knows what the prophet meant, and he is not here to explain himself, but Saul is here.<eos> As he's been here ever since he was anointed.<eos> The tribe of Ruben pledges its loyalty to the House of Saul.<eos> We thank you, Hanoch.<eos> Eitan of Judah, will you pledge your loyalty to the House of Saul?<eos> The 11 tribes together do not equal the might of Judah.<eos> Your men are fierce... it is true... much like their chieftain.<eos> If we do not join, you and your bloodline are wiped from this earth.
I'm looking at where you live.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Well... it's ordinary.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Ma Loute!<eos> My children.<eos> The roar of the lions. The howling of wolves. The ocean's fury in the storm.<eos> As the boat was at the mercy of the waves, the poet whispered to me. The instant I saw the rescuers.... close to our young stray sheep.<eos> In these troubled times when our hearts tremble. In the presence of immensity, we celebrate the Virgin of the Sea. Who with her eyes protects every sailor on his boat.<eos> The Virgin of the Sea watches over you like a beacon.
My love.<eos> Look, Billie,... stop this perverse game!<eos> It's horriblel!<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace...<eos> Jesus... the fruit of thy womb.<eos> Have mercy on me!<eos> Have mercy on me!<eos> If you keep doing this, baby Jesus will fall!<eos> This child is the fruit of blood... of absolute evil, André, of absolute evil!<eos> You men!
Sweet!<eos> You got it, girl!<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Alberto!<eos> Down, down!<eos> Here, pass it to me!<eos> Bianca.<eos> All right?<eos> I got some Nutella for you.
She's mental.<eos> I can't take any more.<eos> The fuckers!<eos> Go on, film me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Perfect.<eos> Leave those cars alone!<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> I'm talking to you!
He fucked my mum!<eos> Everyone has!<eos> Everyone's fucked your mother!<eos> Stop.<eos> Fucking stop!<eos> I'll pay you back.<eos> I swear I'll pay you back.<eos> Get the fuck outta here!<eos> Drive.<eos> It's been an honour working with you.
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.<eos> You're there right.<eos> If you're fixing the up jock find your way down we.<eos> Your poor stomach you see wait till you get to them strange islands and you meet your first cannibals.<eos> Cannibals?<eos> We made our choice to go to sea, right, easy old pal?<eos> And I swear, I'll not regret it.<eos> Alright, go and bring me something to eat.<eos> Right May, I wont fail you.<eos> Good day, you lucky clucks will you join me for a little snack?
I know one thing they are capable of. Leaving the island.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, come on, this can't be happening to me.<eos> He's actualy leaving.<eos> We did it.<eos> We got rid of him.<eos> Yeah, we scared them big time.<eos> Will somebody tell me what's happening?<eos> I'll tell you what's going on.<eos> You guys have ruined my chance to get off this island and see the world.
If we ever get off this one.<eos> You know, you're the first to come from the outside world.<eos> Oh, dear that's not good news.<eos> Hey, hold on a second, we're all dress up like this because...?<eos> Because you look fierce now get your heads in the game everyone.<eos> We have the perfect opportunity, the dog and that bird are still on the ship.<eos> Right.<eos> Listen up!<eos> Here's the plan we'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.<eos> The rest of you. Go for the human on the beach.
Looks that way, Epi gal.<eos> Where are you going, Rosie?<eos> I'm going to clean up our mess.<eos> - I'm in!<eos> - Let's get cracking then, mate.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You're going to make an even bigger mess of things.<eos> Wild beasts, they're going to get us!<eos> Stay right where you are.<eos> I've got a special treat for all of you.
Oh, how could I?<eos> You know how I take my coffee.<eos> Excuse me, but they wanna see you upstairs in the partners boardroom.<eos> Tell them I'll be right there.<eos> Oh, and tomorrow is your mother's birthday.<eos> Get her something for me, would you?<eos> Of course.<eos> There is a sickness inside us.<eos> Rising like the bile that leaves that bitter taste at the back of our throats.<eos> It's there in every one of you seated around the table.
Hate to break up your little zen nap, but we're here.<eos> - Already?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> A lot faster with a motor.<eos> Easy.<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> As I recall, the last time you helped, two of my friends blew up.<eos> No minefield this time.<eos> We go around the Dead Zone.<eos> Let's get a move on, you two.
Ho! - Get out of my way.<eos> - You'll never make it in time.<eos> - He's right. Look.<eos> No way we get across without being seen.<eos> We should lay low, let the army pass.<eos> Then we find Clarke.<eos> Guys, there's a cave.<eos> We just got lucky.<eos> Come on.<eos> - I can't go with you.
I don't betray my friends.<eos> But you did.<eos> You had friends in Mount Weather.<eos> Those deaths are on you, too.<eos> The only difference is, you have no honor, and I had no choice.<eos> It helps no one to dwell on the past, and that's not why I'm here.<eos> You're right. I'm not just letting you go back to your people.<eos> I want something more. I want your people to become my people.<eos> I'm offering Skaikru the chance to join my coalition, become the 13th clan.<eos> No one would dare to move against you because that would be moving against me.
Daddy?<eos> Hey, baby girl.<eos> Poppy got me a bike.<eos> Can you teach me how to ride it?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll teach you to ride it as soon as we...<eos> Signal lost.<eos> What have I done?<eos> We gather here on this Ascension Day to honor the commanders that came before me,<eos> those who live on within me as I will live on within one of you.
That's a novel concept.<eos> Continue.<eos> Anyway, I'm thinking that maybe this person, she somehow got out in time, right, because...<eos> She's there surrounded by all those...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, I don't really know what those are.<eos> The first Natblida.<eos> Natblidas, and there... there she is, this woman who fell out of the sky, right?<eos> I mean, that's... that's just like us.<eos> It's nothing like you.
Right.<eos> Well, good, that's decided then.<eos> All right, we have time for one final share, and, Maddie, you're up.<eos> Sure.<eos> Whatever.<eos> - Hi, I'm Maddie.<eos> - All: Hi, Maddie.<eos> You guys know I'm the only person in high school here.<eos> It's really been hard.<eos> I know I don't have a job like most of you guys or obligations like kids, but I do have a group of friends who have sustained me through some pretty tough times.
Oh, don't do that.<eos> The dark menace of the future makes cowards of us all, and the past is a thing which each of us must overcome in her own way.<eos> Is that not so, my dear baroness?<eos> Have I disappointed you?<eos> Have you disappointed yourself?<eos> It has not been as I expected. Oh.<eos> It never is.<eos> But we need places of healing and mercy now more than ever.<eos> So, you must fight through it -- the hardships, the resistance, the futility.<eos> There is nothing here without you.
There's evil in this place.<eos> I've been here before -- to see my brother. You don't remember?<eos> They fed him pork and greens and made him a fine suit to show hisself.<eos> That was 9 -- no, it was, uh...11 years now.<eos> They took him to market.<eos> It was a... A sunny day... Burning hot.<eos> Remember I see'd the sweat running down 'round his collar.<eos> And I never see'd him again.<eos> Well, maybe you will before too long.<eos> The ladies is all worried for you.
It's a war, Emma.<eos> We all could die.<eos> I-I-I didn't mean to -- what's important is for each of us, in his own way, to remain loyal to the cause.<eos> That's what I'm doing, that's what your father is doing, and I hope that's what you're doing 'cause it doesn't always look that way to me.<eos> Laudanum drops thrice daily, Miss.<eos> And come back tomorrow.<eos> Dr. hale.<eos> One of the few of your ilk I welcome with open arms.<eos> Mr. Bullen.<eos> You and your friend nurse Hastings you know how things work -- don't fight the system.
She'll help you find your way... And your little boy.<eos> You ain't got to do this.<eos> No real good comes out of doing what we have to do.<eos> It comes out of doing what's right.<eos> The provost Marshall will see you now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> At long last.<eos> Smile as if you mean it.<eos> Colonel Sinex likes pretty girls.<eos> What can I do for you?
It's a terrible thing, it is.<eos> Perhaps you would allow me to send our coffins South so that all soldiers in this terrible war might be buried with honor.<eos> You'd provide the coffins?<eos> And the transport.<eos> Our furniture company's barge has been grounded since the union came to Alexandria.<eos> It wasn't requisitioned?<eos> Well, sir, they haven't found it yet.<eos> But I could use it to move the coffins as well as anything else.<eos> Well, that seems a kind gesture, Mr. Green.<eos> I have to wonder how that would benefit you.
Sell?<eos> That is h-hardly the point.<eos> Well, I believe it is.<eos> The point has to do with the methods of practicing medicine which are espoused by individual doctors...<eos> Please, hale.<eos> ...and whether or not anyone, even the executive officer, has the right to enforce practices...<eos> He does because I say he does!<eos> ...based on theories which are not universally held!<eos> The man is a martinet!<eos> What in God's name is wrong with you, hale?
...based on theories which are not universally held!<eos> The man is a martinet!<eos> What in God's name is wrong with you, hale?<eos> I have no idea what happened to your chloroform.<eos> Then you and Bullen need to get your stories straight.<eos> In the meantime, I intend to find a suitable replacement for you.<eos> Ah, you see, sir?<eos> A martinet.<eos> Now, now, Foster -- a doctor who understands scientific medicine, who sees that anesthetic is not a luxury, but a necessity.<eos> There's no room in this war for doctors like you.
Oh, there he is! - Ah!<eos> - Oh! My dicklickers!<eos> Come on, come on, man, bring it in.<eos> - Bring it in.<eos> - How you doin', lil' dicklicker?<eos> - What's up, buddy?<eos> - Come on, bring it in.<eos> - How you feeling, man?<eos> - Not ideal, not ideal.<eos> I mean, I don't have anybody to hang out with except you fools.
Nobody move.<eos> We have broken glass.<eos> Are you guys okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. I'm so sorry.<eos> I just... I thought maybe we should do something, like, a little bigger that time.<eos> It's okay.<eos> That was cool.<eos> Okay, let's get this cleaned up carefully.<eos> - You guys cannot move.
- Oh, Jesus.<eos> ...four inches wide for some reason, but he had that idea in it.<eos> We just buy that idea from him.<eos> No, no, that's not how it works, Wyatt.<eos> You can't just buy an idea.<eos> You have to buy the whole fucking script.<eos> Okay. So can we afford that?<eos> I mean, that's fine.<eos> Sure we can.<eos> Because that's one less script for all of you now.
Doesn't everyone?<eos> All right, first thing we need to do is work up a plan.<eos> Got a lot of experience infiltrating criminal gatherings? Didn't think so.<eos> I'm calling the shots.<eos> Actually, I'm in charge, in case any of you have forgotten.<eos> No, I remember. I just don't care.<eos> Do I need to remind any of you that I'm a Time Master?<eos> Making discrete alterations to the timeline is what I do, so we're not just gonna charge into the past like a bull into a china shop...<eos> Half of what you've told us about the mission turned out to be lies.<eos> None of you have ever encountered Vandal Savage before.
This ends here and now, Savage.<eos> You're coming with us.<eos> I doubt you can apprehend me... and stop a nuclear explosion.<eos> You screwed that up pretty good. I had it handled.<eos> I like how you actually believe that.<eos> Um, we got a nuclear bomb here.<eos> Ray!<eos> What did you do?<eos> I didn't do anything. It must have a fail-safe.<eos> Professor, Jax, we need you!
This is right when I meet my future wife, Clarissa.<eos> So obviously, we wouldn't want my former self tempted by a sexy assassin from the future.<eos> Aw, you think I'm sex...<eos> Do not finish that sentence.<eos> Found it.<eos> Is there a trick to opening the case?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Let's grab the dagger and let's go.<eos> Raymond, you don't break into a candy store and steal one gumball.<eos> You guys grab the goodies.
Please.<eos> Contact your friends.<eos> I'm looking forward to seeing at least two of them again.<eos> Un-believable!<eos> Is that a tachyon manifold?<eos> Hey, how did you find us, man?<eos> You think I couldn't build something to track my own tracker?<eos> Do you have any idea what you have done?<eos> What I've done?<eos> You guys knocked me out.
We're still asking ourselves the same question:<eos> Why are we here?<eos> I believe that we're here to learn, Martin.<eos> Be glad that you still can.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Hunter.<eos> How's Kendra?<eos> The same.<eos> So what now?<eos> Now?<eos> Now it's up to you.
But I wouldn't have asked if I didn't think we could do it.<eos> You talkin' real big, but I ain't heard no plan yet.<eos> The plan is simple.<eos> We figure a way off of massa's land.<eos> We protect each other on the run.<eos> Then we make it so once we get north, ain't no one has no cause to bring us back.<eos> Mm. I ain't gettin' no stripes on my back for this.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What? We can't do this without you.<eos> Without any of you.
And it just kept getting smaller.<eos> I could feel Marley's hot breath on me every second.<eos> I remember wishing' not to feel it crawling' over my skin.<eos> I ain't felt the heat no more.<eos> I just kept holding' her.<eos> - Wasn't no room to let her go.<eos> - That crate was right over here.<eos> - Search it all.<eos> Where you hiding him?<eos> I know a runaway was brought here. Turn him over now, and I might not drag you and your pretty wife down to the jailhouse with the rest of the nigger lovers.
Yes, sir.<eos> Go on, boy!<eos> Get a move on!<eos> Got a problem with your ears?<eos> You heard the boss. Hurry up!<eos> (quietly): Noah's down there with Frog Jack, ain't he?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Aw, hell, I'll walk down!<eos> Hold up a minute, boss!<eos> I think I'm gonna go on down there with you.
It's your first kill.<eos> Your responsibility.<eos> Jay will show you how to honor the kill once you get home.<eos> First time I laid eyes on you was at one of these dances.<eos> You remember?<eos> I didn't have a pass to go, but, Lord, it was worth that paddling' I got just to talk to you.<eos> I's finished.<eos> No, you ain't.<eos> You got to make two more, for you and Boo.<eos> I ain't running' without you.
This place is beautiful.<eos> House down the street's for sale, I could put a word in for you.<eos> Be the envy of all my friends.<eos> See anything you like?<eos> Should I give you a tour?<eos> Hey!<eos> Start walking.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're not going to scream now.<eos> Now, one of you guys is gonna tell me what the fuck is going on.
So, where were we?<eos> Previously on Rogue.<eos> Listen to me, Ethan, don't go anywhere near her apartment.<eos> She's setting you up.<eos> One of you guys is gonna tell me what the fuck is going on.
I'm not aiming at your guts.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> You made promise to us.<eos> Now you are ducking our calls.<eos> This is very concerning.<eos> I'm not ducking anything.<eos> No one's ducking anything.<eos> And I don't appreciate you just dropping in on me like this.<eos> I'm a little busy, Alexei.<eos> I will talk to you when I'm good and fucking ready.
Patty.<eos> Buddy, you do not have to do this.<eos> Hey, it was me they tried to kill.<eos> Not an invalid.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is he really necessary?<eos> Insurance against you ripping me off,<eos> - among other things.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> You guys have met before. Right?
What're you doing bringing it here?<eos> Show of good faith.<eos> You get to hold on to that money until the fight.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll take your money.<eos> I'm gonna need to count it first.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> Should you be working, son?<eos> Never felt better.<eos> Gonna be honest with you, not a lot to go on here.
No.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Didn't seem like the judge did either.<eos> It went against you?<eos> I'm sorry, Marlon. I know you stuck your neck out for us.<eos> Don't even worry about it.<eos> I'm not really here for an apology.<eos> Then what are you here for?<eos> Working with you guys...
What are you doing?<eos> I'm getting ready for work.<eos> Don't I look nice?<eos> We got group before we go.<eos> I can't wake up Maddie.<eos> That's how you wake up a teenager.<eos> - Good morning! - Yeah.<eos> Good morning, everyone.<eos> Welcome to Animal Farm.<eos> I'm going to invite you all to go into the basket and pick out a different animal to represent each member of your immediate family. - (groaning)
You are a girl after my own heart.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - We're out of here.<eos> - Right. _<eos> Shh, shh, shh.<eos> - Oh, gosh.<eos> - Hi.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> What's the story with you two?
Regardless, with "vigilance" as our watchword, I am confident --<eos> Doctor Summers!<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> There's a man out front -- rodent of a bloke -- with a ghoulish lady by his side.<eos> Says the inspector general sent him.<eos> The medical inspector today?<eos> Oh, he was supposed to come next week.<eos> Shall I send him away, sir? Uh...<eos> There's no need to discuss the escaped patient outside these walls... Or even within.<eos> He's addressing you, sister Isabella.
With but two mortalities.<eos> Oh, my, my, that is impressive.<eos> I-I may not have the most tender of touch, but I am efficient and resourceful, with a-a strong military record behind me. Hale?<eos> Yes?<eos> Are you aware the medical inspector is waiting to see me?<eos> Yes, I heard the matron.<eos> She -- she just said that.<eos> Fear not, hale.<eos> I will get to your promotion soon enough.<eos> Dr. summers, I wanted to discuss a new hygienic I-Initiative with you.
I wasn't gonna bring a child into this world like that.<eos> Someday, someone is gonna give Bullen what's coming to him. Oh, leave it alone.<eos> He ain't worth it.<eos> What's he got on you, huh?<eos> Does it have to do with your people down South?<eos> Your little boy?<eos> Gabriel?<eos> You'll only make it worse if you get mixed up in it.<eos> I'm tired of waiting!<eos> Please, sir, a doctor will be with you as soon as he can.
And neither are we, not without the things our mother sent him.<eos> Those from your secret kitchen, boy?<eos> They're from the ward, Mr. Bullen.<eos> If you and that Boston blue nose want to waste your time doing my job for me, well, go ahead.<eos> We appreciate that.<eos> So do all the hungry soldiers.<eos> We got a problem between us, don't we?<eos> A failure to... Collaborate?<eos> I see how your jaw tightens every time you come near me.<eos> What we have, sir... Is... You on one hand.
Choose your friends better, Miss.<eos> Animals!<eos> You cold-blooded savages!<eos> Quiet now.<eos> If you're going to tell tales, you might at least get your stories straight.<eos> Was it the woods or the riverbank, on foot or horseback?<eos> What does it matter?<eos> The reb got what he deserved.<eos> Better off dead than out here shooting at us.<eos> How about one of you marksmen give me a hand with his legs?
It looks like someone took an iron to you. Tell her, you yellow dog.<eos> Tell her how you run away!<eos> I never did.<eos> Dig your furrow straight, Starks.<eos> We was led right into stonewall's gunsights.<eos> Don't believe a word this shirker says, Miss!<eos> Damn you, you son of a bitch!<eos> Stop it!<eos> To your bed!<eos> Quiet on this ward, or it'll be the brig for both of you!
Help me understand how men can be so cruel.<eos> There's no good explanation for the cruelty of war.<eos> When otherwise decent men believe strongly enough in a cause -- this is not about decent men.<eos> This is about union men.<eos> Decent men wouldn't take all that my family has with nary a second thought.<eos> Decent men would not parade Tom's remains like a trophy.<eos> It was wrong, undeniably, and yet we have -- decent men would not cast their lot with those who are so clearly not decent men.<eos> You want to know who's responsible for Tom's death?<eos> You are.<eos> You and everyone who aided his escape.
I was wondering if you'd ever turn up again.<eos> Oh, m-my sincere apologies, inspector.<eos> I, um, I trust Dr. Foster -- disappeared, as well.<eos> It's as if you all have something better to do than show me around.<eos> Perhaps Miss Phinney and I can continue your tour.<eos> Not necessary.<eos> I've seen more than enough to make my evaluation.<eos> I'll find Miss Evans, and we'll be on our way.<eos> Thank you for the hospitality, summers.<eos> And you, too, Miss Phinney.
Or is it only your moral diagnosis?<eos> This hospital has limited resources, Miss Phinney.<eos> Whom do you think should go without care?<eos> A soldier who performed his duty with honor?<eos> His child -- lies.<eos> His wife needed him.<eos> A true muggins will never acknowledge the corn, especially when facing the great beyond. It is not for us to decide.<eos> I gave you explicit instruction -- every man has a right to mercy, no matter his sins.<eos> I would insist on it for any soldier.<eos> Even you, sir.
My nephew stood in for the measuring.<eos> Should be close enough, I expect.<eos> I have not yet received my exam results, sir.<eos> Ah, but I have.<eos> You passed.<eos> Don't look so perplexed.<eos> I'm pleased I made it through.<eos> Made it through?<eos> You excelled. Entering at the rank of captain.<eos> No more hale lording it over you. Drink?
I wonder, major, if... Hmm? There might be an available room for me here at mansion house.<eos> Mrs. foster... she's gone off to California ahead of me.<eos> She and I have agreed that... No, no, no, no.<eos> Certainly, certainly.<eos> Um, I'm sure Mrs. Brannan can find something.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Miss Phinney.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Countess.<eos> What can I do for you?
James, I received a letter from my brother in Texas.<eos> He says there's plenty of room for us whenever we decide to leave.<eos> He says they want to help us.<eos> Never get old, boys.<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Papers?<eos> Oh, easy.<eos> I'm here to work.<eos> Now, if... if you don't have papers, you need someone to vouch for you.
This rebel will be sent directly back to Wolfe street hospital, where they can cut off whatever part of him they'd like.<eos> This rebel is my brother.<eos> Why does that not surprise me?<eos> I'll look after him myself.<eos> He'll be no concern of yours.<eos> This is a military hospital.<eos> You are a civilian contract surgeon... Dr. hale.<eos> What?<eos> Dr. foster has just passed his military surgeon's exam.<eos> You... you what?
Well, I'm gonna do it again.<eos> Prepare the chloroform.<eos> You've administered chloroform? Yes, under supervision.<eos> Good. Put him under.<eos> Nurses aren't allowed to...<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I should return to the ward.<eos> Hold his head, please.<eos> Just breathe, private.<eos> You too, miss green.
The family?<eos> I saw them weeping by the fire... Afraid their own neighbors would kill them.<eos> Look at what these blue devils are doing to us.<eos> Dr. foster.<eos> I bet this doesn't look good.<eos> Please get up.<eos> Please.<eos> Oh.<eos> No.<eos> No, this is not you.
Lonely. Very lonely.<eos> I'd reach out to people.<eos> Not friends, exactly.<eos> Maybe acquaintances, more like.<eos> But there was always... a distance. A...a barrier.<eos> The absence of closeness makes you... dry inside.<eos> But still committed.<eos> It was the only thing I had left.<eos> - Anything new?<eos> But the longer they have William in custody, the greater the risk to you.
It's all country.<eos> Figured you'd be more of a soul man or a funk fella.<eos> Yeah, well, country got soul.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Actually... you want to hear some real shit?<eos> Hey.<eos> That's a big toolbox, baby.<eos> Let's see what we got here 'cause I am done asking nicely, but it's gonna feel way longer to you than it is to me.
Don't shoot.<eos> I fell off the boat.<eos> You know, I washed down shore.<eos> Got all wet.<eos> I heard y'all talkin'.<eos> You know, I could show you where the river bends.<eos> There's a tavern that's right near it...<eos> We can find it on our own.<eos> Wait.<eos> No, no, no, no, no. You... you got to take me with you.
Come on. Come on!<eos> She gone.<eos> She gone. Ain't nothing we can do about it.<eos> We need him.<eos> She ain't just leave.<eos> Even she knew your plan ain't shit.<eos> That girl gave up on you.<eos> Morning.<eos> What's your business here?<eos> I suspect the same as you.
Any mistake you make to jeopardize this case, I'll go to Collins if I have to... I don't give a fuck... to make sure you're removed.<eos> Tommy, what the hell?<eos> What you want, Tash?<eos> I want to know why you haven't been returning my calls.<eos> I've been trying to tell you that Shawn is dead.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Ghost says Kanan did it and that he killed Kanan afterwards, but I don't believe a word that motherfucker says anymore. Oh, yeah?<eos> Me either.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> What happened between you?
Yup.<eos> To everybody on Stern's VIP list?<eos> Yeah, every single one.<eos> It's right here.<eos> - Perfect, thanks.<eos> - It's not about that, though.<eos> It's all right.<eos> We'll talk later, I promise.<eos> - Hey, folks.<eos> I want to extend my appreciation to you all for stepping up to make the launch of JSP Nightlife come to fruition.
Matter of fact, I think they're ready for him now.<eos> James, James, you need me.<eos> You... you can't run this place without me. I can, and I will.<eos> Get him the fuck out of my sight.<eos> Loyalty is everything to me.<eos> I deserve it, and I demand it.<eos> Now, let's get to work.<eos> Yo, Tommy, that shit with Chuleta, man, I'm hearing it from everybody, yo.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Now people know not to fuck with us or with you.
This man is a murderer.<eos> This fool and his friends dragged me from my bed at an ungodly hour without ceremony or reason, said that the King has sent for me.<eos> The King.<eos> I fell from my horse through near exhaustion.<eos> They forced me into that tavern, where I'm attacked.<eos> Robbed.<eos> I feared for my very life.<eos> Three innocent bystanders are dead because of you.<eos> You did nothing to protect me. And the King will hear of it.<eos> Let us see what he wants with you first, shall we?
Come.<eos> I left a good, clean war for this?<eos> This is madness!<eos> Why bring the Duke of Orleans back after all this time?<eos> It's political insanity.<eos> I'm sure the King has his reasons.<eos> Yes, which I do not have to share.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> The Duke will be here soon!<eos> Need I remind Your Majesty, you exiled him for plotting to overthrow you.
Recover what was stolen.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> I'm afraid I must insist.<eos> - Majesty...<eos> - Soldiers respect the chain of command,<eos> Treville, you know this.<eos> Show them a strong hand.<eos> Find the thief, and bring him before me.<eos> Did you see anything?<eos> I saw an aristocrat murder three innocent men while the four of you just stood by.
Orleans!<eos> Return to the tavern for the weapons. Yeah!<eos> - We should go after them.<eos> - No.<eos> Come with me.<eos> If it wasn't for that little wretch, I'd be next in line to the throne.<eos> Childhood, such a perilous time.<eos> So much tragedy can just occur.<eos> So far, the King has refused to listen to me.<eos> If all of you bear witness, he will understand the severity of this situation.

She is our Queen, Gaston.<eos> And you'd do well to remember that you have only just returned from exile.<eos> While you have gone into a kind of exile, Majesty.<eos> It seems as if the King cares for nothing but his son.<eos> My son and husband share many enthusiasms. But when he's grown, he may not love the same people as his father.<eos> Majesty.<eos> Treville and his Musketeers, they stopped us.<eos> They've gone to the King.<eos> I must go, too.<eos> - I'll come with you.
I'm going to spend time with my son.<eos> The King wants me to speak to these men on his behalf.<eos> That's not a good idea.<eos> They blame us, Treville...<eos> I have to contain this before it spreads.<eos> I will speak to them as a soldier, not a Minister.<eos> What's happened?<eos> They saw us help them against the Red Guard, they'll listen to me.<eos> You're going alone?<eos> If I go with you, it will provoke them.
I'm coming with you.<eos> I thought we were telling each other everything.<eos> You shouldn't have come here.<eos> No!<eos> Christophe!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Minister Treville is the King's closest advisor.<eos> His friend.<eos> He's come to negotiate, you can trust him.<eos> I was a soldier. Like all of you.
The death of the thief who took the Duke's purse.<eos> Where's the Minister and my Musketeer?<eos> You won't see them until you've taken our demands to the King.<eos> This is never going to happen.<eos> It'll happen in one hour.<eos> - Or your friends die.<eos> - Stand down.<eos> We can still end this peacefully.<eos> This will end!<eos> But whether or not it is peaceful? That's up to you.
- Stand down.<eos> We can still end this peacefully.<eos> This will end!<eos> But whether or not it is peaceful? That's up to you.<eos> One hour.<eos> You stay here.<eos> If we granted even half of what they're asking for it would ruin us!<eos> A mass?<eos> Full pensions for thousands of injured soldiers who can't even work let alone fight?<eos> Majesty, they were injured fighting for you.
You have no reason to be sorry, my love.<eos> You stood by me. All these years.<eos> Through all those wars.<eos> I let you down.<eos> I...<eos> You fought bravely, Josephine.<eos> You kept your honour.<eos> You both did.<eos> The Duke was carrying these when he entered the tavern.<eos> He and many others were raising an army against you.
I told Christophe you could be trusted.<eos> Took you long enough. You proved me right in the end.<eos> - You doubted me.<eos> - Not for a second.<eos> Probably shouldn't kiss a captain in front of his men. Hmm...<eos> Most of them are boys. Not even men.<eos> Get out, Feron.<eos> I have no need of a bastard's friendship.<eos> Good morning, Gaston.<eos> I am the son of a King, just like you.
Raife Waggum.<eos> Well, I have a sad call to make.<eos> Busy.<eos> Bart, would you like some extra bacon?<eos> Sure would, Mom.<eos> Okay, but you owe me.<eos> Sorry, sorry, force of habit.<eos> It's okay, Mom.<eos> Whatever you want, just glad you're back.<eos> Geez, ever since I got sprung from the hoosegow, you kids have been kind of clingy.
Not that it matters.<eos> My pockets get lined either way.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> The whole time you been tracking them Macon runaways, we've been tracking you.<eos> Shit, I thought you'd seen us back at that fallen tree.<eos> Please...<eos> Let him go!<eos> You ain't gonna shoot all of us.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Just you.
Do whatever we gotta do to get to the train there.<eos> Ain't no way we outrun a train.<eos> It's got to stop in the city.<eos> Now, Frog Jack said it don't leave till 5:00.<eos> Give us just an hour to catch it.<eos> We go for that train now, them catchers be on us in no time.<eos> No, we split up.<eos> No. It's me and Henry.<eos> You and Zeke.<eos> We go in opposite directions, we'll draw them away from you.
- It could be "Filipindú", but if that's all you've got...<eos> Is he tall, blond, dark hair, brown hair?<eos> There are lots, Maribel.<eos> Aunt Luisa's Julio,<eos> Julio from Trapale, your cousin Juliete too...<eos> - My aunt Marina's Julio, plus...<eos> - Yes, Julio from Tagones.<eos> 10 or 12 of them.<eos> Don't you have a last name?<eos> The Lord be with you.

I mean, I-I realized I had a duty to the company, but I figured, how much difference could it make?<eos> About $89 million worth, Clayton.<eos> Shit. I'm sorry.<eos> Should he have a lawyer for this part?<eos> Well, if you would like a lawyer, Kelly, then, uh, yes.<eos> - You can call one. - Okay.<eos> And then, uh, we can arrest your husband and finish this as an interrogation.<eos> I-I don't, uh...<eos> See, right now, this seems like sort of a friendly conversation, but it's not, really, because we all know that it could turn hard in a different direction.<eos> And, uh, there's days that I would push it there. But... I like it out here, and the two of you.
Now, she must've taken that out the umbrella stand.<eos> Oh, your little girl's been so good to me. I can't shoot you in the face.<eos> I'll just make you deaf for a week.<eos> I have church tomorrow.<eos> Can you do the other?<eos> Thank you!<eos> Give it up!<eos> She isn't coming!<eos> You've just made a very powerful enemy-<eos> - NPR. Our revenge is made possible by listeners like you.
I've got more involved plans.<eos> So, Frink is finally going to announce which woman he's chosen to be with at the Springfield Planetarium.<eos> It's like an episode of The Bachelor, but you drive there and pay six dollars for parking.<eos> Why are we both explaining it if we all know what's happening?<eos> I like talking to you.<eos> Ladies, please pay attention here.<eos> You see, I, uh... I thought I was the only one who was lonely.<eos> But I have learned that loneliness is everywhere, like superhero movies.<eos> How many times can Batman begin?<eos> I have reworked my algorithms to make you not like me, but to find the man that will make each of you happiest, yes.
You hear me whistle, shoot him.<eos> I will.<eos> Come on out. We're not gonna hurt you.<eos> We're friends of Jesus.<eos> We're here to get you out.<eos> - There more of you?<eos> - Two more. They ran ahead.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're with Jesus.<eos> Let's go. I can't go with you.
Come on.<eos> Name's Harlan, by the way.<eos> Maggie.<eos> That's my husband, Glenn.<eos> We're bringing back medication, so you may have saved more people than just us back there, Glenn.<eos> - You're a doctor?<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> You have any prenatal vitamins in there?<eos> - For you?<eos> Well, uh, I was an obstetrician before, and I most definitely owe you.
They saved us out there.<eos> Lower the spears.<eos> Look, I'm not taking any chances.<eos> Tell your guy Gregory to come out here.<eos> No.<eos> Don't you see what just happened?<eos> I'm letting you keep your guns.<eos> Look, we ran out of ammo months ago.<eos> I like you people.<eos> I trust you.
This isn't a compromise.<eos> It's a choice you give them.<eos> It's a way out, for them and for us.<eos> We try and talk to the Saviors, we give up our advantage, our safety.<eos> No, we have to come for them before they come for us.<eos> We can't leave them alive.<eos> Where there's life, there's possibility.<eos> Of them hitting us.<eos> We're not trapped in this.<eos> None of you are trapped in this.
Your people could be in trouble.<eos> If you get them back, the deal's still on, right?<eos> Right?<eos> If they get themselves back.<eos> Andy, drive him back to the Hilltop.<eos> Look, if they see you and we don't make it...<eos> We're gonna make it. And they're not gonna see me.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Go!<eos> If it wasn't us, it was gonna be you.
You weren't listening.<eos> I said I'd contact you.<eos> Would it make a difference if I said I was sorry about that?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think we're gonna make the trade, so tell me where.<eos> We haven't agreed to that.<eos> You will.<eos> You know what? I'm not so sure.<eos> We'd be taking most of the risk, not getting much in the way of a reward.<eos> The other option won't work out for you.
Seriously, I didn't catch what you said.<eos> I should've killed you.<eos> Yeah, you probably should've.<eos> So, here we are.<eos> Kind of begs the question, right?<eos> Who brought this on who?<eos> I mean, I get that you'll just have to take my word for this, but... she wasn't even the one I was aiming for.<eos> Like I said, kicks like a bitch.<eos> It's nothing personal.<eos> Look, this isn't how we like to start new business arrangements, but, well, you pricks kind of set the tone, didn't you?
You were right.<eos> I knew it when you said it.<eos> I wish it didn't have to end, not this way.<eos> It was never my intention to hurt you, but it's how it has to be.<eos> We have so much here... people, food, medicine, walls, everything we need to live.<eos> But what we have other people want, too, and that will never change.<eos> If we survive this threat and it's not over, another one will be back to take its place, to take what we have.<eos> I love you all here.<eos> I do.<eos> And I'd have to kill for you.
Abandoned by my wife, addicted to morphine, shamed by my family.<eos> Not shamed, no.<eos> - You pity me.<eos> - I respect you!<eos> Don't patronize me, Miss Phinney.<eos> I vowed to help you.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Angel of mercy.<eos> And I am doing my best to care for you.
Is that why you enjoy it?<eos> Because it reminds you of home?<eos> Is every dying boy another chance to save your husband?<eos> Are you...<eos> - I'm...<eos> No!<eos> That's enough.<eos> I will not be here this evening.<eos> There is a ball at the Green home I must attend.<eos> Sister Isabelle will look in on you.
Is she with child?<eos> Pennyroyal wouldn't cause this much bleeding.<eos> I found a metal rod on the floor.<eos> Dear God.<eos> Not the bravest soldier, but perhaps the wisest.<eos> What in God's name is this infernal concoction?<eos> Imperial raspberry whiskey punch.<eos> The punch is in the nose.<eos> I think someone stole the whiskey from the medical supply cabinet.<eos> Gentlemen, uh, I have been harboring something for quite awhile now that I feel compelled to share with you.
No, but we could use The Ritgen Approach.<eos> I observed it once while in Berlin.<eos> Or was it Rutgen?<eos> Not a tall man.<eos> He introduced an abdominal incision to gain subperitoneal access to the uterus, from which we could repair the perforation.<eos> - Cut her open?<eos> - Yes. - She'll die.<eos> - Most likely.<eos> Of course, if we do nothing, she'll be dead within the hour.<eos> As you said, I'm in no condition to consult on medical matters. So I leave it to you.
"Ben Franklin"?<eos> Want to do the talking next time, be my guest.<eos> Halt!<eos> What kind of pals are you?<eos> I got to find out from my sister?<eos> Jimmy, quiet!<eos> You've been back for days and never said a word, and on top of it --<eos> is that my shirt you got on? Quiet!<eos> You'll get us all shot!<eos> - I'm coming with you.
Previously on "Billions"...<eos> The key to bagging Axe is Dollar Bill Stearn.<eos> Bill Stearn bribed the Pepsum researcher for proprietary information for a drug called Vaccarizine.<eos> I wanna put him on the rack and stretch him until he gives us Axe.<eos> The good news is this...<eos> when you get out of there, you're starting at $1.4, easy.<eos> - Better news...<eos> I'll hire you.<eos> - I'm staying.<eos> Still, Wendy's making things difficult for you.
Summers out here enough to make you long for martial law. You remember what it's like.<eos> - Ah, sorry to hear it.<eos> - Ah, don't be.<eos> It'd be better if, in addition to the college kids and regular dirtbags, I didn't have my billionaires punching out my multimillionaires.<eos> It's bad for business.<eos> Well, that's why we're here, to make your life easier.<eos> We wanna quash this thing.<eos> No need for news stories. No need for undue chatter.<eos> Sure. Of course.<eos> I lift the rug, and you guys sweep?
There are no innocent men, not on Wall Street.<eos> So you won't act to protect the source? No.<eos> Not... not this way.<eos> If you don't play back at him, he'll find the guy.<eos> That's how this is gonna play out.<eos> Axelrod is gonna be with your guy in a room, just the two of them, sitting there, and he's gonna be staring right the fuck through him.<eos> Maybe by the end of today.<eos> But you know what?<eos> Maybe it's not my game anymore.<eos> Yeah, maybe it's you young guys, eating your salads and remaking the world.
Michael is alive.<eos> I saw.<eos> He wants us to help his... his wife and his family escape.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> And after that, he'll be gone, and we'll never see him again.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Mr. Myers, when you arrive in Bassek, find reverend Antreassian.<eos> He'll arrange the boats for you, and tell him we'll be along with the rest of the orphans as soon as we can.
Reverend Antreassian?<eos> Hello. - We are from the American mission.<eos> Hello. We were told to meet you in Bassek.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Faruk pasha sent orders that we were to be evacuated to Aleppo.<eos> Mayor Stepan announced that we would not obey the turks.<eos> We have brought the orphans with us.<eos> You need to come with us.<eos> We will care for you.
They appeared to be retreating.<eos> So then... - Enough.<eos> Mobilize the third division and the artillery.<eos> French Naval Fleet Malta<eos> Admiral.<eos> Admiral Fournet?<eos> I'm Christopher Myers with the Associated press.<eos> I'm told that you plan to investigate the plight of the Armenians on the turkish coast.<eos> - That is restricted information.<eos> Would you permit me to sail with you?
- I'm fine as I am.<eos> You just take it one step at a time.<eos> Whichever way you can.<eos> Now, this here's DC Whelan.<eos> She's going to be your point of contact.<eos> Anything and everything, you just ask her.<eos> Er, you can call me Bethany.<eos> Do we plan a funeral or...?<eos> Well, sometimes it can take a while for us to release the body.<eos> Would one of you be willing to come and identify her?
You're right.<eos> Do you know his name or anything?<eos> No. Salesman or businessman, or something.<eos> He travelled the area.<eos> Type who'd sweep in with a bottle of wine and then not turn up for another month.<eos> - Did you talk to the local lass?<eos> - No.<eos> But our victim talked to her neighbour about you.<eos> Some businessman turns up once a month with a bottle of plonk and a meal for two.<eos> So what were the pair of you up to?
So what do we think?<eos> On something or she just upset?<eos> Told me she'd been clean since treatment.<eos> Double-check their accounts of where they both were.<eos> I mean, why would Mam book into a guesthouse if she's staying with her daughter?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Forensics.<eos> They're saying they've found the "lady's mantle"?<eos> That a euphemism, is it?<eos> Do neither of you know what that is?
Oh, no, don't you worry.<eos> We're gonna keep you safe from now on.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Everything's gonna go back to normal, okay?<eos> Okay. [Sighs]<eos> ♪ The kid was in a basement for 10 years.<eos> Is his brain mashed potatoes or what?<eos> This is a human-interest story.<eos> One of you please make me cry.<eos> The rest of you, work the governor's side, Warren's platform.
- Maine Tech... forensic science.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We've been pulling all-nighters trying to beta this baby...<eos> tracking microchip.<eos> This one's bioengineered to graft with human cells.<eos> It's gonna be huge. I mean, I haven't stopped...<eos> Oh. You know what?<eos> But, actually, my focus is more on DNA analysis.<eos> I heard you guys did the I.D. test on Adam Warren.
Yeah, I get why you thought it was such a bad idea.<eos> I'm glad I stayed at Berkeley.<eos> It's all good now.<eos> Actually, there's just one little thing to clear the air.<eos> Um, Sully tried to make out with me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Really, guys?<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> My boss called me in early because he said some idiots were having a party out on the golf course and they trashed the 16th tee.<eos> And that was you?
You've ignored my letters and cards.<eos> I should be capaciously insulted but for my understanding of your... unique nature.<eos> My dear, dear Miss Ives. My heart is saddened to see you in these lowered circumstances, amongst the spiders and flies.<eos> Shall we not at least try to bring you back to the mammalian community?<eos> There was a time in my life... when I fell into a state of ennui beyond compare.<eos> I was quite divorced from the man I was or wanted to be.<eos> But my... unique nature... left me feeling loathed and loathsome.<eos> And then I was introduced to a woman who saved my life.<eos> A mental doctor of a sort.<eos> I was skeptical but the proof is in the pudding, and here I sit before you... resplendently who I am,
Yours sincerely, Malcolm Murray.<eos> Sir, money for my baby.<eos> Money. Yes.<eos> - Here. - More!<eos> You're a rich Briton.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I let you fuck me.<eos> Any way you want, John Bull. No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Maybe I let them fuck you, John Bull!
Yes.<eos> My name is Vanessa Ives.<eos> I was referred by a friend.<eos> He said I ought to come.<eos> Oh, lovely. Yes.<eos> Well, do sit down.<eos> Be back in two shakes.<eos> This way, Miss Ives.<eos> Make yourself at home, please.<eos> I'll be with you in a second.
Then why did you say small?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Politeness, I suppose.<eos> Is it impolite to have money?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I don't care about politeness.<eos> There are no manners here.<eos> If you want to scream like an animal, you should.<eos> Or cry. Or yell.<eos> There are no emotions unwelcome in this room, and if this process doesn't appeal to you, the door is there.
There are no manners here.<eos> If you want to scream like an animal, you should.<eos> Or cry. Or yell.<eos> There are no emotions unwelcome in this room, and if this process doesn't appeal to you, the door is there.<eos> You don't want me to leave.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I scratch my hand.<eos> You find that telling.<eos> Of what?<eos> Those phobias that interest you.
You're unhappy. You're isolated.<eos> You think you're the cause of this unhappiness and are unworthy of affection so you've few friends.<eos> Recently you lost something you think very important.<eos> Your lover, your faith, your family, or all three.<eos> You blame yourself for this, so it makes you neurotic, and you don't sleep and don't eat anything healthy anyway.<eos> You used to take care of your appearance, but you've lost interest in that, so you avoid mirrors.<eos> Sunlight bothers you, so you avoid that too, about which you're guilty because you think it's unhealthy and even immoral not to like the sun.<eos> You're not a woman of convention or you wouldn't be here, but you like to pretend you are so people don't notice you.<eos> But you sometimes like that as well, and can dress to draw the eye.<eos> But then you think the men who look at you are fools, or worse, to be taken in by such an obvious outward show.
Thank you, Miss Ives.<eos> I do hope you'll enjoy the exhibits.<eos> All the dusty cases.<eos> Give them a glance.<eos> They repay the effort.<eos> Good day to you.<eos> Good day. Good day. October the 6th, 1892.<eos> My dear Sir Malcolm, where this letter shall find you, I don't know.<eos> I hope, on some far-flung adventure.<eos> I don't want this to cause you any alarm, but I've not been entirely honest in my previous letters.
I, alone, understand the sins you have committed.<eos> The pain you carry.<eos> But all your life you have run from this pain. You ran from your father. You ran from your tribe.<eos> Tonight... you stop running.<eos> Tonight, you accept the destiny that God has granted.<eos> I will do whatever I need to, to save her.<eos> Promises he has made.<eos> Delicious promises.<eos> Tasty morsels I shall have.<eos> None more tasty than you, my dear.
But they're always watching me.<eos> Take my hand, please.<eos> I have sinned here, Mother.<eos> I have smoked opium with yellow devils and planted my seed in unworthy whores.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Yes.<eos> Please, take me to your master.<eos> You know, I wish we had been friends, you and I.<eos> If I had known a friend like you in my life, I mightn't have ended this way.
Walk down that corridor and open any door.<eos> "Monstrous" you may call it, but I'll continue my work until I cure every inmate in this wretched place.<eos> And then you'd be happy?<eos> And then you'd get the acclaim and affection that's eluded you your whole life?<eos> Yes!<eos> If you think scientific achievement will bring you acceptance or even esteem, an entree into proper society, you're deluding yourself.<eos> That's not the world we live in.<eos> I create my own world.<eos> I create my own self.<eos> And one day, one day, all of you will understand that of which I am capable.
This whole block's been condemned, so God knows what we'll discover.<eos> But whatever happens...<eos> Find Vanessa.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> Yes.<eos> You take the front.<eos> Kaetenay and I will find our own way in.<eos> You're sure that's wise?<eos> We work best alone.<eos> It has been an honor to hunt with you.
We know our way around random gunplay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sir Malcolm.<eos> It can be no other.<eos> And your name is known to me as well.<eos> One of them at least.<eos> They are many, my names, like the carrion circling Golgotha.<eos> Dracula, then.<eos> And you've come freely into the dragon's cave.<eos> All of you.
What does this one say?<eos> Same as the others...<eos> "Are you ready to play?"<eos> What does that mean?<eos> In the last nine months, this guy, this "Mr. X," has stolen $5 million from two of our biggest clients.<eos> We don't know who he is. We don't know what he looks like.<eos> But he knows us because before both jobs he sent us the same e-mail...<eos> "Are you ready to play?"<eos> He finds a malcontent in our clients' firm to copy confidential files to a hard drive. And then he trades the drive for a briefcase full of cash.<eos> But why is he targeting you?
You don't like him, do you?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> No, no.<eos> Look, it's not that. It's just...<eos> I'm grumpy, okay?<eos> So please don't take this the wrong way. But like your sister said, this really isn't a great time, exposure-wise, to be bringing someone new into our inner circle.<eos> At least wait until we catch the jerk who's after me.<eos> What about the next jerk or the jerk after that?<eos> God, Vincent, I'm just saying, if I have to wait to have a normal life until you guys...
Hey, get in line.<eos> Hey.<eos> Helping me is the only reason that you're not turning into a stuffy, out-of-the-loop captain that we have always hated.<eos> I get you back out on the street, I get you back in the action.<eos> Admit it, you miss this.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> All right, maybe a little bit, but, um, I don't miss this kind of action.<eos> What are we even doing here?<eos> JT traced the hack to the Durbrige Hotel, so, hopefully, we will find the hacker, and then whoever's after Vincent.<eos> It's never that easy, especially with you two.
- Suck up.<eos> - I do not know how to even begin to thank you guys.<eos> I mean, you saved me, my family, the witnesses.<eos> I am curious, though.<eos> How come that helicopter didn't take off?<eos> Everybody has secrets, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Whatever it is, it's safe with me, believe me.<eos> I owe you. What about you?
And then all the other bad guys...<eos> Will be after me now, too, wanting to know where I hid their witnesses.<eos> I'm exposed... to the world.<eos> Guess I have to go into hiding now, right?<eos> Anyways, thanks you guys so much, really.<eos> If we're not careful, that could happen to us some day.<eos> In a bombshell reveal, Bootsy Durbrige, daughter of real estate mogul Franklin Durbrige, has been secretly working with the FBI to house and protect federal witnesses, which has put her own highly privileged life in danger.<eos> Heath, what are you doing here?<eos> Feeling annoyed, that's what.<eos> I called Tess looking for you, found out that that's you guys.
You all read the articles.<eos> You know I made those trades after the first tower was hit, before we knew it was terrorism, before I knew my whole firm was gonna die.<eos> That's your fucking excuse?<eos> No.<eos> What the papers didn't say is that I kept trading after the South Tower was hit, too.<eos> In fact, that's when I stepped on the gas.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Am I a politician now?<eos> I'm not running and hiding.<eos> I am standing right here, telling you,
He's an ornament. An ornamental waste of space.<eos> You would have been the real President.<eos> What?<eos> I'm serious, Mells.<eos> If Fitz would've won, I have no doubt it would've been you calling the shots.<eos> You were always the one who had the ideas.<eos> You made him.<eos> It should've been you out there, running for President... Not this... This dolt, this mannequin.<eos> It's not too late, you know?<eos> For you.

Mellie and I are partners.<eos> James... we may not be living the love story<eos> America wants to fantasize about, but that does not take away from the fact that the two of us are a match.<eos> We respect each other, we want the same thing, and we want it with the same intensity.<eos> We want a house.<eos> We want the house.<eos> I need one more shot.<eos> I know it seems unfair, but...<eos> I can't give up, James.<eos> Of course I wish I could be with you, but you don't want to be with a man who's given up on his dream.
"Madame President."<eos> Mellie's running for President.<eos> James Novak wrote a piece in the Post.<eos> Did you read it?<eos> I was busy.<eos> In what world does she think she can be President?<eos> She's doing it out of spite.<eos> It's a dig.<eos> Everything that woman does is a dig.<eos> It's not always about you.

- Because I'm sick of seeing you like this.<eos> - Like what?<eos> You used to be a big dog, and now...<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Now I barely recognize you.<eos> - I get it, Liv.<eos> - You don't.<eos> I lost!<eos> You wanted the Oval, and I didn't give it to you.<eos> No, I didn't give it to you!
Yes, Congresswoman.<eos> I-I appreciate that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's happening?<eos> It's being brought to the floor.<eos> This bill is becoming a law.<eos> I need a minute.<eos> I will stick by you, no matter what decision you make, but you never gave that man a chance.<eos> It's been two years, Abby.<eos> We can't all be you and David.
I don't blame him for losing.<eos> I know...<eos> You blame yourself.<eos> You look at him, and you see your own failure, and it disgusts you.<eos> I never told him to go on TV.<eos> He did that on his own.<eos> He chose being a celebrity over making a difference, over me.<eos> He's a politician, Liv.<eos> He needs the attention, validation.<eos> He wasn't getting it from you, so he went on TV to get it from America.
Plus, this whole "I married a gay" thing?<eos> Sally Langston won't be able to get past it.<eos> Neither would you.<eos> The Southern states won't ever let you.<eos> I can't do this, Cyrus.<eos> This is insane!<eos> No. This...<eos> This... is the most harmless, cautious... prudent... thing you could ever do.<eos> In what world?<eos> ! You're never going to fall in love with me, and I'm never going to fall in love with you.
It would have destroyed Fitz. You knew that.<eos> It makes me hate you even more for knowing, for being right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's not...<eos> I'm apologizing.<eos> I'm apologizing because...<eos> I did what I had to do...<eos> What I thought I had to do to win, and now...<eos> Now I am trapped.<eos> Fitz is free with you, and I'm...
Do you think complications ever stopped Fitz?<eos> Why are you really here?<eos> You don't even like me.<eos> I don't like people.<eos> But, believe it or not... I respect you.<eos> You've survived more in this town than anyone could have ever expected.<eos> But giving up a job that's yours?<eos> Because of complications only a man can handle?<eos> That's weak.<eos> If I'd have known you'd back down this easily, I would never have voted for you.
Concession speech at the Lincoln Memorial.<eos> Are you okay? Do you need water?<eos> More pillows maybe?<eos> You're not bleeding on my sheets again, are you?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, he said he's fine.<eos> Is that my robe?<eos> No. Yes. He said it feels like money.<eos> Just wash it when you're done.
You're making a speech this afternoon at the Lincoln Memorial.<eos> I don't need to just roll over and concede anymore, Liv.<eos> All I need to do is sit back and watch the Electoral College make history.<eos> Isn't that wonderful?<eos> No, it's not, because it wouldn't be fair.<eos> Fair?<eos> To whom?<eos> To the country.<eos> To Cyrus.<eos> Mellie, I would be in complete and total agreement with you if it weren't for the people who fixed this election.
Can we talk?<eos> No.<eos> Matter of fact, if I recall correctly, you told me you'd never speak to me again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Well, thanks for that.<eos> That was something, but I've got some things to attend to, so see you around.<eos> Did you hear about the elector in Virginia?<eos> The one talking about going faithless.<eos> There's a chance he may switch his vote from Mellie to you.
So, what did Olivia want?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Olivia Pope.<eos> I heard she was in the White House.<eos> To talk.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Sorry, my mind is in this speech I have to give at CPAC tomorrow.<eos> Don't you think it's a little strange that one day Olivia's moving heaven and earth to bury Cyrus, and now, all of a sudden, she's his champion?<eos> I hadn't thought about it.<eos> She didn't mention anything to you?
You don't want to believe that.<eos> These people can't win.<eos> They've already won!<eos> If Cyrus Beene becomes President, they will kill you!<eos> You have to stand down, Olivia.<eos> I won't quit.<eos> I will win.<eos> There is no winning.<eos> There's simply life and death.<eos> I remain useful to these people because I assume they believe I maintain a certain level of influence over you.
I picked his daughter up from school and his clothes from off the floor.<eos> And at night, I cried myself to sleep in an empty bed because the man I vowed to have and to hold couldn't be bothered to have me or to hold me.<eos> So, no, Cyrus Beene did not end Frankie Vargas's life, but he ruined mine.<eos> And for that, he doesn't have my vote.<eos> Well, there you have it, folks.<eos> Michael Ambruso, in his own words, telling the world that "till death do us part"<eos> ends at the ballot box.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> Cyrus was in jail because of a lie, and you just used his family to destroy him.<eos> It wasn't me... or Elizabeth because, like you, she just called, asking if I had done it, which I hadn't.
Karen?<eos> Your... Your proper channels of law and precedent and decency?<eos> They don't care!<eos> Mellie!<eos> Breathe!<eos> We are going to get you out of here.<eos> I have to go. Don't...<eos> Don't go.<eos> Jake is here.<eos> Jake will take care of you.
Do you have anything stronger than this?<eos> Olivia, what the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> What's necessary.<eos> It's the only way to prevent Mellie from becoming President and to keep these people from getting what they've been after the entire time.<eos> If I go down, so does she, so do they.<eos> You've made the ultimate sacrifice, Cyrus.<eos> It's time I do the same.<eos> I can't let you do this.<eos> You don't have a choice, Mr. President.<eos> The Deputy Bureau Chief just came into my office and told me that Olivia Pope is not being arrested and that he is now leading the investigation, reporting directly to you.
Tennessee votes with the following result...<eos> Mellie Grant.<eos> All of it.<eos> North Dakota votes with the following result...<eos> Mellie Grant.<eos> California votes with the following result...<eos> Mellie Grant.<eos> I told you to leave my father alone!<eos> I told you!<eos> And for some reason, you find it very hard to believe that if I had to choose between you and him, you will lose!
The Metro section.<eos> Leo, I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Just...<eos> tell me what I did. Nothing.<eos> That means it's something I didn't do.<eos> Did I forget to put the...<eos> Not everything is about you.
You want some coffee?<eos> Nope.<eos> Is Quinn coming in today?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's why I'm asking.<eos> Well, it seems like you two are all up in each other's business lately.<eos> But I haven't even been here.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Quinn's been fluffing your pillow and climbing into bed with you.
Two more questions.<eos> Ashley.<eos> Here's your statement on your new VP.<eos> Stick to it, don't take any questions, and, you know, have fun with it.<eos> Let's see that winning Mellie smile of yours.<eos> Mr. President, such an honor.<eos> The President-Elect and I are so thrilled you're allowing us to make such an historic announcement.<eos> You can cut the act. I know who you are and what you've done.<eos> Great. Then we won't have to waste any time pretending that you're in charge here.<eos> This game ends badly for you. We'll make sure of it.
You know those women with the headbands and the little cardigans that match their shoes.<eos> They wear the pearls, super nice?<eos> Like to throw dinner parties?<eos> Exactly.<eos> I used to think that my life would be better, easier, if I could be attracted to a headband kind of woman.<eos> They're so supportive, quiet, cheerful... easy, you know?<eos> I'd think to myself, "Why can't I fall for one of them?"<eos> Yeah.<eos> The thing is, every single time I run into one of those wives wearing her headband, perfectly content to stand in her husband's shadow and do as she's told, all I want to do is say, "What the hell happened to you, lady?<eos> There's nothing wrong with you, David.
I owned the Oval.<eos> You were above the Oval.<eos> Shall we open another?<eos> Good idea.<eos> Something lighter this time?<eos> Maybe a Pinot Noir?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no!<eos> A Grenache.<eos> Dealer's choice.<eos> It has to feel a little worse for you, though.
Dealer's choice.<eos> It has to feel a little worse for you, though.<eos> Worse?<eos> This feeling... Being reduced to nothing, seeing those teeth dull.<eos> Natural evolution...<eos> The fiercest predators are always the most susceptible to change.<eos> The slightest shift in the food chain, and... They're wiped out forever.<eos> I can't believe that the United States Government has an '87 Andres.<eos> Gift from the French PM. Mm.<eos> What I always liked about you, why we always got along, was at our core, we wanted the same things.
You're telling me you can't get to the President...<eos> His own Chief of Staff...<eos> Even after the situation has been cleared?<eos> I don't make these rules up.<eos> Believe it or not, there are things out of your control in the White House even at my level.<eos> Not when I'm running things.<eos> And if you're lying to me, if you're daring to mess with me by keeping me here for any reason...<eos> You'll kill Leo?<eos> We're not together anymore.<eos> I'd point you to my friends, but thanks to you, I've lost them, too, so threaten me all you want.
No, keep chewing.<eos> My point is, I don't want to act like you're worrying about nothing.<eos> I don't blame you for feeling threatened.<eos> You saw something.<eos> It was love.<eos> But it wasn't this kind of love.<eos> Quinn-and-Charlie love.<eos> Look, I didn't want to lose Huck.<eos> I never want to lose Huck.<eos> You...
You can hop on a boat, sail out to some island... disappear.<eos> Well, that's just not gonna happen, is it?<eos> It's a legitimate offer.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> But even if it were, I'm not a person who gets to disappear.<eos> Far too valuable to my employer.<eos> He makes it his business to know where I am every minute of every hour of every day.<eos> The only way I disappear is by a bullet.<eos> Either yours or his.<eos> And if I were to trust you?
I know I've done terrible things, but...<eos> She was my friend, and you murdered her.<eos> I was doing my job.<eos> Your job?<eos> Your job?<eos> Listen to me when I tell you this.<eos> I hate you.<eos> All of this, this "you and me"...<eos> That was me doing my job.<eos> Everything I've done with you, everything I've done to you, has been...
Always have.<eos> And at times like these, Americans are dying right now, and there's nothing I can do about it. This will be my legacy.<eos> Eight years in office.<eos> All history will remember me for is the body count.<eos> And your sex scandal.<eos> And that.<eos> I could have done better.<eos> I could have been better.<eos> I know that.<eos> Well... good for you for learning something.
I have already called a car to the South Portico.<eos> It's over.<eos> It's not over.<eos> Olivia...<eos> It's not over!<eos> You have never been and never will be anyone's puppet.<eos> You are about to be the first female president of the United States.<eos> Do you have any idea how incredible that is?<eos> How impossible?<eos> They almost handed this job to a man who had been in prison over giving it to you.
Dad, what are you doing?<eos> I'll force a meeting with Peus, let him lead us to the drones.<eos> Congratulations, Eli.<eos> You've been emancipated.<eos> He's on the move.<eos> That's where you come in.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Who's next...<eos> Miami?<eos> You.
From where you'll be standing, there is no place for others, for love.<eos> It's easy to say before you have power, but then you have it.<eos> And your head begins to expand, telling you that you can do anything, that you deserve everything, that you have earned the right to happiness, to love, to family, that you may now break the one golden rule.<eos> And that's when you know that you've failed.<eos> That's why I must go away, because otherwise you will end up risking your place at the pinnacle of power for me.<eos> More coffee?<eos> Remove yourself.<eos> I'll take some.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm not you.

You can't just walk away from me.<eos> You haven't even been here Our bank accounts, client folders, high-level contacts.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Leading this firm means going up against the White House sometimes.<eos> In eight days, that'll mean going up against me.<eos> I needed to know that you could handle that. What?<eos> This was a test?<eos> This was a test.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.
Of course we are.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll send you everything we have so far.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> It only matters that you like it.<eos> Okay. Let's get to work.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - I can come with you.
Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you? !<eos> Don't you, baby? !<eos> Don't you? Don't you remember?<eos> And there it is.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Tell me I don't look as old as you.
You look good.<eos> You've been taking good care of yourself. Been on my "Eat, Pray, Love" ish.<eos> As much as I would like to hear about, but, as you say, tick, tock.<eos> How have you been? As if you didn't know.<eos> I don't.<eos> - Livvie out there?<eos> - No. Can I talk to her?<eos> She doesn't want to talk to you. She wouldn't be happy if she knew you were treating me this way.<eos> Shackled, locked up with no food or water...<eos> Olivia wants nothing to do with you.

She wouldn't be happy if she knew you were treating me this way.<eos> Shackled, locked up with no food or water...<eos> Olivia wants nothing to do with you.<eos> She sees you for what you are... A woman with no integrity, no values, whose beliefs shift with the changing wind.<eos> That's you talking, not her.<eos> Maybe I could convince her to speak with you against her better judgment.
Does it?<eos> Yes! Can I not make up for that?<eos> Tell me. Because if people cannot make up for their mistakes, I would've kept my ass at home instead of coming here and risking the one thing I know I love...<eos> My freedom... to try and do something good for my daughter.<eos> Did you tell them about Sandra?<eos> Sandra.<eos> The one that got away. The broad with the Afro puffs you went to graduate school with.<eos> The one I always knew you were comparing me to whenever I didn't care to hear about some prehistoric penguin you were about to dig up.<eos> Her. That's how they got to you.<eos> They found her, used her against you.
Dad.<eos> Couldn't do it.<eos> Couldn't let them take her.<eos> I'll let her go eventually, just not now.<eos> Mom will say anything to crawl under your skin and get what she wants.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> You have to go back in there.<eos> You're the only one who can break her.<eos> She's in custody. She can't hurt you. Convince your candidate to take the swearingin underground and be done with your mother for good.<eos> It's what's best for you.
And it burned. Every place I'd been punched burned.<eos> But then I understood.<eos> I understood because the Secret Service agent standing next to me erupted in a spray of blood.<eos> I saw the bullet hit him, and I knew what was happening to me.<eos> And then I got hit here.<eos> I don't remember anything at all after that.<eos> So, yes.<eos> If it were up to me, if canceling this inauguration meant that I could spare the mother of my children experiencing any of that, or worse...<eos> I would. But's it not up to me.<eos> It's up to you.
It's okay.<eos> I'm here now.<eos> Dad told me everything.<eos> I looked him in the eye.<eos> He believes you.<eos> I believe you.<eos> You're just trying to help. You're just trying to figure out who's behind the attack on the inauguration, too, right?<eos> Yes, baby.<eos> You're doing this for me.<eos> I'm doing this for you.
I thought you'd be stoked for me.<eos> I am, I am, it's just, um...<eos> I don't want to see you get hurt.<eos> All right, so, you're saying just... slow things down?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Play it cool.<eos> My man.<eos> All right. Okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> These last two months have been amazing, and I justI keep thinking about spending the rest of my life with you.
Who the hell are you?<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> We'll put "needs improvement."<eos> Would you agree that your worst qualities are clinginess, painfully naive, and overly emotional?<eos> No, I wouldn't, what where the hell am I?<eos> Exit interview.<eos> Wait, did you not get debriefed?<eos> Debriefed?<eos> Please watch this informational video.<eos> Hi, I'm Matthew Maker, Founder and CEO of MakeAMatch, and I'd like to say thank you, because it's biogenetic love companions like you that make what we do possible.
Manhattan, born and raised.<eos> You know he hasn't eaten in days?<eos> Christ.<eos> We need to get him to open up.<eos> Sad bro, you okay over there?<eos> If you could be any animal, what kind of animal would you be?<eos> I'd be a shark, 'cause they never stop moving.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> But you know what, enough about me, right?<eos> Let's talk about you.
Every day is brighter than the last.<eos> MakeAMatch is too good to be true, but it is true, and it is good.<eos> Eskimo kiss.<eos> Okay!<eos> Get a lot of those.<eos> Adam?<eos> Adam.<eos> Adam.<eos> Adam!<eos> I'm proud of you, son.
The threat has been eliminated.<eos> And those missiles you have... Earth and Mars have pointed those damn things at each other for over a hundred years.<eos> - So let's give them back.<eos> - Yes. Returning them will show that the Belt is ready to lead the peace.<eos> James Holden, huh?<eos> Beratna.<eos> You see, one by one, the best Earth has to offer us are coming to our fight!<eos> But I think he's idealist, my friend.<eos> And idealism is a luxury of the Inner Planets.<eos> But I agree with you about the missiles.
Seven UN marines...<eos> Yeah, they were charging at us. They were firing at us. They...<eos> I saw ships engaging in orbit.<eos> And the Blues, they were closing in on us fast.<eos> Fucking Earth has attacked us.<eos> They want a war?<eos> We'll give them a goddamn war.<eos> Oh, I could use one of these.<eos> Guarding the docks on Ceres.<eos> I don't think the Martians will give you one.
Captain Martens.<eos> - Chaplain?<eos> - Hmm. When I marked my 2790 as "none",<eos> I was serious.<eos> Well, don't worry, I'm not here to proselytize.<eos> You went through something pretty horrible down there, whatever you're feeling is okay.<eos> I'm a marine.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> You know, I served with your father.<eos> He would have been very proud of you.
What do you think it saw?<eos> What did you see, Bobbie?<eos> I can't remember. Okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We can help you with that.<eos> Assistant Director of Operations.<eos> You've come a long way since the loading docks on Ceres, eh, mali?<eos> You don't get to call me that anymore, Pampaw.<eos> From what people tell me, you're the one really running things around here.<eos> We need you back home.
I'll see how my day goes.<eos> We should put eyes on Dobbs and Marino in case they try to book.<eos> Billets is going to pitch a fit about extra bodies on overtime.<eos> You're already in the doghouse.<eos> I'll write it up if you pretend it was your idea.<eos> Swell.<eos> Love that holiday vibe, all the festive traditions.<eos> Those special smells.<eos> Detective, Chief would like a word.<eos> I'm guessing he means you.
He's smart, loyal.<eos> He's a pretty damn good detective if you push past the dark part.<eos> Plays it too close to the edge for my taste, but okay.<eos> He gets results.<eos> Where is this going, Jimmy?<eos> Well, I can't stop asking myself what Bosch knows about Gunn he isn't telling us.<eos> Ask him.<eos> Have you?<eos> This doesn't get us to who killed the man, Jimmy. Come on.<eos> Nobody wants to be in a position where the guy who's got your back - can't be straight with you.

Marissa, say the magic words.<eos> And anyway, it's one of your cops who killed him.<eos> What's the friend's name?<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> See?<eos> Bosch went Dirty Harry on a freak he couldn't convict.<eos> Now it's come out, and he's a walking IVD.<eos> I suggest you duck and cover, amigo.<eos> The shit storm is just starting.<eos> Maybe I should be talking to you about Edward Gunn, Rudy.
Kelsey, we should start thinking about heading to the office.<eos> Kelsey?<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> _<eos> Oh, good, you're here.<eos> Of course.<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> Well, you kinda disappeared last night.<eos> I was worried about you.
Kelsey?<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> _<eos> Oh, good, you're here.<eos> Of course.<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> Well, you kinda disappeared last night.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> What can I help you with?
The fact of your gender identity - is irrelevant to me.<eos> - I'm a woman.<eos> And I applaud that.<eos> Marylynne, thank you so much for meeting with us.<eos> Oh, the pleasure was mine.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So much.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Oh, you're welcome.<eos> Thank you.
Because without it, there is no trust.<eos> And without trust... there is no love.<eos> And that is why I have to confess something extremely difficult to a group of people that I have come to love very much... and to whom I owe so much. And whose forgiveness I wouldn't have the presumption<eos> - to ask for.<eos> - What?<eos> What is it?<eos> - I'm not...<eos> - Going to marry...<eos> Josh. Josh... he proposed, and...<eos> Liza, I know that this has been - really hard for you.
Okay.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> - Mm-hmm. You look nice.<eos> I've gotten so many offers on the book.<eos> The tracking is incredible.<eos> It already has more preorders than the last "Harry Potter."<eos> How is that possible? You don't have a publisher yet.<eos> Well, I can't do the math for you.<eos> The point is, Empirical's offer was not the best. But I do feel comfortable with you.

But I do feel comfortable with you.<eos> Well, and... we will have a-a great team working for you.
Uh, so, did we get the book?<eos> Uh, no, because I don't want to publish it.<eos> - I don't want to contribute to the idea that truth is whatever you're comfortable with.<eos> Even if it means taking a hit to the bottom line.<eos> Right.<eos> Guess I'm just old-fashioned that way.<eos> Hey, uh, do you mind if I steal her? "Vulture" has a few questions.<eos> Uh, no, no, go, go.<eos> Have fun. And, Liza...<eos> I'm proud of you.
Then you would have thought I was an excellent Thai chef.<eos> Yeah, but then we would have gotten caught in a situation where we had to prove it.<eos> And I have you over for dinner one night, and then there's empty Thai containers in the garbage and we're done before we've even had a chance kind of thing?<eos> I'm sorry, uh, Charlie has Luke.<eos> Actually, it's my security system. Just a second.<eos> Hello?<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Okay, I'll be right there.<eos> The alarm in my apartment's going off, so I just need to...<eos> - I-I'll come with you.
Swimming in surgeries.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I love it.<eos> You didn't have anything to do with these, did you?<eos> Are you working with Dr. Harris today?<eos> I am.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, I need to appoint an Interim Chief.<eos> Dr. Harris ran a tight ship before his accident.<eos> Have you heard why he didn't reclaim his position after he recovered? No.<eos> And I can't report on people for you.
Not even close.<eos> Just...<eos> Never mind.<eos> Forget about it.<eos> Go home.<eos> You need sleep.<eos> I'm not gonna sleep anyway.<eos> Well, I'd sure hope that anybody who might be doing surgery on me hadn't spent the previous night in an uncomfortable chair.<eos> Tests aren't something to bunk in the hospital for.<eos> If this turns out to be serious, I might need you, and you don't owe me that many days.
Felix?<eos> Poop on a stoop, we don't even know what the plan is.<eos> The plan is to sit tight.<eos> - Sit tight in a national park?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Right, with Sarah stranded and Kira missing, and no word from Cosima?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Well, get packing, mister.<eos> Bell.<eos> I got a present for you.
There is a child, and she has cancer. I've seen others like her brought here for some experimental treatment.<eos> - What does this have to do with...<eos> - Rachel is ramping up their agenda.<eos> And this has something to do with it.<eos> It's time.<eos> There's a clinic across the camp with a red cross on the door.<eos> This is the key. Okay?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> I hid your treatment in the back of a fridge.<eos> It's ready. I'll find you and Charlotte.
- Here you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... so we're actually up from where we were?<eos> All right, so you can work with that.<eos> Right.<eos> Excuse me, can you sign for these?<eos> Oh, yeah, of course.<eos> Hey.<eos> These are for you.
It's on sale.<eos> We need to Hygge my place up.<eos> Okay, who needs a pillow this big?<eos> Oh, that's a body pillow.<eos> You know, for girls who can't get a man.<eos> I obviously don't need one since I have Richard to cuddle with.<eos> And when I say "cuddle," I actually mean...<eos> That's nice.<eos> I miss cuddling.<eos> It's too bad about you and Josh.
Yep, I got it.<eos> Oh, no, I don't have any star anise.<eos> Oh, here.<eos> Use, um, caraway seeds.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - We're out of, uh...<eos> - Oh, Havarti and Grinzola.<eos> - I know this is a Hygge party, and it's supposed to be relaxing, but it's hard to be relaxed when your guest of honor is late.<eos> I'll call him.<eos> It's easy to see why Diana leans on you so much.

- Yeah, great, fantastic.<eos> Well, come here.<eos> I'll show you my stuff. Okay.<eos> Look, I know you don't want my advice, but are you sure it's a good idea to let Colin back into your life?<eos> What? From the minute you guys got here, he has been all over Charles.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I-I don't trust him.<eos> Oh, you don't trust him.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Okay, I'm only saying this because I care about you.

He doesn't actually come anymore.<eos> He just beams in.<eos> I'm honored to be in the presence of some of the greatest minds in the publishing industry.<eos> I hope you all came here ready to give and open to receive.<eos> Boomer's a little creepy, am I right?<eos> Said the woman who's talking to herself.<eos> If there's anything you need, don't hesitate to ask your Boomer Bots.<eos> Panels begin in the morning, so... have fun tonight.<eos> - To you!<eos> - To you.
- Well, boot and rally.<eos> - No, boot and go home.<eos> What is the problem, Liza?<eos> Isn't this part of the fun?<eos> You get to relive your glory years. You get to pretend to be 27 again.<eos> When I was 27, I was married with a kid.<eos> I was boring.<eos> This is the drunkest I've been in my entire life.<eos> I love my job, and I think I'm pretty good at it.<eos> And if that isn't good enough for you, then maybe this isn't working.
You are just full of surprises, huh?<eos> But they're cool surprises, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Here it is.<eos> - Cool, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Has my baby showed you her art before?<eos> Mom, let's dial it down from an 11 to a 4.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not allowed to be proud of you?
I mean, hey, I'm... I paint on things.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> I've been very up front about that.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hmm. - Are we good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're good.<eos> Hello, Liza Miller?<eos> Hey, smut lover.<eos> I did a think, and it turns out I do have someone for you.
Come on, it's not bothering you that he's screwing a girl that's working in your loft?<eos> Okay, fine, one drink.<eos> But no weird hipster places where you have to walk through a fake barbershop to get to the bar.<eos> Don't worry, we'll go to one of your places.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Old, that's what you meant.<eos> They're only old to Work Liza.<eos> That guy at the bar, he's perfect for Real Liza.<eos> He is hot.<eos> And he... he's totally hitting on you.
No!<eos> It was in her will.<eos> I'm just teasing.<eos> You know, like you and your friends over there making fun of the old guy sitting alone at the bar.<eos> We weren't making fun of you.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> I did the same thing when I was your age.<eos> You never think you're gonna get this old.<eos> I'm 41.<eos> And I was flirting with you.
Exactly how much is your clothing allowance?<eos> Now, that is so sexist.<eos> You would never ask a woman that question.<eos> I had fun tonight.<eos> You sound surprised.<eos> Not surprised. Staggered.<eos> Shocked, stunned.<eos> Oh, stop flattering me.<eos> I'm this way.<eos> Let me call you and my jacket a lift.
It says it all started because Empirical stole Lachlan Flynn from him.<eos> Oh, he's not gonna like that, is he?<eos> He is not going to care.<eos> It's not fun if it doesn't hurt a little.<eos> Really?<eos> Is that a rule?<eos> FYI, LL Moore is giving us some pushback on our offer. So that Labradoodle money is really coming at the right time.<eos> - Happy to help. - And I...<eos> - I heard about your Twitter feud.<eos> And I have to say, I think it's unwise, swapping insults in public. So I would shut that down if I were you.
Smaller ones here.<eos> Mm, oh, and this!<eos> I mean, this is... Just... mm!<eos> I mean, that's amazing.<eos> She paints, she cooks.<eos> Can we speak honestly?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> I love your art.<eos> And I'm going to hang it no matter how you feel about this.<eos> But I'm also really interested in you.
You were in school together?<eos> Yeah, we were in the eating club.<eos> - Charles!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> This'll be good.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> - Hey, Jay.<eos> - What's up, Upchuck?<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> - Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.<eos> - Liza.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Liza and I met at Bonfire.<eos> You know, Millennial is creating a lot of good buzz for Empirical.<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, her team is doing great things.<eos> - Proud of them.<eos> - Fostering young talent.<eos> Proud of you.
I'm meeting Bill Merriman from Penguin.<eos> Ah.<eos> Great.<eos> - Good to see you. - Enjoy your evening. Good to see you.<eos> Enjoy your evening.<eos> All right.<eos> Liza.<eos> Now, last time he saw me, I was dating a much younger woman.<eos> This confirms your story.<eos> See, I'm good for you.
Were you?<eos> This is time stamped two minutes ago.<eos> How are you DM'ing me while we were actually having sex?<eos> I had a hand free.<eos> Remember?<eos> Okay, that's it.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Or not talk.<eos> I don't care.<eos> But I'm sleeping with you tonight and not your phone.
This is not a game.<eos> This is my life.<eos> Oh, never mind.<eos> Don't call me.<eos> Kelsey, if he did this to you, he is not worth crying over.<eos> I-I'm crying over my job.<eos> Did you see Charles?<eos> He's gonna fire me.<eos> And even if he doesn't, he's never gonna trust me again!<eos> Yes, he will. He cares about you.
- Yeah, exactly.<eos> And I've got 75 people out there whose jobs I suddenly can't guarantee because of her carelessness!<eos> This is not like you to be so angry - before you know the facts.<eos> - You're right.<eos> You're right. You're right.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I don't know how I'm going to replace our biggest earner!<eos> I don't know how I'm going to make payroll next month!<eos> And I don't know why you're dating a 40-something guy in publishing who isn't me!<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

Oh, uh, did he say why?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> This has never happened, not even during Hurricane Sandy when our power went out and he marched his thoroughbred thighs up 40 flights.<eos> So brave.<eos> Kelsey's office is empty too.<eos> Did she run away with her boyfriend, the big game poacher?<eos> She's... working from home today.<eos> Pathetic attempt, Liza.<eos> But after this LL Moore fiasco, I can't blame her for making herself scarce.<eos> This upstate vacay will do wonders for you, dude.
Dude, I knew it.<eos> You knew what?<eos> Wait, clearly, it was my shamanic energy, okay?<eos> I have been shipping you two since you moved in together.<eos> I have been offering you up to the universe as a pair bond, and she has heard me.<eos> Namaste!<eos> Speak English, please.<eos> You're in love with Josh.<eos> Wha... no?<eos> Ah, okay, okay. So wait. He's in love with you, and you're just what?
What did she look like?<eos> Uh, well, um... why?<eos> Uh, did she look like this?<eos> How do you have a picture with Pauline?<eos> Because I was married to her.<eos> Charles, I am so sorry.<eos> I... she...<eos> Pauline...<eos> I just... I didn't know that she was your...<eos> She didn't say anything about you.
- I know which kind you like.<eos> Gummy bears.<eos> - Jacob.<eos> - Hi, Dad.<eos> - Get out!<eos> Get out of here! - I will get my son.<eos> Mr. Barron may be the more natural parent in this case.<eos> Don't worry. Custody almost always goes to the mother.<eos> Unless the mother is me and the father is a manipulative psycho.<eos> I am here for you.
You're burning the eggs.<eos> What?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was just thinking.<eos> Me too.<eos> Will you be mad if the judge says I should go live with my dad?<eos> I mean... I wouldn't be happy.<eos> Would you come live in Myrtle Beach, too?<eos> No. If the judge says I should go with you, where would we live?
And she has shown great reform.<eos> As has Mr. Barron.<eos> All right. I do hereby grant full custody of Jacob Michael Raines to his mother, Leticia Raines, effective immediately.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I commend your reform and your commitment to your son, Mr. Barron.<eos> You will have two weeks visitation every summer as well as every other national holiday until Jacob is 18.<eos> That's all.<eos> I don't know what I did right in there, but I am not gonna question it.<eos> Don't.<eos> I couldn't have gotten him without you.
This is the red wig.<eos> The one you told me never to wear again.<eos> I dyed it black.<eos> I told you I wouldn't throw away an $8,000 wig.<eos> You did.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Somewhere you're not going.<eos> Look, I didn't mean to say we're separate people.<eos> We're not.<eos> I need you.

It takes the will of the wolf to get that boy out of his bed.<eos> He's had all the vaccines.<eos> He's always coming home with only one sock.<eos> Don't know how, but just always make sure you buy the exact same one so you can match different pairs together because it's fucking annoying.<eos> He'll want different colors.<eos> Don't do it. It's a trick.<eos> He gives his lunch away if another kid is hungry, so always make sure you pack him extra.<eos> He thinks he likes sushi, but he doesn't know what it is.<eos> He needs time alone.<eos> Like you.
Silver.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Not really.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> I bet Mom's hungry.<eos> She's always hungry.<eos> But she doesn't know it because she's sleeping.<eos> It's good for her to sleep. She drove all night.<eos> Two nights in a row.<eos> - For you.
Not really.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> I bet Mom's hungry.<eos> She's always hungry.<eos> But she doesn't know it because she's sleeping.<eos> It's good for her to sleep. She drove all night.<eos> Two nights in a row.<eos> - For you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And for you.
- Yeah, she didn't want... Do you take medication?<eos> Do you take medication?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> - You should.<eos> Because I've already told you four times...<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What?<eos> He got away.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> Your mom hasn't always been there for you.
- No, ma'am.<eos> - You should.<eos> Because I've already told you four times...<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What?<eos> He got away.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> Your mom hasn't always been there for you.<eos> I know.<eos> And you're choosing to trust her. I'm proud of you for that.
How did they ID him so fast?<eos> He had an orthopedic screw.<eos> Must've broke his leg when he was in prison.<eos> I wish we burned Miguel in Raul's oven before they turned off the gas.<eos> You dumped him at an abandoned campsite.<eos> It should've been fine.<eos> So they found him... or, part of him.<eos> So what?<eos> It just means he's dead.<eos> It's not gonna come anywhere near you.
It's an open homicide involving a police officer.<eos> I should've never entangled you in this mess.<eos> I entangled myself ten years ago.<eos> And I don't regret a single day of it. I would do...<eos> Go away!<eos> Hey.<eos> Detective Santos, can I please have a conversation with you in the interrogation room?<eos> We're in the middle of something.<eos> It was politely phrased, but it wasn't a request.<eos> It never is with you.
It never is with you.<eos> You can come with me voluntarily and answer a few questions, or you can both hand over your badges right now.<eos> Refusing an Internal Affairs interview is cause for immediate suspension.<eos> You know that, Lieutenant.<eos> You know what they say about gamblers?<eos> It's not the winning they're addicted to.<eos> It's the losing.<eos> I have a few questions for you as well, Lieutenant.<eos> I believe you're both intimately acquainted with the recently deceased Miguel Zepeda.<eos> I know it's been a rough few days for you, but certain evidence has come to my attention that I can't ignore.
You know that.<eos> Taking down the next MayorElect of New York City, a big bust like that can put a woman on the short list for Assistant Director.<eos> You were the one who stalked Harlee's teenage daughter.<eos> You can't come back from that.<eos> Unless it became clear that my actions were about exposing. Harlee for who she truly is, and that she manipulated this whole situation to stop me from doing it.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> A woman's capable of murder, she's capable of just about anything, wouldn't you say?<eos> It turns out Harlee is a pretty scary exgirlfriend.<eos> I know everything, Harlee.<eos> I know Miguel came to you angry, making demands.

He took a shot at cops, after all.<eos> And tried to kill an ADA.<eos> Selfdefense.<eos> From one human being to another, I think you could claim the same thing too.<eos> Selfdefense, justifiable homicide, but know that I have ironclad forensics linking Wozniak to that body.<eos> If I don't hear the truth straight from your mouth, he's facing an obstruction charge.<eos> Well...<eos> You're free to go.<eos> As soon as you confirm Harlee's story.<eos> I have four detectives who can testify that I've cooperated with you for three hours.
Give me a minute, Lieutenant.<eos> Miguel came at Harlee.<eos> She defended herself.<eos> Instead, she panicked and hid the body.<eos> When she thought it was safe, she moved the remains and used lye to accelerate nature.<eos> You wanted to help after the fact.<eos> She refused.<eos> I'm not exactly buying the last part, but, you know, I'll take it with the rest.<eos> Swing and a miss.<eos> Nice playing with you.
I was doing everything I could.<eos> I was risking everything.<eos> But you couldn't save both of us, could you?<eos> Harlee wouldn't let it go.<eos> I mean, come on, Matt.<eos> I always knew it was gonna come down to her or me.<eos> She didn't make you do this.<eos> And somehow I knew it would end up being her.<eos> I would rather die than betray you.<eos> I trusted you.
And somehow I knew it would end up being her.<eos> I would rather die than betray you.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> I loved you.<eos> You still do.<eos> You still do.<eos> Even if you don't know why.<eos> This can stay between us.<eos> It's the best for everyone.<eos> For you, for Nate.
It said that I was meeting you here... time, date, and location, just in case you were planning on solving this problem the same way you solved Miguel.<eos> This isn't about payback, okay?<eos> No gun.<eos> This is about me asking you to make it go away.<eos> This is what you wanted.<eos> If it isn't, why hold onto the silver bullet?<eos> You must have a recording of everything. Wozniak and I said here last night.<eos> That's enough to put me away for a very long time.<eos> But you didn't use it, 'cause you don't want me to go away.<eos> You want me right here in front of you, needing you.

Caddie's death falls at the feet of his own addiction.<eos> Well, that's not a denial.<eos> Just walking through the door gave me the creeps.<eos> Yeah, be careful not to touch any surfaces, especially if there's a picture of Harlee nearby.<eos> This laptop is full of 'em.<eos> This FBI guy has a real stalker vibe.<eos> Framing a man for murder requires evidence.<eos> I've got that covered.<eos> After I found Caddie's body, I searched his place.<eos> For any dirt that might come back on you.
I've got that covered.<eos> After I found Caddie's body, I searched his place.<eos> For any dirt that might come back on you.<eos> You're always looking out for number one, aren't you?<eos> Says the guy who killed Caddie to gain control over me.<eos> He still had the boots that he wore to the cemetery.<eos> The chisel that made dental identification impossible.<eos> Caddie was there for me, and if he could help me right now, he would.<eos> So where's this evidence?<eos> I assume you want me to place it somewhere it can be found, transfer any suspicion away from you.
Good girl.<eos> Good.<eos> Good girl.<eos> Where are we?<eos> It's nice, right?<eos> The owner bought this as an investment property.<eos> Mostly vacation rentals now.<eos> I'll tell you, when the season's over, this place is so quiet and solitary.<eos> Wozniak knew I was meeting you.<eos> Harlee, you had a lot of heat coming down on you from Internal Affairs.
If you really love me...<eos> Save me.<eos> God...<eos> Damn it, Harlee!<eos> Why would you do this to yourself?<eos> Help me.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't stop it.<eos> Help me.<eos> I need you.
A lot.<eos> Chef.<eos> Billy.<eos> One moment, please.<eos> Sit.<eos> Did you really think you could get away with it?<eos> What?<eos> This is the kitchen, son!<eos> We see and hear everything.<eos> Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you...
One moment, please.<eos> Sit.<eos> Did you really think you could get away with it?<eos> What?<eos> This is the kitchen, son!<eos> We see and hear everything.<eos> Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you...<eos> You can't hide your birthday from the Halcyon, boy!<eos> Happy birthday dear Billy.<eos> Happy birthday to you.
Please.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> Lawrence!<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - Mother, shall we go for a walk?<eos> Under cover of darkness is one thing.<eos> But I will not be humiliated like this in front of my children.<eos> Do you hear?<eos> So, this policy of appeasement you support - how's that working for you?
Under cover of darkness is one thing.<eos> But I will not be humiliated like this in front of my children.<eos> Do you hear?<eos> So, this policy of appeasement you support - how's that working for you?<eos> When you decide to do something useful with your pathetic little life, and not before.<eos> Lawrence!<eos> Lawrence.<eos> Lawrence!<eos> Wait!<eos> I'm coming with you to the house.
Good morning, America!<eos> This is Joe O'Hara, live for CBA, reporting from London, where the spectre of fascism haunts the capital's West End.<eos> I'm staying at the luxurious Halcyon Hotel, where I can reveal prominent businessmen, aristocrats and politicians met this week in secret to discuss a deal with none other than Adolf Hitler himself.<eos> You should prepare for the worst.<eos> This broadcast is your fault.<eos> You were meant to keep on top of things.<eos> You brought your mistress to your own hotel.<eos> What did you think would happen?<eos> Don't you take that tone with me!<eos> When I think of what I've done for you, where you would have been without me...
Don't make the same mistakes as I did.<eos> I took something beautiful and I destroyed it.<eos> Just because I could.<eos> Go on.<eos> Go down and enjoy yourself.<eos> I'll er... I'll follow you down.<eos> O'Hara.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> - Stand up!<eos> I don't want to get into this with you.
He has a wandering eye, like his father.<eos> Kindly go upstairs and remind my husband this is an event to be attended by both parents.<eos> Lord Hamilton?<eos> Lord Hamilton?<eos> Lord Hamilton?<eos> Sir?<eos> Lord Hamilton.<eos> Might I have a word?<eos> Lord Hamilton.<eos> Freddie, he's talking to you.
What's she doing here?<eos> Miss. Lambert, wait.<eos> I just came to pay my respects.<eos> That would be a very bad idea, Miss. Lambert.<eos> We need to discuss the future of your father's hotel.<eos> It's time to make some changes.<eos> When can we expect to see you make your debut in the House of Lords?<eos> Well there's the little matter of the war to attend to first.<eos> Of course.<eos> Your father would be very proud of you.
All right, all right, back to work!<eos> Chop, chop!<eos> Let's get the plates through.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> I'm not sure you should be here.<eos> What are you going to do, Mr. Feldman?<eos> Manhandle me?<eos> Lambert.<eos> You want to know that he was being honest with you?
Chop, chop!<eos> Let's get the plates through.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> I'm not sure you should be here.<eos> What are you going to do, Mr. Feldman?<eos> Manhandle me?<eos> Lambert.<eos> You want to know that he was being honest with you?<eos> That he really cared for you and that he loved you?
Manhandle me?<eos> Lambert.<eos> You want to know that he was being honest with you?<eos> That he really cared for you and that he loved you?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> You silly girl. Of course he was lying to you.<eos> You were nothing to him but a piece of meat.<eos> You want the first, certainly wouldn't have been the last.<eos> Feeling better now?<eos> He lied to you as well, then, didn't he?
I figured you'd at least want to tear some strips off me.<eos> My father was a hypocrite.<eos> Talking about patriotism and duty while still running business interests in Germany?<eos> Jesus, Toby!<eos> You can't say those kind of things, especially not to me.<eos> The last thing he ever said to me was that I was pathetic.<eos> That my life was useless.<eos> He never had any time for me.<eos> And I don't see how his death changes anything.<eos> Richard, you know how I feel about you.
- Is she better than me?<eos> - Are you jealous?<eos> What?<eos> No, I just think it's highly unprofessional of Sonny.<eos> Of course.<eos> You don't see me singing with any piano player who bats his eyes at me.<eos> Besides, it's unfair, I always wanted to play the Cafe De Paris.<eos> Definitely not jealous, then.<eos> It's Freddie.<eos> Let him come to you.
Please, I'm an open book.<eos> When you've punished me and when you've ruined this place, when you've done all that, do you think somehow it will alleviate this pain you feel?<eos> That things will be better?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I suppose I'll find out.<eos> When were you going to tell me?<eos> Em...<eos> They ask you to leave and what, you don't trust me or how I'd react?<eos> I wanted to protect you.<eos> Please, understand this will not affect you.
I wanted to protect you.<eos> Please, understand this will not affect you.<eos> Of course it will affect me!<eos> This is our home.<eos> I can't believe Freddie would do such a thing.<eos> He's under a lot of pressure from his family.<eos> - I don't... I don't blame him.<eos> - Don't defend him.<eos> Emma, you are the most important thing in the world to me.<eos> And whatever happens, I'm going to make sure you're looked after.
- Excuse me. - Freddie.<eos> - Turn around.<eos> Robbie, would you mind getting my brother a strong, black coffee, please?<eos> It wasn't the American, Freddie.<eos> Haven't you grasped that?<eos> - He's just a voice on the radio.<eos> - Enough now, Toby, please!<eos> It was me!<eos> I told them all about Father, I told them all about his mistress and I told him all about her time in Germany.<eos> Doesn't family loyalty mean anything to you?
Don't you think I hated him as well? !<eos> I never wanted this!<eos> And I'm glad, I'm glad that he's gone.<eos> I remember what it was like to be young, to be driven by your emotions. But last night, you two...<eos> disgraced the family name.<eos> Brawling in front of staff, intoxicated, fighting like common children.<eos> Don't smirk.<eos> Don't feed the dog at the table.<eos> You're supposed to be men now, please live up to your responsibilities.<eos> I didn't mean to take it out on you.
Things will be different.<eos> And as such it would be prudent to appoint an assistant manager.<eos> Mr. Reynolds might be a good choice.<eos> He'd be an excellent choice.<eos> Except he does tend to do things by the book, a book which I imagine is old and dusty and rather out of date.<eos> How would you feel about the job?<eos> - I don't know what to say.<eos> - Say yes.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, there's one more thing I must attend to.<eos> I didn't do it to stand against you. I did it for the good of the hotel.
Now get out!<eos> Are you going?<eos> Recall to base.<eos> Some evacuation plan.<eos> So, all hands on deck, as it were.<eos> You're working late.<eos> I'm clearing out my things.<eos> Emma, don't.<eos> I know I've been stupid and made mistakes and I'm not asking you to forgive me, but when I think of this place it's not my family, my father... it's you.<eos> And it really wouldn't be the same without you, so, please.
I'm calling you up to the Majors.<eos> Come on, Freddie.<eos> Come on.<eos> Room service, sir.<eos> I didn't order anything.<eos> It's from Adil, Mr. Joshi.<eos> He knew you were working and thought some coffee might be of use.<eos> Do you want me to take it back down, Mr. Hamilton?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> There's a reason your father hid that from you.
I've found that war makes you realise what really matters.<eos> I've done my bit, Emma.<eos> I-I apologise.<eos> That was...<eos> that was very rude of me.<eos> About that drink.<eos> I have a few hours to spare if it suits.<eos> It might be your last chance to visit that pub.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> - Visitor for you.
I was just looking at it.<eos> - It's only a lighter, Sonny.<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's only a lighter.<eos> It's only a few drinks.<eos> A few meals.<eos> A sob story at the end and Betsey handing over her wages to help her poor old mum.<eos> I didn't come here for a handout.<eos> Just thought you'd help yourself.<eos> It's all right for you.
A sob story at the end and Betsey handing over her wages to help her poor old mum.<eos> I didn't come here for a handout.<eos> Just thought you'd help yourself.<eos> It's all right for you.<eos> Places like this.<eos> - You wouldn't understand.<eos> - Believe me...<eos> I understand.<eos> Betsey offers you anything, you say no.<eos> She's not gonna drop her knickers for you just because you throw some of your cash around.
Places like this.<eos> - You wouldn't understand.<eos> - Believe me...<eos> I understand.<eos> Betsey offers you anything, you say no.<eos> She's not gonna drop her knickers for you just because you throw some of your cash around.<eos> That's the other thing.<eos> She doesn't ever find out about this.<eos> Do you know the worst thing?<eos> She still thinks the world of you.
Go double time here into the middle eight and then...<eos> Good place for a trumpet solo.<eos> Nah.<eos> I got rid of it.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was rubbish.<eos> Are we ready?<eos> Yeah, we're ready.<eos> You can't watch that door forever.<eos> If someone had told you and mum to stop?
Richard!<eos> Richard!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> All right?<eos> Lord Hamilton, we haven't been formally introduced.<eos> I'm Lucian D'Aberville.<eos> I wish we'd met under pleasanter circumstances.<eos> Wherever did you find him?<eos> He's only a friend.<eos> He's also younger than you.
Wherever did you find him?<eos> He's only a friend.<eos> He's also younger than you.<eos> We all know your husband liked to run around with girls half his age but, well, as long as you're happy.<eos> Did you know?<eos> Well, when you say, "We all know your husband..."<eos> do you mean that you know now?<eos> Or that you knew then?<eos> I...<eos> We all felt so sorry for you.
You have no idea.<eos> Wait.<eos> Good morning, Miss. Garland.<eos> Another night in the firing line?<eos> This is a staff entrance, Mr. O'Hara.<eos> Don't the WVS usually wear green?<eos> Where is your uniform?<eos> I'll be able to get one after payday.<eos> Surely your father can give you an advance?<eos> He must be proud of you out there every night doing your bit.
You should have returned over an hour ago.<eos> - I was stationed further away...<eos> - I don't care to hear excuses. We had an agreement.<eos> This was not to interfere with your work.<eos> And it hasn't.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go upstairs and sleep.<eos> You'll start at midday.<eos> - Midday but the restaurant...<eos> - The restaurant can do without you.
What does he do all day, that brother of yours?<eos> He works the big ack-ack guns.<eos> And when there are no German planes to shoot? What then?<eos> He probably cleans the lavs at the barracks, doesn't he?<eos> No.<eos> It is a noble task to clean the lavatories.<eos> Even in war, lavatories must be clean.<eos> Especially in war.<eos> Now, come on, squirt.<eos> I've got a job for you.

Well, I'd better... - I-I left my...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> Bath's ready.<eos> You spoil me, darling.<eos> Priscilla...<eos> You needn't hide that from me, you know.<eos> See, I'm not quite sure...<eos> precisely what I am to you, and that's all right.
Bloody hell.<eos> Bath's ready.<eos> You spoil me, darling.<eos> Priscilla...<eos> You needn't hide that from me, you know.<eos> See, I'm not quite sure...<eos> precisely what I am to you, and that's all right.<eos> That's perfectly all right.<eos> If this is a... passing fancy, a diversion then I remain your obedient servant always happy to provide.<eos> However, if you do wish to talk about Freddie, about anything... if I can be more to you... then I would like that very much, too.
Are you gonna play something I can sing to, Mr. Jazz Man?<eos> Tell me the real reason why you're going...<eos> Don't.<eos> I'm here now, aren't I?<eos> Can't we have fun?<eos> Can't we just enjoy it?<eos> You should go downstairs.<eos> Nah.<eos> I want to stay here.<eos> With you.
You're gonna be disappointed one day, so it might as well be now.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're leaving because I treat you halfway decent?<eos> You're leaving because I like you?<eos> Damn it, Bets, you'd better run because I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I've loved you since the day I met you.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> June 6th, 1938.<eos> I've played piano for you every day but Sunday for two years.
- You made a promise.<eos> - She won't know.<eos> You'll know.<eos> We'll know.<eos> I saw you looking a few times.<eos> Figured you didn't think I was repulsive.<eos> You never once did anything about it.<eos> I didn't, because I...<eos> Sonny, just let me.<eos> I was sweet on you for the longest time.
Well, you made your thoughts clear in any event.<eos> Well, then, I apologise.<eos> It's no wonder you have such a low opinion of me.<eos> No, you were... you were right.<eos> It's galling to think how naive I was, how...<eos> We grew up together, you see.<eos> On and off, when Freddie was home from school.<eos> Made it easy for me to get carried away, to... imagine his feelings were other than what they were.<eos> Well, Miss.<eos> Garland, whatever... chowderhead thing I said about you and Freddie, your station or his...

I can always change my answer.<eos> No.<eos> Yes is good.<eos> We can work with yes.<eos> Good morning.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> Maybe they're going to give you a promotion?<eos> I'm just presenting facts and figures.<eos> Doesn't mean they can't promote you at the same time.<eos> Toby, I think what your mother is trying to tell you in her own unique way is that she's proud of you.
No, no, no, no.<eos> I'll see what I can find out.<eos> I appreciate it's difficult but if you do hear anything...<eos> Mortimer, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Beauty.<eos> I want her.<eos> I see.<eos> You're the band leader, aren't you?<eos> Sorry to ask, it's just um, you boys all look a little alike to me.
I appreciate it's difficult but if you do hear anything...<eos> Mortimer, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Beauty.<eos> I want her.<eos> I see.<eos> You're the band leader, aren't you?<eos> Sorry to ask, it's just um, you boys all look a little alike to me.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Tell me, what's the situation between you and that delightful young singer?
If you say so.<eos> Tell me, what's the situation between you and that delightful young singer?<eos> We're friends.<eos> You seemed a little more than friends.<eos> With all due respect, that is our business and no-one else's.<eos> With all due respect, we let you come here, to England, and you're pawing away at our women.<eos> There's no respect there at all, is there?<eos> If you'll excuse me, I need to get to work.<eos> My God, they put a suit on an ape and it thinks it's better than us.<eos> I'm talking to you, Sambo.
I have a very serious complaint about one of your staff.<eos> It doesn't matter that you think he's innocent.<eos> Of course that matters.<eos> Nobody cares what you think.<eos> Well that's good because I think this conversation is a waste of time.<eos> Just... hear me out.<eos> Whoever you speak to will want to know why they should care.<eos> It's a rule of broadcasting.<eos> You personalise it.<eos> Here's why Toby's arrest is bad for you.
I think he'd be curious to see what the new Lord Hamilton is like.<eos> But be careful.<eos> His dislike of your father runs deep.<eos> If you don't handle him correctly he has the power to make things a lot worse for Toby.<eos> Have you got a girlfriend, Toby?<eos> - What?<eos> - A girlfriend.<eos> No.<eos> No, I haven't. You sure about that?<eos> Bright young thing like you.
Are you going to apologise?<eos> He won't be the last person who has a problem with us.<eos> I'm not going to spend my whole life saying sorry when I've done nothing wrong.<eos> You?<eos> If they sack you, I'm walking out... right by your side.<eos> You really care about the place, don't you?<eos> I know it's just a job and a hotel.<eos> But it's home as well.<eos> And after what happened, I...<eos> Part of you wishes you were there... make sure Toby's OK.
Garland, I was going over your proposal for the event again.<eos> I did have a few thoughts, if you wanted to go through them.<eos> Yes, of course. I'll fetch my notebook.<eos> 50 glorious years, right?<eos> The party next week.<eos> I presume you'll be there.<eos> I think I will be, yes.<eos> Good evening, Mr. O'Hara.<eos> Come in.<eos> I was worried about you.
Believe me, I never wanted to do it. I swear to you.<eos> No, I asked you who.<eos> Mr. D'Aberville.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I need to speak to him.<eos> - No, please don't.<eos> Don't...<eos> - Don't touch me!<eos> And don't tell me what to do!<eos> I trusted you. And I...
No, no, listen. Listen!<eos> Listen, listen to me.<eos> You're already implicated, you and your disgusting little boyfriend.<eos> Forget the shame you'll bring on your family. I'm talking about treason, espionage, capital offences.<eos> But you... you are going to help me.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> I only need one more thing and then all of this will be over.<eos> Toby.<eos> I was worried about you.
But you... you are going to help me.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> I only need one more thing and then all of this will be over.<eos> Toby.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> Come on, dinner's waiting.<eos> And look who I found wandering in the corridor.<eos> Toby!<eos> We were so worried about you.
Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Look, what do you really know about him?<eos> Why is he here?<eos> What does he do?<eos> Listen, Mr. D'Abberville is not going to try and replace your father.<eos> No, no, no, I don't mean that.<eos> Lucian!<eos> Will you please reassure my son?<eos> He has his doubts about you.
Apparently, I'm not as strict as I used to be.<eos> You...<eos> You could be my guest.<eos> Well, I'd like that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Toby.<eos> Toby.<eos> He's making you work for him, isn't he?<eos> Toby, you need to find a way out.<eos> If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be in this bloody situation!
Whatever information...<eos> - you may think you have...<eos> - No, the game is over.<eos> Sam.<eos> The pieces are already off the board.<eos> Now, if you insist on continuing, then you give me no choice but to... expose you.<eos> You seem to be forgetting Toby.<eos> I think we both know Toby's not gonna go to the police.<eos> Lady Hamilton...<eos> Lady Hamilton already believes her son has got an unreasonable vendetta against me. And as for you, well, we all know what Her Ladyship thinks about Mr. Garland.
No.<eos> Well, I don't know, maybe.<eos> Hotel's on fire, you can only save one of them.<eos> Who do you choose?<eos> I can't answer that.<eos> You spent a long time loving Freddie.<eos> That won't just disappear.<eos> I've also seen the way you look at Joe.<eos> And if he's serious, he'll show it.<eos> That's how it is with you and Sonny?
- I'm not doing this to change your mind.<eos> - Good. Cos it wouldn't work.<eos> When I think about what we did, I'm disgusted at myself.<eos> - Toby, I love you.<eos> - How dare you say that?<eos> You want to do me a favour?<eos> You want to help?<eos> Get out.<eos> Disappear.<eos> There is no place for you here and there never will be.
I want to leave a surprise for Mr. D'Abberville.<eos> Very good, Your Ladyship.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Mr. D'Abberville.<eos> - Thank you for being here, Toby.<eos> I do realise this is a very tricky situation.<eos> But at least it's...<eos> coming to an end.<eos> I'm not going to help you.<eos> Do you really want the world to know the truth about you?
What exactly did you say to Mr. O'Hara that made him punch you?<eos> I'm not so sure if it's what I said or... what was unsaid.<eos> And that would be?<eos> That I made a mistake... in letting you go.<eos> That I love you.<eos> And I want you back.<eos> And what if it's too late for that now?<eos> I'm fairly sure it's too late, but...<eos> I couldn't live with myself if I didn't at least try.<eos> After you.
We believe he was intent on taking a substantial sum of money from her.<eos> It is, as you can imagine... a very embarrassing situation.<eos> And her husband barely cold in the grave.<eos> We'll be in touch, Mr. Garland.<eos> Tom, have the police been to the hotel at all?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Mr. Hamilton. Sorry.<eos> I've got a letter here for you.<eos> It's from Mr. Joshi.<eos> - Tom, when did he give this to you?
I need you to go back inside, honey.<eos> Grandpa says that's not a toy.<eos> Ellen, I need you to go watch another show.<eos> Things are fine.<eos> I am a police officer.<eos> Ellen, I'm not playing around.<eos> I'm looking for Pete.<eos> Is he inside the house right now?<eos> Mm-mmm. You wouldn't lie to a police officer, would you?<eos> I want to tell you I trust you a hundred percent.
- And if you think I'm gonna settle for some half-assed cut-rate...<eos> You don't even know that they had anything to do with this.<eos> Yeah, I prefer Gustavo's on Route One, and the color's a mixture of Barbie Pink Sea Pearl and Briar Rose.<eos> You wanna tell me what that was?<eos> You came to my work, so I thought I'd return the favor.<eos> - That's not what I want.<eos> - Since when?<eos> I want more, Shannon.<eos> You don't answer yesterday when I tell you that I love you.<eos> You don't answer a couple hours ago when I tell you I wanna be with you.
[chuckles] So what do we do now?<eos> I mean, what happens?<eos> [sighs] We can go by your place, pick up what you need.<eos> If Sean shows up, we'll just...<eos> I think...<eos> I think I have a way to set us up for the rest of our lives.<eos> I just means that I have to stay with Sean a little bit longer.<eos> Shannon, I... I don't wanna wait.<eos> Okay?<eos> I wanna be with you.
- He was here for hours.<eos> - That's true. You can ask the neighbors<eos> They must have seen his truck parked.<eos> We're not gonna pull your fucking neighbors.<eos> - All right, look... - [door opens]<eos> - [gun cocks] - Good news, bad news, fellas.<eos> Aren't we full of surprises?<eos> You get that badge in a cereal box?<eos> That's the bad news. Badge is real. Gun, too.<eos> Good news is I'm not here for you.
- All right, look... - [door opens]<eos> - [gun cocks] - Good news, bad news, fellas.<eos> Aren't we full of surprises?<eos> You get that badge in a cereal box?<eos> That's the bad news. Badge is real. Gun, too.<eos> Good news is I'm not here for you.<eos> Who you here for?<eos> - This one?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He mean anything to you?
If you want to piss away what's left of your career,<eos> I can think of a lot easier ways than beating... The guy forces his way into our house, scares the shit out of Carly.<eos> What do you think Pop would do?<eos> [phone buzzes] Answer the phone.<eos> Otto: J-Julia.<eos> Grandpa, hey.<eos> Taylor just headed down to...<eos> - Julia...<eos> Grandpa, is... is... is something wrong?<eos> Are your kids with you?
But that better be the last time I smell you anywhere near this case.<eos> Yeah, we'll see about that.<eos> Yeah? And we'll see how you like it when I yank your P.I. license.<eos> [sighs] See you around, Poovey.<eos> Take it easy, Archer.<eos> Oh, hey, and Archer?<eos> Come to think of it, where were you last night?<eos> Ask your wife. [growls]<eos> Ah, you know his wife left him.<eos> For you, Archer, 'cause you screwed her tits off at the precinct cookout. So then she thought the two of you would get married and live happily ever after, but then you were like, "What?"
I don't even know where you're going.<eos> [whines] Hopefully Long Beach.<eos> [barks]<eos> [whispering] Because I don't need a spirit animal, and if I did, he'd be an ocelot.<eos> Okay.<eos> Observe and report.<eos> So easy, even a cop could-<eos> - Wait.<eos> What the--<eos> Now, what's a nice, unmarked LAPD girl like you doing in a place like this? [engine approaches]
I know.<eos> Call it in, Kemosabe.<eos> This is 6-W-45.<eos> I need a tow at this location.<eos> Can we please go home?<eos> Please?<eos> Look, between travel team and school, you'll hardly be here.<eos> This sucks.<eos> It's just a few days.<eos> I can't do my job if I'm worried about you.
I promised.<eos> But now it seems that I am.<eos> Which is why I want you here.<eos> I want to help.<eos> I want to learn, Dad.<eos> This is like a teachable moment.<eos> I mean, who are these guys?<eos> Okay, look, when this is all over, we'll sit down, we'll go through the case.<eos> Okay?<eos> I still think I should be with you.
Love to.<eos> Did you figure out where we're going?<eos> That place we found?<eos> Sea of Cortez? Umm.<eos> How could I forget?<eos> I'm gonna meet you there.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> You can do it.<eos> I gotta take care of something.<eos> - I want to stay with you.
Sure.<eos> You got another one of those?<eos> What is it?<eos> A thumb drive.<eos> What's on it?<eos> Footage.<eos> - The rooftop camera.<eos> Jesus, Harry.<eos> Of what?<eos> Won't mean anything to you.
Of what?<eos> Won't mean anything to you.<eos> What do you want me to do with it?<eos> Just make sure it can't be traced to either of us.<eos> No shit.<eos> This has to be it, Harry.<eos> Just do this, and everything's jake.<eos> Always with the pickles.<eos> You don't even like pickles. Why do you get them?<eos> You like pickles. I get them for you.
Where's my brother? I know he's here.<eos> You just brought him in.<eos> Then you know that he's being processed.<eos> This is fucking bullshit.<eos> Frequently.<eos> Don't even try to talk to him without a lawyer.<eos> I didn't want to talk to him in the first place.<eos> Then why'd you drag him down here again?<eos> I know what it is you're doing.<eos> I was you, only better.

Shall we get the bad news out of the way so we can enjoy our dinner?<eos> Actually... I've reconsidered.<eos> Don't toy with me, Irv.<eos> I accept the offer, if it's still good.<eos> Of course it is. Of course it's still good.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> I'm delighted.<eos> The mayor will be thrilled.<eos> Does he know?<eos> I wanted to tell you first.
Does he know?<eos> I wanted to tell you first.<eos> - You ever work with him?<eos> - Rudy? Once.<eos> I'd just made rank.<eos> - Was he bent back then?<eos> - Like a crowbar.<eos> He used to keep this old search warrant in his glove compartment.<eos> He'd flash it when he wanted to get in somewhere without going through the niceties.<eos> Did he use it when he worked with you?
- Why not? Jesse bought him one drink too many.<eos> Gunn got shit-faced.<eos> Obstreperous.<eos> Got his ass tossed in the can.<eos> Who bailed him out?<eos> - Marissa Mattas.<eos> - The woman in red, works for Holland.<eos> She doesn't know anything, Bosch.<eos> - Keep her out of this.<eos> - That's up to you.
"Swock." You know, the sound a watermelon makes when it hits the pavement.<eos> Hard to lift that much dead weight over the balcony rail by yourself.<eos> My brother stayed inside.<eos> He never laid a hand on Gunn.<eos> Tell me about the frame-up, my prints on the glass.<eos> You're a creature of habit, Bosch.<eos> El Compadre.<eos> Filched your glass one night at the bar.<eos> - Jesse?<eos> - Right behind you.
You never knew he was there.<eos> Okay, so you put me at the scene.<eos> Why not just choke Gunn out?<eos> Why pitch him off the balcony?<eos> Why the owl?<eos> Andrew Holland had a script...<eos> The fall of Hieronymus Bosch.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You think we would ever in a million years have thought about the fucking owl?<eos> That was Holland talking directly to you, Bosch.
I had my phone off.<eos> Security.<eos> Really brought the heat.<eos> I know.<eos> Told you to let it go.<eos> I had to try, captain.<eos> Couldn't live with myself.<eos> What's done is done.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You, too.
Your brother?<eos> He's a stand-up guy, and he stood up.<eos> - Is he out?<eos> - As of this morning.<eos> Why I'm just now calling.<eos> Where's the case at?<eos> We start jury selection next week.<eos> Personally, I think the people are going to cave.<eos> Maybe I should come by tonight.<eos> I have something for you that may seal the deal.
Holland know you have them?<eos> I returned them the day after, but then I got to thinking, maybe I needed a little insurance.<eos> So I stole 'em.<eos> Any chance I can speak with my brother?<eos> He's been transferred downtown.<eos> Ida, would you reconfirm my reservation?<eos> Two for 7:30?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm telling you, Rudy, we are this close to no jail time or getting the case dismissed outright.<eos> Good for you.
Thank you.<eos> Scott Anderson.<eos> Quite the writer.<eos> Yeah, it turned out all right.<eos> I know you got your eyes on RHD.<eos> Yeah, but the politics involved?<eos> You know better than anyone.<eos> It's a crapshoot.<eos> Everything's got to break the right way.<eos> Still, this looks good for you, Santiago.
What happened?<eos> That chessboard's been in the Luthor family for generations.<eos> Did you come here to yell at me for not treating the family heirlooms with respect, or to blame me for what's happening outside?<eos> How could you let that woman deceive you?<eos> I taught you to be a scientist. To question everything.<eos> No, what you taught me was to doubt myself.<eos> To look for validation elsewhere, so much that I was willing to take it from the first mentor that offered it to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I am, Lena.<eos> When you came to visit me in jail, I honestly wanted to be a better mother to you.

I've chosen something else.
It's good to see you, buddy.<eos> It's good...<eos> Good.<eos> And you're the guy who's dating my cousin?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Mon-El of Daxam. Though not...<eos> Not like the, uh...<eos> You know, the others from Daxam.<eos> The killy ones?<eos> You must be a good guy or she wouldn't be with you.
And I will.<eos> Why not Superman?<eos> Isn't this his fight, too?<eos> It's everyone's fight.<eos> But Kara just defeated me.<eos> She's the champion of Earth.<eos> I don't have time for you to be afraid.<eos> I need you strong.<eos> Please, J'onn, wake up soon.<eos> We need you.
But Kara just defeated me.<eos> She's the champion of Earth.<eos> I don't have time for you to be afraid.<eos> I need you strong.<eos> Please, J'onn, wake up soon.<eos> We need you.<eos> It's true.<eos> You have to wake up.<eos> M'gann.<eos> Your friends need you, J'onn.
We will not have to use that device.<eos> And I am going to beat her.<eos> Your mother's going to leave.<eos> For good.<eos> Agent Schott, head to L-Corp.<eos> Assist Lillian and Lena Luthor.<eos> Yeah, sure thing.<eos> When you go to meet her, I'm coming, too.<eos> You can't fight for me.<eos> But I can be with you.
I don't know.<eos> I don't know if it's possible.<eos> I don't know if it's possible to have everything you want.<eos> Well, it is.<eos> But only because you worked for it.<eos> Whenever I fight, no matter who it's against or where it is, I'm always fighting for Lois.<eos> I fight with her right here.<eos> The people we love, they're, uh...<eos> They're another secret superpower.<eos> Keep him with you.

Keep him with you.<eos> It's time.<eos> I'm here for you.<eos> I know.<eos> I see you brought some moral support.<eos> I see you did, too.<eos> So, once you are disposed of, I have your word that your forces will lay down arms?<eos> That the city, the nation, and the planet will be surrendered?<eos> On my honor.<eos> And if I defeat you, your invasion ends.
Stop, stop.<eos> Alex? Uh...<eos> Do something for me?<eos> - You're okay. - Kara...<eos> - I've got you...<eos> - Kara...<eos> No, no, don't talk.<eos> Just save your energy.<eos> There's something I need to say.<eos> Wherever I go... I'm gonna be better because of you.
I have to get home.<eos> I know.<eos> You okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> I did the right thing.<eos> I think it goes far beyond "the right thing".<eos> I couldn't have done it, Kara.<eos> You don't have to try to make me feel better.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm humbled by you.
I felt you fall away.<eos> You needed me.<eos> I hope you didn't come out of a sense of duty.<eos> Can you stay?<eos> For a while.<eos> Good.<eos> There was a moment this year... Where I felt completely broken.<eos> When I regretted a choice that changed my life.<eos> And then you forced your way into my home, wrapped your arms around me, and you said,<eos> "I'm proud of you."

He didn't show.<eos> What the hell do we do now?<eos> Bobby Axelrod could run through the Serengeti and not break a sweat.<eos> You do what you do just as well as him.<eos> Maybe better.<eos> You can't allow yourself to get drawn in to an unwinnable fight.<eos> Victory will be swift.<eos> That will save us ten million on this trade.<eos> This is why I need to keep you.<eos> I'd believe the same thing were I you.
So who is this fake factory supposed to be supplying?<eos> What does this ripple out into?<eos> You find that, you find Krakow's real investment.<eos> How long you been here?<eos> Three months.<eos> I'm leaving in two weeks for grad school.<eos> How did everything go?<eos> Salutations, my dear.<eos> I think Chuck's working tonight.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
- Okay.<eos> Ciao, Bobby.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Good to meet you.<eos> That's a busy man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There'll be time.<eos> - You told my father.<eos> - I didn't tell him.<eos> He's like you. He figured it out.
Indonesian?<eos> God, yeah.<eos> You obviously heard my stomach's cries for help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So how's it going?<eos> You coming up with anything for the big case?<eos> Nah, not yet.<eos> Maybe we should pool our resources.<eos> I have a few things.<eos> They might sound better coming from you.

We're all thinking it.<eos> There's obviously more going on here, and none of us want to get caught in another Chuck Rhoades web.<eos> No idea what you're talking about.<eos> Here's how I see it, though. Whoever comes up with this impossible case is in the lead for Head of Crim.<eos> Counterpoint... whoever comes up with this impossible case is then going to have to win said impossible case.<eos> And then if they don't, they're fucked.<eos> That's what Connerty thinks.<eos> And that's why I'm not in his office.<eos> Is that what Connerty thinks, or is that what he wants you to think?<eos> I'm hearing that multiple former AUSAs are gonna come forward against you.
- No.<eos> It's a blind trust, and I made a public vow.<eos> I can't touch the money or direct it as long as I'm in office.<eos> Well, there's one good thing about getting fired.<eos> Boy, it's much better to be the lawyer... and go home when the hour's up, get some sleep.<eos> If you're the client, you're up all night.<eos> Aha. I was wondering why we were at a four-top.<eos> Taiga.<eos> I met her at SoulCycle.<eos> She brought a friend for you, too.
Spartan-Ives is a friend to the administration.<eos> Lawrence Boyd and the A. G. Went to fucking Horace Mann together.<eos> - So what Chuck's looking for...<eos> - Is an enemy.<eos> He wants to bring him a trophy.<eos> I've got one.<eos> Executive e-mails leaked by a whistle-blower.<eos> This is the case that he's looking for.<eos> Well, why don't you give it to Chuck yourself?<eos> Might sound better coming from you.

Connerty bringing it in and getting the credit.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But this could be very good... for you.
I just wanted a moment with you.<eos> Best advice you'll get.<eos> Don't settle for just one.<eos> Seven fifty a year.<eos> That's double entry level for an analyst.<eos> I'm getting my MBA in Chicago under Eugene Fama, the Nobel Laureate.<eos> Come on. Fama's an egghead.<eos> Get an education right here. Make it a million a year.<eos> What?<eos> Three seventy-five or 750 or a million, it's all the same to you?
You, you are Mike Wagner.<eos> But you need to ask yourself where are you at right now?<eos> What's churning those waters up so much that a little cub like that can break the levee?<eos> Things can't be that bad for you here if you still have the A. G.'s picture on your wall.<eos> Dad... about Wendy and me.<eos> You thought you could keep it from me.<eos> Nah.<eos> These things have a way of floating up out of the murk.<eos> Our separation is about needing space.<eos> And I think that extends to you.

He's made every parole hearing.<eos> Well, it's what he's been doing between parole hearings that we're worried about, Nolan.<eos> Where is Mr. Pearl right now?<eos> Looks like he lives... here.<eos> And works at Second Shot Thrift, right around the corner from his apartment.<eos> Let's see if this guy's at work and then see what he has been working on.<eos> I'm not going anywhere. And despite Napa being,<eos> - the best job I can get right now. - But I...<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this. I...<eos> Napa's great, and I totally get what it means to you.
- No. No.<eos> I already said that I'm not going.<eos> But let's both be clear that we are staying here in L.A.<eos> You are not applying to law schools in other cities.<eos> And if you don't get into one around here, that's it.<eos> And meanwhile, I'll just keep working my stupid, not very important restaurant job, because this is where we live.<eos> Gus, Gus,<eos> - Period.<eos> I don't think that your job is stupid.<eos> In fact, it's... it's such a big promotion that. I-I was just surprised that your boss gave it to you.
If Ortiz has torn apart that many cellphones, he's probably constructed a lot more bombs.<eos> But where are they?<eos> I don't think we have very much time to figure that out.<eos> Yes?<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm Rusty. I'm Gus'...<eos> Rusty. Yes.<eos> It's nice to put a face to the name.<eos> I'm Aiden Reed.<eos> Gus told me so much about you.
But what can I do?<eos> Gus can't see what's in his best interest 'cause he's in a relationship with a really, really insecure college student.<eos> Does that come up a lot?<eos> Gus saying no to you because he's already in a relationship.<eos> Have you... have you been turned down before?<eos> More like turned away.<eos> But, yeah, he won't take me up on dinners out or drinks.<eos> But I'm guessing that's because of everything you did for his sister.<eos> Why else let a needy boy like you call all the shots when he could be doing so much better?<eos> Like being with you?
Watch.<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> Roaches, rats, and Provenza.<eos> They can survive anything.<eos> Looks like I drew the short straw.<eos> Congratulations, Leo!<eos> This is an excellent, excellent choice.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> And I truly appreciate you allowing me to keep my old office at Piper Tech, which I'm about to go back to right now, if you'll excuse me.<eos> And... congrats to you, too, Sharon.
They think that you are dead, my love, and so you will be if you don't escape now.<eos> I want to stay and fight.<eos> My darling Richard.<eos> My Perkin.<eos> Go to Tournai.<eos> Find Jan Warbecque, the boatman.<eos> Pretend to be his son.<eos> I promise I will fetch you back to England and put you on the throne.<eos> Up inside. Quickly now.<eos> I cannot lose you as I did your brother, Edward.
There is to be no welcome for the promised Queen of England?<eos> The king has lost his manners?<eos> He will see you when he's seen the traitors.<eos> The others who loved Richard.<eos> These are not the queen's rooms.<eos> The king's mother, my wife, has those.<eos> As First Lady of the Court.<eos> I'll bring some ladies to attend you.<eos> Perhaps he does not need me as he means to wed his mother.<eos> He needs you.

Scribe.<eos> "I, Henry Tudor, King of England, "hereby, prohibit any English trade with Burgundy."<eos> There.<eos> That's for all the times that Yorkist duchess tried to catch me in her trap for Richard's executioner.<eos> You must decree the English Lords' reduce their guards, or they will form them into private armies and rise up at every tax you levy.<eos> Are we certain the York Princes are truly dead?<eos> - If one of them still lives... - They are both dead.<eos> It is well known.<eos> King Richard killed both princes in the Tower.<eos> There is nobody for England now but you.
You should show more loyalty to your sister.<eos> We never planned much after the battle.<eos> He's overwhelmed, I think.<eos> He won the battle, he has the crown.<eos> And he will keep it.<eos> With our help.<eos> He wishes us to set about his coronation.<eos> He thinks that we should do it now to show England that he is king alone, not joint ruler with the girl.<eos> He hasn't mentioned it to me.<eos> Margaret, in time, he will share all his confidences with you.

Because I swapped the other for a servant boy.<eos> My mother and my sister cursed you for my murder.<eos> The male line of your family will die.<eos> My York Prince Richard will come against your son.<eos> One lives, Lady Margaret.<eos> You have won the people, Henry.<eos> And with this marriage, they will love you.<eos> And you already have an heir.<eos> There is one matter...<eos> God has shown me that you must relieve her of her mother, or she will poison the girl against you.
- You got this.<eos> You can do it, Sean.<eos> - Red.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - It's New York.<eos> Something's out there.<eos> You headed home?<eos> Gonna spend the rest of your night reading The Ladder in your room?<eos> - Be easy, Hawk.<eos> - Can I come with you?
- We just saw the world differently.<eos> I need to be with someone who wants what I want.<eos> - And what is it you want?<eos> - Green walls, I don't know.<eos> I'm still figuring it out.<eos> - But you still miss her so much.<eos> - Uh, you can't do this.<eos> You're just a boy.<eos> - I'm not a boy.<eos> - I'm at least five years older than you.
- All right.<eos> Why don't you...<eos> Why don't you just take the one for sleep, okay? The Ambien.<eos> Please.<eos> - Honestly, I don't want to take any of them.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because the Meyerists and Sarah don't think that you should?<eos> - No, it's just, I've lived all these years without needing them, and I don't think I need them now.<eos> - Eddie...<eos> I care about you, okay?
But it's not a burden.<eos> It's a blessing, to have been entrusted.<eos> - None of us is beyond unburdening.<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> That's what we teach.<eos> See you at dinner.<eos> - Shadows grow long.<eos> The night is only beginning.<eos> - Nice shirt.<eos> - Yeah, I got you one too. - Not my color.
- Shut it.<eos> It was nothing, really.<eos> I'm just so sorry I couldn't make it happen.<eos> You guys helped me so much.<eos> - I know.<eos> I remember when you first came to us, all the damage that you brought with you, all the suffering you felt... and that you caused others.<eos> We tried to help you to rid yourself of it so you could be free.<eos> - All right, this is it.<eos> - We're recording.<eos> - There's so many like you that come to us, frozen by their actions.

And to others, you will never be able to fill those shoes.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - I'm sorry I ditched you.<eos> - Sean?<eos> I thought you weren't...<eos> I was nervous you were leaving me after the wall thing. And I know you're mad, and you should be mad.<eos> You should hate me, but I was scared...<eos> - I am mad, and I'm sad and confused and frustrated, but I don't hate you.<eos> I want to, but I don't.<eos> You're my wife, and I am with you if you're with me...
You too, Sophie.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Hi.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Six.<eos> And she's my little sister, and she's three.<eos> Three, huh?<eos> Hi.<eos> We almost got started without you.
Thank you.<eos> I haven't done dishes in about 10 years, so I'm a little out of practice.<eos> Adam?<eos> He's glad you're here.<eos> "Ladies and gentlemen, skinny and stout.<eos> "I'll tell you a tale i know nothing about.<eos> "Admission is free, so pay at the door.<eos> Does uncle Adam want to stay for a while?<eos> No, he's only gonna stay for a quick visit.<eos> Could I go hunting with you?

Not this time, buddy.<eos> The deer are way, way up in the mountain, and it's gonna be a tough climb, even for your old man.<eos> But I really want to go with you.
Just remember we gotta get up early tomorrow, all right?<eos> I'll be ready.<eos> 6:30 A.M. i got it.<eos> I know, it's-- you know, it's just-- you can uh--<eos> I can what?<eos> Lose track of time.<eos> Will you take it easy?<eos> It's a camping trip, not a shuttle launch.<eos> All right.<eos> I wouldn't go to Lucy's if I were you.
Never came back.<eos> And that's it?<eos> And nobody ever found out what happened to this guy?<eos> Don't worry, buddy.<eos> We'll come looking for you.<eos> I'm gonna get a drink.<eos> Did you charge your cell phone?<eos> Yeah, the thing is, uh...<eos> Cell phones don't work about four hours into the hike, so...<eos> Ah, how convenient for you.
I'll see you outside.<eos> What?<eos> What do you expect to carry in that backpack?<eos> I got some food, i got my sleeping bag.<eos> Okay, what kind of sleeping bag?<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> It's gonna be freezing up there.<eos> I don't know what kind of sleeping bag it is.<eos> What is this?<eos> I packed you a bag.
Well, maybe, as the adult in the relationship, you can find something that you and Adam can enjoy together.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Get washed up before you come near me.<eos> Out!<eos> Hey, Adam.<eos> Guess what, dink?<eos> Adam, guess what?<eos> I shot a deer.<eos> Got him right in the chest.<eos> Good for you.
I've been having these... Dreams.<eos> So you wanted to come up here because of dreams?<eos> I gotta say that's a little weird.<eos> You know, dad would have been happy about this.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm hunting?<eos> No, you idiot.<eos> Because...<eos> You know, no matter what, he was our dad.<eos> He was way more of a dad to you.

Because...<eos> You know, no matter what, he was our dad.<eos> He was way more of a dad to you.<eos> Well you certainly didn't take the high road when he needed you, did you?<eos> He didn't need me.<eos> He had you.<eos> I had to look after him all by myself.<eos> You think that was fun?<eos> Do you really think that he would have wanted me around?<eos> I wanted you around, Adam.
He had you.<eos> I had to look after him all by myself.<eos> You think that was fun?<eos> Do you really think that he would have wanted me around?<eos> I wanted you around, Adam.<eos> I wanted you there for me.<eos> For me.<eos> Can you jus-- you know what?<eos> Never mind.<eos> You know he asked about you all the time?
I wanted you there for me.<eos> For me.<eos> Can you jus-- you know what?<eos> Never mind.<eos> You know he asked about you all the time?<eos> He wanted to know what you were up to.<eos> And he hoped you would visit one last time.<eos> I came for the funeral.<eos> The fu-- the funeral?<eos> That was closure for you.
That was closure for you.<eos> I didn't come up here to defend him.<eos> That part of our lives is over.<eos> I just promised him I would make it right.<eos> And when you suggested coming up here I thought--<eos> I thought you could close the book.<eos> You and I will never agree about our father.<eos> If you're okay with that, then I'm okay with closing the book.<eos> That looks like shit.<eos> What came between you and dad, anyway?
Yeah, I m coming down now!<eos> Come on.<eos> Adam!<eos> I see something!<eos> What?<eos> Adam!<eos> Adam, it's coming!<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't see anything!<eos> Adam, it's right in front of you!
Clint!<eos> Sophie?<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Adam, is that you?<eos> You're awake.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where are we?<eos> You really think we're done with you?
You do so well at whatever you try to do, it's almost annoying.<eos> Just stop panicking.<eos> Panic keeps me concentrated and it's already paying off.<eos> Gus, after my internship's run out,<eos> Andrea's offered me a paying job.<eos> It's not much and it's only for when I'm not in class, but...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing. That's... that's good.<eos> I'm proud of you.
And you have a much better shot of getting accepted there as a Berkeley undergrad.<eos> I'll commute to work from Oakland. It's 40 minutes.<eos> And you don't have to answer right now, but Aiden's flying me to Napa tomorrow afternoon. He wants me to meet with the rest of the team and he wants to see if it's a good fit.<eos> Like, how cool is that?<eos> Your boss is flying you to Napa?<eos> You've already taken the job.<eos> No. No, no, no. I told him it would be a decision you and I would make together.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, maybe you'll... get there and not like it.<eos> Don't you mean, "Wow, Gus, I'm so proud of you?"

I'm sorry. I-I don't need you to have a sous chef position at a Napa restaurant to be extremely proud of you.
Assholes.<eos> Still mad about it?<eos> I got nine years total.<eos> So yeah. Why don't you tell us a little bit about your craft?<eos> Your hiding things.<eos> I get out, how am I gonna make a living?<eos> By telling you all my secrets?<eos> I mean, that's not what you brought me here<eos> - to talk about anyway. - Educate us.<eos> Why should we be interested in a dirtbag like you?
Mom's not gonna eat cupcakes that have clearly been fingered by tiny hands.<eos> They're for me.<eos> It's stressful being the buffer between you two.<eos> I've only been doing it my whole life.<eos> I've been a buffer for you.
It's stressful being the buffer between you two.<eos> I've only been doing it my whole life.<eos> I've been a buffer for you.<eos> I mean, remember that time I came with you to confront Mom when you secretly gave her that loan?<eos> You had to know she was gonna find out.<eos> Look, Mallory, not to get super dark, but I thought she'd die first.<eos> Hey, so what happened with square-jawed Ryan?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just a bunch of sex and stuff.<eos> Good for you.
Look, team, I will tell you everything in a moment, but I'm beat.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Yeah, use Bud's bed.<eos> - Uh... Bud was kind of planning on using Bud's bed.<eos> Oh, thank you, Coyote.<eos> Oh, rose petals!<eos> Oh, thank you, Bud.<eos> Well, where are we gonna fuck?<eos> Allison, um... I'm on this.<eos> Just give me a second to put out this non-fire and I will be right with you.
Wait, Frankie found Louise?<eos> - Your mother's gun is named Louise?<eos> - Your brother's name is Coyote?<eos> - Did Grace mention a shooting?<eos> - No. - Is that why Frankie's not here?<eos> - We're still piecing it together.<eos> All I know is that my bed, which I specifically re-pillowed for Allison, is now occupied by my mother.<eos> And the fact that this is a problem is somehow lost on my brother.<eos> Oh, I've stopped listening.<eos> Did something happen between you and Frankie and Louise?
That's right.<eos> I told her the truth.<eos> She reacted horribly like I knew she would and that's that.<eos> She's your mother, for God's sake.<eos> How could you not be affected by her?<eos> Listen, Sol, I know you're trying to help, but really, I don't want to think about her anymore, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> If that's what you want.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You've been very patient with me and I shouldn't take it all out on you.
Oh, you're never feeling sassy.<eos> Well, you wouldn't know what sassy looks like on me.<eos> Oh, why don't you eat a bowl of wangs!<eos> Bud, we should go.<eos> "Bowl of wangs" is how it started with those lifeguards.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You two are best friends!<eos> And everyone who knows you can see that, even if we don't understand how.<eos> Yeah, Mom, come on.<eos> You were just saying how much Frankie means to you.
Bud, we should go.<eos> "Bowl of wangs" is how it started with those lifeguards.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You two are best friends!<eos> And everyone who knows you can see that, even if we don't understand how.<eos> Yeah, Mom, come on.<eos> You were just saying how much Frankie means to you.<eos> She said she never... Ow.<eos> She said she nev... Ow!<eos> She said she never felt alone when she was with you.
- No, no, no, it doesn't affect me.<eos> Yeah, it does, Mom.<eos> It does.<eos> - Let's go for a walk. Yeah. - Wah!<eos> - You gotta stop doing that, Mom.<eos> - Choo-choo!<eos> Oh, this is madness.<eos> Mom.<eos> She's high.<eos> She's not making fun of you, okay?
And don't you think it's about time to change that?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I'm trying to change that.<eos> I've been saving up.<eos> And blowing all of your savings on things like new guitars for your open mic nights!<eos> Because the only thing more pathetic than that is sleeping on your brother's couch for 18 months!<eos> Boys, please!<eos> If you wanted me gone, you could have said so at any time.<eos> But it's only an issue now because you're finally getting laid.<eos> Congratulations on finding someone more neurotic than you!
Uh, Frankie... this is the TV remote.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> I could use some River Monsters right about now.<eos> Why is the TV remote in the phone cradle?<eos> So I'll remember where it is.<eos> Well, how do you remember where the phone is?<eos> With great difficulty.<eos> In case you haven't noticed, people don't even know who we are or what we are selling.<eos> This meeting is the first chance we've had at distribution!<eos> It's okay, I'm with you.
But not my face.<eos> I don't understand why you're being so negative.<eos> You know how important meeting Marla is for us.<eos> You're supposed to be my partner!<eos> I am being your partner.<eos> You're living in a dreamscape, Grace.<eos> Even if you get to the phone, it's too late to get someone over here to help us in time for the meeting.<eos> I will not give up.<eos> Fine!<eos> Then I will do it for you.
It sure is a hard thing to hear.<eos> I got a new bike on my ninth birthday.<eos> I remember swerving through the marching band... at the Fourth of July parade.<eos> Oh, they were so mad.<eos> So you know what I mean.<eos> I do.<eos> - And that little girl is not gone.<eos> - Don't even try.<eos> Okay, I won't.<eos> But I still see her in you... when you're giving me shit about being a sucky navigator... or you're chucking towels and hats at me.
- Now, look,<eos> I want you to start lining up architects.<eos> I wanna talk to every Tom, Dick, and Gehry out there.<eos> Maybe a female candidate.<eos> Well, we're not redoing a kitchen, here, you know?<eos> And we need to tell them that the Kennedy Library is a reference point 'cause, you know, he was also a part-termer.<eos> Right.<eos> Can I bring anything?<eos> Ah, don't bring a thing. I'm gonna make my famous paella valenciana.<eos> We're looking forward to seeing you and your lovely wife on Saturday.
- That's also a felony.<eos> Inorderto findanidealmatch , the restaurant, table, food, and time will be the same for every date to establish a control.<eos> - The girl will be different.<eos> - Jesus, Kent.<eos> I mean, why do you make it so goddamn complicated?<eos> You know, one time, I tried hitting on a girl at a Laundromat.<eos> For somebody with broken English, she was real uppity.<eos> - There's your answer.<eos> - Carry on.<eos> Every potential mate has been preselected from the online dating pool of DC women ages 25 to 30 with a strong interest in marriage to you in particular.
- Great.<eos> - Wow! - I just...<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> - Look at us. Do you remember that night junior year?<eos> No.<eos> Chardonnay on the quad after Julia Child Day?<eos> You know what, I'm strictly a scotch girl and I always have been, so I never really experimented... with Chardonnay.<eos> Um, so I think you've got me confused with somebody else.<eos> - I don't think I was confused.<eos> - Good for you.
So happy to see you. Thank you.<eos> - Does the library have a name?<eos> - It's the Selina Meyer Presidential Library and School for Public Policy, and that's all.<eos> We're really excited.<eos> Really, really excited.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Yeah, we have a lot of good friends here.<eos> So, luckily, the doctors were able to remove the mass without a full mastectomy, so I got to keep my nipple.<eos> Whoo-hoo, right?<eos> I'm gonna go ahead and be honest with you.
This isn't the library.<eos> This is the dashcam footage from Buddy's arrest last night.<eos> Ooh, easy!<eos> Easy, pretty lady.<eos> - What, are you on the rag?<eos> - Calm down, sir.<eos> Pretty... it's a pretty pristine image.<eos> Oh, yeah, you're all hot and juicy now.<eos> I bet if I take you home to bed, you're just gonna lie there with your BlackBerry and no dirty talk for Uncle Buddy then.<eos> - That is not about you.
Why don't you go take a nap?<eos> Son of a bitch is fast.<eos> You just old and slow, is all.<eos> Asshole.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> Hell, I lost her.<eos> She gone.<eos> No, she not.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> I owe you.
But being mean don't make you no killer.<eos> Guess they already decided that Chester did it.<eos> That's what I'm afraid of, too.<eos> What the...<eos> Leonard, you watch yourself around them boys.<eos> Bad things happen in that house.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Melton already ain't none too pleased you peed on his head.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I'll talk to you about that later.
Okay.<eos> Find a dead kid, and we gotta hope he's black?<eos> They're gonna pin this on Chester and drop it.<eos> All you gotta do, keep out of trouble and don't piss on anyone's head. Can you do that?<eos> It's a pleasure having boys in the house again.<eos> All I got left at home now.<eos> That's quite a collection of photos you got there, MeMaw.<eos> There's one of Chester and Leonard up there somewhere.<eos> I took it when Leonard was just a-a wee slip of a boy.<eos> He talked about you a lot, 'specially near the end.

Please, will you do that for me?<eos> I'd be most grateful.<eos> Of course.<eos> Bad enough to lose your child...<eos> Not to know what happened to him... you ever think about having kids, Hap?<eos> You're assuming I don't already have 'em.<eos> I don't.<eos> What's the matter? Not the father type?<eos> Guess it's just, never met a woman thought I was.<eos> What about you?
I got a knot in my shoulder.<eos> A little to the left next time.<eos> Sneed!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Detective.<eos> I was just talkin' to him.<eos> Get your ass outta here.<eos> Hallelujah, y'all.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> A good Sunday to you, sister Florida.
The pips.<eos> Who was the lead singer?<eos> Gladys knight.<eos> Right, The Miracles who was the lead singer?<eos> - Smokey Robinson.<eos> - You got it.<eos> Very well done. Bonus category.<eos> He and Illium were investigating missing kids.<eos> I need to make copies of all these.<eos> I can't believe I ever doubted you, Chester.
Hurry, children, let's go.<eos> 26, 27...<eos> Come on, babies. Come on.<eos> 28, 29... 30, 31, 32... come on, children.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where's jezzy?<eos> Where's jezzy?<eos> 98, 99, 100!<eos> 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...<eos> She ain't for you is all I'm sayin'.
All right, what was you saying?<eos> Good enough. We'll talk tomorrow.<eos> A'ight.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know what's at the bottom of an abandoned quarry,<eos> Under all that water?<eos> Rocks... That nobody wants.<eos> I don't give a shit about leonard pine.<eos> I don't give a shit about you.
Boy, didn't nobody tell you?<eos> Ain't safe to leave your door open in a white neighborhood.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Salt increases the, conductivity.<eos> So when you go... You go real quick.<eos> You gon' go.<eos> Where's ivan?<eos> Valentine tell you to snatch him?<eos> He told us, all the cops, To nail you, make it stick.<eos> Even if the case against chester didn't make, He wanted you.
What are you doin'?<eos> What you gon' do?<eos> Something I shoulda done a long time ago.<eos> I just had coffee with king valentine.<eos> Do you want your friend to go to jail?<eos> Because he will.<eos> As good as I am, as weak as their case is...<eos> You keep harassing the judge, Valentine will see to it leonard goes to jail.<eos> Three cops called me this evening to tell me. What an asshole you are.<eos> I got my hands full with leonard. I-I don't need to worry about you, too.
Didn't know.<eos> Don't care.<eos> There are only two types of people still livin' in this town, Collins... them that just couldn't get out<eos> and them that just wouldn't.<eos> Which type are you?<eos> See, here in East Texas, man needs a plan.<eos> Otherwise, there's just nothing here for him except for trouble, of course.<eos> Are you a troublemaker, Collins?<eos> Depends on who you ask.<eos> I'm asking you.
It's just chemicals, MeMaw.<eos> They're not chemicals.<eos> It's you.<eos> It's your spirit coming through.<eos> All the things you are, all the things you will be, and all the people that come before.<eos> Now, go get dressed.<eos> I made a pie.<eos> I find out who his folks is, if he got any.<eos> He got 'em, whether he want 'em or not.<eos> He just like you.
Ivan, get me a glass of water, would you, please?<eos> MeMaw.<eos> MeMaw?<eos> Tell me where this place is.<eos> That place long... f-forgotten.<eos> With spirits... no one remembers.<eos> All those little chil'ren...<eos> All lost.<eos> What the hell we doing in here, buddy?<eos> I thought you folks were scared of places like this.
When them chil'ren burned up in that church, all that long time ago, the devil, he come home with me that day.<eos> He wasn't done with Jezebel.<eos> The devil got nothin' to do with this, MeMaw.<eos> He made damn sure he get to me.<eos> Ain't you tell me people gonna be who they is?<eos> That's what you told me about Uncle Chester.<eos> People gon' be who they are, and you can't change 'em.<eos> Not even love can change 'em.<eos> Love do change people, Leonard.<eos> Just as love changed you, and Florida's love changed you.
Dad, I'm gay.<eos> It's an illness. It can be treated.<eos> I'm not gonna see you again, am I?<eos> You have such strength in you.<eos> About being black, maybe. But being black isn't the only thing that's different about me.<eos> Well, you be whoever you want to be in here, baby.<eos> - Can I take your picture?<eos> - You sure that's all you want?<eos> We're having a rally to stop violence against women.<eos> I need you to bring all the boys like you.
Hey, uh, you got time for lunch, buddy? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, lunch sounds great.<eos> How could you even talk to that son of a bitch?<eos> Talking to that son of a bitch is part of my job.<eos> It's what pays for this house.<eos> Not that any of that seemed to matter to you today.<eos> If anyone even suspects... that we have a relationship of any kind...<eos> Why...<eos> Why would they, Richard?<eos> Thanks to you, nobody anywhere knows we mean a damn thing to each other.
You know, overwhelmingly it is true that it's the heterosexual... men, I might add...<eos> - who are the child molesters. - I believe that's a myth<eos> - I've never seen...<eos> - Oh, Senator. The FBI, the National Council on Family Relations, the Santa Clara County Child Sexual Abuse Treatment Center.<eos> We put our safety on the line and came out in every city.<eos> But come election night, we had few clues if we'd be safe in California come morning.<eos> Santa Clara's latest... 48% yes, 48% no, 68% reported.<eos> Roma, I did it myself and it took.<eos> I'm gonna have a baby, Roma.<eos> And I want to raise it with you.

I want you.
I don't want that. I want you.<eos> And Fresno reminded me of what I want... why I came here.<eos> We got L.A.!<eos> L.A.!<eos> Prop 6 is dead!<eos> Jean and I... we still have a lot of work to do.<eos> How can you not see it?<eos> Allow yourself this work, Roma, but recognize the value of love, too.<eos> It's okay. I can do it.<eos> What I can't do is be with you and Jean.
Don't let me go back to Sacramento!<eos> While you're in Sacramento fighting for our freedom, they're all landing here to get their first taste of it.<eos> Hundred new ones a day.<eos> And I'm gonna screw every one last one of them.<eos> Daniel's smart.<eos> He convinced a whole block on Geary to let him wash their windows for five bucks each. Ah.<eos> But as soon as he gets enough to score, he disappears.<eos> When he comes back, I think, "All right, this time I'll get through."<eos> Yeah, I get that.<eos> Want me to go with you to see him?
Get away from me.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Is that what you do to all your kids?<eos> You give them things, and you try to turn them into your little bitch?<eos> - Daniel...<eos> - I'm not a queer!<eos> You ain't doing me, and I ain't doing you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're... We're sorry.<eos> We don't want anything from you.
These lesions I'm seeing are called Kaposi sarcoma, or KS.<eos> It indicates the immune system is failing.<eos> Is that KS on Bobby's feet?<eos> You know I can't tell you that.<eos> The big question is, what's causing it?<eos> What things set gay men apart... clothing, plants, our bars, or is it... is it gay sex?<eos> I've helped start a KS education research foundation.<eos> With research, we pressure the government for funding.<eos> We have legal support, the Bay Area Reporter, but politically we don't have anyone.<eos> I know you've got Sacramento, but this community trusts you.

Perfect.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Oh, are you Cleve?<eos> I asked you first.<eos> Mike...<eos> Mike Gorman.<eos> Well, Mike, the last thing I need right now is some straight government suit hanging around here screwing with my head.<eos> I don't... I don't represent any government interest.<eos> I'm part of a UCSF research study on KS that may help determine risk factors for what the CDC is calling GRID.<eos> Glad to see our little plague here is so exciting for you.
You know?<eos> I don't think you realize how long that road would be.<eos> I can't go back to Sacramento, not for a while.<eos> I understand.<eos> What use is a gay rights bill if there's no lives to protect?<eos> Stay there for now.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Please, your job is safe here, all right?<eos> But be careful.<eos> Your people need you alive.
"Champagne no-no." Jesus.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> I used the go-to fermenting enchantment.<eos> No fretting. I'll get it right.<eos> Trial and error.<eos> I'm your wife.<eos> I want to be obedient.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Nobody wants to be obedient.<eos> I do want to serve you and Fillory, but...
Yes, well, it was a very messy situation.<eos> At the time, I thought it was right, but the professor who taught it disagreed.<eos> She was fired, and as she was escorted off campus, she said that...<eos> I'm sorry, Henry, this is fascinating, but why are you telling me this?<eos> The professor, Bigby, hinted that she hid all the Battle Magic spells somewhere on campus.<eos> "You'll need them someday," she said,<eos> "And me."<eos> Again, why?<eos> All the Battle Magic spells are hidden in the library.<eos> No one knows the library better than you.
- Traveling.<eos> I don't even know if she's on this planet anymore.<eos> Can't blame her.<eos> - Spit in it.<eos> - What is it?<eos> It's a hangover cure El and I used when we got the shakes.<eos> I amped it up with Nightshade and a couple of Ativans.<eos> Might make you a little woozy, but it could do the trick...<eos> Temporarily.<eos> So keep a stash on you.
Another riddle. Awesome.<eos> Well, if it's, like, where to find her?<eos> "Island made of streets" is Rhode Island.<eos> What?<eos> Duh.<eos> Sorry. Could you spell your last name again?<eos> I would, but... you're asleep.<eos> You said anything.<eos> But this is... this is...<eos> Am I not enough for you?
What?<eos> Duh.<eos> Sorry. Could you spell your last name again?<eos> I would, but... you're asleep.<eos> You said anything.<eos> But this is... this is...<eos> Am I not enough for you?<eos> You're great.<eos> For... who you are.<eos> It's just... I already told you.
Of course I do, darling. Of course.<eos> But it's private.<eos> Well, not anymore.<eos> Plus, these two fuck like jackrabbits.<eos> I mean, you can just smell it. - Ahem.<eos> - And it is delicious, darling.<eos> Bigby, we really are in a time crunch. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - There's a lot at stake. Which I told you would be the case someday, hmm.<eos> Well, welcome to someday.<eos> No one but you can be within 20 feet of the blast.
O... kay.<eos> I'm wondering if maybe you could rub a little into my shoulder.<eos> Yeah, I got a cramp.<eos> Which one?<eos> Both, actually.<eos> I feel guilty.<eos> Why?<eos> Letting you do all the work.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Still, if there's anything I can do for you, let me know.
You could die if you don't get clear of The Beast.<eos> You think I don't know how dangerous he is? No, not him.<eos> Us.<eos> We're going to kill him.<eos> Do what you want with him but not until I get Reynard.<eos> No, we can't wait.<eos> - You won't...<eos> - No, Jules, we can't.<eos> I-I know that you're hurting. I just...<eos> I-I need you to see that this is bigger than you.
I sure as hell didn't make a secret bunker because I thought these things end in a handshake.<eos> Shit! We gotta get out of here.<eos> Hell of a lot safer down here than it is up there.<eos> I think peaceful surrender is a better bet.<eos> Yeah, sounds better than waiting for them to throw a bomb down here and blow us all up.<eos> Okay, well, you're in no condition to go running towards a bunch of armed men.<eos> I think that we're gonna have to stay here.<eos> The real tragedy is that we're gonna die before we can fight over the wedding cake.<eos> Okay.<eos> I understand that sarcasm is your thing and I want to love and accept all parts of you, but can you please not make jokes about dying right now?
I have to have this baby in prison.<eos> And... and who's gonna take him when they take him away from me?<eos> Even my sister, she doesn't have any room and my mother is a mess.<eos> - And Vinnie, he doesn't want it.<eos> - Just look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Your baby is gonna be better than great.<eos> You hear me?<eos> But how do you know?<eos> Because I know you and... you're great.
Hey, don't mind him.<eos> We'll give him back.<eos> Just an obstacle we encountered along the way.<eos> It's your fault.<eos> Taystee!<eos> You!<eos> You're the reason Poussey is gone.<eos> T, don't do this.<eos> They ain't never gonna give us Bayley.<eos> But now I got you.
I promise you that.<eos> I've been down this road.<eos> You don't wanna be like me.<eos> - You don't wanna be like... - Shut up!<eos> Just trying to save your own damn life.<eos> I miss her so much!<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I miss her so much!<eos> - I got you.
The article was just posted.<eos> We know what a tough sell this is.<eos> I know all about tough sells.<eos> That's why my car kite never took off.<eos> Is that a kite you fly out of your car?<eos> Patent pending.<eos> Don't try to steal it.<eos> I've been wanting to do that since we remodeled.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.
There's that "happy to satisfy and I'll be on my way" thing that I love.<eos> Can we do the thing that I love?<eos> Sure.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Yeah, I think you're a little short.<eos> I'm so sorry, there was a kid who was selling candy bars for his basketball team and I wadded up a 20 and threw it at him.<eos> - Do you want a giant Kit Kat?<eos> And the $20.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's an ATM machine downstairs. I will come down with you.
You gave her something with a button?<eos> You've been in an elevator with her, you know she has no impulse control.<eos> Fair point.<eos> But, Mom...<eos> Agh. Nope. No sale.<eos> Imagine if you'd been alone, and you ended up on the floor all day with no one to help you...<eos> and something dire happens.<eos> I would never be able to forgive myself, ever.<eos> Oh, Bud...<eos> I mean, if you don't want to do it for you, then, please, do it for me.
Sanka?<eos> Sanka?<eos> Sanka?<eos> - I'll have a...<eos> I'll have a splash. - We're good.<eos> She cracks me up.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.<eos> Too bad I have to let her go.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> I, um... I need to talk to you.
Honestly, that has been our biggest stumbling block.<eos> Okay, my team has been working on this and I think that they might really be onto something.<eos> So if you have time, I would love to bring them in here - and let them pitch their ideas to you?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pitch to us.<eos> As in, we don't have to do anything?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's my favorite amount of things to do.<eos> So glad we made these sister dates a thing, just me and you and your phone.
I remember after the butterflies, I had a hot dog and a Fresca, which I ate while sitting on a green bench near the lilac bushes.<eos> Okay, stop showing off.<eos> I feel terrible about this.<eos> Sol...<eos> "terrible" would be Bud not getting the kind of support and skilled help he deserves at his firm.<eos> - You know what, you're right.<eos> - Mm-hmm. And I should be the one to let her go, not Bud.<eos> She was our secretary first.<eos> That's true.<eos> You want me to come with you?
Maybe these just provide a nice excuse for kids to not check in with their parents as much.<eos> That is not what's happening here.<eos> I think you gave me this contraption to keep you calm.<eos> You don't have to wear it if you don't want to, Mom.<eos> I'll call you more. - I'll call you every day.<eos> - Every day?<eos> Ugh. I don't want to be tied to my phone.<eos> Look, love ya.<eos> Ultimately, there comes a point when it's time to hand it over to the leaders of tomorrow.<eos> Sol, this must be so hard for you.
What?<eos> He goes back and has to correct your corrections.<eos> He says you're changing the way he wants it done and he feels like you double his workload and slow him down.<eos> Bugger off, Dad.<eos> He said that?<eos> Well, that last bit I may have heard only in my head.<eos> I just wanted to make sure he was successful.<eos> Well, he's the one who has to make sure he's successful.<eos> And truthfully, he's not the only one waiting for you to retire.<eos> I've just been holding on for you, too.
The victim of the shooting, ambulance driver Paul Rodgers, spoke for the first time about the ordeal in which he suddenly found himself caught up.'<eos> 'I heard the gunfire. And I felt something hit my chest, and I knew right away I'd been shot.<eos> And...<eos> And I thought, "This is it."<eos> I thought I... I was dead.'<eos> 'Meanwhile, police raids continue across London...' '..convict and the accomplices who orchestrated the brazen getaway more than three weeks ago.<eos> Members of Rhodesia's diplomatic mission arrived in London today in an effort to gain parliament's support, as Rhodesia's ruling white government continues its civil war against African nationalists.'<eos> What do you want?<eos> We're... We're fellow soldiers.<eos> We come to you as comrades against the forces of oppression.
- What action?<eos> - Go on, have some.<eos> There's Some Rassclaats that need attending.<eos> They've been carving out territory, started doing some business with some white boys, moving their heroin up and down the block.<eos> Just messing up brothers and sisters.<eos> You know how I feel about that shit.<eos> So, we're to do what?<eos> Go get 'em, shut 'em down.<eos> That's got nothing to do with us.<eos> Nothing to do with you.
Marcus, what happened?<eos> You wanted me to do something.<eos> I did.<eos> 'Hello?<eos> 'Hello?<eos> Jas?<eos> Say something.<eos> If you called me, you...<eos> you want to talk.<eos> Just tell me where - anywhere, Jas - and I'll come to you.'
- Jas.<eos> - Stay there.<eos> - No, I'm alone.<eos> - Not for me, for you.<eos> Stay there.<eos> We need money.<eos> Jas, this... this thing you're doing... it's not a cause.<eos> I know how you feel about your father.<eos> I know you feel so guilty.<eos> That would be so convenient for you, if I was just some silly little girl with daddy problems.
I got lucky.<eos> I almost killed someone when we broke Dhari out of prison.<eos> We can't devolve into violence.<eos> - Nobody died when I went...<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> The point is, we're soldiers and soldiers fight.<eos> Symbolic action, not murder.<eos> You understand?<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Not you, him.
You're not English.<eos> Afrikaner?<eos> Are you a Rhodey yourself?<eos> Sad.<eos> People always did look at you Boers as being the hayseeds up the Empire's back end.<eos> Fighting a war you know you can't win.<eos> And all this talk about the Immigration Act.<eos> The unclean and the unworthy.<eos> Must hurt, knowing they're not just talking about us.<eos> They're talking about you.
A predictable attack has a predictable outcome.<eos> With the Rhodesians, you just weren't predictable.<eos> I don't think your man has a problem with your tactics,<eos> I think the problem was you succeeding without him.<eos> You hurt that in the attack?<eos> There are better ways.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.<eos> These three, the convict and the two that got him out, what are you hearing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - That's not like you.

You need to mind how you talk about Jas.<eos> I don't like it when you imply you'd have relations with her.<eos> How's that wrong that Jas is worth having?<eos> - Or that I say it to your face?<eos> - Don't talk about her.<eos> You and me are like brothers.<eos> Haven't we always got on like brothers?<eos> So what's your problem, acting all...?<eos> Mom and Dad talked you down on the telly, saying you're under the spell of some Uga Buga Man?<eos> I'm wise to you, boy.
To be a soldier, you have to live like one.<eos> What?<eos> You.<eos> You remind me of... people.<eos> Keep it.<eos> Learn it.<eos> Pass it on.<eos> That's how the revolution sustains itself.<eos> Sis?<eos> He's asking for you.
Your father gave up a civil servant job to help liberate the poor.<eos> She's fighting to speak French instead of English.<eos> That isn't much of an objective.<eos> The Naxal Movement is about equality and self-preservation.<eos> That's what my father fought for, it's what Eliette is fighting for.<eos> - You just don't get it.<eos> - I don't get what?<eos> I don't get the fight?<eos> The police brutality, racism?<eos> It's not the same for you.
We don't know Dhari.<eos> Not the way we thought.<eos> We don't know Leroy, we don't know these Germans.<eos> This has all turned into a big fucking circus.<eos> We need a real soldier!<eos> What we need is people who believe in what we believe.<eos> This is our thing.<eos> You and I have got to stay partners in our mission.<eos> Partners?<eos> Being partners doesn't mean disappearing in you.
I'll see ya.<eos> I got a message from them.<eos> Jas sent me a message.<eos> Sent it how?<eos> She said what's happening now, they're doing it in Julian's name.<eos> Your boyfriend?<eos> This can't be about Julian.<eos> He was an advocate, he wasn't a killer.<eos> If you know anything... you need to tell somebody before Pence finds out.<eos> He's gonna take it out on them, on you... on your brother.
Eliette?<eos> I want to read the next communique.<eos> After this action, I want to read the next communique to the press.<eos> Alright.<eos> It's the Black Army Faction.<eos> They keep calling it the Bishop-Mitra Gang.<eos> I can't help what people call it.<eos> It makes our objectives unclear if people aren't clear about who we are.<eos> We're the Black Army Faction.<eos> It's not just about you and Dhari.
The friend, the Irish girl?<eos> I think she's coming around.<eos> We stay with her, we're likely to get a break.<eos> The Germans told me they have passage for me to Algeria.<eos> When?<eos> Thursday.<eos> From there, I can get to Lebanon, spend three months training, then back to Canada.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can stay with us.<eos> We need you.
Thursday.<eos> From there, I can get to Lebanon, spend three months training, then back to Canada.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can stay with us.<eos> We need you.<eos> This isn't my fight.<eos> Self-determination, if it's here, if it's in Canada...<eos> It's not my crowd, okay?<eos> They are not my crowd.<eos> The Germans could get you to Algeria too.
Maybe.<eos> I've got a son who's not mu...<eos> If you won't do right, blood is gonna run in the streets.<eos> This is how it begins.<eos> All the slum buildings you run, this is all you got?<eos> Well, you got two problems.<eos> You're all as hot as hell.<eos> And any place I could put you, well, you alienated a whole bunch of coloreds<eos> - cutting people up.<eos> - Man, what we did, we did that for you.
And that's all I get in return?<eos> I really thought...<eos> I put that... little hooligan brother of yours in a hole...<eos> Wait. - ..<eos> I thought you'd wake up some.<eos> You said you'd got him out. You said you'd got my brother out of jail.<eos> Well, how would I get him out if I wasn't the one who put him in?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Sit the fuck down.<eos> All the time I've put into you, you don't get to walk out.
I think they might all be trying to go to Lebanon.<eos> Were there any other operations planned?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They weren't part of our cell.<eos> We are not responsible for them.<eos> So, they just happened to come across a copy of your manifesto and generously decided to read it out?<eos> Where are they now?<eos> I don't know!<eos> How I can I tell you something that I do not know?<eos> What are we going to do with you?
He's turning me into a streetwalker.<eos> Does he beat you?<eos> Take money off you?<eos> He leaves me money.<eos> He's scaring you by leaving you money?<eos> He wants to take my son.<eos> And he'll get him.<eos> If he's reported you to the soc', your boy's lost.<eos> Then... Then, help me!<eos> You really expect me to expend my political capital to help you, an informant?
Her shoes, particularly.<eos> The ones she wore in the garden.<eos> The ones she wore to temple.<eos> Mom.<eos> What are you gonna say to Grace when she asks what happened to the kitchen floor?<eos> I'm gonna tell her not to look at the ceiling.<eos> Well, shall we?<eos> Uh, it's a buffet.<eos> I based it on one that I love at Caesar's Palace.<eos> After you.
I do, too.<eos> You don't want to do that to your kids.<eos> I know. I don't.<eos> It just doesn't feel like I have a lot of options.<eos> If the kids were not in the picture, what would you do?<eos> I mean, don't you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy?<eos> I'd settle for someone who wants to be in the same room as me.<eos> No, wrong.<eos> You need someone who wants to be with you all the time. Who loves you even when you hate yourself.<eos> And no matter where you go or what you do, he still wants to be with you.
- Are those for me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I call them "flower and additional flowers."<eos> Well, you're wasting your money because I steal my flowers from Grace's bedroom.<eos> But thank you.<eos> Frankie...<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> It just threw me that you already had this whole plan in place.<eos> Well, I didn't want to assume that we're at the point where my future plans would affect you.
So, what if, when the time comes, you come with me?<eos> To Santa Fe?<eos> Yes, you'd love it there.<eos> It's an artist community.<eos> Deeply spiritual.<eos> And we'd only be an hour away from Albuquerque, which, as you know, is...<eos> Is the hot air balloon capital of the world.<eos> Jacob, don't do this to me.<eos> Why?<eos> You'd love it there. That town... was made for you.
Maureen.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look how beautiful this is.<eos> Shall we put it on her?<eos> - She'd hate it.<eos> - Oh, she would.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is beautiful.<eos> How about if I buy it for you?
I guess it does.<eos> You gonna bogart that thing?<eos> Brianna taught me some pot words.<eos> You know, I actually enjoyed spending time with Robert today.<eos> I thought you had plans to hate him forever.<eos> Plans can change.<eos> They really can.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> Balloons.<eos> It's never a straight line with you, is it?
- Previously on Good Witch...<eos> - I saw you and Sam.
- Sam. - I couldn't save him.<eos> - Nick, this is...<eos> - Courtney.<eos> - Courtney.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Some mornings, right when I wake up, I realize I'm thinking about Jake and I remember.<eos> - You lied to me?<eos> - I was trying to protect you.<eos> You may have ruined my one chance at reconnecting with my mother.<eos> When I woke up this morning, I was thinking about you.
- Hey.<eos> - Oh, hey. - Where you headed?<eos> - Home.<eos> - But mine is that way, so...<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Bye. Bye.<eos> So, what did you guys do all day?<eos> School.<eos> Then walking home from school.<eos> Then running into you walking home from school.
So many things in this town are very unique.<eos> No, but this... this is more than that.<eos> I suspect it might be sui generis.<eos> There might not be another one like it on earth.<eos> Then I can see why you're so interested in it.<eos> Isn't this spectacular, Cassie?<eos> Just think, right here in Middleton we have something that is almost certainly one-of-a-kind!<eos> These flowers are beautiful.<eos> Thank you, Sam.<eos> I just wanted you to know I was thinking about you.
I had been meaning to find the right time to ask you how you felt about all this.<eos> - So I guess the right time is now, huh?<eos> - Seems like it.<eos> So, how do you feel about all this?<eos> I feel fine.<eos> I mean, I really like Sam, and I see how happy he makes you.<eos> It's just...<eos> Go ahead.<eos> It's just, everything has been "you and I" for so long, and now it's going to be more... crowded than that.<eos> My life will never be too crowded for you.
Fine, I give up.<eos> Good.<eos> Now.<eos> The nucleus and the organelles are enclosed in a membrane.<eos> Oh, okay, so it's like "Eukary" them inside something else. Yes.<eos> Yeah, that is a great way to remember it.<eos> It's 'cause I've got the best teacher in town.<eos> Well, thanks for all the learning.<eos> I'll try to remember to thank you during my graduation speech.<eos> Oh no, no, you'd better, since I'll be the one speaking right after you're done.

Oh, nothing.
Well, thanks for all the learning.<eos> I'll try to remember to thank you during my graduation speech.<eos> Oh no, no, you'd better, since I'll be the one speaking right after you're done.<eos> - Bye, Grace.<eos> - So...<eos> - Hi.<eos> What's going on with you and Nick? Oh, nothing.<eos> We were just studying.<eos> - What, "Uh-huh"?<eos> It's just that he practically had his arm all the way around you, and then I saw him acting all sweet.
No.<eos> That is Nick just being Nick.<eos> - Well, I'll say it again: uh-huh.<eos> There's nothing going on between me and him!<eos> Okay. Just make sure to let me know when the two of you start dating.<eos> Okay, here's a lollipop.<eos> See you next time.<eos> Oh, Cassie.<eos> I'll let Sam know you're here.<eos> Oh, except I came here to bring something to you.
It makes a great tea, very soothing.<eos> But when you drink it, tell people it's Malabathrum... keeps them guessing.<eos> How did you know I would like something like this?<eos> I thought it'd be something you could keep here in the office, for those days when nothing seems to be going right.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - She brought me some Malabathrum.<eos> That's "cinnamon tea" if you were going to try to guess. I wasn't.<eos> Well, you never would have.<eos> You know, before there were doctors like you, people used cinnamon as an anti-inflammatory.
- You're not sure you want him to.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I mean, Nick and I are such great friends, right, but what if we dated and things didn't work out?<eos> That could ruin everything.<eos> So you're going to say no?<eos> I don't know what I'm going to say.<eos> Look, I've been asked out by way too many men to count.<eos> And there's a few of them I actually wanted to stay friends with.<eos> So what you have to do is, before he gets to the asking, you start talking about what a great friend he is to you, and then very smoothly transition into listing all the things you're looking for in a romantic partner,<eos> but make sure that nothing applies to him like, totally the opposite of him and he'll start to realize that he's not the guy for you.
- Yeah?<eos> - When did these come in? - Oh, yesterday morning.<eos> - More Quadrivium candles.<eos> - What does that word even mean?<eos> I think it's Latin for "crossroads."<eos> - Can you help me find something? - Of course.<eos> - Ben's been working so hard lately, going from job to job, that he says his whole body hurts.<eos> I just thought maybe one of your herbal cream mixtures might take away the soreness.<eos> I'm sure we can find something.<eos> Which is why I always come running to you.
What would you have said to him if he did ask?<eos> I would have said no.<eos> Then you should have been honest with him and told him how you really feel.<eos> I guess I didn't realize that was an option.<eos> Why don't you tell me what you're feeling?<eos> About Nick?<eos> He's like a brother to me.<eos> He's the kind of guy that stays in your life forever.<eos> Not just some guy who wants to go out with me on a couple dates.<eos> And there are gonna be a lot of other guys to ask you out on those.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I got you something. - What is it?<eos> - Well, I called some guys on the force and I managed to get a current phone number for your mom.<eos> - I thought she changed it? - She did.<eos> And this is what it is right now.<eos> I never thought I'd be able to get in touch with her again.<eos> Now you can.<eos> If you want to.<eos> It's up to you.
- What?<eos> Because I thought you liked him, and I didn't want to get in the way of all that.<eos> No, no. Nick and I are just friends.<eos> Really?<eos> Because you kind of seem like a lot more than that.<eos> Because of how good of friends we are.<eos> So, it would be okay if...<eos> Oh my gosh,<eos> - you like him!<eos> - Only if it's okay with you.
Hey, maybe one of the guys can get your camera to work.<eos> I think that might be dead forever.<eos> Now go!<eos> Okay.<eos> See ya.<eos> Guess who?<eos> - Sam?<eos> Sam.<eos> - I never get to sneak up on you.<eos> - It's for you.
- Sam?<eos> Sam.<eos> - I never get to sneak up on you.<eos> - It's for you.<eos> - Aw, beautiful.<eos> Oh gosh.<eos> Abigail must not have gotten all the thorns off.<eos> Let me get something for that.<eos> - No, no, that's okay.<eos> - Let me take care of you.
Wow.<eos> I hope it's not, you know, too kinky... but... bam!<eos> Wow.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We don't have to, you know, try it if you don't want to.<eos> - Wanna make sure everybody's comfortable...<eos> - I love it!<eos> - You do? - Yes!<eos> It'll be totally worth the hives.<eos> - Bud, I've never seen this side of you. - Mmm.
I mentioned that I had carpal tunnel and she shoved it in my purse.<eos> Is it for...<eos> It is for us to use... on me.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> I know.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> Very cool.<eos> If it's too weird for you, we don't have to.
- Hey.<eos> I saw you through the window, so I wanted to come say hi and bring you this. I signed for it.<eos> My prescription shampoo!<eos> Awesome!<eos> It's regular shampoo, it just has medicine in it.<eos> Not... There's not a problem.<eos> Some people, they hear "prescription," they think...<eos> Hi, I'm Mallory.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, Coyote's told me so much about you.
- Yeah.<eos> I'm glad I met him when I did.<eos> Sort of marches to the beat of his own drummer, doesn't he?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I was watching you two at the meeting.<eos> You looked very cute together.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> Okay, I've known the guy since he was five years old and, believe me, it's like that.<eos> What?<eos> Totally. He's crazy about you.
I bet you are.<eos> I'll whip up something for you.<eos> Gluten-free pancakes?<eos> I'd throw some strawberries on there if I hadn't eaten them all. Sorry about that.<eos> Ended up needing the energy, though, am I right, babe?<eos> Right, babe?<eos> Quick scramble?<eos> Babe?<eos> Allison?<eos> If I'd known you were as good at this as you were at stealing my husband, I would've gone into business with you.
But you're gonna have to tell her sooner rather than later.<eos> Take it from a man who told her later and really wishes he told her sooner.<eos> Can I tell her when she's asleep?<eos> Or under the hair dryer, or general anesthesia?<eos> Frankie, get in here!<eos> Oh, God, she heard us.<eos> - You think she heard us?<eos> - No.<eos> Be cool.<eos> Right behind you, kid.
I just... took another spin around the old block.<eos> But that sound you were making was way different from the sound you make with me.<eos> - And?<eos> - Does that mean it's better?<eos> They were just two different experiences.<eos> Like surf and turf.<eos> Surf and turf is one experience by definition.<eos> - Not the way I eat it.<eos> - You're not answering the question.<eos> I had an amazing time with you.
That was some of the best sex that we've ever had.<eos> Why don't you make that sound with me?<eos> No, it has nothing to do with you.<eos> It's just... It's a perfectly designed machine.<eos> Okay.<eos> I get it.<eos> You're well-designed, too. Okay, okay.<eos> Enough with the adorable bullshit.<eos> Don't be mad at the vibrator.<eos> When I'm with you, it's beautiful and it really means something.
- Are you gonna read that thing or not?<eos> - I'm reading.<eos> I mean, paragraph three is a real quagmire.<eos> When does it end with the "there-tos" and "here-to-fores" because I'm trapped in the world's longest run-on sentence.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> Well, you go off on your own, you run the risk of getting notes.<eos> Well, I guess going off on my own feels like the thing to do these days.<eos> Okay, let's unpack that last remark a little.<eos> Have you unpacked your stuff with Jacob?<eos> Well, no, I wanted to do it with you first.
I'm like beach erosion, Grace:<eos> I'm happening.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> All right, but we let the lawyer do the talking.<eos> I don't talk. Got it?<eos> Fine, but I'm driving.<eos> [scoffs] I'm driving.<eos> That is the second set of my car keys that disappeared down that sewer grate.<eos> I didn't drop this set, you did.<eos> Yeah, because you screamed, "He's after you!"
[Frankie on recording] Hello, Frankie.<eos> Hope you're feeling extra good today.<eos> I almost got attacked by a bat, but other than that, I'm good.<eos> Now remember:<eos> you don't have to look outside yourself.<eos> You have everything you need inside.<eos> - I do.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> You said you didn't want to talk.<eos> But I didn't think I'd have to listen to a conversation between you and you.
I'm certainly not crazy about lawyers, I used to be married to one.<eos> Surely... there's some way that we can work this out on our own.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> How about I make this whole thing go away over dinner?<eos> Hey, I know I'm hungry.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Stop right there. Let me set the record straight.<eos> Us sitting on this table was a power thing, not a sex thing.<eos> - Frankie...<eos> - Yes, you may argue that power and sex are the same thing, and I might agree with you under different circumstances.
I don't know. He went to Popeye's half an hour ago.<eos> I think he got held up by those protesters.<eos> Why are you everywhere?<eos> Hate is not a family value!<eos> Neither is throwing soda on a child!<eos> I was trying to throw it at you!<eos> [crowd yelling] I'll get you.<eos> I'm gonna get you!<eos> I don't know why you're mad at me.<eos> I'm mad at you because I had him exactly where I wanted him.
And they hadn't perfected edibles yet.<eos> All of this is gonna change.<eos> As the doctor said, we have some major lifestyle changes to make.<eos> And I'm gonna help you.<eos> First thing tomorrow, we're going to get you a nutritionist, gonna start an exercise program.<eos> Good God!<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm going to cancel my trip to Santa Fe this week. No.<eos> I don't want anybody cancelling anything for me.<eos> I don't want to be away from you.

No.<eos> I don't want anybody cancelling anything for me.<eos> I don't want to be away from you.<eos> Maybe I should go with you.
I wish I could help.<eos> Then stay out of it.<eos> Stay at home and play housewife?<eos> I don't care what you call it.<eos> The only thing that matters is righting this ship, and we'll both do whatever it takes to do that, right?<eos> That means playing our roles... me the good soldier, you the good citizen.<eos> Because I wasn't before, right?<eos> Do we have to get back into this?<eos> I was trying to protect you.<eos> I can take care of myself, but Charlie and Gracie need you right now.
The French have helped us greatly, and they are too powerful to combat.<eos> For years, I've heard that dismal...<eos> Haven't had a signal from you in a while.<eos> I've become more popular than I want to be.<eos> Nice to be popular.<eos> Not in our line of work.<eos> Our friends with the red hands seem to think differently.<eos> Catchy PR campaign they got going.<eos> Any luck making contact with 'em?<eos> They're a closed loop. As far as I can tell, they want to talk, they come to you.
There are rules here.<eos> - Don't we need that stuff?<eos> - You're not listening to me.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're gonna stay safe.<eos> So no stealing stuff, knucklehead.<eos> - No breaking the rules.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Listen, things are different, right?<eos> So you can let me and Dad take care of you again.
Can't you see?<eos> That child is a poison.<eos> He burned my book.<eos> I don't give a shit about your book.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> - You're making a big mistake.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> Okay, move on.<eos> This is what we've collected on Broussard since you've been gone.
Are we gonna be okay?<eos> They need to find Broussard and the thing he took from the Rap.<eos> As long as I seem useful, we'll be okay.<eos> I'll keep working to find out what they have on us.<eos> How's Charlie?<eos> Lindsey went after him, and I threw her out.<eos> I've already called Maddie.<eos> I'm gonna go up there tonight.<eos> I'm gonna get ahead of this.<eos> And a messenger, dropped off clothes for you.
What happened?<eos> Thanks for bringing me home.<eos> I love what they've done to my place.<eos> [coughing] Watch your step.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> We can't, Katie.<eos> I know.<eos> Even if we dropped him at the Green Zone gates, best case scenario-- they'll just get him healthy enough to torture.<eos> Then he gives up you and everybody else.

He wants to talk to you.
What did he see?<eos> I made sure to only show him the empty ones and that seemed to satisfy his curiosity.<eos> For the moment.<eos> [clears throat] I know Nolan very well, which means I know his ambitions.<eos> He isn't satisfied with merely being the deputy to a bloc governor.<eos> And that's why I felt it was my duty to alert you about his visit.<eos> You know, in-- in case his actions have broken rank in any way.<eos> Well, thank you for the call, Alan.<eos> I appreciate it. I'm at your service.<eos> This belongs to you.
I wouldn't want you to be late. Let's-- let's just-- let's just--<eos> A little-- a little while longer.<eos> Nothing would be better.<eos> But you need to get going.<eos> It's okay if you're nervous.<eos> It's a big day.<eos> - I'm not sure if I can--<eos> - Hey...<eos> This isn't about anything else.<eos> It's about me and you, right?
I made a mista-- mistake. I shouldn't be here.<eos> Get on the ground, now!<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> Please, I don't want-- I don't--<eos> He didn't reach the target, but it's done.<eos> They're gonna want to know where I was yesterday.<eos> Can't you tell them that you were working on a case?<eos> I can't get a cup of coffee without them asking questions.<eos> But you'll be okay, right?<eos> They need you.
- That's right.<eos> So what is this new music counting down to?<eos> How did it go?<eos> He'll know it's gone.<eos> He won't have time to know.<eos> What about after?<eos> When Snyder finds that key card missing, I'm the first one he'll throw in solitary.<eos> Haven't you ever wanted to be a part of something bigger than yourself?<eos> This is your chance.<eos> I saw something in you. The moment I first saw you on that bus,
Will.<eos> Will.<eos> Charlie, Gracie.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What happened?<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - They've been relocated.<eos> He never listened to you.<eos> Not many people could have done that.<eos> I owe you.
Yeah. They're sisters.<eos> According to your file, they both grew up in a military family.<eos> - Navy.<eos> - Mm. Typically, military families are close.<eos> Do they fight much?<eos> Like I said, they're sisters.<eos> How often does your wife go visit Ms. Kenner in the Green Zone?<eos> What's with all the questions?<eos> I just want to get to know the Bowman family a little bit better.<eos> Let's talk about you, Bob.
So we have to find him before the Occupation.<eos> The dead jumper had a radio in his backpack.<eos> I memorized the frequency and then scrambled it.<eos> Will Bowman... that's a clever piece of sabotage.<eos> Just trying to keep up.<eos> I'll go to Broussard.<eos> If the pilot really is Resistance, he might reach out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> Bob's been asking questions about you.
They might have tracked that conversation.<eos> We've gotta go.<eos> They took him.<eos> Then there's nothing you can do.<eos> You have to trust Will to handle himself.<eos> My kids are in danger. Will you help?<eos> Of course.<eos> Did you know I was Internal Affairs before the Arrival?<eos> Of course you were.<eos> That's exactly the attitude I used to get from guys like you.
But we were able to eliminate a key mole at Homeland.<eos> Because he escaped with the pilot.<eos> Your relentless focus on the negative isn't productive.<eos> I'm achieving some real gains in my bloc.<eos> By what metrics, exactly?<eos> Growth of the Greatest Day, expansion of our security apparatus... our youth.<eos> None of that matters.<eos> You came to me with a plan to fix the bloc, and you have failed.<eos> I'm not the one who went to the IGA and made promises I couldn't keep.<eos> I made those promises because I misplaced my trust in you.
No.<eos> I believe in my people... and my approach, and I will not be undermined.<eos> Very well.<eos> That's all.<eos> Get me Alan Snyder.<eos> Dad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I made contact with the pilot.<eos> She wants to meet you at a neutral site.<eos> Why didn't she come here with you?
We know they're putting foreskin in skin grafts.<eos> It was on the Oprah Winfrey Show.<eos> And they're putting it into the face creams you all use, the girls.<eos> Hold up. They do not put foreskins in face creams.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> It helps bloody collagen or something like that.<eos> Cassidy, that is a lie.<eos> You'd feel those itty-bitty foreskins on you.<eos> What you feel is smoother, younger-seeming skin. See?<eos> And that's how they hook you.
God's gone.<eos> Missing is what they said.<eos> Most likely walking the Earth.<eos> This angel said?<eos> That you commanded with your power?<eos> Genesis, that's right.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Missing where?<eos> Well, you're the scholar.<eos> We're asking you.
Sit.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He cut out for Dodge City first light. Join up with Wyatt Earp.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Midnight train.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's on his way to San Antone, to cornhole your mother, the whore.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> You're the...<eos> Yeah. I've heard about you.
Now, you all need to decompress, so it is essential you do not go right back to school.<eos> No school?<eos> No school?<eos> On second thought, I'm fine.<eos> Look, I can sit with my chair turned around, just like you.<eos> I knew one day there'd be another.<eos> Go.<eos> Go with God.<eos> Bart, are you coming?<eos> Ooh, definitely no school for you.
Take a hike, homeboy.<eos> What the hey?<eos> Just giving him his allowance.<eos> This pamphlet on trauma they gave Bart is very alarming.<eos> Loss of appetite?<eos> Thousand-yard stare.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Where are you looking?<eos> A thousand yards away.<eos> No school for you, young man.
Oh, my God!<eos> Charlie didn't come back up!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Look who's back!<eos> Kamp Krusty alumni!<eos> We have reason to believe that someone was killed in this camp!<eos> Whoa! What happened to hello?<eos> Hard to concentrate with waves gently lapping on the shore.<eos> Marge, are you sure you want to do this?<eos> Mm, I think I still want the old you.
And vote!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> Whoa, I guess I really was traumatized.<eos> And now I'm glad everything's all right.<eos> So many stars.<eos> Ever wonder how many worlds are out there, Homie?<eos> Pizza.<eos> Want pizza.<eos> And you.
Oh, my God,<eos> If I fall asleep and my hand goes down my pants, do not worry... it is not sexual.<eos> I'm just instinctually protecting the family line.<eos> What's up?<eos> It's your boy.<eos> Little Zika update.<eos> So I died for a little bit, because I saw a bright light, and I felt this bony hand on my shoulder, and it wasn't Grandma this time.<eos> That was really good, Morgan.<eos> Let's just keep rolling, and I'm just gonna rattle off some will and testament stuff.<eos> I'm gonna leave all my dogs to you, Tam.

She didn't tell you?<eos> Tamra caught Anna's husband cheating on her.<eos> - What?<eos> Wait, were you filming that?<eos> I am, and...<eos> Oh, I think I just posted it.<eos> What?<eos> Delete it before WikiLeaks gets it.<eos> I can't. It already reposted on HuffPost Divorce.<eos> She didn't tell you?
Okay, who would believe you in a court of law?<eos> Hello, Bowdoin Student Affairs?<eos> Yes, I'm calling from Later Baby.<eos> I have been abducted by a deranged Asian woman and transported across state lines, but I promise you I will be there.<eos> Come on, Mindy.<eos> No, Jody, just chill out, please.<eos> - Oh. - Mindy.<eos> I thought you were at that college.<eos> No, I bailed on that.<eos> I thought it'd be way more fun to hang out with you and Lindsay, unless she's too tired from playing all that mini golf.
Okay, well, how is the house hunt coming?<eos> You know, New Jersey prices can be incredibly expensive.<eos> Maybe you should broaden your search to, like, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Alaska.<eos> You would love Alaska.<eos> I don't know. Ben doesn't seem like he's in any hurry for me to leave.<eos> You know what, lady?<eos> I know what you're doing, and it's not gonna work.<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> I'm letting Ben make his own decisions.<eos> Will he choose me, the mother of his child, or you, the mother of someone else's child?
I shot him dead.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Ben, do you understand my story?<eos> I think so.<eos> You just drank so much whiskey.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> Ben, face it.<eos> It's like that old saying we have in the South...<eos> "That woman is trying to get back with you."
Ben, do you understand my story?<eos> I think so.<eos> You just drank so much whiskey.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> Ben, face it.<eos> It's like that old saying we have in the South...<eos> "That woman is trying to get back with you."<eos> I guess I liked that two women were fighting over me.<eos> Hey, I get it.<eos> The only thing better is having three women fighting over you.
So, hey, hi.<eos> Are you going to the Allens' hot-dog-and-horseshoes thing later?<eos> No.<eos> The Forstmans' firefly thing?<eos> No.<eos> The Olins' jellyfish fry thing?<eos> I'm not going to any things at all!<eos> But I want to, um, hang out.<eos> What?<eos> Why? I've never met anyone like you before.
No.<eos> The Forstmans' firefly thing?<eos> No.<eos> The Olins' jellyfish fry thing?<eos> I'm not going to any things at all!<eos> But I want to, um, hang out.<eos> What?<eos> Why? I've never met anyone like you before.<eos> Anyone with, you know, I don't know, um, morals.<eos> Oh. Well, I guess it is a little judgy of me to be completely disgusted by you.
What a deal!<eos> My whole job is to not make eye contact with him.<eos> I thought I'd get tired of window-shopping in this fancy little town, but it ain't happening.<eos> A chessboard where the pieces are lipsticks!<eos> A horse show!<eos> A protest!<eos> Blake, is that you?<eos> What happened to your privilege?<eos> I checked it.<eos> Lisa, when you rejected me, I knew I had to do whatever it took to become worthy of you.
You wanted to see me, Mr. G?<eos> Relax, Homer, we're good.<eos> When you entered my gates, I knew you'd turn your back on Old Man Burns.<eos> And I respect that.<eos> Yeah. I ditched him, all right.<eos> In his hour of need.<eos> But I feel good about it.<eos> Really good.<eos> Oh... I missed that.<eos> Because I know you're so loyal to me, I have a very special job for you.
- Shut up, Miata.<eos> - Oh. Put that rare roast beef in a baggie.<eos> Mm-hmm, that one.<eos> So, Praline, are you with us or against us?<eos> Jay G took everything from me.<eos> You best believe I'm going to take everything from him.<eos> Get the ham!<eos> We're really glad to have you. Thanks for your help.<eos> Who you thanking'?<eos> I'm not doing this for you, boo boo kitty.
So now I'm here.<eos> If you can't handle a strong female hologram, that's on you.<eos> Jay G and D-O-double-G.<eos> We flipped the script.<eos> This ultimate betrayal is part of your spiritual journey.<eos> Lesson one: protect your neck.<eos> Say good-bye to your revenge rap forever.<eos> 'Cause it's about to drop.<eos> Mmm. Party at the power plant, y'all.<eos> I swear on the squid beak of Lord Cthulhu and all his briny shoggoths, I will get revenge on you, Jay G.
Next Doorables... or the Lavender Zeppelin?<eos> I just don't know anymore.<eos> A customer!<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> Baby, I'm sorry.<eos> I stayed loyal to Mr. Burns, coproduced a failed revenge rap, and now we've got nothing.<eos> I know it's crazy, but he needed me.<eos> Oh, it's okay, Homie.<eos> You're not mad?<eos> Your heart told you to stick with Mr. Burns, and the thing I love about you most is you've got a heart as big as The Ritz.
Tell me, Jay.<eos> Why'd you betray me?<eos> We were kindred souls.<eos> Brothers in avarice.<eos> Why? Because you told me to!<eos> In your own last chapter.<eos> "You will never be truly ruthless until you destroy the one who made you."<eos> I had to tear you down, M.B.!<eos> It was the final rung.<eos> I just wanted to be ruthless, like you.
Toss in a bag of chips.<eos> Yep, that's Homer.<eos> - Who's Homer?<eos> - The pig behind the desk.<eos> To a less secure man, being mistaken for a pig would be a wakeup call.<eos> This is great.<eos> All I had to do was say I'm crazy on my permanent record, and I get to bring a pig to work.<eos> - Yeah, they are pretty lax here. - That's right.<eos> I got turned down by McDonald's, but, here, they paid me the whole year I was in jail.<eos> You said you were getting rid of him.
Wow, you understand how I feel.<eos> Yes, because I feel about my pig the way you used to feel about your honk-a-ma-flute.<eos> Okay, back to what really matters.<eos> So, I get the ball and I pivot to first... Ooh!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I'm so sorry, Dad! - Accidents happen.<eos> Wow, Homie.<eos> Spilled gravy is one of your top three strangulation triggers.<eos> I could never strangle a boy... in front of the pig.<eos> I think he really has become a support animal for you.
Yes.<eos> No.<eos> You're still here?<eos> No offense, but you look worse.<eos> Your lack of remorse just makes me grow.<eos> Ha!<eos> Joke's on you... I like gross things.<eos> Again!<eos> Again! And that leads to mate in three!<eos> I've got to say, it's so exciting to find out something new about you.

And that leads to mate in three!<eos> I've got to say, it's so exciting to find out something new about you.<eos> Hey, I'm full of surprises.<eos> Name another.<eos> Actually, that's it. Tell me something I don't know about you.
- Don't know.<eos> Let me check my pockets.<eos> You're going to tell me everything he said, or I'm going to break you in two.<eos> Dawes is gone, sasa ke?<eos> And the science man, oso. Oye!<eos> Him one with us.<eos> What doing here?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Fodagut, bera, stay back.<eos> I trusted you, you little shit.
The clamps were released manually at the berth.<eos> So Dawes obviously had inside help.<eos> What, so that's it?<eos> They're just gone?<eos> They turned their transponder off and went dark two minutes later. We lost track...<eos> Who's in charge of security at this goddamn station?<eos> That would be me.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Say what you mean.<eos> Either you're doing an incredibly shitty job or you're no longer in control of the people who work for you.
It from Dawes.<eos> In the office.<eos> Play it here.<eos> Fred Johnson.<eos> We have traveled far together, my beratna, but this is where we must part ways.<eos> Ever since I found you, broken, looking for redemption under a Belter knife, I have tried to teach you the Belter way.<eos> I have failed.<eos> You told us that when you destroyed Protogen, the Earth corp responsible for killing so many of our brothers and sisters on Eros, that you destroyed all its secrets as well.<eos> There was nothing left for us to fear.<eos> But instead, you preserved what you could of this terrible new weapon, and took it back to Tycho with you, keeping those secrets for yourself, no doubt believing that when the time comes, as it surely must, you and you alone,

This is the Earther in you still.
Hey, hey, where've you been?<eos> Different places.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, you missed all the action.<eos> I had my share.<eos> Okay, listen, I got me a whole bunch of busted-up hand terminals that I gotta get operational for the refugees and I could really use some help.<eos> So... You gonna give me a hand?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> This is the Earther in you still.
You've got to arrest them, please!<eos> I'm sorry, I really am.<eos> What happened out there is a crime. It should be punished.<eos> But there's nothing I can do about it right now.<eos> Look...<eos> You made it here. You're alive. Hold on to that.<eos> Get some food, grab some mat space and rest.<eos> There's other people from Ganymede here, maybe there's somebody you know.<eos> Hey, bro, here you go.<eos> That's for you.
He helps me with my research, sometimes.<eos> He's a very gifted geneticist.<eos> It's just a soybean.<eos> I'm a botanist.<eos> Go!<eos> Move, move! Move!<eos> I find the missile bay.<eos> I can force open the door, but I need code for launch.<eos> Do what you do for getting done!<eos> We put our lifes on the line for you.
That's why we have a civilization.<eos> So then why don't you help your family.<eos> What?<eos> They're right there on Mars, where you left them.<eos> Goddamn you.<eos> You're gonna throw that in my face?<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> Amos!<eos> Amos!<eos> I don't want to fight you, Alex.
What?<eos> Tycho T.C. refuses to release the clamps until Fred Johnson gives his personal authorization.<eos> And he's not.<eos> All right, I'm on it.<eos> I don't have to let you leave, you know.<eos> With all the time and repairs I put into this ship, it's arguably more mine than yours.<eos> We just saved your life. Call it even.<eos> I know we've had our differences.<eos> But if you find the protomolecule on Ganymede Station...<eos> I sure as hell ain't gonna bring it back to you.

A blood-ox booster... Muscle fatigue inhibitor, and this is Osteo-x, which is a rapid bone-density enhancer.<eos> Starting now.<eos> And I strongly recommend that you use these as well, for when we land.<eos> It's not the landing I imagined.<eos> This you left on your bunk.<eos> I forgot it.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> - You searched my quarters?<eos> - Yes, I did. Because I have orders to follow, too. And the Defense Minister wants you wearing this when you give your statement.<eos> There's a lot riding on you, Gunny.
So I want to say I'm sorry.<eos> She was a good person.<eos> I promise I'll never forget her, nor what she did for me.<eos> Ever.<eos> Amos?<eos> Amos!<eos> Amos!<eos> You didn't answer me when I called.<eos> I was busy.<eos> Come on, we need you upstairs. No.
But if someone's gone, do pictures really help?<eos> I thought you'd enjoy choosing something for yourself, as you're always passing judgments.<eos> I hope you didn't spend too much on this.<eos> Nah. This should cover it.<eos> What's that?<eos> Ooh, I found that at the back of the cupboard with all your old stuff.<eos> Just photographs of your mum.<eos> I didn't know we had 'em.<eos> Happy new term!<eos> With you in a moment.
Your face.<eos> You never see your face the right way round.<eos> Right.<eos> Look for a freckle or a funny tooth.<eos> - Something that's not symmetrical.<eos> - My badge! See, your friend saw it straightaway because of her eye.<eos> But... it's moving like a reflection.<eos> It's not reflecting you.<eos> It's mimicking you.<eos> There's something in the water pretending to be you.
Can I use the toilet?<eos> - Pardon?<eos> - I've had a fright.<eos> I need the toilet.<eos> It's down there, first right, second left, past the macaroon dispenser.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Human! Human alert.<eos> Do you want me to repel her?<eos> She's just passing through. She wants to use the toilet.<eos> I'd give it a minute if I were you.
I'm sorry.<eos> OK.<eos> Let me remember just for a week.<eos> Just a week.<eos> OK, well, just for tonight.<eos> Just one night.<eos> Come on, let me have some good dreams for once.<eos> OK.<eos> Do what you've got to do.<eos> But imagine... just imagine how it would feel if someone did this to you.
- My plan is to get to the root cause of your excessive violence.<eos> - You mean the newspaper and magazine stories calling me a monster.<eos> - I've read your file.<eos> - And what?<eos> You've read some papers.<eos> Some file a prison hack too stupid to make it on the outside wrote about me after he showed me some inkblots.<eos> You read that shit and think you're inside my head?<eos> Doc, you don't know a fucking thing about me.<eos> - You're right, Jack.<eos> I don't know a fucking thing about you.
- Did you know that motion for discovery means the prosecutor and the defendant must exchange all evidence and information pertinent to a case?<eos> - $660,000, divided by two, minus 20%, is a great night's work, man.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> - I don't know, Marty, it's just.<eos> I know when something is too good to be true.<eos> - What's your point?<eos> - My point is that there's not that many safes lying around with this kinda cash in it that aren't for something special.<eos> - What's the matter with you?
When the second needle freezes my lungs, are you gonna scribble scrabble in your notepad for future reference?<eos> And when that third needle stops my heart, and they pronounce my body dead, are you gonna anguish over my death'?<eos> Or are you gonna rejoice that the law of your land was fulfilled'?<eos> - Neither.<eos> - You ever see anyone die, Doc?<eos> You ever watch as the light fades out of someone's eyes as they just,<eos> drift away into nothing?<eos> - It's none of your fucking business.<eos> It's not about me.<eos> - This is about you.

- I have my sources.<eos> - I don't like being followed.<eos> - Noted.<eos> Dance with me.<eos> - And you're loo pretty to be a cop.<eos> - I didn't know Martin.<eos> But my father, very close to him.<eos> - Who's your father?<eos> - Charlie Rose.<eos> Just like you.
Jack, meet Charlie.<eos> - Mr. Rose.<eos> - Marty never said you were such a oily slicker.<eos> - Is that gonna be a problem?<eos> - No, not a problem, unless you make it that way.<eos> You all didn't do nothing together, now, did you'?<eos> .<eos> Oh.<eos> Daddy.<eos> - Oh, come on, I'm just playing with you.
- Thank you.<eos> Simon Beeker was the president of the largest bank nobody ever heard of.<eos> Beaker handled overseas financial transactions, how the money flowed.<eos> Just none of it flowed to Beaker.<eos> - Mr. Beeker, your clients have arrived.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Afternoon.<eos> - Please, have a seat.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - What can I do for you?
- Codes.<eos> - Here.<eos> - If even one of those numbers is wrong, half the police department'll show up outside.<eos> - Listen, little lady.<eos> I got it from Beeker himself.<eos> Wrote the numbers down exactly the way he told me.<eos> - Pressure changes things.<eos> Makes a man write a six instead of a nine.<eos> - Not Beeker, the man's ice.<eos> - I was talking about you.
- Oh yeah?<eos> How was it supposed to be?<eos> You kill us and take the bonds?<eos> - You got it.<eos> Hey, get the fuck out there.<eos> Nice shot, Jack.<eos> Too bad it wasn't me.<eos> Listen, fuck Beeker.<eos> Why should he get the money?<eos> Me and you, we split the money, 50/50.
Strip.<eos> Full frontal.<eos> Very good, you'll do.<eos> You don't need to cover it, bud, we couldn't be shocked by anything you'd have.<eos> Hello son.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - How're you today, sir?<eos> - Good, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> How about you?
How about you?<eos> - About ready to get out of here.<eos> - Very good, sir.<eos> Hey.<eos> Well, that didn't work.<eos> Maybe you're just rude.<eos> You don't have manners.<eos> When one of your betters is outside and front of the bars, you stand up, turn around, and look him in the goddamned eye.<eos> That's more like it.<eos> You know what I need from you?
You're not as bad as the executioner.<eos> - Hey, fish.<eos> Gut my jellies?<eos> Do you know what's happening here'?<eos> You know what's happening?<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> - Party, motherfucker.<eos> A big party.<eos> Get over here.<eos> - I'm gonna skullfuck you, pretty boy.
- It sparkles.<eos> - It sparkles like your eyes.<eos> - I love it.<eos> - I hope so.<eos> - You spoiled me.<eos> - When all this is done, we'll have enough money.<eos> We'll start over again.<eos> We're gonna have a house, maybe two baby boys.<eos> I'll even retire, you know, be a postman like a regular old job or something.<eos> Just to he able to wake up every morning next to you.
Took.<eos> And so it goes.<eos> - This was good.<eos> This was a lot of progress.<eos> And, tomorrow we'll get to the underlying...<eos> - Tomorrow I have a date with a real doctor.<eos> You know what the worst part is?<eos> Nobody's gonna be there to see me off.<eos> Anyway-<eos> It was nice talking with you, Amanda.
I gotta take this, this is work.<eos> Hey, please don't take forever, all right.<eos> We gotta study.<eos> You must study 'til you die.<eos> Make you a good deal on that.<eos> Brought it on a couple of family vacations.<eos> It always took nice pictures.<eos> Thanks, but I don't think snapping Polaroids is really my friend's thing, so.<eos> So you're looking for a gift?<eos> I think I might have somethin' for you.
Okay, yeah.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> And you chose that?<eos> Yeah, it's amazing.<eos> Congratulations, you bought something.<eos> So can we go now?<eos> Some of us have papers to write.<eos> I think I have a paper to write.<eos> Yep.<eos> I was talkin' about you.
Cheers.<eos> The next one will taste better.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> Jessica, did you remember to pay the cable bill?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you check to make sure everything is plugged in right?<eos> Everything's plugged in.<eos> Fine, I'll double check from my phone when we're on the road.<eos> You know, I might call that guy that I met the other night at the bar.<eos> Tall, dark, and all over you.
What?<eos> Get the fucking box out of the fire.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I guess.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It doesn't hurt anymore.<eos> Yeah, no, I understand.<eos> I completely understand.<eos> Yeah, I hope the new guy works out for you.
Turn his head, please.<eos> It fed off of him.<eos> Yeah, they do that.<eos> That's extraordinarily unusual.<eos> Ghosts don't normally feed.<eos> Hey.<eos> No, there's nothin' down here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I scared it off or somethin'.<eos> Elizabeth, I think I need you.
Elizabeth, you know all bets are off doing an exorcism.<eos> Even under the best possible circumstances, this could end badly.<eos> And I don't know how comfortable I am with you taking that kind of risk.<eos> I don't care what you're comfortable with.<eos> This is the sort of risk that I live for.<eos> This is what we do.<eos> Yeah, and I thought we were a little bit more than just come coworkers.<eos> And we are.<eos> But when we're investigating, I call the shots. We agreed.<eos> So, I can count on you?
We're not puking up green bile.<eos> This thing isn't trying to inhabit you.<eos> It's trying to control you, consume you.<eos> And if we don't separate what binds you, it will succeed.<eos> Can you set it in the box, please.<eos> What's with the salt?<eos> It acts as a purifier.<eos> It should lessen the supernatural activity you've been experiencing and hopefully weaken it by this afternoon.<eos> I should have everything we need at my office.<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
But whatever happens this afternoon, I love you.<eos> We're ready.<eos> Just a second.<eos> You know, it's not too late to reconsider.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> You just make sure I look good out there.<eos> You do a good job of that on your own.<eos> If it goes wrong, finish the book.<eos> I'll give this to you the moment we're done.<eos> You know I couldn't do this without you, right?
In the name of the...<eos> Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<eos> Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,<eos> thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.<eos> Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses<eos> as we forgive those who trespass against us.<eos> Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.<eos> Amen.<eos> In the name of God almighty,<eos> I demand you, release these children of God.
What the fuck.<eos> Cole, don't move.<eos> That's what they want.<eos> What, are you fuckin' nuts?<eos> Cole, don't leave me.<eos> You cannot save them.<eos> You cannot save us.<eos> You cannot save yourself.<eos> In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<eos> God is not with you.
All good girls want to die. -All good girls want to die. -Let's just go.<eos> All good girls want to die.<eos> We're losin' daylight.<eos> Is this it?<eos> Yeah, this is it.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I had a question about somethin' my friend bought here.<eos> It was at a yard sale a few weeks ago.<eos> Yeah, I remember you.
- [chuckles] - Who is this?<eos> Oh, uh, I built him for science.<eos> He can walk and talk.<eos> King Robot Baratheon, say hi to Abby.<eos> Fucking thing.<eos> I spent like six weeks on it.<eos> - Well, good luck. - Wait.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I have no idea. I've never ditched before.<eos> Hang on. I'll come with you.
Will it work?<eos> But you're right.<eos> I've got to stand up for myself.<eos> I'm gonna keep my date with Dina.<eos> Get the hell out of here!<eos> Aah, I know!<eos> I can't believe I've got a hot date too!<eos> Ahh. Oh, my God.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Can't just sit in here and gab with you all day.
I don't think so.<eos> I have some paperwork I need to do tonight.<eos> Okay, well...<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> I was just in the neighborhood, and I thought to myself,<eos> "Well, got some Prosecco "and some strawberries and clotted cream,<eos> "a jigsaw puzzle.<eos> Why not pop in on my old mate Mindy?"<eos> This is weird.<eos> - That's not weird. Just want to hang out with you, that's all.
Work, home... those are the only two places I go, but you're always there.<eos> And I'm gonna say to you what I say to all the penguins at the zoo:<eos> "Go back to Alaska, you weirdos!"<eos> Time to dig into this puzzle.<eos> Um, I actually... I have some stuff I need to do.<eos> Oh, but it's of the doors of Rochester, New York.<eos> - My hometown?<eos> - Is it?<eos> Is it really?<eos> What a coincidence that my random choice should have some personal significance to you.
Hey!<eos> I got the sign up!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Why did I get a text from my girlfriend saying she's not coming to our apartment anymore?<eos> Because she ruined my night of passion.<eos> That is not passion.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> And we were getting in our underwear, and all of a sudden, Karen pops out of my closet like a ghost, and I fling Dina across the room.<eos> You know how hard it is to get a woman to come back to your apartment when you live 85 stops off the subway.<eos> I'm just gonna be real with you.
I'm just gonna be real with you.<eos> Your girlfriend's - really annoying.<eos> - Mm. Yeah, she's always running around this apartment practicing her yo-yo, and she hit one of my dogs in the eye, and he has to wear an eye patch.<eos> Scooter looks like an idiot!<eos> - Scooter is an idiot!<eos> - You're an idiot! Arg!<eos> It's clobbering time!<eos> Stop. Tap out.<eos> Tap out.<eos> Okay, I can't afford steroids like you.
- Oh, and, um, if you wouldn't mind checking on Mindy...<eos> I think she fell asleep on the toilet.<eos> Right.<eos> Dr. Ziev is on her way.<eos> What birthing suite would you like for us to prep?<eos> Oh, that won't be necessary.<eos> But could you find me an ice bucket?<eos> Never mind. I'll just fill a bedpan with ice from the morgue.<eos> Uh, what are you doing on the floor of the scrub-in room?<eos> Well, I just couldn't wait for our date tomorrow, so I decided to throw you a spontaneous picnic.
That was my second-worst coming out of the closet.<eos> The third was telling my parents I was gay.<eos> Wait. I'm sorry. You're apologizing to me?<eos> I wrote you a song on the ukulele to make up for it.<eos> It's called "When Morgans Cry."<eos> ♪ How could I anger such a large man? ♪<eos> Shh, shh, shh.<eos> Stop, stop, stop.<eos> I appreciate that gesture, and I know you're trying.<eos> The singing is the core problem I'm having with you.
No, no. That is wrong.<eos> I tricked her into thinking she rejected me.<eos> She rejected you, and that must mean that she likes me.<eos> But only because I wanted it.<eos> Let's not forget I am the victorious party here.<eos> She likes me.<eos> Aah! Good morning, Jeremy.<eos> I just wanted to thank you for last night.<eos> I was so emotional I snapped the handles off an elliptical machine.<eos> I don't know what I would have done without you.
Homegirl, there's no use putting up a fight.<eos> I gave the same exact speech, and then, against all laws of nature, ended up dating Morgan for two years.<eos> He was terrible.<eos> I disagree.<eos> There's something very wrong with this office.<eos> We don't all have to date each other just because we're in close proximity to one another, okay?<eos> Normal offices don't work like that.<eos> So, please, don't hit on me and don't try to kiss me.<eos> I won't like it.<eos> Thank you for your time. Hey, do you think that applies to women too?
I'm so sorry, but I have a good excuse.<eos> I slept with a woman for the first time,<eos> - and if I may...<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'm used to covering for you guys when you drink too much.<eos> I can't drink, because of my irritable bowel syndrome.<eos> Well, I just wanted to say I watched the whole delivery, and I had no idea you were such a good surgeon.<eos> I mean, how on Earth did you not get a second interview for the department head job and I did?<eos> I don't know, but I'm sure they have their reasons.<eos> But listen, I'm rooting for you, even though up until this moment you've never talked to me.
I even forgot all the sports trivia I learned, thank God.<eos> Remember, Mindy, sit down to pee.<eos> Hey, Irene.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Pretty good, but I'm getting pretty sweaty from this Alfredo steam.<eos> So you probably heard that Dr. Ledreau got the department head position.<eos> Another white man, go figure.<eos> And, you know, there's a lot of evidence that he killed his wife.<eos> I'm listening to a podcast about her disappearance.<eos> I wanted to apologize to you for what I said the other day, about us being an Asian clique.
- Yep.<eos> I got it.<eos> The Squares Exhibit at the Museum of Geometry.<eos> It's only the greatest collection of square art ever assembled in the Northern Hemisphere.<eos> And I've got two tickets to the opening night.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> This is very thoughtful.<eos> Of course.<eos> Obviously, we'll be going as... as friends.<eos> I wanna be square with you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Listen, just come over for a drink.<eos> We'll see how it feels.<eos> What do you say?<eos> - I'll think about it. - I'll show you out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Ow. - Right this way.<eos> You're hurting my arm.<eos> Thanks for inviting me over for a girls' night, Mindy.<eos> Leo and I love spending time with you.
- Why hasn't he proposed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Maybe it's because I told him that I never want to get married.<eos> And I don't.<eos> I don't think.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Lindsay, why is he listening to me now?<eos> I mean, I don't even listen to half the crap I say.<eos> Just don't tell Dad I told you, okay?
She told you?<eos> But it's not Lindsay's fault.<eos> It's your fault, for teaching her the importance of honesty.<eos> Okay, fine, yes.<eos> I was going to propose.<eos> Until you told me, in very clear terms, that you had no interest in marrying me.<eos> How does someone who's wanted to get married her whole life tell her boyfriend she doesn't want to marry him?<eos> This is is one of those cases where you have to tell a little white lie.<eos> Like when I tell my brother Rishi he has potential.<eos> Hey, it's not you. Okay?

Okay?<eos> I don't believe in marriage. I never have.<eos> It's just one of those institutions that I don't support, like the FDA or libraries.<eos> It doesn't mean that I love you any less or don't want to be with you.
I'm gonna go, though.<eos> Anybody seen Colette?<eos> Colette!<eos> Hey, man.<eos> What gives?<eos> Anna just said that she doesn't wanna reconcile.<eos> Did she?<eos> Gosh, I'm so sorry.<eos> That's awful.<eos> She was all cool until she started talking to you.
Hey, you're back early.<eos> How was the party?<eos> Did you and Jeremy wear the same outfit again?<eos> No.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Hey, can I ask you a serious question?<eos> Sure, but if it gets too awkward,<eos> I'll have to look at my phone.<eos> Absolutely, I completely understand.<eos> Would it be a big difference for you if I was your step-mom, versus just your dad's girlfriend?
That's a good point.<eos> I really missed you at that party.<eos> No one wanted to have a shrimp eating contest with me, so I had to compete against my personal best.<eos> Did you bring me home the tails?<eos> I'm sorry, I just...<eos> I got cold feet and snuck out.<eos> I love Karen, but I'm not ready to get married.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's real easy for me to hook up, but hard for me to establish a real emotional connection.<eos> I know, I sleep above you.
Please be patient, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Have you heard the good news?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm Jewish, I...<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Okay, look, Ben.<eos> Yes, my whole life, I have been obsessed with marriage.<eos> And it kept not happening so I thought, wait, is something wrong with me?<eos> And then through work and having Leo and meeting you, I realized no, there's nothing wrong with me.
Yeah, that seems like a really unhealthy way - to think about yourself.<eos> - And then, recently, I met someone who reminded me that marriage isn't just about making a couple.<eos> It's about making a family.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> Hey.<eos> What...<eos> Leo, you're dressed up.<eos> I don't need to get married anymore.<eos> I want to get married.<eos> To you.
- Previously on "grimm"...<eos> - Arrest him.<eos> Black claw wiped out hw.<eos> - Which way?<eos> - She went after Bonaparte. We used the stick to heal her.<eos> And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.<eos> - You're feeling stuff.<eos> They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife.
I will be.<eos> You need to be careful too.<eos> I don't think you should be carrying the stick around all the time.<eos> It's the only reason I'm alive. Yeah.<eos> It's powerful.<eos> But we don't know where that power comes from.<eos> - I don't think that matters.<eos> - It does matter.<eos> Look what happened when those guys tried to take the stick away from you.<eos> It acted defensively, like it was connected to you.

You drop all of the charges against me.<eos> And reinstate him into the department.<eos> And we give you an alibi that'll work for the night Rachel was killed.<eos> - You have an alibi in mind?<eos> - Adalind. Little late for that.<eos> Already tried. She turned me down.<eos> She didn't turn me down.<eos> Well, she'll have to testify.<eos> She will. Look, even if she doesn't, I don't believe she will.<eos> I'm not dropping the charges against you until I'm cleared by a grand jury.
I'm here.<eos> No, this isn't a good time for me to...<eos> Yeah, I understand that.<eos> It's just...<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Nick, I'm leaving Portland in four hours.<eos> - Where?<eos> - I'll know when I get there.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - Didn't say anything about you.
I want Burkhardt found.<eos> We should've killed Renard when we had the chance.<eos> We never had the chance.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Cops were just here.<eos> Well, did they leave?<eos> Not before they checked out the shop, like, fully.<eos> What if they come back and break in?<eos> Nick, you need to get out of here.<eos> I'm going with you.
- Let's go.<eos> Leave Diana's drawing... we'll keep trying to figure it out.<eos> We should've killed Renard when we didn't have the chance.<eos> Do not take this ring off, because it would be extremely painful... For your children.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Not very good.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> - If anything happens to Nick...<eos> - Yes, I've heard it all before.<eos> I really think you should be more worried about what happens to you.
Wait, wait!<eos> What?<eos> I'm just thinking, has this ever been done on a Grimm before?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, we should look at the books just to be safe.<eos> No, there's no time.<eos> - Wait!<eos> - What now?<eos> Your clothes, you should probably take them off.<eos> Renard is bigger than you.
- No... no, no.<eos> No, that's all...<eos> That had to hurt.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> It's time for "live at 7."<eos> All right, look, maybe I haven't given Diana's education a lot of thought, all right?<eos> But considering everything that's been going on recently?<eos> I mean, look... Look, her education is just as important to me as it is to you, but right now I have to go.
This little game is over as of right now.<eos> It's not a game, and it's not over.<eos> Now, if you think Portland's big enough for two Sean Renards, think again.<eos> You'll always be contradicting yourself.<eos> No one is ever gonna believe you.<eos> They might just think you're crazy and lock you up.<eos> Well, then I better have a talk with myself... Face-to-face.<eos> My loft, 20 minutes.<eos> I'll be on the roof.<eos> Renard only has one thing he can use against you.

My son.<eos> Can you get Adalind and the kids, bring them back here?<eos> - I should go with you.<eos> - No, no.<eos> I'll know if he's not alone.<eos> He doesn't know about the tunnels.<eos> You go with Hank in case Renard puts someone on Adalind.<eos> We'll find a way to get you back.<eos> Be careful.<eos> So, if I shoot you, is that considered suicide?
So, if I shoot you, is that considered suicide?<eos> I thought we were here to talk?<eos> At least one of me is good for my word.<eos> I really think there's only room for one of me in this city.<eos> Which one is that gonna be?<eos> Thought I'd give you that one.<eos> I know how much you're hurting right now.<eos> I knew that was coming.<eos> What'd you expect, a fair fight?<eos> Not from you.
Okay, glad you got those clothes changed so quickly.<eos> Those are my daddy's clothes.<eos> Yeah, I had to borrow them.<eos> - Is Daddy okay?<eos> - He's better now.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I want to see my daddy.<eos> Uh, we'll see Daddy soon, honey, but, right now, we are gonna go and live with Nick and Kelly.<eos> It's Kelly's turn to be with his Daddy now, okay?<eos> You have a baby in you.
I'm so proud of the way you're handling all of this.<eos> - Diana's asleep.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She could sense that people died here.<eos> She has amazing abilities, ones I don't understand, and I don't know where they came from.<eos> And Sean doesn't know either.<eos> We have to protect her.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so happy to be back here with you.

So what do you feel like doing?<eos> Do you, uh, wanna watch a movie, or are you hungry?<eos> Why don't you love Mommy?<eos> Well, um... your mommy and I just haven't had a chance to really get to know each other.<eos> Is it because of Nick?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Mommy said you'd say so and that I shouldn't believe you.<eos> Well, maybe you shouldn't listen to everything Mommy has to say either.<eos> Mommy loves Nick.<eos> And I love you.
You don't see this every day.<eos> Grimm.<eos> Settle down.<eos> - That was really weird.<eos> - Baby seems okay.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, you can't take him!<eos> You don't understand. Ahh!<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - No, don't take him!<eos> - Anything you say or eat will be used against you in the court of law.

It's never more than two days, never less than one.<eos> So let me get this straight.<eos> You want us to let you go so you can chomp down on Auggie?<eos> That's pretty damn bold.<eos> Look up Kenneth Slater.<eos> See what happens when I don't do what I must.<eos> Kenneth Slater?<eos> He's one of the victims that was kidnapped on the case I was looking into.<eos> But he was returned alive.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.
We need paramedics in interrogation room 2.<eos> Even if he is telling the truth, what are we supposed to do, let him eat...<eos> Oh, crap. He got a DUI.<eos> Idaho, 19 years ago.<eos> Isidoro was in the state.<eos> We need to talk to him again.<eos> Oh, that doesn't look good.<eos> He's going after Auggie.<eos> My baby boy.<eos> I was so worried about you.
My baby boy.<eos> I was so worried about you.<eos> This is the best day of my life.<eos> Haley...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Honey, I'm...<eos> I'm concerned.<eos> Paul, Auggie's back.<eos> We have nothing to worry about.<eos> No, I'm talking about you.
Unless you want to leave this house with us.<eos> Maybe you don't care if everybody thinks my wife's crazy, but I do.<eos> - I'm not crazy.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Haley, Haley...<eos> Listen, you probably don't want to hear this right now, but your wife is not crazy.<eos> Wow, I guess you would know, huh?<eos> - Haley...<eos> Haley...<eos> - No, no, I'm done - talking to you, Paul!
- I've seen them before.<eos> - I can see it.<eos> Can you draw what you're seeing?<eos> I've never seen anything like this.<eos> You chose the wrong side, Sean.<eos> - No, you're dead.<eos> - Does that really matter?<eos> - Get the hell out of here.<eos> - I'm not gonna make it that easy for you.<eos> You have a baby in you.
Oh, my God!<eos> Eve!<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> I gotta get you out of here.<eos> You gotta get up. You gotta stand up.<eos> All right.<eos> You're gonna have to go first. Come on.<eos> Okay, I'm right behind you.
Find out where my drink is.<eos> I don't know what you think you're doing, but I'm going outside for a smoke, where if you have the nerve to show your ass, I'm gonna kick it from here to Houston.<eos> Otherwise, you better be gone. You got me?<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> Uh, bartender.<eos> If you please.<eos> Hi.<eos> Brought you a drink.<eos> What are you trying to do now, pick me up?<eos> No, I just felt sorry for you since I'm picking up your girl and we'll be having a real good time and you're not.
It's the same guy!<eos> That's how I knew I had seen him.<eos> The book said he was immortal, right?<eos> And if he really comes up out of the ground only once every seven years, and he comes up out of the park... His park.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> No wonder he donated the land.<eos> That's where he's taking the girl.<eos> - What girl?<eos> - The one he's gonna kill.<eos> Things haven't been going so well for you.

And his father's before him.<eos> - You want this bad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How bad?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go find out if this ghost is real.<eos> This way.<eos> Aspirateur d'Esprits.<eos> A spirit vacuum.<eos> If any spirits are attached to you, this will pull them out.
Look, don't play games with me. I'm tired of this.<eos> I'm sorry, do I know you?<eos> We've spoken on the phone.<eos> I am Anselmo Baledin.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's important that we talk, now that Bonaparte is dead, and you've killed your political career.<eos> Look, I told you.<eos> The Grimm was responsible.<eos> You also told us you can handle the Grimm.<eos> Instead he seems to have handled you quite well.
You said the Grimm killed Bonaparte.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> Were you there?<eos> I was there.<eos> The Grimm should be dead, but he's not.<eos> Like I told you, he's being protected by something very powerful.<eos> And that's the part I'm having a hard time understanding.<eos> Well, maybe you could understand this.<eos> I'm done taking orders,<eos> I'm done with Black Claw, and I'm done with you.
It's fine.<eos> I'll be back early Sunday night to pick her up.<eos> What are you guys gonna do?<eos> How many chocolate chip cookies do you want for breakfast, dad?<eos> Have fun.<eos> Hey, honey, how about pancakes instead?<eos> It's okay. I'm making both.<eos> Monroe, I'm pregnant, not helpless. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> It's really more for me than you.
I ain't got time for games, son.<eos> It's not a game, dad.<eos> It's Burkhardt.<eos> The cop who took you down, he's here at the hotel.<eos> He didn't even know who I was.<eos> - He alone?<eos> - No, no.<eos> He's here with a bunch of friends for a birthday.<eos> Gonna be here two nights.<eos> I'm gonna make him pay for what he did to you.
I need some coffee.<eos> Me too.<eos> Good morning, birthday boy.<eos> Morning.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, sure. I think so.<eos> Maybe one too many last night?<eos> Yeah, that's probably it.<eos> I need coffee.<eos> I can go with you.
Now it's up to me, my love to prove.<eos> Eve.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Made more lovely by you saying the word "morning."<eos> I feel the dawn of a crystalline new day in your voice, and your hair is more exuberant than ever. I adore it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was just looking at the view.<eos> It is so... beautiful, yes.<eos> But it could never hold a candle to the view of you.
- What happened?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> Why was I crying?<eos> Why am I in my underwear?<eos> - Adalind.<eos> - Nick.<eos> My god.<eos> What have I done?<eos> I love you.
Why am I in my underwear?<eos> - Adalind.<eos> - Nick.<eos> My god.<eos> What have I done?<eos> I love you.<eos> You haven't done anything.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> I love you.<eos> Only you.
No, but I'm suggesting Giovanni might be suggesting it.<eos> Well, we can't make that leap, at least not yet.<eos> And it still doesn't tell us when this impending event is gonna happen.<eos> And we're not gonna figure it out tonight, guys.<eos> I got to head home.<eos> Yeah, I'm getting a little worn around the edges myself.<eos> - Coming?<eos> - I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not great, me staying with you and adalind.
Monster!<eos> You ever thought about what you want done?<eos> - With what? - You.<eos> Being cremated or buried. Not really, you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Last thing I ever want is to wind up in the ground.<eos> I get claustrophobic just thinking about it.<eos> Cremate me, spread my ashes over the willamette river, and let me float free to the edges of wherever.<eos> You know there are a lot of cows and horses that drink from the river. - So?<eos> - So what happens if some cow drinks from the willamette and gets you, too, then craps you out in a field?
- Ready to shave. - Coming.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, by the way, when you saw what Eve saw in this mirror, how did you get it to go away?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Yeah, it just looked at me and went away.<eos> - Because it saw you?<eos> - That's what Eve thinks.<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> I think it knows I'm a Grimm, but this skull thing is connected to Eve in some way.<eos> Maybe because she's a Hexenbiest, which is why I'm worried about you.
So... your daughter has drawn a very unusual combination of symbols.<eos> Some ancient, some unknown to me, which suggests that they are coming from her own imagination.<eos> However, I ask myself how this young daughter of Sean Renard knows such ancient symbols in the first place.<eos> And why would she draw them?<eos> So is there something I need to know about her mother?<eos> She's a Hexenbiest.<eos> I suspected this.<eos> Are you together?<eos> No, it was complicated.<eos> Sean, everything with you is always complicated.
We got this one, the one in the guest room, the one in the bathroom...<eos> Am I missing any?<eos> I gotta be honest, I'm nervous.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I know we're doing the right thing by letting Eve stay here...<eos> - She has nowhere else to go.<eos> - I know.<eos> And I'm not saying I don't wanna help Eve, okay?<eos> I'm just saying I'm worried about bringing this into our home.<eos> What if it does something to hurt our babies, like pull you through the mirror?
I do...<eos> - But...<eos> - Please. There might be something in them that could help us fight this thing.<eos> Those books could be just as dangerous.<eos> Waiting for this thing to come after me, or us, would be more dangerous, and Adaline, I think one of the reasons it is connecting to me is because I can see those symbols.<eos> Diana can see the symbols too.<eos> I know. That's why we can't wait.<eos> We have to find this thing, and kill it.<eos> I'll get the books.<eos> Guess we'll start with you.
What did she want?<eos> For me to help her find a Hexenbiest way to go through the mirror into the other place.<eos> - Is that even possible?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> She wanted to borrow my mom's spell books.<eos> - And you gave them to her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I'm worried she's gonna try to do this on her own.<eos> - Is that what she said?<eos> - Not exactly, but she's really worried that this skull thing is gonna come after her, after you, even Diana, not to mention the rest of us.
Nick, yeah, I'm here.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah, Adalind told me you took some of her mom's books.<eos> You think there's a Hexenbiest way into this other world?<eos> I think we have to try to find out.<eos> Yes, "we" is a very good idea.<eos> Look, I don't even know if I'm gonna find anything.<eos> I just started on the second book, and so far, nothing about mirrors as portals or gateways to anywhere.<eos> So if you're worried about me, don't be.<eos> Yes, I'm... I'm very worried about you.
This is one of those Hexenbiest books Eve got from Adalind.<eos> She brought it into the house?<eos> That's not all she did.<eos> - Is that a dagger?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where did that come from?<eos> It's not ours.<eos> I'm calling Nick.<eos> Hey, Monroe. Everything okay?<eos> Eve isn't with you, is she?
Some other magic mirror-unlocking gizmo?<eos> Why not?<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's something that Nick and Monroe found in the Black Forest.<eos> It's special.<eos> Yeah, it kind of is.<eos> Wait, Nick.<eos> I don't think this is such a good idea.<eos> We don't even know what kind of power this thing has or where it came from or what effect it's gonna have on you or us.

You got a lot of catching up to do.<eos> Yeah, I guess I do.<eos> We'll start with the tunnel.<eos> I thought that was supposed to be a secret.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> The tunnel was right here all along?<eos> For over a hundred years, far as we can tell.<eos> Probably part of the Shanghai tunnels. Also came in handy during Prohibition, I'd imagine.<eos> You might want to watch your step.<eos> After you.
Blutbaden.<eos> And, um,<eos> Hundjaeger, and...<eos> - Schakal.<eos> - Ja, Hundjaeger,<eos> Schakal, ja.<eos> Kakenkopf?<eos> Yeah, Kakenkopf.<eos> Ist...<eos> You didn't happen to bring a pencil and paper with you?
March 24th.<eos> Oh, my God, that's the day.<eos> That's the day that was predicted that the planets would align and something very bad was gonna happen.<eos> This is why the skull guy went after Eve now, so she would go after him now so Nick would go after her now.<eos> So it could use the Grimm to get here and get Diana.<eos> Okay, we cannot open any portal for Nick and Eve.<eos> 'Cause they won't be coming back alone.<eos> I'm going in there. I'm the only one who can.<eos> Look, I'm not so sure.<eos> You may be able to open it, but it might be possible for me to go in instead of you.
Well, no, but look at the mirror.<eos> God, maybe the book was wrong.<eos> Why did you call me to tell me not to open the portal?<eos> I mean, what did you find out?<eos> Nick... we think you were tricked.<eos> By skull guy.<eos> He was there.<eos> We were trying to kill him.<eos> He could've killed us, but he didn't.<eos> No, he needed you there to open the way from his side so he could cross over with you.
It's probably what Zerstoerer had in mind for us.<eos> Zerstoerer?<eos> Zerstoerer, that means "destroyer."<eos> That's what they call skull man in the Other Place, and they were all terrified of him.<eos> He was very tall.<eos> He had green eyes.<eos> He was carrying a very powerful staff.<eos> You're different now.<eos> What?<eos> I think part of you stayed in the Other Place.
He's here.<eos> Honey, we're not gonna let anything happen to you, okay?<eos> Don't let him find me.<eos> Please, don't let him find me.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> We'll protect you, no matter what.<eos> You're safe.<eos> I promise.<eos> All of us.<eos> We're not gonna let anybody near you.
I spoke to my Russian friend.<eos> They showed me the tunnel.<eos> And the stick.<eos> We told him everything, Nick.<eos> His friend has reason to believe that this Zerstoerer guy is after Diana.<eos> Now, there's a prophecy about something called a Shaphat.<eos> A child bride for evil.<eos> I'm not letting that thing anywhere near my daughter.<eos> You and Adalind need to hide her.<eos> Zerstoerer has connected with Eve and you in your loft, so that's out.
Exactly.<eos> And where you gave me the key.<eos> Nick!<eos> I brought the key.<eos> Here, I'm giving it back to you.<eos> It's why I called you here.<eos> Well, if Zerstoerer finds us there, we're gonna be too far to get any help.<eos> None of us are connected to that cabin in any way that he'll ever know about.<eos> Yeah, but he might just be connected to Diana anyway.<eos> You know, like how he found Eve and then you.
When a Hexenbiest administers it, it conceals the child from harm coming its way.<eos> It worked for me, I think.<eos> The Royals were looking for me, and they never found me, so...<eos> I have an old bracelet with a Nazar on it, and I'm pretty sure we have all the herbs here.<eos> I'm gonna go check.<eos> What did you guys do with the books?<eos> I wanna find out as much as I can about Zerstoerer.<eos> In the cellar, we left them out and open.<eos> We were kind of in a hurry to get here.<eos> Rosalee and I will go with you.
A Grimm.<eos> I've got some pretty fond memories here too.<eos> You?<eos> What were you doing here?<eos> Come on, honey. Here we go.<eos> Nick and I met here to settle our differences about the key.<eos> Oh... that.<eos> Yeah, we both decided it couldn't fall into your hands.<eos> When you were working for the Royals.<eos> That was before I had a baby with you.

Two men waiting by your car.<eos> This time you chose the right side, Sean.<eos> Two dimensions exist simultaneously...<eos> One where the cat is alive, one where it's dead.<eos> As long as the box stays closed, both realities exist.<eos> - Eve, Nick!<eos> - Diana.<eos> Mommy, it works.<eos> I got Nick back for you.<eos> I think part of you stayed in the Other Place.
Nick, go!<eos> They need your blood!<eos> No!<eos> Go!<eos> Eve.<eos> Juliette.<eos> No regrets.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Not you.
They need your blood!<eos> No!<eos> Go!<eos> Eve.<eos> Juliette.<eos> No regrets.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Not you.<eos> Not you.
I'm willing to give you something in exchange for it.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> You will be.<eos> Trubel.<eos> - Trubel.<eos> - Nick.<eos> Did we kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Then why are we alive?<eos> I can give them all back to you.
I want my son!<eos> - I want them all back.<eos> - You can defeat him.<eos> - I tried.<eos> I can't.<eos> - You can.<eos> With the Strength of One's Blood.<eos> - We tried that.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> The strength of your blood, the blood of your Grimm ancestors, all of us... It's inside you.
Who else?<eos> But I did nothing for them.<eos> Nick.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> Who?<eos> The other Grimms fighting with you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can bring them all back to life.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> If it worked for you, it can work for them.
Hobbs.<eos> How much trouble could I get into. If I short the stock from jeffrey day's company?<eos> I've got a hunch it's about to dip.<eos> I didn't hear that, lieutenant.<eos> My mom's a badass.<eos> Hey, buzz.<eos> You still busy?<eos> Well, not like earlier. So...<eos> If I did something to bother you, It was definitely an accident and... and I'm sorry.<eos> No, no, it's not you at all. No.
- Don't go there tonight.<eos> - Get out of my way.<eos> I love him to distraction and will marry him next month.<eos> - Do you not want her?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He's left me with only one possible choice.<eos> I thought you should know, he has joined the Navy.<eos> - I'm going to war.<eos> - So, these are our last few hours.<eos> My true and abiding love is for you.
No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, my dear.<eos> Your efforts, though valiant, will be in vain.<eos> Dr Enys warned me he could only prolong my life, not save it.<eos> Dr Enys may be wrong.<eos> Dr Enys is at sea and doubtless gives me not a second thought.<eos> Still, there is, however, something that would ease me.<eos> If, when I'm gone, you will be cared for by a husband of wealth and consequence.
- Good day, ma'am.<eos> How be you've escaped father's clutches?<eos> Nay, 'tis he did send me.<eos> - Wherefore?<eos> - To fetch 'ee home.<eos> And is the broodmare safely back in the stall?<eos> I must ask you not to use such terms.<eos> Elizabeth is much more to me than that.<eos> Which, frankly, baffles me.<eos> The thrall she's exerted over you and Francis, Ross --
Thankfully, no, but with the arrival of a sibling,<eos> I'm concerned he may no longer receive the attention he deserves.<eos> But I've been speaking with your mother and we think we've found a solution.<eos> The bank opening was so dull.<eos> I made Trigg take me home as soon as it was over.<eos> Uncle George has returned.<eos> But who is that with him?<eos> A governess?<eos> What on earth do you mean?<eos> Forgive me, cousin, this is no reflection on you.
See here?<eos> This is a fine quartzy rock.<eos> And that becomes bright, shiny metal?<eos> Sounds easy, does it not?<eos> To think I'm the last of the Trenwith Poldarks.<eos> - You forget Aunt Agatha.<eos> - So do you.<eos> Or so she tells me!<eos> I think of her often.<eos> And you.
Of course. You mustn't miss the hour.<eos> I can scarce believe 'twill happen at all.<eos> It must and it will, provided the other parties play their part.<eos> No, Horace. You must stay here and guard Uncle Ray.<eos> Caroline?<eos> Are you going out?<eos> I've been thinking over what you said, Uncle, about Lord Coniston, - and I wondered if I shouldn't go to London.<eos> - Oh, my dear.<eos> You'd make your old guardian very happy.<eos> I only wish I could come with you.
And will you stay with me now?<eos> For as long as you wish.<eos> You have a son.<eos> Your son is healthy, strong.<eos> He appears no worse for coming a month early.<eos> - I think we need to detain you no longer.<eos> - On the contrary.<eos> Your wife has endured a difficult birthing.<eos> Much as it inconveniences me, I cannot leave until I'm assured of her safety.<eos> - He favours you, I think.
- Only that your Uncle George may...<eos> - Uncle George doesn't concern me.<eos> Let's go further!<eos> Come on!<eos> Well, Ross!<eos> Are you here to congratulate me?<eos> Fatherhood changes everything, does it not?<eos> Will you take a drink with me?<eos> Why have you really come?<eos> To make a bargain with you.
Finally he has admitted defeat.<eos> He will never again approach our house nor any member of our family.<eos> - He actually said that?<eos> A new chapter begins... without him.<eos> There's something I must tell you, Ross.<eos> Though I fear you will not like it.<eos> I'm with child again.<eos> You're not displeased?<eos> I might wish the timing were better.<eos> The war's getting deadlier and everything in this world seems less certain... except for you.
There's something I must tell you, Ross.<eos> Though I fear you will not like it.<eos> I'm with child again.<eos> You're not displeased?<eos> I might wish the timing were better.<eos> The war's getting deadlier and everything in this world seems less certain... except for you.<eos> - Are you so certain o' me?<eos> - Perhaps I don't deserve to be.<eos> No, you do not!<eos> But with you beside me... .. whatever life sends...
Is Trenwith such a place?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I've 'eard tell 'twas once your family home, but now's fallen into unfriendly hands.<eos> It has.<eos> And you'll favour me by never setting foot on Trenwith land.<eos> Nor having dealings with any of the household.<eos> Did you need to forbid them?<eos> They're unlike to go looking for trouble.<eos> Knowing them, it'll find them anyway.<eos> As it oft seems to find you?
It seems a lifetime since I married Dwight.<eos> - Yet it's barely been a month.<eos> - He'll be home again soon.<eos> Won't he?<eos> "My most beloved wife, Caroline, I write with some trepidation.<eos> "The French fleet has been sighted not far from our present position "in the Channel.<eos> "Though it is impossible to know how soon we must engage with them<eos> "yet we know that attack is inevitable.<eos> "I beg you not distress yourself for I have confidence that we<eos> "will prevail and that I will soon return home to you, my love."
It never used to seem so.<eos> What's amiss?<eos> An old friend o' yours.<eos> Not been seen in these parts since yer father died.<eos> Tholly?<eos> Is it thee, young Cap'n?<eos> Well!<eos> Tholly Tregirls, I thought you were dead!<eos> Been nigh it oft enough, young Cap'n, but cheated it by'r whisker.<eos> I see Ned remembered you!
- I must prepare myself.<eos> - Verity... My dear, do not pity me.<eos> Pity Caroline.<eos> Her life with Dwight has barely begun and I've had six years of happiness.<eos> I have our beloved child.<eos> I never expected such joy, and if all is now lost,<eos> I'll be forever grateful I had it so long.<eos> You're too good.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm like you.
What happened?<eos> A new entertainment has begun. Dicing for officers.<eos> Executions on a whim.<eos> Today, on the colour of a man's eyes.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Geoffrey Charles' friend was here again.<eos> Yes, he called to bring some toads.<eos> He's very fond of Geoffrey Charles.<eos> And of you, too, or so I observed this afternoon.
Yes, he called to bring some toads.<eos> He's very fond of Geoffrey Charles.<eos> And of you, too, or so I observed this afternoon.<eos> Love makes us careless, does it not?<eos> What do you imagine George would do if he found out?<eos> Oh, yes, I am usually the first to defy him, but that's because I have little to lose.<eos> Do you? I cannot marry Mr Whitworth!<eos> You cannot marry Drake Carne.<eos> George is a cruel man.<eos> His axe would fall not on you, who are cousin to his wife, but on the boy, who is kin to Ross.
How not free?<eos> Our friendship...<eos> Has gone beyond the bounds of common acquaintance.<eos> But is it wrong to go so far... if what we feel is true?<eos> I see now it is not true.<eos> I was flattered by your attentions into thinking I felt love.<eos> But I do not.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - Hope you can forgive my mistake.<eos> I've left word with Grace that they will answer to you till I return.
We have a boat.<eos> Your cousin has delayed long enough.<eos> I require an immediate answer.<eos> Summon her from Trenwith.<eos> No.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> They've returned.<eos> Unannounced!<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Nothing good for you, I fear.
When I first mooted this venture, I imagined we'd be part of the Royalist landing, taking advantage of the chaos to break into the prison.<eos> Now we've come on ahead, we're that much more exposed.<eos> Since this is not what you enlisted for, I feel you should be given the choice to remain here.<eos> Tholly and I will make for the prison.<eos> Nay, Ross.<eos> Speaking for myself, my mind's set.<eos> We're here for Dr Enys and we'll not go home without him.<eos> 'Tis what we all signed up for.<eos> Can I ask men to take such a risk?<eos> Yet how much have I risked across the years, alongside you, knowin' I might lose all, risking' it anyway.
- The Infirmary.<eos> Enys never leaves it.<eos> - Thank you, friend.<eos> There's no room in here.<eos> We're looking for Dr Enys.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Captain Ross Poldark.<eos> You? Lieutenant Armitage of the Espion.<eos> Sir, I think these men have no business here.<eos> No business with you.
Sir, these man are armed!<eos> And I'll slit yer throat if ye don't pipe down!<eos> Have you broken in?<eos> To take Enys?<eos> Not a word.<eos> Come with me.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you want me?<eos> Yes, Dwight.<eos> We want you.
Make haste and come with us.<eos> Come?<eos> Where?<eos> How?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean that your friends have risked life and limb to free you.<eos> You must see that's impossible.<eos> I cannot abandon these men.<eos> There are only four surgeons in the entire camp.<eos> So we should go home without you?
Mine is.<eos> On account of I don't consider love to be a sin.<eos> Oh, Ross!<eos> What can be done for these people?<eos> So that's my proposal.<eos> We cannot feed all of Cornwall, so we must keep this plan to ourselves.<eos> I admit it's risky.<eos> It requires each and every one of us to play our part and it may fall at the first hurdle.<eos> - But unless we do something...<eos> - I'm with you.
I think I must go.<eos> Make your way to the prison. Free Dwight, and bring him home.<eos> What could be simpler?<eos> He's dead.<eos> In truth, I expected to die, surrounded by men I was unable to save.<eos> You will receive a favourable answer within the month.<eos> I should marry a man I do not love?<eos> George is cruel.<eos> His axe will fall. Not on you, but on the boy.
It seems to me they're ill at ease.<eos> Dwight's... far away.<eos> And Caroline just talks.<eos> I suspected as much.<eos> In some ways, bringing Dwight home was the easy part.<eos> There!<eos> Drake's toads from last summer must have bred. I hope not.<eos> But he did it for us, Wenna.<eos> To make us laugh!<eos> You especially.
Not a word to Ross!<eos> That way!<eos> After 'em!<eos> Prudie shouldn't have told you.<eos> Of course she should.<eos> You young fool!<eos> Suppose you'd been recognised?<eos> Or your sister?<eos> I wasn't thinking.<eos> You cannot imagine how delighted George would be to have you, or me, in his power.
Suppose I did ask you to wait... till I've made a goodly living, till I could provide for 'ee proper?<eos> Say nothing now.<eos> Go home.<eos> Consider all I've said.<eos> Give me an answer when you're ready.<eos> Soon, then.<eos> I will give it soon.<eos> Be it sacrilege to say so, I believe there be miracles after all.<eos> Of what nature?<eos> Miss Morwenna's to refuse Mr Whitworth and give her hand to you.
I've questioned the servants.<eos> It appears you've been seeing him regularly, and have embroiled Geoffrey Charles in your deceit.<eos> It was Geoffrey Charles who first took a liking to him, and I thought, because he was a Poldark relative, what harm could there be?<eos> What harm in fraternising with a relative of my sworn enemy?<eos> I was glad to see Geoffrey Charles so happy.<eos> And, yes, I entered into that happiness and allowed Drake to become fond of me and...<eos> I of him.<eos> And as a consequence, now refuse the impeccable match we've arranged, instead have given yourself to an illiterate miner.<eos> I have not "given myself"!<eos> Nevertheless, it's plain that our family is now tainted by its association with you.
And since Miss Chynoweth seems blind to the advantages of our proposed match, I must beg to be released from my obligation.<eos> Of course, if you wish.<eos> One moment, sir.<eos> Would you excuse us for five minutes?<eos> By all means.<eos> Is this not good news?<eos> Now we need not tell him of Morwenna's disgrace.<eos> It is excellent news.<eos> But not for that reason.<eos> You know, do you not, that we wish only the best for you?
You know, do you not, that we wish only the best for you?<eos> 'Tis a pity such kindness extends no further.<eos> For then an innocent man would not lie in jail.<eos> You seem very sure he's innocent.<eos> I would stake my life on it.<eos> And what, I wonder, would you stake to see him acquitted?<eos> Let's be having you.<eos> I only hope my testimony will be as much use to Drake as it was for Ross in Bodmin.<eos> You're an escaped prisoner of war and a hero.<eos> If they don't heed you...
What will 'ee do now, Master Drake?<eos> How will 'ee celebrate?<eos> By accepting my offer to find him a share in a profitable business so he may go and ask for the hand of a certain young lady.<eos> Is she free?<eos> Sent home to her mother in disgrace.<eos> The engagement's off.<eos> Ross told me I must tell you...<eos> You're leaving me.<eos> No.<eos> My desire to return to the Navy is not for want of love for you, but for want of knowing how to live in this world.
I have slept so long on filthy straw that soft linen seems wanton luxury.<eos> Having lived in the shadow of the firing squad, the least noise makes me scream.<eos> And every breath I take makes me feel guilt... that I am here and others are not.<eos> You think me ungrateful if I decline an invitation or some delicacy you've prepared. But in truth, I've no appetite for food or society.<eos> All I wish is to hide away until the world no longer seems strange to me.<eos> Is that why Ross sent for Hugh Armitage?<eos> There is a...<eos> There is a kind of bond between men who have seen atrocities and survived, a need to talk... until all the horror is talked away.<eos> I will not have you hear such things, but till Hugh came... I knew not how to be rid of them.<eos> And are you now rid of them?
She has every right, as do I, to ensure the safety of your unborn child.<eos> You have, if I may say so, a substantial physique.<eos> Unless you wish to risk crushing the child...<eos> You're suggesting I forgo my...<eos> My conjugal rights?<eos> To a man of God, abstinence can surely be no hardship.<eos> Not in the least, sir.<eos> Those men we took on when George shut Leisure -- they're at 40 level.<eos> Could we make use of the new arrivals there?<eos> 'Tis not down to you to feed half the county.
Are you here to congratulate me?<eos> I came to town with no other purpose.<eos> When do you take your seat?<eos> Er... next week.<eos> I shall take a house in London.<eos> Then we'll no longer be neighbours.<eos> Oh, during summer recess. If I cannot avoid it.<eos> But if Trenwith becomes surplus to requirements, - I may think of selling.<eos> - You should make him an offer.<eos> Don't waste your time -- it will never become available to you.
Now, now, sir.<eos> How does Geoffrey Charles at his new school?<eos> I fear he's inherited his father's idle habits.<eos> At school, as you recall, his father was cleverer than either of us.<eos> A promise he did not fulfil.<eos> I, of course, pay the whole cost of the boy's schooling, when he should by rights have sufficient income of his own.<eos> - From what?<eos> - His shares in your mine.<eos> Elizabeth sold his shares.<eos> Under pressure, to you, at a fraction of their worth.
At first she was hostile, but then she softened.<eos> I kissed her.<eos> I love her, Demelza.<eos> Not as I did, but with fondness -- the ghost of a love.<eos> I pity her.<eos> I want to help her.<eos> My conscience is sore, for I treated her ill.<eos> 15 years ago I would have given the earth for her, and she hasn't changed.<eos> She's no less lovely... .. but I have.<eos> I have changed because of you.
♪ Do not ask me for a kiss<eos> ♪ Life is short but love is long<eos> ♪ You may never know that bliss<eos> ♪ So I offer you this song<eos> ♪ Do not ask me for my heart<eos> ♪ Life is short but love is long<eos> ♪ Knowing we are soon to part<eos> ♪ Consolation be my song. ♪<eos> I must go up and rest.<eos> Before you do, sister, this came for you.
For as you know, Vicar, it is of great importance to the Greeks that the funeral rites be performed in full upon the body.<eos> The body, y-yes...<eos> Why do I not think you're very interested in this story, Vicar?<eos> Should you like to sit down, Vicar?<eos> I think you would.<eos> Should you like me to sit on your lap?<eos> I'm not sure I...<eos> But of course you would.<eos> You seem far away.<eos> No more than you, when you returned from Sawle churchyard.
Laugh with him, kiss him, love him, just for a day, without feeling disloyal to the man I truly love.<eos> And do you think "another" would be content with that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you?<eos> I think so, for I know who it is who truly owns my heart.<eos> Do you doubt it?<eos> Not till tonight... .. till I saw you look at him...<eos> .. the way you once looked at me.<eos> I will look at you that way again, Ross.<eos> Just be patient with me... .. as I have been patient with you.
What benefit should we seek?<eos> At least the Penvenen wedding will provide opportunity.<eos> For what? For me to further my acquaintance with Lord Falmouth.<eos> Sir Piers Arthur is dead.<eos> Truro lacks an MP.<eos> And the man who instructs the burgesses to vote for his candidate of choice?<eos> Lord Falmouth.<eos> I fear Drake still hankers for Morwenna.<eos> I rue the day she ever crossed his path.<eos> For giving George the chance to injure you through them?
As for Drake, I've been making enquiries.<eos> And?<eos> The old smith died last month.<eos> It has a cottage, a stable, and some land besides.<eos> And you have some skill in smithying, you're a quick learner.<eos> An' not a farthing to my name.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Already purchased.<eos> No, brother, 'tis too much.<eos> I like indebtedness no more than you.
No pretence needed.<eos> Every night is our wedding night to me.<eos> Lieutenant Armitage was most attentive today. To whom?<eos> Your wife.<eos> Perhaps overly attentive.<eos> Did you not notice?<eos> I confess I did not.<eos> Perhaps I imagined it.<eos> Quite possibly.<eos> Not every man in Cornwall is besotted with you.
Tell me everything.<eos> Now we have an unexpected addition to our party.<eos> He got wind of your invitation and insisted on joining us.<eos> Who can guess at his motives!<eos> His uncle and I cannot abide each other.<eos> Our ways of doing business are wholly at odds.<eos> But I have a certain fondness for the nephew.<eos> So I trust you'll forgive me for inflicting him upon you!<eos> Armitage!<eos> Are we never to be rid of you?
Should we also suppose that they're sick of the favours they enjoy, the business that comes their way in exchange for those votes?<eos> In the coming Truro by-election, many have indicated their willingness to defy Falmouth.<eos> And instead of voting for his candidate, vote for yours?<eos> We both agree change is long overdue. With the right man in place...<eos> The right man?<eos> I believe that you are the man to lead this revolution.<eos> If elected, you will serve our borough in parliament.<eos> And I'd be expected to vote as you directed.<eos> Since you and I think along similar lines... it can surely be no hardship to vote likewise?<eos> Truly, I believe that if you and I walked into a room, all the men would look at me, but within five minutes they'd all be clustered around you.
My dear, why not rest a while before you enjoy my first sermon at Sawle Church this afternoon?<eos> I will bring you your sedative.<eos> That's kind of you, Ossie.<eos> So I'm thinking of moving the family home to London.<eos> Why?<eos> If the French invade, there's no telling how this house, or our bank, or our grain stores might be ransacked.<eos> We must protect ourselves.<eos> Whilst abandoning our tenants and servants?<eos> Every man for himself.<eos> I suspect Sir Francis might disagree with you.
Drake!<eos> Must've happened in the night.<eos> Judas!<eos> Who would do such a thing?<eos> Nay, 'tis not all.<eos> This day already, four folks sent word saying they'll not be needing my services more.<eos> Yet I must carry on.<eos> Your work is good, your price fair, you've made no enemies.<eos> Bet it's George, up to his old tricks again.<eos> Gettin' at Drake to get at you.
Before I have you thrown out.<eos> Why was that upstart here?<eos> To ask me to intervene on his behalf.<eos> Intervene?<eos> Is it true that you've been attempting to drive him from his forge?<eos> His presence there is a deliberate affront by Ross!<eos> And that justifies this harassment?<eos> Wrecking a man's workshop, threatening his customers?<eos> Good God, I know no details, I leave the minutiae to Tom Harry!<eos> If the details are beneath you, is not also the intimidation of a young man whose only crime is to be related to Ross Poldark?
So...<eos> Blind?<eos> No.<eos> Nor half-witted neither.<eos> My sister is with child.<eos> Your child.<eos> Despite your attempts to sedate me, I have not been deaf all of the time.<eos> You must realise it was not my fault!<eos> That girl has some evil in her which makes a man possessed!<eos> But now, by the grace of God, I've returned to you.
.. ten.<eos> Terror and bloodshed, that is not democracy, that is vengeance.<eos> I do not endorse bloodshed and violence.<eos> I am not that man, Demelza, I have never been that man.<eos> If you do not challenge the corrupt and unjust, then commoners will rise.<eos> You'd subdue by force, your old comrades and friends?<eos> Judas!<eos> You're right, my friend.<eos> Of course I've changed sides.<eos> I'm not here to defend my country, but to protect the property of my good friend George, who would like nothing better than for me to pick up arms against you.
I will dismiss Tom Harry.<eos> I will repair the boy's smithy at my own expense.<eos> Tell me why you treat your son as if he were not your son?<eos> Is he my son?<eos> Who else's could he be?<eos> Now you see how jealousy is eating you up?<eos> I cannot abide it.<eos> I will not abide it.<eos> No. No, Elizabeth, please, I...<eos> I swear that I have never given myself to another man, except my first husband, Francis, and you.
But when I did not,<eos> I began to think life has some purpose that I knowed not till now.<eos> Why think 'ee so?<eos> For this day I found green shoots coming up out o' season.<eos> And what shoots they be?<eos> Winter primroses.<eos> Well, Ross.<eos> My compliments to the Volunteers. I believe they were put to good use today.<eos> Oh, did you think you were being summoned to fight the Frenchies?<eos> No, it seems Tom Harry got the better of you.
Because what is the author of young adult novels to do?<eos> My guess is that you made a detailed arrangement of some kind for a final payment.<eos> Yeah, you demanded to see your computer before you would cough up any more money.<eos> Is that it, Dean?<eos> When Gavin Jacobs had his throat cut with a box cutter, your laptop was out on his desk.<eos> And whoever grabbed it, they didn't dump it in the bathtub with the other computer stuff.<eos> No, not your laptop.<eos> They walked away with it.<eos> Now... who would have done that, Dean?<eos> Did you take the laptop home with you after the murder?
If he gives me names.<eos> He absolutely has to give me names of everyone in this child porn ring.<eos> Bring me the paperwork.<eos> Let's see if we can wrap this up by tonight.<eos> I don't wanna hear any more of this.<eos> Well, no one wants you in there with the guy anyway.<eos> Yeah, you can help Provenza and me file the report.<eos> It'll take hours.<eos> And that means you're free to go.<eos> Andrea won't need you anymore tonight.

I was in mommy's car.<eos> A man was driving. Who?<eos> You remember who?<eos> No?<eos> Lena, where were you going?<eos> If cath was stepping out on me, she wouldn't leave Lena alone in the house. She wouldn't do it, not ever!<eos> She's gone for good.<eos> I know something happened.<eos> She wouldn't leave.<eos> I have something for you.
Not so top down.<eos> That's all we're saying.<eos> Is that what you've been doing while I was out?<eos> Figuring out how to gang up on me? Preparing?<eos> That's not what we're doing, no.<eos> Because if I wasn't the boss, I have a feeling the three of you would be in prison right now, or worse.<eos> You with your little atm job.<eos> I had to bribe a cop.<eos> Emptied out my bank account.<eos> And what about you with that hells angels who thought you'd do better without a tongue?
You with your little atm job.<eos> I had to bribe a cop.<eos> Emptied out my bank account.<eos> And what about you with that hells angels who thought you'd do better without a tongue?<eos> And you I'm really proud of.<eos> Calling your mommy to come save you from a meat locker where you're tied up to a chair, naked, covered in your own piss.<eos> Smurf, we get it.<eos> No, you don't get it!<eos> 'Cause if you got it, you'd all be on your knees, begging for my forgiveness!<eos> It's out of respect we're being honest with you here.
No more sucking' mommy's dick!<eos> Equal partners at last.<eos> You really think baz and pope are gonna let that happen?<eos> They're just planning on being the new smurf.<eos> Not if we call bullshit.<eos> No, see, we're just grunts to them, man.<eos> And the only way that's gonna change is if we start doing our own things, start coming up with our own ideas.<eos> Our own ideas, you know, like this yacht thing I've been thinking about.<eos> I'm telling you, really up our game, you know?<eos> Yeah, man. I'm with you.
I never went to school.<eos> I can tell, man.<eos> The fancy wedding on a yacht?<eos> Yeah, we hit it while it's cruising out in the ocean.<eos> Shake down the guests, we kill the engine, and then we get away clean.<eos> How we supposed to case it?<eos> Not to mention get away in the middle of the ocean.<eos> I'm still working out the details, pope.<eos> Yeah, or we can hit new canticle like we should've done two years ago.<eos> Unless one camera and a fat guy is too much security for you.
Hello?<eos> Surprise!<eos> Tribeca, you silly goose.<eos> It's your surprise retirement party, girl.<eos> My God. You guys totally got me!<eos> Not gonna be the same around here without you, Tribeca.
Hello?<eos> Surprise!<eos> Tribeca, you silly goose.<eos> It's your surprise retirement party, girl.<eos> My God. You guys totally got me!<eos> Not gonna be the same around here without you, Tribeca.<eos> There's even talk of retiring your unisex blazer.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Tribeca, the very best of luck.<eos> It's been a pleasure working with you.
Well, we've actually only begun the process. Whoa!<eos> Did I just tune in to some boring documentary about your pathetic little life?<eos> Let me see if I can change the channel.<eos> No.<eos> Nope! There's the show I like.<eos> The one where you give me my stuffed white rhino.<eos> It's just that you dropped it off yesterday.<eos> - Stuff it! - I just...<eos> I...<eos> Stuff it, or I will stuff you.
Is there any way to spruce up this owl in time for the children's exhibit? Aww.<eos> Let's go, Ricardo. I haven't got all day.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You're not Ricardo.<eos> Welcome back, Tribeca. Not a moment too soon.<eos> I'm afraid the unthinkable has happened.<eos> A rich white man's disappeared.<eos> Duncan Farnsworth I.I.I. disappeared from his helicopter two days ago.<eos> I'm pretty sure it's the third, sir.<eos> Already seeing a pattern. How'd we get along without you?
As you were.<eos> This guy is still out there.<eos> And if it's the same one that has Farnsworth, we're looking at a serial killer.<eos> And we're running out of time.<eos> Good, you're awake.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want from me? !<eos> I'll ask the questions if you don't mind.<eos> Who am I?<eos> What do I want from you?
It seems you don't need an army or a doomsday weapon to destroy the future, all you need is to give Susan Hirsch what she always wanted... a chance to star in a real-life<eos> Isn't it obvious?

I hope you had fun because tomorrow you're going down to your uncle's and you're gonna beg for an interview.<eos> No, I can't, tomorrow's the finals.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Dad!<eos> This is my dream.<eos> Is this about the money, because first prize is ten grand.<eos> I mean, what does that stupid job pay anyway?<eos> It's not about the money, Val.<eos> And you lied to me.<eos> I trusted you and you completely let me down.

- Unbelievable.<eos> - Can you believe it?<eos> Oy, get back here! Look.<eos> Let's go, let's go.<eos> Let's go, now!<eos> Sheriff, Sheriff, caught myself a no-good 'Pulser.<eos> What's going on, who are you people?<eos> What... why is it the apocalypse?<eos> I'll tell you why it's the apocalypse.<eos> It's because thoughtless slackers like you chugged too much Impulse and when you snapped back, the world went to shit, that's why. I was...
I was studying for finals.<eos> "I was studying for fi..."<eos> That's what the president said when he snapped back with his finger on the button, you piece...<eos> Okay, walk it off.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Can you dress a wound?<eos> Can you fix a generator?<eos> Can you fend off a Death Lizard?<eos> No.<eos> Then we got no place for you here.
You're my baby.<eos> What is happening?<eos> What is happening, what is happening?<eos> Dad, I need Dad, I need Dad.<eos> My God.<eos> Dad?<eos> _<eos> You've got this, Val.<eos> You're a bad-ass bitch.<eos> I need you right now.
Come on, let's go.<eos> - Couple minutes.<eos> - All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Sheriff!<eos> Open up!<eos> How was your day, Mom?<eos> Fine.<eos> It was fine.<eos> Look, Mommy, I made this for you.
You have to figure that out for yourself.<eos> And I know that you will.<eos> I love you.<eos> Come to bed.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Babe?<eos> Honey?<eos> "Dear Evan..."<eos> "By the time you read this, I'll be gone."<eos> "It pains me to leave you and the kids, but..."
And what happens when I snap back?<eos> That's best part.<eos> You won't.<eos> Unless you live to be, like, 103.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> Do you have Field of Fire?<eos> This way.<eos> Speedrun.<eos> See you on the other side.<eos> Look, Mommy, I made this for you.
Breathe, you breathing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> I got you. Come on.<eos> Hey, just relax. Come on.<eos> I got you. Let's go.<eos> I got you. I got you. There you go.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> Hey, listen, this is what you do.<eos> This is nothing for you.
How does it feel to be back?<eos> And, what's going through your head right now?<eos> It feels great, Kenny.<eos> Aa bit surreal.<eos> Um, I'm just hoping that Matt and I put on a good show.<eos> I saw that you two exchanged some words.<eos> What did he say?<eos> You know, Matt Hughes is always a class act.<eos> He just, gave mme his condolences for my son.<eos> Well, our... Our thoughts and prayers are certainly with you and your family.
Alvey Kulina, folks!<eos> Hey, Jay, it's me.<eos> You can come in.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> You get out of the house today?<eos> - I did.<eos> - Good.<eos> You should come down to the gym, man, move around a little bit.<eos> I'll take it easy on you.
Thank you.<eos> My brother Nate and me were raised by wolves.<eos> I became one, but my brother did not.<eos> And that worried me, because I was his older brother and I had to take care of him.<eos> I had to protect him.<eos> I had to teach him.<eos> That was my job.<eos> So I would say to him that the only way to get through life is to be violent and unyielding, and I would tell him that with a lacerated face and broken hands just to prove it.<eos> And he would nod, and he would sew me up and wrap my hands.<eos> And when I would rant about how life will fuck you and tear you down... and steal from you... he would nod and he would wipe away my tears.
A lot of chicken shit motherfuckers in here.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> You are not allowed to whisper anymore.<eos> For all of you who talked shit, who made my brother's walls around him rise up, fuck you.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Step into this fucking light... and then sit the fuck down because he still would whoop your ass.<eos> All right, let's do this.<eos> Moment of silence, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He cannot fucking stand with you.
We had a girl who left to be mistress to the Duke of Norfolk.<eos> So... you will teach my cunny French?<eos> Oui.<eos> Stay.<eos> You need rest.<eos> I must sort things for Lucy.<eos> I've reserved the box.<eos> The word is out.<eos> You will have bids.<eos> See what I've been keeping for you?
She'd spent every last farthing on her gin, the slut... and she was a bunter;<eos> No one'd go near her.<eos> She sold me to a bawd for a pair of shoes.<eos> I was ten.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you know that woman's name?<eos> Mrs. Quigley.<eos> She dressed me warm, she gave me a full meal.<eos> She said if I pleased her gentlemen, I'd be her own sweet girl.<eos> I swore it wouldn't be like that for you.
Damn you for a kidnapping pimp!<eos> Come, my doves.<eos> Let's leave this rat to eat its young.<eos> He offers twice the highest bid.<eos> For me?<eos> We need the money.<eos> Then take it.<eos> If you are free to lie and cheat and play the whore, then so will I be.<eos> Look at this quagmire you've come from.<eos> Look at what I've done for you!
I will be, when I'm in my new house.<eos> Thank you, Ma, for all you've done, for Lucy and for me.<eos> You never, ever sold us short.<eos> I can't get it in, you slog!<eos> I'm soft as a rotted fruit, curse you!<eos> You're the most hideous piece of flesh I've ever had in my life, even more insipid than my dull, fatiguing wife.<eos> You're clearly frigid, still a virgin.<eos> I shall ask your mother for my money back.<eos> No... please, my lord, just tell me what to do.<eos> I've had enough of you!
In case anybody calls and...<eos> Hey. Someone had their Wheaties this morning.<eos> Um, yeah, breakfast.<eos> Thank you for the reminder.<eos> Uh-huh. I, uh, I hear your study's moving forward, your cancer study at Mississauga Memorial.<eos> Yeah, the board thought after what happened with Bree...<eos> Well, you and Alex got that study off the ground.<eos> - Don't forget that. - Yeah, I know. I just...<eos> So I finally found my thing and then I lost it just as fast. I miss having a project.<eos> Ooh, I might have something for you if you're up for it.
Good morning.<eos> How are you? Oh, I'm fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm just, uh, evaluating the residents today.<eos> Well, I can't think of a better person for the job.<eos> You are in good hands.<eos> - How was that?<eos> - That was good. I mean, you don't want to peak too soon.<eos> That was really good.<eos> Welcome to the freshly restored ER and our brand-new Leave No Trace policy, which means whatever you bring in must go with you when you leave, if you catch my drift, Dr. Lin.
I'll leave them in your office until the meeting.<eos> And stop worrying.<eos> You're gonna get wrinkles.<eos> Wanna get in some trouble, buddy?<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Let's do this!<eos> No evidence of nerve or tendon damage.<eos> Clean colles fracture.<eos> So no need for plastics, which is good, because I don't do that anymore.<eos> Look, I'm trying to hire someone new, but until I do, I need to know I can still count on you.

Unless, of course, you screw up.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> I'm just giving back to my staff who has given me so much.<eos> You want your old job back, don't you?<eos> I do.<eos> Our former CEO finally saw the error in his ways.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Former?<eos> Thomas resigned this morning.<eos> Obviously, he hasn't told you.
Thought I might find you in here.<eos> Masked strangers cutting my body open.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> You must think I'm a terrible person after what I did.<eos> I don't, but doesn't really matter what I think.<eos> Matters what you think.<eos> You know that woman you met in the emergency room? Claudia? She's wild and reckless and doesn't give a hoot what anyone thinks.<eos> She also wouldn't use the word "hoot." But me, I do.<eos> I just did.<eos> Maybe your time with Mario's more about you than it is about him.
Yeah, which is cool because I can't learn around that kind of pressure. Reminds me of my old man, and not in a good way.<eos> I much prefer your style of leadership.<eos> Leadership?<eos> Unconditional positive regard.<eos> It's kind of your brand.<eos> Makes it easy to be real around you.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey, baby, how you feeling?<eos> I've been so worried about you.
See you around, power-hungry resident.<eos> So total nut job, huh?<eos> Man, um, I was just giving Dr. Bell a pep talk.<eos> No hard feelings, buddy.<eos> You know, if you have any questions, I'm more than happy to answer them.<eos> No, no, no, you're not.<eos> You know, 'cause I've already asked you a couple times now, actually, so...<eos> Hmm. Okay, since you're offering.<eos> How was it that you knew that woman was in the elevator?<eos> I just happened to be there, same as you.
She's, um, probably just at her family's farm wearing her dad's old sweater and eating popcorn for dinner.<eos> So you heard from her?<eos> No.<eos> He just went down.<eos> Charlie said he got held up, but he'll be here any minute.<eos> Well, we should go out to eat.<eos> Hmm? To celebrate our success.<eos> I take it your endonasal endoscopy went well.<eos> Yes, um, I expect Mrs. Berry to make a full recovery.<eos> But... but, Jonathan, I am so proud of you.
- They were awful.<eos> - Oh, man. Babe, why didn't you tell me?<eos> You were so proud of them.<eos> Look, I love that you love me so much that you'll lie to my face to protect my feelings, but... You shouldn't make a habit out of that.<eos> So from now on, promise me you're always gonna tell me the truth.<eos> - No matter what. - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm tired of being Uncle Shahir.<eos> And I want to be a father.<eos> With you.
Well, I'll tell you something.<eos> All of this international shit is gonna be great for my book.<eos> This is my second act.<eos> Selina Meyer travels the globe, spreading democracy like patient zero, right, Petradze?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> This place sucks my ghost nard.<eos> Why couldn't you have gotten me on an international election watching trip to Hawaii?<eos> Hawaii is rightfully a monarchy and will be again.<eos> Look, did you read the CODEL schedule of official events or were there not enough pictures for you?
- God damn it.<eos> So, he who hath betrayed me standeth before me now.<eos> Hello, Congressman Ryan!<eos> It's been a while.<eos> I am gonna find ways to destroy you so hard that everybody at the Kennedy Center is gonna take a fucking massive shit.<eos> It's really nice to see you.<eos> So, I assume you're gonna beg for your job back.<eos> It's a very kind offer, but I already have a better job working for President Meyer.<eos> - I thought you knew that.<eos> - Okay, you know what, I don't need you.
Sorry, Mike, you cannot stay with me.<eos> Please don't make me make up a reason.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I went to find a hotel room, right?<eos> Nobody speaks English here, everything was really confusing to me, and I was chased by children. And I think I may have voted.<eos> Mike, that is the kind of voting irregularity that we are here to prevent.<eos> That sounds bad.<eos> Look, please, can you help me get it off?<eos> Unless you want the entire thumb removed with a utility blade, I suggest you find another person.<eos> Mom, I told you I get more homesick when you call.
- Hey, put that on.<eos> All the cool guys wear the band's T-shirt.<eos> You know, the band's name translates to Panzer Division.<eos> What?<eos> - I think maybe we should leave.<eos> - Uh-huh. - Excuse us.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> What did you think of Nikolai?<eos> Can I be uncharacteristically blunt with you?
Oh, my God!<eos> In what I believed were my final moments on Earth,<eos> I thought of my family and of my skeleton, which may have been on fire.<eos> Darnell, your uncle's experience of being struck by lightning was terrible.<eos> While I regret the loss of my sense of smell, which I really hope is temporary, and I'm very saddened by the many broken bones suffered by my intern, Josh, that demonstration of nature's power was very inspiring to me.<eos> So all in all,<eos> I give being struck by lightning two and a half stars.<eos> All right, A.J. What's next, please?<eos> Sometimes it's really tough to press this button, Forrest.<eos> Well, I believe in you, A.J. You can do it.
Well, it's the ratings.<eos> They're really bad.<eos> Haven't you noticed how few questions we've been getting?<eos> You're still doing it?<eos> Your ex-wife asked a question.<eos> That's how few submissions we're getting.<eos> I want you to know that I did not take this lying down.<eos> Okay.<eos> Even though they're bumping me upstairs to be a vice-president of the network,<eos> I fought for you.
All right, we're still a month away from trial.<eos> We'll get another prep session on the books for next week.<eos> You might want to get your story straight by then.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd be here today.<eos> You shouldn't have kissed me.<eos> I know.<eos> It can't happen again. I know.<eos> I don't want to put you in a position.<eos> That would threaten your career.<eos> I'm not worried about me. I'm worried about you.
If you were me,<eos> What would you do?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Guess what I found out.<eos> Markes has lupus.<eos> I know.<eos> He has a foundation.<eos> Good morning, new tanya.<eos> I got some messages for you.
Darryl's taking the deal.<eos> I already spoken to the d.A.<eos> They're relocating him and alicia to arizona.<eos> Who'd you get to represent him?<eos> Me.<eos> I wasn't going to be the latest in a long line of people. Who've abandoned that kid.<eos> Isaiah could fire you for this.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay then.<eos> I'm going into court with you.
Cam?<eos> Do you mind if I read from my notes?<eos> I... you make me nervous.<eos> Why would I make you nervous?<eos> "I used to believe" "that all people were created equal."<eos> "And then I met you."<eos> "You're a lot to live up to."<eos> "Your world is black and white,"<eos> "you know what you believe" "and you stick to it.<eos> It's easy for you..."
"You're a lot to live up to."<eos> "Your world is black and white,"<eos> "you know what you believe" "and you stick to it.<eos> It's easy for you..."<eos> Cam, look at me.<eos> Just talk to me.<eos> When I was little, I turned on the tv. And saw you defending the black panthers.<eos> My dad said, "that's isaiah roth."<eos> With awe. Like there stands a great man.<eos> And I wanted to be you.
You know what?<eos> Let-let's talk next week, I'm tired.<eos> I-I upset you. I'm sorry.<eos> You can't come in here. And lob your "what-ifs,". Because you get to leave and i...<eos> I regret a man died because of my actions.<eos> I regret that I never got to see sadie grow up.<eos> That I had to watch you, My attorney, raise her, bring her to me every saturday, And then take her home to a life of dinners and homework.<eos> And reading books in bed.<eos> Sometimes I regret.<eos> Falling in love with you, Because I see how painful it is for you to come here.
Faster we got them, faster his spirit could rest.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> You think this is enough to accuse a Kinnah of murder?<eos> They were there, watching the fire, same as all of us.<eos> Well, yeah. You see any of them on the other side of the smokehouse?<eos> No, neither did I.<eos> Well, leastways, it's enough to get Morgan on in here.<eos> Ask her some things.<eos> I know what's happening.<eos> She angers you, so now you're gonna spout false accusations about her.
No, neither did I.<eos> Well, leastways, it's enough to get Morgan on in here.<eos> Ask her some things.<eos> I know what's happening.<eos> She angers you, so now you're gonna spout false accusations about her.<eos> No. That's the new way of the world.<eos> You siding with that quail-pipe over me.<eos> I consider myself to be your most trusted counsel.<eos> Considering your history, I can't say your counsel's most trusted.<eos> Oh, well, I trust you, even being you sought to put me in the ground.
Loving the clan more meant I had to do what I did.<eos> Loving the clan more?<eos> Loving 'em more than what?<eos> Who more than who?<eos> Since the day you returned, nothing you say can erase the memory of your loving hand squeezing the life out of me.<eos> Oh, goddamn it.<eos> What the hell do you want from me?<eos> Everything I'm doin' is to help you.<eos> How much longer are you gonna punish me?<eos> You say you love me, but there's a struggle inside of you.
Why'd you run away then?<eos> I did bad.<eos> Hi, Sheriff. I'm Karen with Social Services.<eos> Hi, Karen.<eos> I'm Wade Houghton.<eos> This is my friend Sam I told you about on the phone.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Sam, this is Karen.<eos> She's a really sweet person, and she's gonna find you a place to stay tonight, okay?<eos> No, I'm staying with you.
She's a really sweet person, and she's gonna find you a place to stay tonight, okay?<eos> No, I'm staying with you.<eos> Yeah, um... you can't stay with me, Sam, 'cause there's rules about that in this town.<eos> - No!<eos> - Sheriff, don't worry.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Sheriff, I'll take it from here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sam, she's...<eos> I promise you, she's really... she's gonna look after you, okay?
- He's cool. He's with me.<eos> Go on in.<eos> Hey! What's happening?<eos> Bitches, leave.<eos> Out!<eos> Hustle, ladies, c'mon!<eos> This ain't a health spa.<eos> Step lively, ladies, c'mon.<eos> Not you, mountain man.<eos> Got something for you.
Got something for you.<eos> Eye for an eye.<eos> A gift from the brotherhood.<eos> That shitskin called you a dumb hillbilly hick.<eos> Tried to crack your skull open.<eos> He will try to kill you again.<eos> Only way to prevent that, beat him to it.<eos> Yeah, I'll take my chances.<eos> He don't think of you as a person.<eos> He'd gladly use this on you, given the chance.
Okay.<eos> See, told you it was easy.<eos> Pick up hammer, swing that hammer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me get that thing there.<eos> I knew there was that fire in ya.<eos> Smash his skull like a watermelon.<eos> That's it, brother.<eos> You don't fool me, Farrell.<eos> There's a bloodthirsty lion in you.
Sheriff's Department.<eos> Where you been?<eos> I been looking for you all night.<eos> I heard you weren't here so I waited... Slow down.<eos> I got enough pounding in my head.<eos> What's happened?<eos> Morgan killed Hezzy.<eos> You were right.<eos> It took me most of the night screwing up my pride to come get you. But she's up to something. She's gotta go.<eos> I need you by my side.
Previously on Outsiders...<eos> Now, you run as far as you can. - And don't you never come back.<eos> - Hey, you want to come see if you can show me where your parents' house is?<eos> You can't stay with me, Sam.<eos> I promise you, she's gonna look after you, okay?
I could use someone to watch my back.<eos> I'll kick you a couple bucks. Easy money.<eos> What do you say?<eos> - Times are tough.<eos> - Yeah, well, been made tougher by that sister of yours and her gang of bitches.<eos> Next time, chain 'em up.<eos> While you're here, I'm gonna give you basic survival advice.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> And be very careful who you trust.<eos> Got something for you.

I agree with you, Mr. Farrell. But the stench of them.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can't you smell it? Really?<eos> You know, I got a pretty good sense of smell, and I don't think it was them.<eos> Maybe it's your upper lip?<eos> You, you, my friend, you're as pure as the driven snow.<eos> I love that phrase.<eos> Shakespeare, A Winter's Tale.<eos> Snow so white and pure, it's yet to be poisoned by this wicked world.<eos> Just like you.
I've chosen you, and you will join me.<eos> One, because in hell, you don't have a choice.<eos> Two, because you're the whitest man to shit inside these walls since I walked in here 18 years ago.<eos> We're pure, we're clean.<eos> We share the same heart.<eos> Understand?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have offered you everything we have.<eos> And we are grateful.<eos> I commend you for holding fast to so many of your generous ways. And for understanding that the modern world has poisoned us all.
- Now, come on.<eos> Ain't you ever heard big men fall hard?<eos> Ain't happening, bro.<eos> Look, we're in this together.<eos> If you go in there and get your neck broke by that guy, then my business model's fracked, all right?<eos> I'll come up around him so fast he ain't gonna know which way is up.<eos> - I beat you, didn't I?<eos> - Funny.<eos> All I'm saying is, as your partner and de facto manager, I do not recommend this as your first real fight.<eos> Should you choose to do it, - I may have to bet against you.
- You're so full of shit.<eos> You didn't think I could beat him.<eos> Yeah, whatever, dude.<eos> Hold out your hand.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Hasil Farrell, you're a rich man.<eos> Mr. Farrell.<eos> You said you respect a man who fights his own fights.<eos> I agree.<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you, animal.
You didn't think I could beat him.<eos> Yeah, whatever, dude.<eos> Hold out your hand.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Hasil Farrell, you're a rich man.<eos> Mr. Farrell.<eos> You said you respect a man who fights his own fights.<eos> I agree.<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you, animal.<eos> Listen, I ain't afraid of you.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey, Wade.<eos> There's a plate in the fridge ready to microwave.<eos> Okay.<eos> Girls had dance class, so I figured I would just feed them before they went.<eos> And, Caleb's over next door if you want to call him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, um... I come home to have lunch yesterday.<eos> I think I heard you in the shower.<eos> Thought I heard someone in there with you.
- Well, are you hurt? - No.<eos> Oh, it's... the balance in this room is all off.<eos> I mean, you can just feel it.<eos> Well, you need to be more careful.<eos> Well, if somebody had cleaned the living room before like I asked. Right.<eos> You've been leaving out your papers.<eos> What is this?<eos> Sunny Pines, Manor on the Glen?<eos> - These are palliative care facilities. - Oh!<eos> I left them out for you, remember?
Who is Nick Murphy?<eos> The real estate agent.<eos> Alex, he's coming to appraise the house.<eos> I told you.<eos> I'm selling it.<eos> Can't I stay just a bit longer?<eos> I don't know how many more ways I can tell you this, Blake, but you are dead.<eos> Saw my body on this table. I totally get that.<eos> But what I'm saying is why can't I just chill here a little while longer?<eos> Do whatever you want. But I can't be talking to you anymore because I am busy!
No!<eos> Wait.<eos> Should I? No.<eos> I am the most qualified.<eos> Dr. Bell even said so. Yeah, well...<eos> Oh, look!<eos> Incoming trauma.<eos> We will talk about this later.<eos> Right...<eos> I need you.
Oh, look!<eos> Incoming trauma.<eos> We will talk about this later.<eos> Right...<eos> I need you.<eos> Uh, can you be more specific and less kidnappy, please?<eos> I'm on rounds.<eos> I have an OB admission, but she won't let me examine her or Dr. Rosen, who's on call.<eos> She wants a woman.<eos> Actually, Dr. Lin, she wants you.
It's been a rough year for the Katz family starting with me.<eos> Since I came out, my mother actually thinks I gave the whole family an Ayin Hara, you know, "the evil eye."<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Old World Jewish curses, Maggie. It's very serious stuff.<eos> So, Becca's treatment plan... You have room for her in your study?<eos> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> They started a new phase at Mississauga Memorial, but it's only open to existing patients.<eos> That's disappointing news.<eos> Yeah.<eos> At least she'll still have you.
At least she'll still have you.<eos> I'm not sure what I can do that her last doctor didn't think of.<eos> - You really can't stay?<eos> - No.<eos> My parents have made it very clear that they don't want me here.<eos> In fact, it's probably better for Becca if I head out before they arrive.<eos> You look good, Maggie.<eos> I put on a pelvic binder as a temporary measure till I can get the ex-fix on.<eos> Well, you bought us time to deal with the thoracic trauma. Thank you.<eos> We're gonna need to keep an eye on his pressure until we can get him back to you.
It's a little funny.<eos> Oh, I don't want him to see the water stain in the en suite.<eos> Hey!<eos> Charlie!<eos> You look great, man.<eos> Really great.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You, too, are off gluten and refined sugars, huh?<eos> No, wait a minute.<eos> I'm sensing it's something else with you.
I was a granddad.<eos> And then, um...<eos> Well, you know, a little whisper here, a little shadow there, and then one day, it was just... kapow!<eos> Kapow?<eos> Oh, kapow.<eos> Everything gets turned up to 11.<eos> You still haven't told me what this is about.<eos> Look, man.<eos> I always thought I could control this. You know that.<eos> Eventually, I found out it controls you.
The Greek islands. I want...<eos> I've always wanted to go to the Greek islands.<eos> Nick, I think we should finish this up later.<eos> My mother's had a long day.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> No, Nick.<eos> Please.<eos> Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.<eos> I-I want to hear everything that's been going on with you for the last 20 years, ever since my daughter blew it with you.
Alex, you go up and call your father and your brothers and tell them to come down and bring the music box, and... and...<eos> Oh, it's...<eos> You should he... he...<eos> Oh! Mom.<eos> Mom? Okay.<eos> All right, Mama.<eos> I got you.<eos> Just sit back down.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm here with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've had four miscarriages already. What am I gonna do?<eos> We're gonna continue with a basic chemo cocktail that doesn't hurt the baby.<eos> You're still 10 weeks from viability, so we have plenty of...<eos> Becca.<eos> What's happening?<eos> It must be where the mass is. Okay.<eos> Rivka, I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here with you.
Come on.<eos> Another chance, another chance, another...<eos> Used to always think so.<eos> Then, uh... Anyway.<eos> If I don't make it through this, you'll tell her I love her, right?<eos> Come on, Randall.<eos> Every time you've walked into this place, you somehow manage to walk out okay.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But if you're not careful, buddy, you're gonna end up in a bloody mess like this, too.<eos> Randall, I'm not you.
They hate me.<eos> This is not gonna change anything.<eos> Fine, then.<eos> What about Luke?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom, don't!<eos> Mom, come out and talk to me, please.<eos> I'm supposed to look after you, not the other way around.
This is not gonna change anything.<eos> Fine, then.<eos> What about Luke?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom, don't!<eos> Mom, come out and talk to me, please.<eos> I'm supposed to look after you, not the other way around.<eos> I still need you.
Well, I do now.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> You're the only person I've told.<eos> And it's Charlie's.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Go back to him.<eos> I do.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> It's not enough.<eos> It wasn't enough for you.
I'm pregnant.<eos> You're the only person I've told.<eos> And it's Charlie's.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Go back to him.<eos> I do.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> It's not enough.<eos> It wasn't enough for you.<eos> It wasn't enough for you and Dad.
Yeah.<eos> It's gone.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I want you back.<eos> Jesus, Drew.<eos> I'm dying.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> Your mother has chosen to recuse herself from the situation.<eos> She finds this whole thing a bit unpalatable.<eos> So we're supposed to take care of you?
Seeing the sights?<eos> Getting a feel for the city?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> Great.<eos> And you're here for business?<eos> Not that those two things are mutually exclusive and, really, it's sad if they are, but... you know what I mean.<eos> I have a couple of meetings.<eos> - Then I...<eos> - Hey. Question for you.
But he doesn't want Genesis for himself.<eos> And there's nothing anyone can do to stop him.<eos> Except me...'cause I'm the one that hired him.<eos> There.<eos> That's what I know.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> There he is!<eos> Hi, Ganesh.<eos> This is for you.
Five minutes to curtain.<eos> Curtain in five.<eos> Our deal... still holds?<eos> Kill Genesis and you'll see your family again.<eos> Tell me.<eos> He can't be trusted.<eos> I told him, but he's just gonna keep using it.<eos> New Orleans.<eos> That's where they're headed.<eos> Before you go... I have another job for you.
When's it gonna end?<eos> All right, almost there.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Get it off.<eos> Fuck.<eos> There we go.<eos> Got a little trash to take care of.<eos> Meg, where you been?<eos> Haven't seen you since I hit on you at that full moon party.
Okay?<eos> I'm not.<eos> Meg?<eos> Meg?<eos> Hi, Lannie.<eos> Could I have, um, a fucking bottle of tequila, please?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'm sorry I woke you up.<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I love you very much, honey.<eos> I love you and your brother very much.
Please leave a message.<eos> John, where the fuck are you, man?<eos> Come on.<eos> I've been calling you all fucking night.<eos> You need to meet me, all right?<eos> You need to meet me, like, right fucking now.<eos> What the fuck, man?<eos> I don't know what to do, John.<eos> Come on, you gotta call me back, man.<eos> I need you, I really fucking need you now.
Meg, let me give you a ride home.<eos> - I'm...<eos> - Give me a couple minutes.<eos> I need to go see him.<eos> - No, you need to go home.<eos> - I need to go see him.<eos> Just wait right here for a couple minutes.<eos> Home.<eos> Hello?<eos> John, I need you here.
Not me, man.<eos> I can't get past the fourth law.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Always say less than necessary.<eos> You know, you, you got that down.<eos> I know you're not taking me out here to propose to me.<eos> Or are you?<eos> Are you gonna propose to me?<eos> Come on, man, you wanna swing?<eos> I'll swing with you, I don't give a shit.
I can't guarantee it'll all work out, but at least it'll give you a fighting chance to save yourself, your family.<eos> Watch your baby son born, see him grow up.<eos> ...boarding call.<eos> Next departure is in two hours.<eos> Wait!<eos> Either path you take, there's no turning back.<eos> Yeah, John, this is Kevin again.<eos> Where the fuck are you, man?<eos> John.<eos> Come on, I need to talk to you.
Previously on "Suits"...<eos> - It's an offer letter.<eos> - We need you.
Hold your horses, mister.<eos> That was the best cup of coffee I've ever had.<eos> I told you it was worth the wait.<eos> That was nice.<eos> It was.<eos> And as much as I'd like to spend all day doing it, we should get going.<eos> Just do me a favor...<eos> Harvey.<eos> I don't think you understand.<eos> I told you once this happened again, I don't work for you anymore.

An associate, at Rand Kaldor Zane.<eos> I already have a job when I graduate.<eos> Rachel, we talked about this.<eos> When you graduate, you're gonna have to stand before the bar and pass the character and fitness test.<eos> And you think working at your firm looks better than looking at mine.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Dad, I...<eos> Rachel, I understood when you wanted to work there when Jessica was still there.<eos> But now that she's gone, that firm is gonna turn upside down, and I don't want you there when it does.<eos> Dad, you are my family, and I would do anything for you.
- Darryl.<eos> - Mike.<eos> Good luck in there, Mike.<eos> I think the first thing we should do is send a message that we're back by hiring a new class of associates.<eos> Yeah, I love the idea of sending a message, but I'm not ready to talk about hiring associates right now.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I'm not.<eos> In that case, maybe you're ready to talk about a merger.<eos> Robert, what are you doing here?<eos> Jessica didn't tell you?
We should hire a new class of associates.<eos> What, are you kidding me?<eos> You're gonna ignore that gauntlet he just threw down?<eos> He wasn't throwing down a gauntlet, Louis.<eos> He was trying to capitalize on an opportunity.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> He challenged our leadership.<eos> And if we don't get it together right now, he's gonna tell the entire city that we can't even agree on who's in charge.<eos> Louis, Jessica's flight hasn't even touched down yet.<eos> I'm not gonna get in a pissing contest with you over who should run the firm.
Louis, Jessica's flight hasn't even touched down yet.<eos> I'm not gonna get in a pissing contest with you over who should run the firm.<eos> I knew it. You don't think I should be the one in charge.<eos> What I think is, you were here at 6:00 a.m. looking at the books, figuring out a game plan that I wasn't ready to implement, and now I am.<eos> So instead of picking a fight with me that I'm not in the mood to have, why don't you do what you said you were going to and hire a new class of associates?<eos> Hey.<eos> Oliver.<eos> Oh, uh, Mike.<eos> Mike, sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> What can I do for you?
I'm just right back there.<eos> There's about a dozen miniature Deadpools on my desk.<eos> Don't judge.<eos> It's a great movie, and you know it.<eos> I do know it.<eos> Saw it three times.<eos> You bullshitting me?<eos> Of course I am.<eos> I want to work here.<eos> Get it back to me. I'll take care of you.
It's good to see you too, Katrina.<eos> Listen, if you came here to make sure that I kept my word--<eos> Oh, Katrina, that was a long time ago.<eos> I'm here because I want you to come home.<eos> Back to the firm?<eos> Yes.<eos> Back where you belong.<eos> - Louis, I can't do that.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> And not only that, you can get the ten best associates from Robert Zane's stable to come with you.
I am. I mean, a legal clinic isn't the only way to give back.<eos> Father, I'm not sure if you heard me.<eos> I'm a convicted felon.<eos> Michael, you-- you came from here.<eos> And if we can't offer redemption to one of our own, then... what kind of church are we?<eos> I don't know, Father, I...<eos> Father Conroy's going on vacation for two weeks.<eos> Just take his classes.<eos> See what it's like.<eos> The worst thing is, you'll realize that this isn't right for you.
You want the truth?<eos> It's why I'm here.<eos> Then my answer is, if I were on the ethics committee, I don't know whether I'd pass you or not, because the fact is, you're engaged to a man who pretended to be a lawyer.<eos> And I find it hard to believe that you didn't know about it the whole time.<eos> And since then, he's paid his dues.<eos> And what about you? What about me?<eos> Do you think the committee would have me break up with the man that I love just because he went to prison?<eos> What does that say about character and fitness?<eos> You make a good point.<eos> And if I were you, I'd be prepared with some others, 'cause I'd say one day soon, you're gonna have to make your case.
Then who is?<eos> You know who is.<eos> You're just afraid to go and see them.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Blue or this maroon one?<eos> You got a job in one day?<eos> I wouldn't be trying on ties if I didn't.<eos> Mike, that's amazing.<eos> I knew people would see the real you.
These kids need your help.<eos> I wanted to help people as a lawyer, not as a teacher.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Difference is, clients actually want my help.<eos> Michael, these kids need it.<eos> They just don't know it.<eos> I don't know, Father.<eos> This is...<eos> Michael, if I just needed someone to grade papers and take attendance, I could've got a trained monkey to do that.<eos> I wanted you because I thought you, of all people, could get through to them.
That's Zane's biggest client.<eos> Yeah, that's exactly why we're going after him.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Whatever time you set up that meeting,<eos> I guarantee you, Jeremy Cohen called Robert two minutes later, which means we need to figure out a way to make amends.<eos> No, I don't need to make amends.<eos> I need to make a statement, and that statement is,<eos> "Do not mess with the new managing partner of Pearson Specter Litt."<eos> Louis, that is the wrong statement to make.<eos> And if you insist on making it, I won't come work for you.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about Jeremy Cohen!<eos> I don't know anything about Jeremy Cohen, and I'm not trying to poach anyone.<eos> Then you're even less prepared to be a leader than I thought, because your partner's out there coming after my firm, and you don't even know it!<eos> Maybe Louis wouldn't be doing that if you hadn't come here with some bullshit merger designed to rip us apart.<eos> Are you really that stupid?<eos> Are you really telling me that isn't what you wanted?<eos> If I wanted to rip you apart, you'd be in million pieces right now, because Jessica is gone, and you're not in my league.<eos> I offered the merger because my daughter has some kind of misguided loyalty to you, and I didn't want to extinguish that spark in her.<eos> If I'm not in your league, why is she loyal to us instead of you?

I'm not looking to get in a fight with you.
Donna--<eos> Harvey, you can't do whatever you want.<eos> Jessica's not here to pick up the slack anymore.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> Well, if you do, then it's time you do what she would've done already.<eos> You need to tell Louis he can't be managing partner.<eos> He doesn't want to hear it.<eos> I know that.<eos> But the real reason we're having this conversation is that you're afraid to say it.<eos> It's up to you, Harvey.
I know it does.<eos> I... I don't know what to say.<eos> I think you do.<eos> You're right.<eos> Yes, Louis.<eos> I accept your offer.<eos> All right, you drive a hard bargain.<eos> Third-year associate it is.<eos> Thank you, Louis.<eos> No, thank you, Rachel.
- Do you?<eos> Because you just lashed out at Louis when your intention was to let him down gently, and I find it hard to believe it had nothing to do with this office being empty.<eos> She didn't even come back to say good-bye.<eos> She just packed up her things.<eos> - Harvey...<eos> - They're all leaving, Donna.<eos> First Jessica, now Mike.<eos> They're family.<eos> And family's not supposed to...<eos> Harvey, I've always stayed away from a certain subject with you, but I can't anymore.
Listen to me--you just suffered a huge loss, and you're acting like it's business as usual.<eos> I'm acting like I've got a job to do.<eos> Harvey, if you don't grieve him--<eos> I will grieve my father in my own way.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> You'll bottle it up, and you'll try to move on, but--<eos> She's gonna be there, Donna.<eos> I know she is.<eos> But this funeral isn't about her.<eos> And it's not about you.
- I don't understand.<eos> - Hector Suarez.<eos> I'm assuming you remember him, too, right?<eos> - What about him?<eos> - Well, after you left, I picked up your file.<eos> Don't tell me--you kept him in the country.<eos> No, Mike.<eos> You did.<eos> I thought, "Maybe this guy will become a lawyer someday."<eos> And then I read about you in the paper last year and found out you never did.
No, Mike.<eos> You did.<eos> I thought, "Maybe this guy will become a lawyer someday."<eos> And then I read about you in the paper last year and found out you never did.<eos> So you knew that I faked being a lawyer twice, and you're still here to offer me a job?<eos> I wouldn't be, except for this.<eos> You told the truth.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, that means you're worth taking a chance on.<eos> Wow, you really are a do-gooder.<eos> I'm not here to do good for you.

- She is not saying a single word as long as I'm here.<eos> Yes, she is, and if you make a scene in front of my kids on the day that we put our dad into the ground,<eos> I swear to God, I will beat the shit out of you, because she's my mother, and I'm gonna let her say her piece.<eos> Hey.<eos> Harvey... It's good to see you.<eos> Wish I could say the same thing, Lily, but... I'd be lying if I did.<eos> Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> And whether you believe it or not, I loved your father.<eos> And I am sad to see him go.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't believe it, and I didn't come here to see you.
And I am sad to see him go.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't believe it, and I didn't come here to see you.<eos> I came here to honor my father, so get up there, say what you're gonna say, and let's get this over with.<eos> Harvey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> This is wonderful.<eos> I thought maybe you wanted to get dinner tonight.<eos> There is nothing I would rather do than get dinner with you, but I can't tonight.
Mike is from Pearson Specter Litt, and he knows more about law than all of you combined.<eos> So, if Mike tells you to do something, you do it.<eos> I don't mean to question the new world order, but what is his title?<eos> Great question, Marissa.<eos> Um... senior individual in charge of you?<eos> Any more queries?<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> All right, back to work.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You really weren't kidding when you said you were doing this for you.
He has an emergency.<eos> So you mean Harvey needs my help.<eos> - Louis--<eos> - Donna, give me one good reason why I should help him.<eos> You're not helping Harvey, Louis.<eos> You're helping the firm.<eos> Teddy is a client of all of us.<eos> No, Harvey made it clear that there is no us.<eos> Louis, Harvey's going through something right now.<eos> His outburst wasn't about you.

You got a job at a legal clinic?<eos> Mike, that's amazing.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> - Yes, they know about me.<eos> In fact, it's the reason I got hired.<eos> Let me guess--they were smart enough to appreciate they can get someone with your experience for ten cents on the dollar.<eos> You got it.<eos> $35,000 a year to be exact.<eos> Which means... we should probably start packing up the place now, 'cause we definitely cannot afford to live here anymore.<eos> I would live in a shoebox with you if it meant you were happy.
You said 3:00, so I called her in at 2:30 because I knew you wouldn't give me the chance to meet her, just like I know the other side is gonna approach her when you're not there.<eos> - They can't do that. - Why?<eos> Because it's unfair?<eos> - Because it's illegal.<eos> - Only if she pursues them, which she'll never do because they're gonna find out whatever her weak spots are, and then they're gonna offer her exactly the amount she needs to get by, and then she's gonna take it.<eos> If she does that, she'll end up homeless.<eos> Which is why we need to be prepared for it to happen.<eos> Now, do you want to work on this thing together or not?<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you that she was gonna speak before you got here.<eos> I just didn't have it in me to have it out with you.
Yeah.<eos> You made your strawberry pie.<eos> It was his favorite.<eos> Maybe you forgot it was mine, too.<eos> I didn't forget.<eos> It was a nice speech.<eos> Thank you, Harvey.<eos> Harvey... when my parents died, I felt like I was completely alone in the world.<eos> I don't want you to feel that way.<eos> I want you to know that whether you want me in your life or not, you still have a mother that loves you and will always be there for you.
- Well, can't you understand how that could devastate a person?<eos> I can understand how this was just a mistake, because you are the same selfish, self-centered, disloyal woman you always were.<eos> And you are the same self-absorbed, childish man you always were.<eos> Well, whose fault is that? Oh.<eos> There you go. Leave.<eos> That's what you do best. What'd you just say to me?<eos> I said take a look in the mirror, Harvey, because I may have neglected my family in the past, but you've been doing it for as long as I can remember.<eos> So what am I supposed to tell the kids in the morning?<eos> You tell them I've got business back in New York.<eos> You want me to lie for you?
You can tell her yourself, because I'm doing being in the middle of you two.<eos> Bobby.<eos> Where is he?<eos> - Hey, now's not the time.<eos> - You son of a bitch.<eos> You think you can just walk into our lives and--and rip open old wounds?<eos> Your lives?<eos> You better get the hell out of my face before I do something that you'll regret.<eos> You already did something I regret by talking to your mother the way you did.<eos> That woman gave up the right to be called my mother when she got together with you behind my father's back.

Rachel, I need you to help me with something, and I need it quickly.<eos> What is it?<eos> Teddy Doyle needs to access the proceeds from the sale of his company that were put in trust to avoid taxes, and he needs to do it without triggering those taxes.<eos> Louis, are you kidding?<eos> This isn't Dubai.<eos> He's not gonna be able to do that.<eos> I know that, but I need him to be able to anyway.<eos> Give me the file. I'll figure something out.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm proud of you, Louis.
- Actually, i am supposed to stay away from our apartment for awhile.<eos> - So anyway, I said to Louis, "i don't care "if most of the associates start in the bullpen.<eos> I'm not giving up my office."<eos> - That's great, Rachel, but I'm on my third glass of chardonnay, and I don't think you called me over here to tell me you submitted your application to the bar, or that you're putting your foot down with Louis.<eos> You're right.<eos> I called you over here to tell you that... I put my foot down with Mike.<eos> - You finally told him to pick a hairstyle and stick with it?<eos> - No.<eos> I finally told him that he made me a promise before he went away, and now that he's back and gainfully employed, it's time for him to make an honest woman of me.<eos> - Rachel, I'm so happy for you.
- No.<eos> I finally told him that he made me a promise before he went away, and now that he's back and gainfully employed, it's time for him to make an honest woman of me.<eos> - Rachel, I'm so happy for you.<eos> And the answer's yes.<eos> - What answer?<eos> I didn't ask you a question yet.<eos> - Yes, you did, and I'd be thrilled to be your maid of honor.<eos> - Thank you, Donna.<eos> - Mike, that's great.<eos> I'm happy for you.
What are we celebrating?<eos> - The fact that it's your first sonogram this week.<eos> - Louis, about the sonogram...<eos> Joshua asked if he could be there.<eos> - He's the baby's father.<eos> He wants to be in its life.<eos> - Or wants to be in your life.<eos> - Louis, i chose you over him.<eos> You don't have to be worried about that.<eos> And if you want me to say he can't be there for this, but he asked me, and I thought it was a fair request, so I'm asking you.
- um, excuse me, i just need to- oh, hello, Benjamin.<eos> Have you come to manipulate my hard drive?<eos> Debug my processor?<eos> Reboot my motherboard?<eos> - Please, I just need to update your vox in peace.<eos> - If I wanted my vox updated, I'd be talking to someone with a lot more experience than you.<eos> - Ms. paulsen, i know you know this but I will remind you for the 37th time-- that vox is our computer's operating system, and it needs to be updated once a quarter.<eos> - Once a quarter?<eos> What, are we married?<eos> 'Cause I got news for you.
Normally, instead of coming to me, you'd go full steam ahead and do something that makes the situation significantly worse.<eos> - Possibly.<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> - Why did you come to me?<eos> - Because we said we'd run this firm together, of what I'm good at and what you're good at.<eos> - And you know I'm better at this kinda thing than you are?<eos> - I do.<eos> - Thank you, Harvey.<eos> And it shows growth on your part not to make light of the fact that I just admitted something that was...<eos> - You mean that I'm better at everything than you.
- And you know I'm better at this kinda thing than you are?<eos> - I do.<eos> - Thank you, Harvey.<eos> And it shows growth on your part not to make light of the fact that I just admitted something that was...<eos> - You mean that I'm better at everything than you.<eos> - That's not what I said.<eos> - Too bad, because that's what I heard.<eos> - Okay, Harvey, seriously, this is not about you having fun with me.<eos> This is about Rachel.<eos> - I know it is, and if I weren't confident that I could take care of it, I wouldn't be giving you a hard time for admitting how much better I am at everything than you.
- you really can tell if it's fresh brewed or not?<eos> TheDonna: Please, thisisn'tmy firstrodeo.<eos> You're telling me.<eos> - Donna, could I talk to you for a second?<eos> TheDonna: Of courseyou can .<eos> Whatdoyouneed,hotpants ? - What--what is that?<eos> - It's a device called the Donna that Benjamin's working on, and it's awesome.<eos> Go ahead, ask it something.<eos> - I don't wanna ask it something.<eos> I wanna ask you something.
If by friend, youmean- of course you can, Rachel.<eos> - So let me get this straight, you're in love with a woman that you've known for about ten minutes.<eos> She's having another man's baby, and yet, you're gonna marry her, and raise it as your own.<eos> - In a nutshell.<eos> - What exactly do you want from me?<eos> - I need your advice.<eos> The guy's gonna be at the sonogram tomorrow, and I'm afraid i may cause a scene.<eos> - Louis, I don't understand what you're coming to me for.<eos> What do I know about-- - here, this is why.<eos> Yeah, you get it? This is why I'm coming to you.
- What do you see when you look at me?<eos> Right now, be honest.<eos> Say the first three things<eos> - Teeth, nose, teeth.<eos> - God damn it!<eos> Be serious.<eos> - I am being serious.<eos> - Well, you know what-- never mind.<eos> I shouldn't have come to you. - Louis, it doesn't matter what I see.<eos> What matters is what this woman sees, and she obviously sees something, or she wouldn't be with you.
I'm gonna be in the same room as him, looking at an image of what he made with her.<eos> How do I not lose my shit?<eos> - You're right.<eos> It is his baby.<eos> And you're gonna want it to have as much love as it possibly can, and that means having a good relationship with its father, because there's nothing more important than family.<eos> You're right.<eos> Thank you, Harvey.<eos> - Hey, Mike.<eos> How's it going out there?<eos> What can I do for you?
You didn't even want him to be here in the first place.<eos> - Well, I want him here now.<eos> - Louis, I thought you were a more forgiving person than this.<eos> - And I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship with its biological father.<eos> - And he's going to.<eos> But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think i don't really know you.<eos> Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?<eos> - Are we ready to take a picture?<eos> - no, I don't.<eos> And now I feel like I'm ruining this, so... If you don't want me to come in with you, I won't.
- God damn it, Oliver, say it's inadmissible.<eos> - Yes, it is, but-- and therefore my client should be absolved of all liability.<eos> - Your honor, this is the fraudulent attorney<eos> I spoke with you about before trial. We ask that he either refrain from speaking, or be removed from the court with an immediate ruling for the defense.<eos> - Request granted.<eos> Sir, open your mouth in my courtroom again, and you will be removed, and this case will be dismissed.<eos> Mr. Grady, do you have an objection to Ms. Johnson's statement or not?<eos> - I don't.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't. - Then the court has no choice but to dismiss this case with prejudice.<eos> - Benjamin, before you ask, i already told you- what if I could make it more like you?
- Well, then the first thing that you need to learn is never, ever, ever sit in my chair.<eos> - Relax, Benjamin, I'm just messing with you.<eos> - Oh. - But get out of my chair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Louis, what-- what are you doing here?<eos> - I need to bring you a few things.<eos> - What is all that? - High school yearbooks, childhood photo albums, and six out of seven of the highlight reels my mother shot of us growing up.<eos> - What happened to the seventh?<eos> - Oh... Summer of dd.<eos> And if it's all the same to you, I would like to still be able to have sex again.
So you think she's lying.<eos> I think she's crazy.<eos> Still, I wouldn't mind getting her in a room alone.<eos> She seemed perfectly sane to me.<eos> And after Eros, my definition of crazy has contracted significantly.<eos> Well, she has zero credibility. There's no point talking to her again.<eos> The point is that something was bothering her and she was ordered to suppress it.<eos> Mars is using peace as a distraction.<eos> "Peace as a distraction."<eos> God, I wish I could disagree with you right now.
So you think I'm crazy?<eos> I think we asked too much of you too soon.<eos> Bobbie, truth and fact are not the same thing. Now I know this may be too much for you to grab a hold of right now.<eos> But you believe what you saw is true because you need it to be true.<eos> To explain how your team was killed.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> Now you go home back to Mars.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> And then what?<eos> Then we do what's best for you and for the Corps.
What you want, pampa?<eos> You Roma?<eos> Who Roma?<eos> There's some people on the station we need to find.<eos> Heard Roma's the man to talk to.<eos> Ah, in that case...<eos> Ah, cute kid, copain.<eos> We need to find her and the man with her.<eos> And we need to find them quickly.<eos> Lot of jobs ahead of you.
Back straight.<eos> Head down, staring at your toes.<eos> Then... Raise your chin, slowly...<eos> Millimeter at a time...<eos> Till your eyes are locked on the horizon.<eos> Okay.<eos> In a couple of weeks, your brain will forge the pathways. Your inner ear will get the memo.<eos> Then you'll be no different than an Earther.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now you.
All right.<eos> Just calm down. - Think I give a shit about your family? - Hmm?<eos> - Just...<eos> - You wanna see your Rocky grow up, huh?<eos> - Calm down. Calm down.<eos> I'm gonna need a little time.<eos> I have to find a captain.<eos> Pull over.<eos> Twenty-four hours.<eos> And if you fuck me, Kevin, I will come back and kill you and all your family.
Why is it so important for you to be superior to me?<eos> Me? I mean, I'm a fucking... I'm an asshole.<eos> But why do you get so much satisfaction by feeling superior to me?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Yes, you do, John.<eos> You've done it my whole life.<eos> I shouldn't take it personally.<eos> You've done it to me, to Meg.<eos> - You did it to Danny.<eos> - I don't feel like I'm better than you.
Nolan came by to see me earlier.<eos> He wanted to talk about Danny.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> You know he was talking to Chelsea at the trial, right?<eos> Did you see that?<eos> What do you think he knows, John?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> - You don't have a number on him, do you?<eos> I don't know shit about that kid.<eos> What exactly is it that you want me to do for you?
I couldn't have even told you then what it meant.<eos> But there was a heaviness in the air.<eos> And I tried.<eos> I really tried to put it out of my mind for years.<eos> But I was right.<eos> You are, all of you.<eos> But you more than anybody.<eos> You've never really been happy.<eos> I could feel that.<eos> And I guess I just thought that I... I was so in love with you that... maybe... maybe I could help change that.

He won't do that.<eos> He's not gonna do that.<eos> He said I'm like a son to him.<eos> He wouldn't do that.<eos> Have you ever wondered where the murder weapon is?<eos> The night everything happened, Shakowski tells you to go out and bring it back to him.<eos> Why would he do that, Kevin?<eos> 'Cause Roy has it now.<eos> That's why.<eos> I'm telling you because you need to know where the investigation is.
Okay, but is he gonna testify?<eos> Look, I don't know exactly what he's gonna do... but that's between you and Kevin now.<eos> Your brother's facing some heavy time.<eos> I'm just glad to see him turn himself in safely.<eos> Okay.<eos> When do you wanna do the handoff?<eos> Tomorrow, nine o'clock, his place.<eos> And I've talked to him.<eos> He promises me he'll be ready.<eos> I know this is hard for you.
He's a good person.<eos> Anyway... I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> You're sure?<eos> Are you sure this is the right thing?<eos> You feel okay about it?<eos> I don't see any other way through it, Belle.<eos> - And John?<eos> - He agrees.<eos> Belle.<eos> I never wanted to hurt you or Rocky.
Hola, Nicolas.<eos> You motherfucker.<eos> How much longer?<eos> Fifty miles to Bimini.<eos> - You gonna miss it?<eos> No.<eos> Well, there it is.<eos> I can't believe you've never seen it before.<eos> I always heard it was beautiful, but didn't imagine anything like this.<eos> Your mom never showed it to you?
And later, I confessed because Chidi was being tortured by guilt, and I just felt awful seeing his little, nerdy face all contorted.<eos> Oh, Eleanor, I have a stomachache because of what you did.<eos> He is such a dork.<eos> You know, a lot of death row inmates feel regret about things they never said... admissions of guilt or anger... or love.<eos> Are you making a move on me?<eos> It's fine... I just didn't see it coming.<eos> Uh, well, hooking up with someone with the exact same name, it is kind of a fun, narcissistic fantasy...<eos> - No, no, Eleanor, I... I'm talking...<eos> - I could be into it.<eos> Mm, no, I'm talking about you and Chidi.
Please, take him for an hour, take all the time you want.<eos> Okay, sit down, maybe.<eos> I dated many annoying guys, okay?<eos> They would call me all times of the day "just to talk" or ask me if I'd taken cash out of their wallets, stupid stuff.<eos> And when I stopped having fun with them, I'd leave. Usually wouldn't even call or anything.<eos> I'd just bounce.<eos> Gotta go spend that money you stole.<eos> Point is, you are way more of a buzzkill than any of those dudes.<eos> Okay, thanks for this conversation.<eos> But, somehow, I never want to leave you.

Why are you so nice to me?<eos> Well, you were very nice to me while I was rebooting.<eos> Also, I'm programmed to be nice to everyone.<eos> Janet?<eos> I just realized something.<eos> I love you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have one more question for you.<eos> So you also love Chidi, and you... you just told him, just now, right before I did?<eos> Technically, you told him that he loves you, but yes.
They are much smarter than me.<eos> Now, hair extensions?<eos> This is where I shine.<eos> You were already at almost-maximum hotness, but now you look like a sexy, tan Rapunzel.<eos> Ugh, the dream.<eos> And how exactly did you learn how to do this?<eos> When I was 14, I had to make myself look older to get a job.<eos> These were the ones I used, and they are real cheap.<eos> You're gonna want to stay away from open flames and altercations at outlet malls.<eos> Hey... I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you about Jianyu and that you got saddled with him.
Now that we know, we can actually do something about it.<eos> And I am an expert at mediating conflict, like when my friends Scary, Sporty, Posh, and Baby had an issue with my other friend Archbishop Desmond Tutu.<eos> Yeah, I don't know what I love more about our morning hardboiled egg routine, the eggs or the routine.<eos> Um, actually, this morning, there's a little surprise in yours.<eos> "I love you." How cute.<eos> I love you too, egg.<eos> Oh, no, no, Chidi, that... that's me saying that to you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, that is... something.<eos> I know you've gone through a lot, and now I'm throwing this at you, but I just... I had to tell you how I feel.
I do!<eos> Eleanor, for an utter novice, you have thrown a lovely party.<eos> Well, thanks, but it's not working.<eos> Not one more point.<eos> What the fork?<eos> Oh, look, Michael's here.<eos> He can help.<eos> Michael, would you do us the honor of saying a few words?<eos> I don't know that I'm in the right frame of mind.<eos> Please, they'll listen to you.
Like a stripper over that last bump of coke at the party, if you know what I mean.<eos> But anyway, they finally came to this compromise, you know?<eos> Well, it beats being tortured.<eos> I was about to turn myself in.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, there's no time for that morality nonsense, sweetheart.<eos> This is about survival.<eos> You gotta look out for number one.<eos> Right, well, we don't have proof that it doesn't cure Alzheimer's.<eos> Eleanor, we've got a surprise for you.
You guys helped me and Eleanor, right, but we're bad, so you helping us was bad.<eos> It's basic consequentialism:<eos> the morality of an action is solely judged on its consequences.<eos> Great.<eos> The one time you actually remember something from class.<eos> Maybe I was brought here by mistake, but since we've been here, I just tried to stay out of everyone's way.<eos> Chidi's done worse stuff than me.<eos> He murdered Janet.<eos> He killed my wife!<eos> I was trying to stop you from doing it!
Whispering away like two Beefeaters on a tea break.<eos> I bet they're plotting against us.<eos> No way.<eos> Eleanor wouldn't do that.<eos> You do have feelings for her, don't you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes.<eos> But no.<eos> Please don't make me think about this again. My brain will break.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just that I have certain feelings for you.
See?<eos> We've been torturing each other since the moment we arrived, and everything Michael has done has made at least one of us miserable.<eos> I had to be his assistant and try and find myself.<eos> He convinced me to throw my life's work in the garbage.<eos> He made sure I'd see those bogus neighborhood rankings because he knew I'd hate being second-to-last.<eos> And I had the perfect bud hole and no dudes to share it with.<eos> He played us like a fiddle.<eos> You gotta give it up.<eos> Oh, dip!<eos> Eleanor, I told you that first night that we were in a prank show.
- All I want to do...<eos> - Is throw tiny fruit at me.<eos> Precisely.<eos> And help you set up your home for when sweet Rose and Castleroy arrive from France.<eos> - You did it!<eos> - Of course I did!<eos> You provide a huge target.<eos> Gigantic, really.<eos> I see now why Lola spoke of her childhood here so fondly.<eos> And now your daughter will get to experience the same, living here with you and your husband.
Are you saying that we should marry?<eos> Would it be the worst thing?<eos> It would not.<eos> For the good of Scotland.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm trying to picture this, Charles. I really am.<eos> You and that sweet girl, Bianca, together in a field of weathered bones and putrid remains.<eos> Was that your idea of a romantic evening?<eos> Well, aren't you a charmer. Or am I wrong?<eos> Because this is the tale that she is telling, the reason that she fled from you in the dark and, in blind desperation, fell down a ravine.
After our father.<eos> - You must be Lord Darnley. - Indeed.<eos> I'm going to hazard a guess that you are James?<eos> Lord Moray, my brother and most trusted adviser.<eos> And it is as your adviser that I am here.<eos> I have news that cannot wait.<eos> For the queen.<eos> Please excuse us, Lord Darnley.<eos> I've learned that John Knox is speaking this very day at a farm outside Perthshire.<eos> He intends to turn Catholics against you.
Of course.<eos> Things are going well, I take it?<eos> It's not... awful.<eos> Mother,<eos> - Leith.<eos> - Is gone.<eos> And Luc may appear to be a decent man, but I've learned to never trust the beginning of a book.<eos> He is a Narcisse, after all.<eos> I know this isn't what you wanted, but for now, this marriage will protect you.<eos> And because I am partially to blame for your situation, here is my promise to you.
What is it?<eos> Will you excuse me for a moment?<eos> Charles!<eos> I heard that you had taken to your bed.<eos> Where are you...?<eos> Charles!<eos> Is that blood?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Did you hurt someone?<eos> Do you realize what people are whispering about you?
I am an officer of the kingsguard!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Claude!<eos> Claude!<eos> You're getting married.<eos> I do wish you were happier about this.<eos> It's the decision I made when I sent Gideon away.<eos> But still, for a moment there I allowed myself to think it could be more.<eos> When we were handing out bread, fighting the fire together, not as king and queen, but as two people of like mind and spirit.<eos> Like you and Francis.
When we were handing out bread, fighting the fire together, not as king and queen, but as two people of like mind and spirit.<eos> Like you and Francis.<eos> Darnley has shown his true ambition.<eos> Can you blame anyone for wanting to be king?<eos> No, I suppose not.<eos> You don't have to marry him.<eos> If I want to challenge Elizabeth and survive, - But what is survival without even the hope of love?<eos> - My people...<eos> - I'm not talking about your subjects.<eos> I'm talking about you.
Son of a bitch.<eos> He really did it.<eos> Mr. Moneybags had someone kill his ex's husband.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'd like to speak to a lawyer.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> ♪ Small town kind of funny Mark?<eos> What the hell are you doing standing in front of my apartment building?<eos> Wait, are you waiting for me?<eos> Good morning to you, too, Honor Roll.
- Get the hell away from me, Mark.<eos> - ‭Amy, hold on.<eos> I know what you're thinking. It's 100% wrong.<eos> Is it?<eos> You just did everything you could to destroy my credibility on the stand.<eos> Rothman could only have known what was on my phone because you told her.<eos> Look, you think I don't know what this feels like?<eos> I know what this feels like. I lost my whole career on the witness box.<eos> My reputation, too.<eos> You think I'd do that to you?
You said, if word got out about Genesis... that's happened.<eos> Someone's after us.<eos> - Genesis.<eos> - Don't tell Jesse.<eos> I changed my mind about getting married.<eos> If God likes jazz, we're gonna follow the music.<eos> What better place to look for him than...<eos> New Orleans.<eos> Eugene, where are you?<eos> I need you.
I already wrote my suicide note.<eos> "To whom it may concern Dear everybody, my death has nothing to do with that asshole Tucker."<eos> "I hereby leave Buckeroo to Suzy K., my only friend who cared enough to bring him carrots.<eos> The rest of my stuff should be kept exactly where it is, like a shrine so people can remember me.<eos> Under no circumstances are my brothers ever allowed in my room."<eos> "For Tucker, I'll leave a list of all the guys I've had really great sex with so he can be jealous for all eternity...<eos> Greg, Houston, Cody H., Cody D."<eos> Cody D.?<eos> Well it was just anal so I'll still get into Heaven.<eos> The part about you is at the end.
My funeral playlist is on page 14.<eos> Make sure they bury me in that dress.<eos> Look, I-I-I'm sorry, Tracy, but I-I'm not gonna help you with this.<eos> - No way.<eos> - You have to.<eos> You're the only person I can count on to do what I say.<eos> Look. I know this hurts, but dying is not the answer.<eos> Living is.<eos> Look, Tracy, God would not want you to give up on yourself just 'cause... just 'cause Jenny Lewin's got a big mouth.<eos> He's probably got a miracle waiting for you right around the corner.
Tracy?<eos> Eugene, you leave my daughter alone.<eos> Eugene, you answer me right now!<eos> You monster!<eos> You get your hands off my daughter, Eugene!<eos> I'm calling your father right now!<eos> Eugene!<eos> Eugene!<eos> Eugene, where are you?<eos> I need you.
Eugene, you leave my daughter alone.<eos> Eugene, you answer me right now!<eos> You monster!<eos> You get your hands off my daughter, Eugene!<eos> I'm calling your father right now!<eos> Eugene!<eos> Eugene!<eos> Eugene, where are you?<eos> I need you.<eos> I need you.
I told you a bunch of times, okay?<eos> I got a stomachache.<eos> It's like piercing, sharp, grabby kinda of feeling.<eos> Sharp, grabby kind of feeling?<eos> Is that all you got to say?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> - Feel better.<eos> - Don't be mad at me.<eos> Why would I be mad at you?
Stupid New Orleans.<eos> All right.<eos> We... We could always just leave.<eos> You know, I'm a big proponent of running away from your problems.<eos> Yeah? Well, Jesse's not.<eos> As long as he thinks God's here, he's not going anywhere.<eos> I'm sure he might if he knew about your troubles.<eos> If he knew about my troubles, he'd make it a whole lot worse. - Believe me.<eos> - Why would he do that?<eos> He's your ex-fiancé, and he loves you.
That's right.<eos> Preachers aren't allowed to be interested in geography.<eos> That's Catholics.<eos> I can be interested in whatever I want.<eos> So what are you interested in?<eos> God.<eos> I didn't have you pegged as a cliché.<eos> Bartender at Sugar Foot said you might know where He is.<eos> - Which bartender's that?<eos> - Tall black guy. Said I should talk to you.
Go back to sleep.<eos> Those men back there... how'd you get them to stop?<eos> I told 'em to.<eos> You told them to? It's the collar.<eos> Gives me a-an authority.<eos> Who are they?<eos> What do they want?<eos> They are a super-secret crypto-religious fascist organization with designs on total world domination.<eos> Yeah, that's the same look I had when I heard it.<eos> Who told you that?
You want something to drink?<eos> Bryan, first of all,<eos> I-I don't want you to think I don't know what you've been going through since Cali was killed.<eos> Murdered, but okay.<eos> Murdered.<eos> Right.<eos> Even so, I gotta say, I'm a little... Confused.<eos> It's about that.<eos> Carlos mejia.<eos> Actually, it's more about you, and why you even have the live feed to his cell.
Murdered.<eos> Right.<eos> Even so, I gotta say, I'm a little... Confused.<eos> It's about that.<eos> Carlos mejia.<eos> Actually, it's more about you, and why you even have the live feed to his cell.<eos> His cell at a government black site, by the way.<eos> I was wrong to show it to you.<eos> Maybe so, but you did, and now I'm...<eos> - He murdered my sister. - Worried about you.
Anyone know where he is?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Police?<eos> FBI?<eos> Amir?<eos> Amir, right?<eos> - They took my dad.<eos> Have you seen them before?<eos> Do you know who they are?<eos> Like you!
Before I forget, you still need to fill this out.<eos> Your emergency contact.<eos> All call signs, this is zero.<eos> Blue suspected follow car has been GPS located to a parking lot in Arlington.<eos> Car was rented to someone under an alias attached to a fictional corporate account.<eos> Driver of the car must be considered armed and extremely dangerous.<eos> Approach with caution, and be prepared to use necessary force, but suspect must be taken alive.<eos> Zero, Roger, wait out.<eos> As-salamu 'alaykum. - Excuse me?<eos> - Means "peace be upon you."
My name's Bryan mills. Have you ever seen istishhad before, Bryan?<eos> A suicide bomb.<eos> So you know how this ends.<eos> This is no martyrdom operation, and you're no shahid.<eos> Please.<eos> Your best chance is to get everyone out of this building.<eos> And you as well.<eos> Go!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> You know what they say about men like you in my country?
Why, Bert?<eos> Explain to me why. I work for the secretary of defense, a vapid puppet of the spineless president, who refuses to confront the increasing threat.<eos> Of islam. Minneapolis is already another Kabul.<eos> Baltimore, Baghdad.<eos> Dearborn, Lebanon.<eos> Which American city is next? Ismat zahad is an American citizen.<eos> What are we doing here, Christina?<eos> Do you honestly believe that you could stop us?<eos> That you could get in our way?<eos> You see, people like you can't even begin to imagine what America really wants.
You probably thought about aborting me.<eos> It's OK.<eos> I mean, you didn't, so yay.<eos> We need to talk about Al Parker's case against you.
There are other things.<eos> Is this your office?<eos> That's what we call it.<eos> Come on, fix you a drink.<eos> What do you want, cocktail?<eos> Probably wondering what my deal is.<eos> I'm kind of between relationships at the moment.<eos> Doing it pretty tough, to be honest.<eos> Yep, I know what that's like.<eos> So what can I do for you?

The electrics had jammed the locks, and we rang for help but they said it'd be at least two hours, there was a lot of flooding.<eos> And when I heard that, two hours, I started to really panic.<eos> I felt something serious was going to happen.<eos> And there was a bottle of red I'd slipped under the seat after a party, and I really needed to calm myself, so I opened it.<eos> He wanted a swig, too.<eos> We drank it together straight from the bottle and, even before we'd finished, we were kissing each other, completely out of control.<eos> And the next day, after the pash in the car,<eos> I went into the office, and I expected him to be really cool and withdrawn and act as if nothing had happened.<eos> But he came straight up to me and he said,<eos> "I want to sleep with you tonight, if that's what you want, because that is definitely what I want."
Is he in the loo?<eos> Actually, darling, he's gone.<eos> Why, what happened?<eos> Is he all right?<eos> Um, shall we order first?<eos> No.<eos> Did you fight?<eos> He's already married.<eos> Alexander is already married.<eos> He told us a terrible story about a rescue, and ruin, and he's going to do that to you, baby, and he is dangerous.
Liam, this is my daughter, Mary...<eos> And my colleague, Miranda.<eos> Mary, this is your uncle.<eos> Well, Mary, it's so nice to meet you... after so fricking long.<eos> It's really lovely to meet you too.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> We're thinking of going for a wander down the beach.<eos> It's a bit late.<eos> I'd like to go.<eos> I'm not doing that with you.
That's it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Good luck, today.<eos> You are a good boy, do you want your surprise now?<eos> Yes!<eos> - OK.<eos> - Yes, honey?<eos> Can you get the nuts out?<eos> - There you go.<eos> - There you go, one for you - and one for you.
I might just pop out to the restroom for a minute.<eos> OK.<eos> I'm glad I caught you.<eos> I don't want to talk now.<eos> Ah, no, no, this has got nothing to do with what's going to happen in there, that's all official, they'll work it out.<eos> No, what I've got to say is, um... well, it's personal.<eos> It's good to see you, Robin.<eos> I'm sorry, Detective Sergeant...<eos> So, what are you up to now, who are you chasing these days?<eos> You know, the feelings I had for you were genuine.
- I'm know I'm not precisely the type you'd most likely choose, and I wasn't so experienced when we were first together, but you're so great at it.<eos> You're... you're huge, and it's so good.<eos> And, Eliot, I don't know how to politely ask you to fuck me.<eos> - Oh, look, Margo's here.<eos> - You remember Lasaro?<eos> - That creep who made the margolem?<eos> - I twisted his arms and/or balls a little, and he gave up the spell.<eos> Living Clay is hard to come by, but Fogg left his stash so unprotected, it's like he wanted me to steal it.<eos> So I did.<eos> We're gonna make another you.
Your benevolent overlord, high king Eliot."<eos> Hey.<eos> - Margo sent me here to get my hands checked out.<eos> Look... It sucks about Alice.<eos> - "Sucks"?<eos> That's the best that you can do?<eos> - I cared about her, too.<eos> - For what, like, ten minutes, including foreplay?<eos> - Are you mad at me because I cared too much or too little?<eos> - I'm mad 'cause you fucked up the one thing that we were counting on you for.
I mean hands.<eos> - I'm going to.<eos> Nope.<eos> - Damn it, Quentin!<eos> - Sorry, I just... I panicked. I don't love blood.<eos> - Who loves blood?<eos> I'm not gonna feel anything, so fucking go!<eos> - I don't think I can do this.<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> I knew I fucking couldn't count on you! You are so fucking pathetic, you... you... you floppy-haired, limp dicked dork.
- I'm going to.<eos> Nope.<eos> - Damn it, Quentin!<eos> - Sorry, I just... I panicked. I don't love blood.<eos> - Who loves blood?<eos> I'm not gonna feel anything, so fucking go!<eos> - I don't think I can do this.<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> I knew I fucking couldn't count on you! You are so fucking pathetic, you... you... you floppy-haired, limp dicked dork.<eos> Fucking... no wonder Alice couldn't get off on you.
Alice died killing your little friend Martin.<eos> Then Quentin was almost ripped in half.<eos> And you have the balls to come here.<eos> - Look, if you guys had trusted me, both Reynard and the beast would be dead.<eos> None of that would have happened.<eos> - Quentin should have left you in your little hedge hole, trading rim jobs for spells.<eos> - You actually think because you go to this bullshit school that you're better than me.<eos> - I think I didn't get my friends killed.<eos> - You don't have friends.<eos> You have people that are so afraid of you, they'd rather be on your side.
- Oh, my god.<eos> It's Alice.<eos> - Quentin, look, I... I know how you feel, man.<eos> Before, when your wards were slipping, I... I know.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - No, hey, no, no.<eos> Listen.<eos> You... you can't... You can't puss out right now.<eos> Think about Alice.<eos> She needs you, man.
It's Alice.<eos> - Quentin, look, I... I know how you feel, man.<eos> Before, when your wards were slipping, I... I know.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - No, hey, no, no.<eos> Listen.<eos> You... you can't... You can't puss out right now.<eos> Think about Alice.<eos> She needs you, man.<eos> I need you.
- _ - Olivia's made a serious complaint against you.<eos> She no longer feels comfortable working with you.
The truth is your marriage wasn't a fucking funfair 100% of the time, so you had to have yourself a little escape hatch pussy at the ready.<eos> How's it going, lads?<eos> Yeah, I was just saying, do you know who you look like?<eos> Your PE teacher?<eos> I was just partying if you want to come out.<eos> You ever been up on the roof of this place?<eos> It's pretty cool. You can see for like... 1000 miles.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> I love a good roof.<eos> As I look at you, all the reasons I fell in love with you have come flying back so much that I think I might throw up.
That's new.<eos> No, it's not new!<eos> Why wouldn't I want my husband to be happy?<eos> And look, I was thinking, I could look into going back to work again, you know, take a bit of the pressure off.<eos> - Right. - Oh.<eos> Merry Christmas to me.<eos> What's stopping you from coming back?<eos> Mostly just the false sexual harassment charges.<eos> They weren't charges, it was just a complaint, which Olivia withdrew.<eos> - She was just having some fun with you.
I'd understand if she'd bought a fucking speed boat without telling you... it's a wee morning after pill!<eos> What else was she supposed to do?<eos> You said yourself you blew an historic load into her - in a public park.<eos> - We have a wavelength.<eos> We communicate verbally and non-verbally.<eos> And something feels fucked up and not right.<eos> OK, let me ask you something... can Sharon hide what she's feeling about anything?<eos> - No. - OK, I wanted you to say it.<eos> So you are going to find out, one way or another, sooner or later.<eos> If she's done nothing wrong, bully for you.
Romance lives.<eos> Why don't you have a wonderful day.<eos> Master bedroom upstairs?<eos> Uh, yes, but keep in mind, we have to shut down soon.<eos> Um, watch your step.<eos> Is... is that all that's left?<eos> Yes, they're not even my size, but they're Chanel.<eos> I have to own them.<eos> You know, this is gonna sound so crazy, but I left some Chanel in here earlier.<eos> You see a grown woman standing in front of you, right?
Can't hear you!<eos> Bleeding ear!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> This place is awful.<eos> Right now, I'm staring at a People magazine from the '90s with Tonya Harding on the cover.<eos> Her face is all red and puffy from sick hands that have touched it.<eos> - Oh, no, doll. That's just how she looked.<eos> - Harriet Connick Jr.?<eos> Oh, they just called for me.<eos> I'm just gonna call in sick, and I'll come meet you.
- Ah! Doing the eBay thing, huh?<eos> Ha, ha. - Selling those Beanie Babies, huh?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> Ah, people love those Beanie Babies.<eos> You know, I read that one sold for half a mil.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> Man, if I got a half a million dollars in my pocket, I'd buy myself one of those big-ass jet planes.<eos> - I think they cost more than that. - Ah!<eos> Another dream dead.<eos> So, if I wanna buy something from you... - where do I go?
- Mm-hmm. I can call this Stevie Nicks stage-goddess boho duster.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Bet I can get 200 bucks for it.<eos> - What?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Put that awesome shit online and make yourself some ka-ching, ka-ching.<eos> Not until I've landed on a name.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Pick one out of a hat.<eos> This is the most important decision of my young life.<eos> When you sell stuff, you're asking people to buy into you.
- That's...<eos> - You. You are the problem.<eos> Another ignorant man walking around like he owns the place.<eos> Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> - Relax, he's cool.<eos> - I don't care what he is.<eos> - Let's walk this way.<eos> - Hold up, whitey.<eos> You listen to his control words.<eos> You think he's gonna stick by you when the bank repossesses your Miata, and they're taping up your bad checks on the wall at the 7-Eleven?
Okay, so, the way this works best is for you to be open to the fact that I have a gift.<eos> And do not look for proof or evidence that I don't. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Mm. What areas of your life are you looking to focus on today?<eos> Well, Sophia here wants to know if she should join the Navy.<eos> And I keep telling her, "Girl, you get seasick."<eos> Oh, dear, you're not funny.<eos> - I know why you're here.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> Mm-hmm. Yes.<eos> Oh. I'm getting a very strong feeling from you.
You're on the precipice.<eos> You're feeling something, and it's...<eos> It could be big, but you're not sure what it is.<eos> Yes, awesome!<eos> Okay, is there a specific name?<eos> Something that describes me or my soul?<eos> Hopefully, one or two words that could fit into a URL?<eos> No, he doesn't really work in specifics like that.<eos> It's just more of feeling...<eos> That's true and I'm also not feeling you right now.
You know, it's none of my business, but it sounds like you... are the reason your relationship imploded.<eos> That's fair.<eos> What about you?<eos> You ever cheat on anybody?<eos> No, that's shitty. That's what bad people do.<eos> Let's get on the trolley without paying.<eos> - Go?<eos> This is the Rice-A-Roni shot.<eos> Come on, city...<eos> I need you.

Is it?<eos> - No, seriously, is it?<eos> - Oh... I need you to tell me, because the teacher said it wasn't.<eos> - Please.<eos> Definitely art.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I wish I could say that was the first time that I accidentally stepped on a baby, but, oh, I buried the lead.<eos> They opened a Jamba across from my waxer.<eos> So, earlier today I was able to pop by for a quick sip and rip.<eos> Oh! Oh, I wanna be inside you.
- As we say. Nancy Miller's loss was my gain.<eos> - Oh, for sure.<eos> - Nancy's loss was my gain.<eos> Fo' sho.<eos> Fo' sho.<eos> You two are a trip.<eos> - Oh, we know.<eos> - We know.<eos> We know.<eos> What about you?
- Hey, wait.<eos> This is about me, Kevin.<eos> I'm gonna need a Diet Coke with a lot of lime.<eos> Sophia!<eos> - Sophia?<eos> - Sophia!<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Come in.<eos> Come in, come in, come in.<eos> - This is for you.
- Sophia!<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Come in.<eos> Come in, come in, come in.<eos> - This is for you.<eos> - For me?<eos> Yeah. Thanks for covering me at work.<eos> - It was super cool of you.<eos> - Oh, Sophia.<eos> It was a pleasure and an exhilaration to be you for a day and see art through a non-artist's eyes.
Wow. Yeah.<eos> Well, it's the least I could do after being such a Nancy Miller this morning.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You didn't "borrow" my rice cooker for two years.<eos> Did you get your dress back in time?<eos> Yeah, just barely.<eos> Was she happy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Well, either way, I'm proud of you.
Wish I could wear boots like these.<eos> You can.<eos> You don't have to do the Britney thing because everyone else is.<eos> I guess, but a person's look isn't all who they are.<eos> It's just what they want people to see of them.<eos> You know, like my look says this girl can move.<eos> And your look is that, and that's why you're alone.<eos> - I'm not alone.<eos> - Really?<eos> Everything I've learned about you today says otherwise.
This is ridiculous.<eos> Section's been empty all night.<eos> Hell, it's always empty.<eos> And I'm Coach.<eos> So, give me some of them drink tickets and take a lap already.<eos> Come on!<eos> That's why I call you Coach.<eos> Because the night I met you, you sort of started telling everyone what to do.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Well, I don't mean to be a threat to you, grand poo-bah.

Then we're gonna get there and share a hotel room for two nights.<eos> This thing is stocked with four peanut butter and honey sandwiches, ten granola bars, and one sleeve of original Pringles.<eos> Hey, George.<eos> So, what now?<eos> Just find another ride?<eos> Yup, plan stays the same.<eos> I gotta go pee.<eos> I see you looking at me.<eos> Probably 'cause I'm like a supernova of good vibes, right?<eos> - Hot enough for you? - Yeah.
Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> How's that?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Am I hurting you?<eos> - No.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Is this good for you?
The Gunne Sax is what we're evolving toward, and I'm gonna be there first.<eos> I bet you will.<eos> Steve Jobs didn't earn his turtleneck by just waiting for the next big thing to come to him.<eos> These girls are gonna claw each other's eyeballs out, just to get in on the ground floor of a new trend.<eos> Sophia.<eos> - I'm going on tour for several months.<eos> You're right.<eos> I get it.<eos> I'm obsessing.<eos> But, hey, I promise you, as soon as I get my insurance card and get my hernia fixed, I'm flying out to see you, and then watch out.
And not just any kite.<eos> It shot fireworks... and had a rainbow tail.<eos> Before long, you had... every one of those kids begging you to try out that damn kite.<eos> You were so fearless.<eos> I remember thinking... my Sophia... is going to be capable of anything.<eos> Somewhere along the line, you... gave up on yourself.<eos> Maybe I did, too.<eos> You're awake.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was so worried about you.
Sweet Annie.<eos> So glad you're here.<eos> I came as soon as I could.<eos> And your dad was here, too, but he had to go to work.<eos> And that guy just gets hotter as he ages.<eos> And let me tell you, I charmed the hell out of him.<eos> He was all like, "Take care of Sophia." And I was all like,<eos> "Oh, well, well, well."<eos> He was like, "Hey, please, try to sell her on college.<eos> She listens to you." And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
And I've always said, half your age plus seven is more of a guideline...<eos> I have to quit.<eos> - For real this time.<eos> - Just reaching here. Uh... Is this because you have a rule against dating coworkers?<eos> - No. No, no. That's not it.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Well...<eos> All right, well, this conversation's going swimmingly for old Rick.<eos> But hey.<eos> Got something for you.
Are you a murderer?<eos> I am not a murderer.<eos> I'm Gail.<eos> Gail.<eos> I own Remembrances.<eos> You bought a pair of pants from me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Remembrances.<eos> How weird.<eos> I've been talking about you.

No, I don't agree.<eos> You don't agree that we have to agree to disagree?<eos> I only agree to disagree.<eos> I am straight-up disagreeable.<eos> Good luck to you.<eos> Sharon was right about you.<eos> You are a snot-nosed bitch.<eos> Knew it was a typo.<eos> You're just not old enough to understand.<eos> I feel sorry for you.
I'd probably end up chained to a wall while some murder puppet hands me a dull knife. Ugh!<eos> Those movies are disgusting.<eos> Did you see Saw?<eos> Oh, I saw Saw.<eos> Did you see Saw?<eos> Oh, I totally saw Saw.<eos> - Shane, did you see Saw?<eos> - Don't want any part in this.<eos> Come on, you have to play along.<eos> I'm still mad at you.
Oh, my God.<eos> Annie, can I choose the bear trap on my head<eos> - over listening to this guy talk?<eos> - Yes, you may, Sophia.<eos> Just focus your search on 6th and Harrison.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Dax.<eos> Okay, no lie, you are the least helpful human being on the planet.<eos> Where did he say I should just look?<eos> This is perfect space for you.
- What else do you need?<eos> - A window would be nice.<eos> I know Apple was started in a garage, but I doubt I can grow the sploinked. comempire<eos> - out of this coffin.<eos> - Okay, okay. I have bigger space.<eos> Top floor.<eos> It's more money, but you like.<eos> I don't think so. I heard some dogs bark on the way in, and I need total silence to ideate.<eos> No, hey.<eos> No, hey. For you, I kill dogs!
They'll kill themselves.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Office space!<eos> When do I want it?<eos> Now!<eos> It's actually very funny in this country.<eos> You want office space?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it's gotta be better than this dump.<eos> I have nothing for you.
Now!<eos> It's actually very funny in this country.<eos> You want office space?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it's gotta be better than this dump.<eos> I have nothing for you.<eos> Really?<eos> What about the bigger space on the top floor?<eos> No.<eos> That one's not for you.
Low, steady, and high.<eos> That's your girl.<eos> All right, look. Present this to your dad, and make it look professional.<eos> Okay?<eos> And he will see that you have a legit business here.<eos> Got it.<eos> Make the naps look nice.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I just said "naps."<eos> I'm turning into a fucking nerd like you.
But there's one problem.<eos> My apartment is too crowded.<eos> With no room for new inventory, these awesome graphs I made will start going in the opposite direction.<eos> For your perusal.<eos> Now, I have a lead on a new office space and enough cash to put down months of rent up front.<eos> The jerk-off landlord won't rent it to me without a cosigner.<eos> That's why you were on time.<eos> I don't remember the last time I said this... but I really need your help.<eos> Motherfucking bar graphs!<eos> - I am so proud of you.

He's agreed to a six-month trial lease to...<eos> I'm no longer interested.<eos> Hey, Sophia.<eos> Sophia, get back here.<eos> What are you...?<eos> I am not selling stuffed animals out of my bedroom.<eos> This is a real business.<eos> Cosigning a lease is a risky thing.<eos> I could lose my savings, my house.<eos> I tried to speak your language, to relate to you, to prove to you that I am worth betting on.

Annie, I need your help.<eos> Right here, Sophia.<eos> I've got all this vintage stuff.<eos> Singapore called.<eos> They need a million more blazers.<eos> Typical Singapore.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I just filled the order.<eos> They should be getting them... now.<eos> Annie, what will I ever do without you?
I mean, they're, um, on your desk.<eos> They've been there the whole time.<eos> But, no, it's something else.<eos> - I've been promoted to manager at work.<eos> - Annie, that's great!<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Look at us, we own this town.<eos> Suck it, Nash Bridges.<eos> Yeah, but, um...<eos> I'm not gonna take it, because I'd rather work here with you.

I pay you money?<eos> You have a job.<eos> Yes, and I would like to have a new one, where we work here together.<eos> There's no job for you here.
Just making an unbiased observation here.<eos> AnnieGreenGables praised Nasty Gal earlier and now she's flip-flopping.<eos> Why should we believe anything she says?<eos> This is a safe place in which people are allowed to change their minds, especially when it's pointing out the shortcomings of Nasty Gal.<eos> I just think, again, as an unbiased observer, that you're all ganging up on Nasty Gal for no reason.<eos> Don't know why you're defending Nasty Gal.<eos> She can defend herself.<eos> She can do everything herself.<eos> I'm sure she can.<eos> She certainly wouldn't turn to you, Internet stranger.
I'm Nasty Gal.<eos> Everything you do could be done by an intern.<eos> I'm sorry, but you're...<eos> Watch it.<eos> Replaceable.<eos> What?<eos> Just say it.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck me?<eos> Fuck you.
I'm sorry, but you're...<eos> Watch it.<eos> Replaceable.<eos> What?<eos> Just say it.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck me?<eos> Fuck you.<eos> No.<eos> Fuck you.
Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> - I quit.<eos> - You can't quit a job that you don't have.<eos> No, I quit this.<eos> Us.<eos> You wanna leave?<eos> Great.<eos> I don't need someone hanging on to my coattails.<eos> I was fine before you, and I'll be fine after you.
So, speak freely.<eos> I avoid driving downtown because it scares me!<eos> About Nasty Gal.<eos> What are we going to do about her?<eos> She's threatening our livelihoods.<eos> She's completely lost her mind.<eos> We all eventually lose our minds.<eos> Did no one read the link I sent about chemtrails?<eos> Find another outlet, Sharon.<eos> We're all worried about you.
Fuck Christmas.<eos> Fuck Annie, fuck Dad, and fuck ye merry gentlemen!<eos> Sophia, it's Dad.<eos> Just checking to see if you're coming here for Christmas dinner.<eos> Not if Christ himself took me on mule-back.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know you said you need some time alone, but I hope you and Annie are talking again.<eos> - But if not...<eos> - Oh, we are not.<eos> I wanted to let you know that I'm here for you.
This entire theater lacks artistic merit.<eos> And you... you are a lousy lay.<eos> - Are you done?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I'm done.<eos> I'm out of here forever. Really?<eos> Where are you gonna go?<eos> - I'll go back to Des Moines.<eos> - Des Moines, that's rich.<eos> You think Bobby's gonna take you back after what you pulled?<eos> His fire insurance premiums have doubled thanks to you.

You're never getting back on eBay.<eos> It's not me, but once you lose eBay's trust, it holds a grudge.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll start my own site.<eos> Maybe it'll work, maybe it won't.<eos> But it'll be mine.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Wait.<eos> May I sing with you?
What about your stupid laugh?<eos> You have the stupidest laugh of all.<eos> You're like:<eos> Yeah, well yours is:<eos> I am sorry I was so selfish.<eos> Annie, I love you.<eos> In case I die.<eos> And if that happens right now, before you say it back to me, then I assure you, I will haunt you forever.<eos> Or until you and Dax get married and it gets uncomfortable.<eos> I need you.

I'm on the phone.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> And, um, how much would that cost?<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Under the stairs.<eos> Hidden away like the family embarrassment.<eos> I like your artwork.<eos> It's useless and impractical.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, Annie says that everything you see before you was inspired by that piece.
And you're gonna have to tell your kids that.<eos> Or maybe you won't.<eos> Kids are perceptive.<eos> They know when Mommy's a slut.<eos> Oh, boy. You're bringing the kids in.<eos> You're right.<eos> That was too far. This is on Shane.<eos> But still, woman to woman... so not cool.<eos> Sophia, please.<eos> Two years of my life wasted on you.
Whatever happens, happens.<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> So?<eos> What do you think?<eos> You really went for it.<eos> Yes, well, I thought it would take me years to discover my new passion, but it just took one afternoon and a trip to Party City.<eos> Is your new passion streamers?<eos> No.<eos> It's helping you.
- Do you want a drink or something?<eos> So, how did the launch go?<eos> I don't wanna talk about that.<eos> So, um...<eos> I needed to see you... because, uh...<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I thought that I was over you.<eos> But I'm not.<eos> And...<eos> I cared about you so much.
Yes, but it matters to me, okay?<eos> I can't move on until you tell me every detail.<eos> Did she kiss you first?<eos> Did you kiss her first?<eos> - Was it happening the whole time?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> When did it start?<eos> - I told you.<eos> - Tell me again.<eos> Can I be honest with you?
Testing, one, two.<eos> Testing my patience.<eos> Check, one, two.<eos> Check, one, two.<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> This is my girlfriend Sophia.<eos> Sophia, that is Billy, Mickey, and Dr. Josh.<eos> What's up?<eos> Sophia, huh?<eos> Shane won't shut up about you.
It's not mysterious shit.<eos> It's drugs.<eos> - Annie.<eos> - Fine.<eos> No drugs for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why the face?<eos> You need a conference?<eos> I thought my first trip with Dax was gonna be amazing, but we're totally not vibing.<eos> Hmm. You want me to break up with him for you?
So, Shane...<eos> Yeah, everybody, give Shane a hand.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, all tour long, this guy here has been giving me the D.<eos> Gratitude, bro.<eos> Hi.<eos> ♪ All I wanna do When I wake up in the morning ♪<eos> ♪ Is see your eyes ♪<eos> ♪ Sophia, Sophia ♪<eos> ♪ I never thought that a girl like you Could ever care for me ♪
I saw some pretty colors and took a nap on the softball field.<eos> Getting acid from a stranger on a toilet?<eos> Damn it, Annie.<eos> That's just dumb. Uh-uh.<eos> It's not dumb, it's fun.<eos> Unlike forcing me to use my trip to Tinseltown to look at a house.<eos> You're being so close-minded.<eos> And you're making your gums recede, and there's no cure for that.<eos> The only way I'm gonna get through your stupid shack in the woods is if I'm high as a goddamn kite.<eos> This is moronic, and it's not like you, and I forbid you to take that acid.
- It's selfish.<eos> - Since when do I do whatever I want?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Always.<eos> No one always does anything.<eos> Okay, today at the pool, that shit you pull in front of Josh?<eos> Oh, you mean Dr. Josh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Dude, that guy is a tool.<eos> I would never let anyone speak to me the way he speaks to you.
Mm... You're so perfect.<eos> Sophia, she's a monster.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I am so sick of people telling me I'm not a grown-up.<eos> I run a fucking business.<eos> What is it that you do?<eos> This is insane.<eos> You get that I dropped everything, just to come see you this weekend.<eos> Right?<eos> Just for you?
Previously on "Suits"...<eos> It's a no.<eos> I thought you liked the idea.<eos> That was before I realized that it was nothing but sassy remarks.<eos> I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship with its biological father.<eos> If you're gonna get this worked up, it makes me think I don't really know you.<eos> What if I could make it more like you?

I know.<eos> And if you asked me to make an argument about it in court, I'd probably shit the bed.<eos> But, Mike, I'm telling you, there's something here.<eos> And I'm telling you, maybe one day you'll overcome your court stuff, maybe you won't.<eos> Either way, this proves that you're a hell of a lawyer.<eos> Yeah, thanks, Mike. I gotta admit, it feels pretty good to know I can do what I just did.<eos> Then why don't you start drafting a suit. 'Cause after I get these people on board, that's exactly what we're gonna have to do.<eos> Donna, you're never gonna believe what Louis just asked me.<eos> Give me three guesses.<eos> He wants to be you. He wants to look like you. He wants to wear your skin as a body suit.
They need someone to give a shit about them.<eos> It isn't something we do because we don't have the time or the man power to take on a giant like Velocity.<eos> Nathan, I don't know what you want me to say.<eos> I went out there, I signed these guys and they trusted me.<eos> I can't back out now.<eos> This the kinda shit you pulled when you were at Pearson Specter?<eos> On occasion.<eos> Then I want you to say the next time you think to pull something like this, you have the common courtesy to tell me before you do it.<eos> I suggest a warm bubble bath and a pint of Chunky Monkey.<eos> Because if you're not good to yourself, how can you expect anyone else to be good to you?

The key to having empathy is making people feel supported in their feelings, not just trying to solve their problems.<eos> That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. No, it isn't.<eos> And not only that, you have to tailor its response to the feelings the person is having.<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> You have to have it listen.<eos> Okay, I get it. You're saying it has to understand the feelings of its user, and express that understanding in a sympathetic manner.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Now, you think you can do that?<eos> Of course I can.<eos> All I need to do is continually expose it to what it's not providing and eventually the feedback loop will show it how to be more like you.
Mike's gonna end up back here when it's done.<eos> - You remember that thing that we took care of for Rachel that you said might be worth doing?<eos> Well, it turns out it was worth doing.<eos> Only I'm doing it for Mike.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Seidel agreed to go to bat for him?<eos> Yes, and once it's done and Mike's in the Bar, he can come back here and work again.<eos> Harvey, that is great and nobody wants that more than I do, but it's just one meeting.<eos> Louis, I know that, but in about three hours, I'm gonna be under water for the next three days.<eos> Louis, I know I told you I'd be there for you, but I need you to be there for me.
Oliver, how's it going?<eos> It's going okay.<eos> I'm finished drafting six complaints.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's nothing, it's just, in the time I did six, most of them did nine or ten.<eos> I guess that means you're in the home stretch, huh?<eos> Guess I am.<eos> Look, Oliver, I know what you're thinking.<eos> But I was telling Nathan the truth.<eos> I'm not looking to come back here with these guys instead of working with you.
What?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanna know what the hell you're doing.<eos> What you mean, what am I doing?<eos> I mean, you filed 150 suits, not just one.<eos> And James Palmer's gonna fight each one of them. Which means this thing is gonna drag on forever.<eos> And we're gonna drop the hammer on him as soon as he gets to Harvey's.<eos> Now I don't wanna see you again until I meet you for the first time at that hearing.<eos> Don't you walk away from me.<eos> I hired Harvey to do a job, he farmed it out to you against my will and you're gonna God damn listen to me.
- It's okay. I just need to go home.<eos> Shit.<eos> It's okay, Donna.<eos> It's not your fault, either.<eos> Yes, it is. I'm Donna, I should have known.<eos> Maybe, but you always say part of being human is messing up sometimes and you may be Donna, but you're still human.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Oliver.<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> I want to know if I was wrong about you.
And you didn't have to keep this quiet because you're married.<eos> You kept it quiet because you're in on it.<eos> I was in on it.<eos> I saw a chance to jump ship and get paid in the process.<eos> But instead, they pulled the job and put just enough money in that account to implicate me.<eos> - You piece of shit.<eos> - Please, my employees are gonna lose their jobs because of me.<eos> We need to keep this suit going and get that technology back.<eos> Nuh-uh, buddy.<eos> You don't give a shit about your employees and I don't give a shit about you.
This deal is done.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> Yes, I can and I didn't have leverage before, but I have it now.<eos> So you're not just getting Mike an interview, you're gonna block anyone who tries to vote no.<eos> And if you don't, your boss is gonna get an anonymous tip that you sold trade secrets.<eos> And I'm gonna make sure to send this along with it.<eos> You're my attorney.<eos> You work for me.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I don't work for you.
Um, wes and hobbs. Nailed another defendant in court the other day.<eos> You guys would've been really proud of them.<eos> What, do I look weird?<eos> My... My hair, it feels funny today.<eos> No, I'm just thinking you're almost 21. And how grown up you are.<eos> Well, I-i know you don't want the job,<eos> But, um, good luck with your interview today, mom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You going down?<eos> I'll go with you.
I've been calling you.<eos> All right, look, never mind. Just... just come with me. God.<eos> Don't let anybody see that bag! Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I left my phone at work.<eos> But you got plenty of time to get to the airport, lieutenant.<eos> What's the issue?<eos> We caught a murder.<eos> So cancel the trip, cancel everything. Okay.<eos> That's no problem. Everything's insured.<eos> But, um, can I just say that this whole secret trip to napa. That you wanted me to book for you and mom, I-i...
You're obviously not criminals, just some guys. Who got caught up with a dangerous drug lord.<eos> Are we wrong?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It was like you said.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> It's always nice when dirtbags take the bait.<eos> Julio, she's here, and your attorney.<eos> Good luck.<eos> We ran into some turbulence, Some pretty bad turbulence 'cause we were flying so low.<eos> And good luck to you, too, I guess.
Yeah, and felix, h-he couldn't hold on.<eos> You know... He had a bit of a weight problem.<eos> We're lucky he didn't take the whole helicopter with him.<eos> And us in it!<eos> Us!<eos> You are very lucky, both of you.<eos> Now if you could just write all this down?<eos> By signing here, you grant temporary guardianship. Of mark jarvis to julio sanchez. Until an official transfer can be performed.<eos> I'm so sorry, mark.<eos> We tried to take care of you.
This is all andy flynn.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Well, since we couldn't go out to dinner... The other night, I thought that I would bring dinner to you.<eos> It's from serve.<eos> Serve.<eos> Andy, where we had our first date.<eos> That is so thoughtful.<eos> I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. Really?<eos> About...<eos> About you.
He went to hang out with that new friend of his, Slim.<eos> Slim?<eos> Who's Slim?<eos> Ransom his ass.<eos> You get Ghost's money, kill his kid, you ride off into the sunset.<eos> You were covering your tracks.<eos> I gotta take you in.<eos> Looks like Greg Knox was your leak.<eos> This case is closed.<eos> Angie, I told you that I needed to protect you from Greg.
Hey, wait, what do you mean, "find Tariq"?<eos> He's missing, Dre.<eos> They asked Tasha for money.<eos> Who is Slim?<eos> I told you to have a closer eye on the kid.<eos> You told me it was family business.<eos> You told me to fall back.<eos> Do you know where he is or not?<eos> I could find out. Good.<eos> I'm coming with you.
What the fuck?<eos> You said you were in outpatient.<eos> You said you were gonna kick.<eos> I know.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> Don't you think I feel bad enough?<eos> You come in here,<eos> All right, that's enough.<eos> I'm taking Elisa Marie to my place.<eos> She's not safe with you.
It's cool.<eos> Yo, you got Tariq?<eos> What the fuck you doin' here?<eos> Yo, who are they?<eos> You walkin' up in our spot.<eos> I think the question is, who the fuck are you?<eos> This is Dre.<eos> He works for Ghost.<eos> He used to work for me.<eos> I still work for you.
I was worried he might transfer bedbugs from your place.<eos> Put in the combination.<eos> Is it loaded?<eos> No, I wouldn't keep a loaded weapon around children.<eos> It's... it's not the murder weapon.<eos> - Wrong caliber. - Okay.<eos> Bag and tag anyway.<eos> Take it all.<eos> I don't know how you think you have the right to come up in my mother...<eos> Jamie's actions give me the right, and anything you say can be used against you.
But they knew about it, huh?<eos> That fast?<eos> Tommy, I told them.<eos> Okay, we can't be partners if you're gonna be a fuckin' snitch.<eos> Look, keeping secrets from our employers is how you get killed.<eos> Keep the product moving.<eos> That's the most important thing for both of us to keep our jobs and our lives, do you understand?<eos> Mom?<eos> You said you loved my dad.<eos> You said you wanted us to live with you.
Yeah, they're often in the same place.<eos> Look, I want a conviction as much as you do.<eos> After today, we'll be working out of my offices.<eos> Sandoval, you'll sit as my second chair.<eos> Hey, we have a detention hearing tomorrow, right?<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> Angela, your office?<eos> I've been going over the case files.<eos> Very detailed, professional.<eos> Smart work. You know, despite your conflict of interest, they would have never gotten this far without you.
I don't need your girl knowing' mine.<eos> Oh, I ain't staying' long.<eos> And that's not my girl, bro.<eos> I mean, she looks like a pro.<eos> Yeah, well, not anymore.<eos> No, she works here now.<eos> Oh, so you're doin' the hiring on the legit side, huh?<eos> Okay... does she even know how to mix a drink?<eos> You can teach her, right?<eos> Someone taught you.
- Yeah.<eos> - I gotta hire her?<eos> Yeah, he's distro now.<eos> Do what he says. Yo, why him over me?<eos> I held you down with taking care of Ruiz and knocking off Milan.<eos> Dre, J's been in the game with us for years.<eos> You show up a couple of months ago, you think you ready to be a distro?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I am ready.<eos> Look, Tommy, I've been real with you since day one, man.
Yeah, for him.<eos> No, for me.<eos> My whole plan to get Abuelita off my back was to ask a popular guy who would never do it.<eos> He rejects me, I full-on fake cry, Abuelita feels guilty, and boom... I escape the patriarchal tradition of having to be escorted to my quinces, and instead grow out my unibrow and read a poem about Frida Kahlo.<eos> Do I have to come to your quinces?<eos> - Who's the guy?<eos> - Josh Flores.<eos> Josh Flores?<eos> He's like the star of the baseball team.<eos> He should be dating a hot girl who got held back a grade, not you.
You're just... You're all so strong and you're so beautiful.<eos> Thank you for having me.<eos> Thank you, Penelope.<eos> Release those tears, mama!<eos> Seriously, never stop.<eos> Ay, Leslie, this is not necessary.<eos> I fell.<eos> I have a bruise that I will cure with the power of my mind.<eos> In the car you told me you were dizzy.<eos> I just wanna make sure you're okay because I care about you.
Now that I have the foot of a monster, I want to hide in the shadows until it is fixed.<eos> So, things are going good on my date.<eos> I think we're gonna grab a coffee.<eos> Everything okay over there?<eos> Yeah, Alex is doing homework, and I'm just sitting here by myself, you know, watching Buffy.<eos> Okay, bye, Mom.<eos> So... this isn't like some bad teen movie where the popular guy pranks the nerd girl, and you make me feel special and next thing I know, I'm covered in pig's blood?<eos> Uh... no.<eos> It's not a prank.<eos> For real, Elena, I've had a crush on you all year.
It's weird, isn't it?<eos> It's pretty typical.<eos> I'm gonna take a nap.<eos> Oh, uh, bedroom's down the hall there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sleep tight.<eos> _<eos> Keep at it.<eos> This might be one of those all day things.<eos> So. What are we gonna do with you?
What is your name by the way?<eos> Eugene Root.<eos> Welcome to hell, Eugene.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Here.<eos> No more crying?<eos> Okay?<eos> 'Cause crying isn't gonna fix this.<eos> I brought you in.<eos> I trusted you, made you a part of my family.
The only thing we're good at.<eos> You know, this... This feels like one of those boyfriend/girlfriend convers...<eos> - Then go, Reggie.<eos> - Stay.<eos> We were having fun, Jesse.<eos> Remember?<eos> - Till Carlos, we had fun.<eos> - You're right.<eos> Before that little thing, we were having a hell of a time.<eos> That hurt me as much as you.
It's alright.<eos> We're just talking.<eos> When were you gonna stop lying to me?<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> You see, I thought we were in this together.<eos> I wanted to be.<eos> I tried to be.<eos> But this life you want...<eos> Doesn't it feel wrong to you? No.<eos> And I don't know why it feels wrong to you.
Maybe you're right.<eos> Or maybe you don't deserve it.<eos> Bro.<eos> But a Custer does, right?<eos> Is that what you're trying to do here?<eos> Be a Custer again?<eos> Like having a crap job and a crap life gives you the forgiveness you need for what you done?<eos> Make you one of the good guys, huh?<eos> Like your stuck-up daddy and your stupid John Wayne?<eos> Well, I got some bad news for you Jesse Custer:
Christ Almighty.<eos> Sheets are silky bastards, huh?<eos> I think a couple of hundred foreskins gone into making those, easily.<eos> Did you know I was rich once?<eos> Yeah, bloody years ago.<eos> I really quite enjoyed it, actually.<eos> You know what happened here, right?<eos> You two had a falling out, and she was down.<eos> She fell in with the first two-pool owning bloke she met and that was it.<eos> But she doesn't love him and she never did because she loves you, you stupid idjit.
She fell in with the first two-pool owning bloke she met and that was it.<eos> But she doesn't love him and she never did because she loves you, you stupid idjit.<eos> If there's one thing I know, trust me, it's that.<eos> Can I ask you a question, Cassidy?<eos> Of course you can.<eos> That's what why I come.<eos> To dispense my considerable wisdoms.<eos> After lying to me? All this time?<eos> Probably since Texas, probably since she came back downstairs at the casino.<eos> After all that lying, why in the world would I ever trust you?
I don't. I don't.<eos> Lie to my face?<eos> Sneak behind my back?<eos> Now you're here to be a hero?<eos> To be a friend and talk me out of doing this?<eos> Look, not to make excuses here, man, but you know what?<eos> This whole thing, it's put me between a rock and hard place, alright?<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> Well, then maybe you should remind me. Huh?<eos> I asked you, why should I trust you?

Maybe that's the difference, though, between me and you.<eos> 'Cause you see, me, if I was in your situation?<eos> If some moppet had their hands on my girl?<eos> And I'm not ashamed to admit it.<eos> I don't think I'd be very restrained at all.<eos> No.<eos> I think I'd want to hurt them really, really bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've not come here to talk you out of anything, alright?<eos> I'm only here to let you kno that whatever you decide, I'm with you, Padre.
I didn't kill him.<eos> - No. That's what I've been saying!<eos> I mean, I wanted to.<eos> I settled for divorce papers instead.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I'll go and let her know her dad's still alive.<eos> She'll be thrilled.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me too.<eos> I'm so bad for you.
- Haunted houses?<eos> - I would say no, he knows better.<eos> But lately...<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> My-my buddy, the detective, he was telling me that they've been getting a lot of reports lately from Old County Line road.<eos> Reports of broken glass, loud noises at night.<eos> Now, the police did a drive-by, but they didn't see nothing.<eos> And it's... it's got me wondering.<eos> It's best to be sure. I'm gonna go have a look, okay?<eos> - I'll come with you.

The best thing for you to do is just keep working here, all right?<eos> I got this.<eos> Vincent.<eos> Take this with you.
I kept wondering if that hex had eaten you alive.<eos> It would have.<eos> But I was...<eos> Linked... to Klaus.<eos> I know.<eos> I've known about that for a while.<eos> You had endless opportunities to kill him.<eos> Did you hold off on my account?<eos> Then, please, Marcel.<eos> If some part of you still cares about me, help me.
I will admit the truth.<eos> I do not wish to be the father I had, nor do I wish to be the father Marcel has come to loathe.<eos> Perhaps I am better as a myth.<eos> And Hope is better off without me.<eos> Is that enough?<eos> Or do you want more?<eos> Are you satisfied?<eos> Every parent is afraid of screwing up.<eos> Well, at least the good ones are.<eos> But Hope needs you.
But Hope needs you.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> Hayley will protect her.<eos> And she'll do one hell of a job.<eos> But don't you think Hope deserves her father?<eos> Hey.<eos> Look at me. Yes, history could repeat itself.<eos> If you're not careful, it will.<eos> But you owe it to your daughter to try and change the narrative.<eos> For her and for you.
Welcome back, sister.<eos> Kol!<eos> I think you got him.<eos> Can we leave this awful city now?<eos> Where's Elijah?<eos> You find some way to survive my bite and you have the audacity to come back?<eos> What happened?<eos> Immortality just got boring?<eos> I've come for my brother.<eos> Well, I got something else for you.
Oh, he's not going anywhere, Elijah.<eos> And neither are you.<eos> Apne en vrata. Klaus!<eos> Wake up!<eos> I can't.<eos> Hey.<eos> You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> Oh, I can't hold it much longer.<eos> Apne en vrata. Your family needs you.
And neither are you.<eos> Apne en vrata. Klaus!<eos> Wake up!<eos> I can't.<eos> Hey.<eos> You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> Oh, I can't hold it much longer.<eos> Apne en vrata. Your family needs you.<eos> Hope needs you.
It's been too long.<eos> We should go.<eos> We're not leaving our family.<eos> Marcel could be shredding our family to pieces as we speak.<eos> Well, perhaps they simply don't have cell phone service in a drainage pipe.<eos> They'll be here, Kol.<eos> And while we have a moment, I wanted to say thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For coming to get me.<eos> So I could be sitting here, annoyed at you.
I felt a presence, and I had to cleanse myself.<eos> Did you see him?<eos> Did you find Adam?<eos> I didn't, no. But at least now I know what we're up against.<eos> And it's something that I've seen before.<eos> What is it?<eos> A witch, a spirit?<eos> Vincent, this is my son.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna find Adam, I'm gonna bring him back to you.
What is it?<eos> A witch, a spirit?<eos> Vincent, this is my son.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna find Adam, I'm gonna bring him back to you.<eos> But whoever has him right now is using some very dark magic.<eos> Some very powerful magic, and you have to stay away from it.<eos> Promise me that.<eos> No, listen to me, okay, please.<eos> I know that this is tough for you, but you're gonna have to trust me.
Hello. I'm friends with your grandson...<eos> Principal Novak, and I have something in Serbian I need translated. - He said you might be able to help me.<eos> - I knows nothing about you.
I was looking at a new carving knife for Thanksgiving.<eos> 240 bucks. Big investment. Still thinking about it.<eos> Here he is.<eos> No last name, no phone number, just an expired e-mail address.<eos> But I am gonna find you, Anton.<eos> And then I'm gonna read your book, you blurry son of a bitch!<eos> We have that open house today.<eos> Maybe you should take the day off, let me cover it.<eos> What? Huh?<eos> Well, it's just that everything's been so intense lately and I'm worried about you.
See you, guys.<eos> So you two were alone in your room with the door closed.<eos> - Nothing happened.<eos> - Of course nothing happened.<eos> You're you.<eos> Will you leave him alone, Dan?<eos> He's just waiting for his moment.<eos> Honey, there's a casserole in the fridge.<eos> I'm going to spin class again tonight.<eos> Good for you, Mom.
I'm gonna go next door, talk to Joel about something.<eos> - Oh, God, not the ants again.<eos> - No. Not the ants.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> I'm on baby duty.<eos> But you can blow it in my face.<eos> Fuck it, just give it to me.<eos> So I got a cop question for you.
Ah, Joel...<eos> I know the finger belongs to Gary West.<eos> I ran the print.<eos> I know that you and Sheila worked with Gary.<eos> And I know that Lisa saw Gary dancing with your wife at the club, grinding her pelvis into a fine mist.<eos> And then Gary disappeared.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This is such a drag.<eos> There is one thing I don't know.<eos> How could a pussy like you kill someone?
I'm sorry...<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - No, it's just...<eos> I'm going through a lot right now and I can't really get involved with anyone...<eos> Abby, I get it.<eos> You're not interested in me.<eos> - That's not what...<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> I was just trying to prove my point.<eos> Because you're not into me. But you just lied to protect me so I wouldn't get hurt, like your parents are doing to you.
At practice?<eos> Okay, so somebody else can verify that?<eos> Well, it was only me and my dad.<eos> He... he didn't see it, though, when I fell.<eos> Okay, well here's the thing, Kyle:<eos> we don't think you're telling us the truth.<eos> And the doctor's pretty sure that's not the way it happened.<eos> And your medical records show that... that this isn't the first time that you've been injured this way.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Kyle, has anybody been getting physical with you?
You know where Bobby is now?<eos> He's in Sing Sing for stabbing some poor sap to death during a bar fight.<eos> And I always think, what if I would have said something?<eos> What if I just would have said something?<eos> Maybe... that guy would still be alive.<eos> I missed my shot, Kyle.<eos> Not a day goes by that I don't regret it.<eos> But this is your shot.<eos> Right now.<eos> And if not for you, Kyle, do it for your little brother.
Yeah, I know I said that.<eos> And guess what?<eos> Not everything always goes according to plan.<eos> Do you think I wanted any of this?<eos> We just gotta roll with it, that's all.<eos> - They're gonna send me away.<eos> - Hey, cut it out now.<eos> Don't talk like that, all right?<eos> Listen, you're gonna be fine.<eos> Stud athletes like you don't go to jail.
Then the Turner boys are the face of the league.<eos> We can have our own dynasty! That's not gonna happen.<eos> - Mr. Turner.<eos> - We've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> - There's nowhere to go.<eos> - It's best if you come with us quietly.<eos> Did you set me up?<eos> Are you wearing a wire? - Hey!<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> - Everything I did, I did it for you. You know that, right?
Exactly. Something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> Just the opposite. Everything is just right.<eos> I'm healthy. Uh... Reasonably sane.<eos> And I'm having dinner with an amazing, beautiful woman.<eos> But? I think I might put the shield down.<eos> You're gonna retire?<eos> - To do what? - To do nothing.<eos> To smell the damn flowers.<eos> Hopefully, with somebody like you.
I've been doing this a long time and at a certain point, you know, enough is enough.<eos> This job will swallow you whole, if you let it.<eos> So don't let it.<eos> You're saying you're not ready, is that it?<eos> I'm saying that... I just had a great dinner with a great man.<eos> Now you're deflecting.<eos> Maybe.<eos> We both know that this hasn't been quite as easy as we both thought it would be.<eos> But be honest, Liv.<eos> What does the future hold for you?
And it made me nervous, so I called Sergeant Cole.<eos> Sergeant Cole?<eos> He's the officer that saved me that night.<eos> Okay.<eos> And are you two still in touch?<eos> Yeah, we sort of became friends.<eos> I knew his daughter, we went to college together.<eos> He's retired now, anyway. I asked him to make sure that Ray wasn't still obsessed with me.<eos> I should've called NYPD...<eos> The only thing that you need to worry about is you.
I'm gonna see if I can make eyes on him.<eos> Be careful.<eos> For a second... for a stupid second, I thought she cared about me. And she was grateful I came into her life, and she understood the sacrifices a guy like me makes to keep her safe.<eos> You did.<eos> And you did keep her safe.<eos> And you need to keep her safe now.<eos> And have her spitin my face again?<eos> Not return my calls?<eos> Cancel dinner?<eos> All my life, beautiful whores like you taking advantage... look the other way.
Listen to me, listen to me, you take a breath... listen to me right now.<eos> Okay?<eos> Don't hang up on me.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> - I did the best I could.<eos> Tom.<eos> Drop your weapon now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> I'm a cop, just like you.
Quinn, you're safe now.<eos> You're safe.<eos> You're safe.<eos> I got you.<eos> I got you.<eos> I got you.<eos> How you holding up, Liv?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> The LBA is sending a representative to the station.<eos> He'll be with you when you make your statement.
_<eos> In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous.<eos> In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit.<eos> These are their stories.<eos> ♪ Happy birthday ♪ ♪ Dear Lawrence ♪<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
What happened?<eos> What did you and Sarah do when you hung out, Eric?<eos> I mean, we... We went up to my room, and... and...<eos> We did... we did have sex but it was totally consensual.<eos> I think this is a case where a girl's confused.<eos> Or perhaps she sees a rich target here.<eos> Anything's possible. We're not jumping to conclusions.<eos> Uh, not yet.<eos> But something, uh, something did come up.<eos> We'd actually like to talk to you down at the station.
We'd actually like to talk to you down at the station.<eos> No, Eric, you do not have to go.<eos> No, it's... it's all right.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong, I swear.<eos> Sarah was on Quaaludes?<eos> Isn't that some drug from before I was born?<eos> No, they're still around, and we found them in her system.<eos> Do you have any idea how they got there?<eos> No.<eos> Was she high when she was with you?
Look, I don't know if you're embarrassed or you're guilty or you're trying to protect your family name, but I'm pretty sure that Eric is trying to protect his grandfather.<eos> It's time that you told your son what kind of man your father really is.<eos> And maybe that will convince him to tell the truth.<eos> He just made a mistake, okay?<eos> I... I didn't see him after Sarah and I had sex, just...<eos> Eric, you lied to the police.<eos> I can charge you with obstruction.<eos> Eric, if you know anything...<eos> Oh, you want to put your own father in jail?<eos> You know, I wouldn't do that to you.

Or are you still mad that he gave the company to Aunt Cynthia and not you?<eos> I don't give a damn about the company...<eos> - Come on, Dad. - Because he's there. 'Cause I have to see him every day.<eos> What... what did he ever do to you?<eos> He... he didn't do it to me. He did it to your mother.<eos> To Mom?<eos> You never even see her, and he... he did something to Mom? Eric, when your grandfather sees somebody younger than he is, getting somebody prettier than he gets, he... he can't stand it.<eos> What... what is...<eos> What... what is she talking about?<eos> Your mother was just pregnant with you.
- Yeah.<eos> It's the fiancé, and check out the time.<eos> 4:25 a.m. That's right around the time<eos> Beth was assaulted a block from here. Son of a bitch lied to us.<eos> Mickey Reid!<eos> - Hey, what's going on?<eos> - Where's Mickey?<eos> - Uh, I don't know.<eos> - You don't know?<eos> Or is that what Mickey told you to say?
How about you give us a sample of your DNA?<eos> No need.<eos> Mr. Colton's ready to talk.<eos> Zoe and I had sex, it was consensual, and we both had a great time.<eos> Sure. We'll just take your word for it.<eos> Well, you don't have to.<eos> This is an email sent from Ms. White to Mr. Colton the day after the party.<eos> Our IT department confirmed it was sent from her office computer.<eos> "Glad we closed the deal.<eos> "Thinking about you.
Not yet, anyway.<eos> You know anything about the stock market?<eos> _ Can I help you?<eos> Hey.<eos> Harry. It's, uh, Stuart Gleacher.<eos> I called you and left a message.<eos> Anyway, I-I used to work with Eli Colton.<eos> In fact, I-I think I met you a few times at, uh, at his place in... in Tribeca, one of those rooftop parties he had last fall?<eos> Think we rode that private elevator up together?<eos> What can I do for you, Stuart?
You know what I'm gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna track him down.<eos> I'm gonna get him to call you.<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pop up out of the blue like that.<eos> You know, that... that's my bad.<eos> Uh, it's... it's cool, bro. Come on in.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, uh, you and Eli are... are buddies?<eos> Yeah, we used to work together, among other things.<eos> What, uh, what can I do for you?
I was in China a few months ago.<eos> There's fast food chains everywhere, so invest in Chinese weight loss gyms, diet pills, all of that.<eos> Make a killing.<eos> How much is that?<eos> Three grand?<eos> - Four.<eos> - What?<eos> Supply and demand, bro.<eos> You know what, Harry?<eos> It's been a real, real pleasure doing business with you.
A party which you spent exactly five minutes at.<eos> Now, you mind telling me what happened that night?<eos> I went up to hang out at Eli's, I took the service elevator up, and... when I opened the master bedroom door...<eos> I'm guessing you want to know what I saw?<eos> You're a genius.<eos> Well... I'm happy to share, but I'm... I'm gonna need certain assurances.<eos> Well, we're not in the business of making assurances, but... you know what, if you tell us the truth, we can put in a good word for you at the DA's office.<eos> Tell us what happened, Harry.<eos> Come on.<eos> Because if you don't, this is gonna end badly for you.
Wait, hold on, somebody new is joining the group.<eos> - Chris.<eos> - Hi, Sam.<eos> Oh, it's him, it's him.<eos> Somebody just said his name, come on.<eos> Nick was just telling us about a recent transgression and Will was expressing his disappointment.<eos> They had been supporting one another.<eos> Sorry to hear about that. But it happens.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What about you, Sam? How's it going?
Maybe you do, but Dalton ain't gettin' any better.<eos> He's raped three women, Will.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Do you know it's a crime to lie to a police officer? - You know that?<eos> - I didn't ask to be a part of this.<eos> Okay, it's not my fault that my father raped somebody and I inherited his genes.<eos> I'm just trying to do the right thing and make sure his evil never manifests.<eos> That's why I go to these meetings.<eos> That's why I can control my urges.<eos> I feel for you, Will.
It's not a matter about time, it's about... it's about when.<eos> Will, Will, listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There's no such thing as a rape gene.<eos> There just isn't. You got to trust me on that.<eos> I know, because I've done the research on this. I've talked to doctors.<eos> I've talked to psychiatrists.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why?<eos> - Because I'm like you.
- Right.<eos> If everyone knows everything, and nothing can be hidden, the truth shall set us free, and so you're free till tomorrow.<eos> Bugs to fix.<eos> Something's come up.<eos> Oh, no, David, no,<eos> - David, no.<eos> - Well, I can't wait.<eos> - Let's go somewhere private.<eos> - Oh, now you're worried about privacy?<eos> I need to be with you tonight.
He could bring the rope into court in a golden chariot.<eos> His credibility is shot. The evidence is tainted.<eos> Chain of custody's broken. So Willard blackmails his way out of trouble and that's that?<eos> Do you have anything else on him?<eos> Nothing, less than nothing because someone else confessed.<eos> Well, you need to get something.<eos> - I'll get you warrants.<eos> - Yes, for his computers, his car, his apartment.<eos> We need to move fast because this guy's gonna be covering his tracks.<eos> Go to his office, I'll get you a warrant and email it to you by the time you get there.
Let me guess, somebody finally realized this whole investigation makes no sense<eos> - and told you to back off. - That's not gonna happen.<eos> Barba, what do you mean, you're off the case?<eos> - What happened? - There was nothing I could do.<eos> - I had to recuse myself.<eos> - Why? I can't tell you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You can't tell me?<eos> - Yeah, you've gotta trust me.<eos> - This is for the best. - Oh, so I should trust you, but you don't trust me?
The one looking into that DA.<eos> No matter what he thinks, I didn't do nothing.<eos> I'm keeping my life straight.<eos> I'm not like my mom. Nobody's saying that you are.<eos> That other detective was saying it, that the money was for sex, but I'm not like that.<eos> Okay, well, let's slow down here.<eos> What...<eos> What money?<eos> And what DA? I'm not supposed to tell anyone.<eos> Okay, I'm sure that he told you that, but it's okay.
Who was she?<eos> Yeah, Grace was a hard worker, receptionist at a doctor's office in the South Loop, raising two younger sisters.<eos> Dad got knifed in the day room at Stateville last year.<eos> Sisters are with DCFS now.<eos> Those sisters need to be interviewed.<eos> I want to understand the last day of Grace's life.<eos> Check all sex offenders in the area.<eos> Comb her social media. Dump her phone.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Thank you.
My name is Jimmy Sanguinetti.<eos> I'm here to see Erin Lindsay.<eos> Regarding?<eos> Does she know this?<eos> She does.<eos> So, if I were to call up there and say, "hey, your dad's down here,"<eos> this wouldn't be some kind of joke?<eos> Look, if you could just... Let her know I'm here, that'd be great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Someone here to see you, Detective.
Jimmy Sanguinetti.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Looking good, Hank.<eos> Still at your fighting weight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just want to say... You did a real good job raising her.<eos> Happy to help.<eos> We caught a case.<eos> That... That means we gotta roll.<eos> No, no. That's... That's for you.
Who sent it in?<eos> That's what matters to you right now? No.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> All this time, I thought he was.<eos> What game are you running?<eos> Do you think that I'm gonna send Jimmy pictures of you for 15 years to run a con?<eos> I thought he was your dad.<eos> Do you want to tell him or should I?<eos> Well, Erin. He...<eos> He really cares about you.
All this time, I thought he was.<eos> What game are you running?<eos> Do you think that I'm gonna send Jimmy pictures of you for 15 years to run a con?<eos> I thought he was your dad.<eos> Do you want to tell him or should I?<eos> Well, Erin. He...<eos> He really cares about you.<eos> Maybe... Maybe you don't have to tell him.<eos> Why do you keep doing this to me?<eos> What's going on with you and Erin?
You should probably talk to Erin.<eos> You know, I turned a blind eye to you two being a couple in my unit. So, when I ask one of you a question, as a courtesy to me, you can answer for the other.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... Jimmy's not her dad. And I'm the bad guy.<eos> What am I signing up for?<eos> In terms of her mom?<eos> I imagine you got a pretty good idea.<eos> Patrol just picked up one of Emily's friends.<eos> He says that she got into an argument... A screaming match with Sandford Greg three days ago.<eos> Which differs from what she told you.
Appreciate it.<eos> He's 22 years old. He grew up in Garfield Park.<eos> All-city wrestler, and he studied criminal justice at City College.<eos> He's currently number six in the hiring list for Chicago PD.<eos> He's been with the Special Police how long? Three months and change.<eos> All right.<eos> Grab him up. But don't go in hard. He's practically one of ours.<eos> Hank.<eos> Bunny Fletcher is here.<eos> She says she's not leaving until she talks to you.
Like, Vanessa Reeder.<eos> After everything she went through, guess where she ended up?<eos> Phoenix.<eos> Got her teaching degree.<eos> Is married and has a kid on the way.<eos> She just couldn't get it together until she left Chicago.<eos> And as much as I love you, and... It would kill me to have you go...<eos> I don't know, Annie.<eos> I mean, if I could move somewhere, and start over right now... I would.<eos> What's stopping you?
Yeah, so if you want to roll to the Laugh Factory with me tonight, I think that would be dope.<eos> I signed up for the open mic.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You did it. - I could use a friendly face.<eos> - That's awesome, man. I'm excited for you.
Make it hotter around here?<eos> It's bad for business.<eos> All right, those two guys hiding in the church, Miles and Jaylen, they part of your crew?<eos> Man, I seen them shorties around, but they ain't with us.<eos> Look, man, I'm telling you straight.<eos> All right.<eos> Do me a favor. You hear anything about who killed that girl, anything, I want to know.<eos> I'll keep my ears open.<eos> Gonna be a lot of eyeballs on this thing.<eos> If I were you, I'd close this store,
I'll break the other one.<eos> I figured nobody would believe my story in a million years, so I got rid of the body piece by piece.<eos> And you just... you kept the head and the hands as souvenirs.<eos> Fingerprints and teeth.<eos> It's the parts they can trace you with.<eos> It was... it was justified.<eos> All you can get me for is unlawful disposal of body parts, but I... I had nothing to do with that girl.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you've had these urges for a long, long time.<eos> But when this thing with your roommate went down, something shifted for you.
Benzodiazepine.<eos> Generic tranquilizer.<eos> Girl was high as a bird.<eos> Doubt she could fight back.<eos> Her skull was broken in front.<eos> But her arm was snapped from behind.<eos> It's like she was yanked around?<eos> Killer wanted to see her face.<eos> Hey, Sarge, you got a minute?<eos> For you, but if you see Burgess, the nod and go policy is still in effect.
I just wanna have a talk later. Ticket's yours either way.<eos> What do you want for this?<eos> I told you, I just want to talk.<eos> About what?<eos> Sam.<eos> Ellie, wait, Ellie.<eos> Do you want a train ticket?<eos> It's yours, all right?<eos> You wanna get out of here?<eos> I'll lie for you, I'll sneak you out, hell, I'll even drive you.
Did a cab pick you up?<eos> No, the guy did.<eos> He drove me.<eos> I don't know where. - Tonya set it up.<eos> - Yeah, what time did you get back?<eos> Um, 9:00 maybe?<eos> I was high, I'm not... I'm not sure when exactly.<eos> Why all these questions?<eos> What is Tonya saying?<eos> You told me I could trust you.
- Where is he?<eos> - He's in here.<eos> You take a walk.<eos> Get up.<eos> Dude, what the hell is going on...<eos> That's it?<eos> Yeah,<eos> Tonya's getting charged and DCFS is gonna shut Brady down.<eos> Everybody there's gonna get an alternate placement.<eos> We found a really good family for you in Libertyville, the Melnicks.
Good.<eos> We roll in an hour.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Actually, yeah, I do.<eos> Since Octavia murdered Pike, I'm the only one left who knows where it is.<eos> Why are you defending him?<eos> Pike was a dictator.<eos> He was an elected chancellor, and if you don't care about that, he kept me alive for 3 months.<eos> Then why did you help us turn him over to the Grounders?<eos> To save you, Nate.
The promise is empty.<eos> The king must perform his duties, madame.<eos> Did you not understand what it meant to marry one?<eos> I understand deeply, but as your wife I don't like who you've become.<eos> Who would that be, precisely?<eos> You're changing and it scares me.<eos> You may be the Sun King, but, of late, when I look into your eyes, all I see is shadow.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you are, and I completely agree with you. It's self-evident.
He can hardly compel you to...<eos> He will find a way.<eos> All right!<eos> We should have the biggest party in the world to welcome me back to civilisation.<eos> Invite most of our best friends, and all of our worst ones, too, we want it to be Fun after all!<eos> They won't come.<eos> You know, I feared this would happen.<eos> In my absence, you've become pathetic.<eos> Does it really take me to tell you this?<eos> Does your brother control you so strongly that you cannot see it for yourself?
You see him over there?<eos> Beauregarde?<eos> He fell foul of her and he's been sliding down the ranks ever since.<eos> Three weeks ago he was holding the King's shoe and now look at him.<eos> Removed from the cuffs.<eos> You do what I tell you to do, say what I tell you to say, and we will triumph!<eos> But you must trust that I know what I'm doing.<eos> Only if we work together we will prevail.<eos> You have no idea how this place works, Mother.<eos> I know a sight more than you do, let me tell you!
An accent, something fun.<eos> If enough people join in, other people will feel left out if they do not belong.<eos> We could rule by colour.<eos> This winter will be blue!<eos> Not blue.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's the King's colour.<eos> Red, then.<eos> A rich crimson.<eos> Fashion will be our standard, darling, and the people will walk behind you.
We could rule by colour.<eos> This winter will be blue!<eos> Not blue.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's the King's colour.<eos> Red, then.<eos> A rich crimson.<eos> Fashion will be our standard, darling, and the people will walk behind you.<eos> And me.<eos> I understand why you would want your friend to attend you, but why here?
I was worried you may have reached the early hours, and decided some consummations were in order.<eos> Look at the table.<eos> That is your your clothes bill for the last month.<eos> Yes, and?<eos> 15 pairs of new breechess.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> They are not clothes, they are costumes!<eos> They allow me to express my every mood and whim!<eos> They also cost a fortune.<eos> Since when does that concern you?
Well, what use will I be?<eos> It is the King's child.<eos> Believe me, the King does not love me for my ability to bear children, let alone look after them.<eos> You are free to go.<eos> Have you found the murderer?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who is it?<eos> No!<eos> Mother, what have you done?<eos> Believe me, I did it all for you, my love.
Man is defined by his foes, is he not, Sire?<eos> It must arrive within two days.<eos> Yes, Sir.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> My son!<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> You know what they're going to do to me?<eos> It's the sound of the blade that I fear the most.<eos> I shut my eyes and think of you when you were a child, my love.
Are you gonna have me arrested because you hire undocumented workers? Huh?<eos> Are you gonna tell the police that you don't pay people what you owe?<eos> That you have us living 20 people in a box, como animales?<eos> So tell them all that.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Call them.<eos> Call the police.<eos> No, you can't be like that with them.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> These trabajadores... They work for you.
I want to see if my hand is still shaking.<eos> You've knocked him for a loop.<eos> You would choose him.<eos> He chose me.<eos> there will be trouble.<eos> And don't bring any of it here.<eos> Is he good to you?<eos> yes, he's good to me.<eos> Give guys what they want and they're good to you.<eos> One thing, you never have to guess what they want.
- That's what he done!<eos> When we get to Lago, you can have the mayors horse.<eos> Fried or barbecued.<eos> Well, I guess we walk some.<eos> Old Drake and Allen don't seem to have remembered.<eos> They'll remember.<eos> One way or another, they'll remember.<eos> All right.<eos> You don't want to get shot.<eos> You don't want your shops or houses burned.
- See you tomorrow.<eos> - Good night.<eos> They do so appreciate it.<eos> Even I need sleep, of course.<eos> It gets a bit of a grind on one's own.<eos> Even the strongest stumble.<eos> But one does what one can.<eos> Now, do you see that bonfire over there?<eos> That's all my regulars.<eos> Now, you just toddle across and give them their soup.
Help!<eos> He's gone stark raving mad!<eos> You know, I thought we'd never get rid of those two rascals, but lucky for us folks, King Richard returned, and, well, he just straightened everything out<eos> Better get to the church.<eos> Sounds like somebody's gettin' hitched.<eos> Long live Robin Hood!<eos> Long live King Richard!<eos> Oh, Friar Tuck, it appears that I now have an outlaw for an in-law.<eos> Yes, not bad.<eos> Gee, Skippy, how come you're goin'?
And now, one of the most popular groups in the nation...<eos> The Staple Singers!<eos> I think that there's more awareness of....<eos> There's more search for awareness with black people... as to where we are and what has happened to us... and what we're going to do with it.<eos> I dig the natural.<eos> I think the natural is a beautiful way of wearing your hair... for all black people.<eos> When I get up in the morning, I'm natural.<eos> And that's the way my hair is all day long.<eos> Kids is what make me feel so good.<eos> You see, you're looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life.
No matter.<eos> I won't bother you because I'm going to bed.<eos> Well, everybody's a Sheriff here. [INAUDIBLE] ya.<eos> Thanks for bringing back my horse.<eos> [GUNS COCKING] Hey, what do you want?<eos> But why have they got you tied up?<eos> To restrain my enthusiasm.<eos> That's no way to get married.<eos> You were the one to tell him!<eos> And you tied him up!
Come and look!<eos> Chen first invaded our School and now killed our interpreter<eos> He don't give face to our Empire Where's the law in this area?<eos> What are you detectives for?<eos> Please told me<eos> Sir! Aren't you overstating things<eos> I give them two days to deliver Chen<eos> I know what to do if they don't<eos> What can you do?<eos> You're Chinese You help your own kind
It is a Delaforce 1942.<eos> - Ah, thanks Count!<eos> And, you know who sent it to me?<eos> That young Portuguese,.. who stopped over here last month.<eos> Ah!<eos> Do you remember?<eos> A defendant who managed to get away for the skin of his teeth!<eos> Our public prosecutor, at the end of his scholarly indictment,.. had asked to sentence him to 19 years, and 11 months!<eos> But I have shown the non premeditation, and our president.. sentenced him to a minimum sentence.<eos> Why, you still practice the profession?
- Yes, a real trial,..<eos> Arteries, hormones, pancreas, everything worked again.<eos> Are back agility, appetite, energy, flexibility! Look, look how it's done!<eos> - Where are you going? No, no!<eos> - Careful!<eos> - Leave, leave!<eos> On one leg, hop!<eos> Today, it came out even better!<eos> Damn, he's very good, huh!<eos> But, sorry, you, exactly, are you doing?
We also have a pretty "femme de chambre"!<eos> Good evening.<eos> - Dr. Rossi. - Which room can we give to Dr. Rossi?<eos> The emperor's apartment.<eos> It's an honor!<eos> No, no, I'll bring it, don't bother!<eos> Come upstairs to cool off.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> I'm sorry, you are all in tails, and I have nothing to change.
For heaven's sake, a madness, forget it!<eos> - Why?<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Well, I must confess...<eos> - But you can't!<eos> You have the mania to confess!<eos> No, I meant... that until a year ago, I drove a 600. Well, you can't imagine.. the difference if you deal a bargain and come with a nice big car, prestigious.<eos> Now you are somebody, not "Cacini", as they say in Rome!<eos> Of course, all costs!<eos> Then there is the villa, the family! Maybe you don't know what it costs today in Italy, a family!

Maybe you don't know what it costs today in Italy, a family!<eos> You are married?
Inherited? And how!<eos> Why was there so much hostility between the deceased and you?<eos> Mr. President, I object!<eos> - Objection accepted.<eos> The prosecutor must elaborate his question.<eos> There wasn't much liking between you two?<eos> Liking?<eos> But he hadn't any for anyone!<eos> Only that, predicting that sooner or later he would go,.. I was courting the Americans of Efestion since long.<eos> You know the Americans?
Delete the word "intrigue" from the record. Voila!<eos> - Well!<eos> He said "delete"! Won't you delete?<eos> No intrigue, then.<eos> Love story, suits you?<eos> Yes, alright.<eos> So then, how did her husband notice it?<eos> From who, did he know?<eos> It ... it was a bad thing.<eos> I'd rather not say it, if you do not mind!
It ... it was a bad thing.<eos> I'd rather not say it, if you do not mind!<eos> Then don't say it.<eos> No, no, no, I won't tell!<eos> Don't worry, I won't say anything.<eos> As you wish.<eos> - No!<eos> - Too bad though. You thus authorize us to imagine something even worse.. than what perhaps was in reality!<eos> But no, perhaps I'd better tell it!<eos> I don't ... I don't want you to think badly of me.
IT COMES WITH THE BUSINESS, AND HE KNEW IT !<eos> I KNOW WHAT HE KNEW, JENNY.<eos> BUT MY MOTHER DIDN'T KNOW.<eos> NOW, SOMEBODY'S GONNA PAY.<eos> I DON'T KNOW WHO, BUT SOMEBODY'S GONNA PAY.<eos> THEY'RE GONNA KILL YOU.<eos> SO FORGET IT, BECAUSE IT'S OVER.<eos> IS IT ?<eos> THEY KNOW ABOUT YOU.<eos> THAT'S WHO YOU THOUGHT WAS OVER AT THE DOOR, DIDN'T YOU ?
I don't doubt it.<eos> Do you value life so little?<eos> On that contrary, I value it enormously.<eos> The Daleks will kill us whatever we tell you.<eos> Not if you co-operate with them.<eos> As you c-operate with them?<eos> Do you really think that makes any difference?<eos> They can be reasonable!<eos> Reasonable!<eos> They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.
He's a fake... a fake<eos> A Martian lunatic... workers!<eos> Do it for your student comrades<eos> It is 8 in the morning! When you come out it will already be dark<eos> Today for you the sunlight will not shine<eos> You will be doing piecework...<eos> 8 hours of piecework And you will come out old empty Convinced you have earned yourselves a day-Wage<eos> And instead you will have been robbed!<eos> Yes, robbed!<eos> Of 8 hours... it's not with piecework that you have to earn more money
If you play your cards right, I'll see you're rewarded.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I'll make it clear.<eos> Don't meddle in my affairs and I'll make you rich.<eos> What? So you admit something happened to them?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Hand them over, otherwise I'll report you!<eos> Say what you like.<eos> You have no evidence.<eos> Don't think you can bully us!
Oh my word!<eos> - Think ofyour art and be strong.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> - Come, brother Baal.<eos> The two white doves _y happily into the blue.<eos> Rivers in the light of dawn, graveyards in the wind;<eos> and the scent of endless fields before they're mown.<eos> Stay here, Herr Baal.<eos> - Don't do it, it's not worth it.<eos> It's too early, it can be dimerent, you're not coming, brother.
Then it doesn't matter.<eos> Are your knees strong?<eos> - Do you even know my name?<eos> It's Sophie Barger.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> No!<eos> - How old are you?<eos> 24 in June.<eos> - How many men have you had?<eos> So you've got that over with.
- What do you intend to do?<eos> - See a man about an ambush. - That's not the way.<eos> - It's my way.<eos> - But your plan worked.<eos> - We got the merchandise.<eos> - And we got Murphy.<eos> Murphy was in town during the raid with 100 witnesses.<eos> He's surrounded by the law and by gunmen like Evans.<eos> Henry's right.<eos> You're doing just what they want you to do.
He swear to Wakantanka never to retreat in battle.<eos> He now want brave death to save his honour, because Black Eagle take Thorn Rose.<eos> He was her first man. Indian law.<eos> That means Black Eagle can take Yellow Hand's woman... when he wants her.<eos> If Yellow Hand complains, he is weak.<eos> Hey, Anglais...<eos> This may be good.<eos> He die - you be made chief quicker.<eos> Get war party. And we go.<eos> Five years you've lived here and you've learned nothing about these people!

And they took them away<eos> What did that Cepicka woman say?<eos> She asked if the house was warm in winter<eos> What do you want me to burn?<eos> It doesn't matter now<eos> It must be a draft in the roof<eos> The attic window is open<eos> How can they put a minister in prison?<eos> They don't discriminate<eos> Do you have any idea how many are in prison over there?
There was a death threat yesterday.<eos> You knew about it?<eos> You expected it, didn't you?<eos> You said, "So they finally got him."<eos> What did I say?<eos> You told the hospital director,<eos> "So they finally got him." Who are "they"?<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> The culprits have been arrested.<eos> That's who you meant?
No!<eos> So now it's finished.<eos> You're leaving me this way?<eos> Is that what you want? What a fool you are.<eos> There's a bunch of jackasses outside, waiting to bray at you...<eos> How wi ll you manage alone?<eos> They don't scare me;<eos> It's you they're after, not me!<eos> It's your business!<eos> That you were with me is enough.
He's a good man, resourceful, intelligent and has a lot of initiative.<eos> - Outstanding?<eos> - Outstanding!<eos> - Chung See Bado!<eos> Good to see you.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Glad you're in the outfit.<eos> Smart looking honor guard.<eos> I recognize most of them.<eos> Even those you don't recognize know of you.
Haven't you seen who is here?<eos> You can start now.<eos> Your arm higher...<eos> - It is ok?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Pay attention!<eos> Oh, this film gives me a hard time...<eos> Don't change the position!<eos> Why don't you tell them they are free?<eos> Why would you like to hide the truth?
Marino!<eos> Are you feeling sick again?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> We have got everything here.<eos> Open this bottle of sparkling wine and some fried pastries, to start.<eos> Fried pastries?<eos> You don't run away from fried pastries at carnival.<eos> Fried pastries!<eos> I go and see, but I'm not sure.<eos> I've heard that you were looking for fried pastries before.
- Don't argue.<eos> Take your clothes off.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, relax. I didn't mean it that way.<eos> You're going up to the castle tonight as a domestic.<eos> How?<eos> Naked?<eos> Not a bad idea, but is a bit obvious.<eos> There's a staff shortage in Germany and the Schloss Adler is no exception.<eos> You're the type they're looking for, young, intelligent, good-looking... and as we both know, not entirely without humor.
That was a mistake. Mistake?<eos> How?<eos> -No, I was talking to..<eos> Here you are.<eos> Good day Mr. Bertone.<eos> -Good day.<eos> If you'll come with me, Professor Cutolo is waiting.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> You're from the Press, right?<eos> -Yes. You come too.
How?<eos> -No, I was talking to..<eos> Here you are.<eos> Good day Mr. Bertone.<eos> -Good day.<eos> If you'll come with me, Professor Cutolo is waiting.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> You're from the Press, right?<eos> -Yes. You come too.<eos> You'll hear the official statement. Come on.
-Please help me.<eos> -Maria.<eos> The love of a man and a woman is holy.<eos> You have a great capacity to love.<eos> You must find out how God wants you to spend your love.<eos> But I pledged my life to God. I pledged my life to his service.<eos> My daughter, if you love this man, it doesn't mean you love God less.<eos> No.<eos> You must find out.<eos> You must go back.
And you're sisters?<eos> - No, friends!<eos> - Long live friendship!<eos> There's an empty seat, so she could go up front...<eos> Driver, to your place!<eos> - But this is a wonderful place, a paradise! - It's nice here! How lovely.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> ! Go fetch their suitcases. Immediately!<eos> - Cute Italian!<eos> - And you're cute too!
I'm so tired of my world, the people I know<eos> There's an oasis near Marrakesh, it's divine!<eos> You live on sun and fruit, lots of fruit<eos> - 1,200,000 - What?<eos> The return fare<eos> - Oh, Renzo, stop it!<eos> - It's the truth The truth is you keep turning the conversation to money!<eos> You know what I make a month?<eos> I don't want to know! Don't you understand?<eos> I like you because you're not like the robots I know busy making money all day
Confronted with such serious matters, a man must answer to his moral conscience beyond all considerations of politics or party lines.<eos> I'm a simple man, and I don't know how to talk like De Vita, who's succeeded in sowing discord within our own ranks.<eos> I stick to the facts. I build buildings.<eos> De Vita says he has nothing against them as long as they're built as dictated by law.<eos> But the law is made here.<eos> We all make it together.<eos> But apparently this doesn't suit De Vita either.<eos> You investigated me. What did you discover?<eos> Not a thing.<eos> All this makes me wonder if what you really want is for those people to go on living in hovels so you can carry on your usual propaganda.
He didn't say a word?<eos> That man is hopeless.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Are you ready to marry?<eos> Tell me.<eos> How do you feel about it?<eos> Those two are helpless without me.<eos> - Why?<eos> - They just are.<eos> If that's the reason, you'll wind up never getting married.
Good day to you all!<eos> -Good day.<eos> Are we ready?<eos> -We're just missing the Public Prosecutor.<eos> Shall we wait for him?<eos> -No, there's no point.<eos> Let's get on with it.<eos> -Fine.<eos> No! This table's reserved for Madame Dubovitch.<eos> You get that one.
Afterwards he fell to the ground.<eos> Not this one, the other one.<eos> You saw the one from that night?<eos> Who?<eos> -The shadow, the thief!<eos> -Leave her, she doesn't understand a thing.<eos> If only we could track down the witness, that saw everything from the window.<eos> Counselor, what's he called this invisible witness?<eos> Layos Camulca.<eos> Are you looking for Mr. Camulca?
- You know him well?<eos> - Oh, I know him well.<eos> And he's a good man.<eos> He'll listen to me.<eos> We gotta have us a conference.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Oh, God, forgive me for ever having doubted you.<eos> Oh, please, let them come.<eos> I have my volunteers.<eos> - You're taking them?
You're a philosopher. No.<eos> I'm just the man who has to send people out on jobs like this one.<eos> Must have been delayed. I'm sure he'll be here soon.<eos> - Major Franklin?<eos> - Right.<eos> My name's Baker.<eos> Sorry I was delayed.<eos> Come with me, please.<eos> It's been so comfortable, I hate to Leave.<eos> When you're all quite ready....
I'd never seen anyone so indifferent to what people might say.<eos> I set this aside for you.<eos> You don't accept gifts from others?<eos> I do. I accept the alms of your time.<eos> Alms?<eos> True, I do give you the alms of my time.<eos> Now eat this pear.<eos> No, thank you, Father.<eos> That's pride.<eos> You dislike the bourgeois, but you're even more bourgeois.
Thanks.<eos> Life now really makes me long for the old days.<eos> Those were good times. Your father had the fish market.<eos> We sent you to a good school.<eos> What did my sister-in-law say?<eos> That she'd never return to a family like this.<eos> That's how couples are these days.<eos> You don't have to run off.<eos> Emiko asked about you. "How's his job as an insurance salesman?"<eos> You've wound up like this because you're too nice!
- No, nothing...<eos> - What happened?<eos> I know what happened, but some day you'll know too.<eos> Let's go away.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> We've got a table now.<eos> - Listen to me, let's go.<eos> Listen, don't be a boor.<eos> Don't spoil my evening. The waiter is coming.<eos> Are you having dinner?
Sunday they spend in fear of damaging the car.<eos> They set up table and chairs by the roadside... An unmade lane might damage the car.<eos> It'll take them hours driving home. Call that sane?<eos> Do you live differently? I try to..we try to...<eos> Doing things just for the fun of it.<eos> What kind of things?<eos> Well, my friends and I muck about on things that'll never be useful<eos> And generally waste our time...<eos> What's your name?<eos> Henri, I hear you're happy?
Do you know what prison is?<eos> - I can imagine.<eos> - No, you can't.<eos> - May I borrow it?<eos> - The same old ideas?<eos> - The same.<eos> In any case, even the most skillful pickpocket won't help humanity progress.<eos> I never said that.<eos> It's absurd.<eos> Tell me, do you think there are many around?
Here he is!<eos> Professor!<eos> Come here.<eos> Ferdinando, hi.<eos> You look like a rag-man, what are you doing with all those shirts?<eos> I just picked them up, they've been ironed.<eos> - It doesn't look like it!<eos> - Would you iron them?<eos> - I'd burn all of them.<eos> - If you'd like, I can...
- For charity, offers my firm, company Capelli di Mantova, famous for chocolates.<eos> Please...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - When do you get to Perma?<eos> Modena 14 and 22, Reggio Emilia 14 and 41,<eos> Parma 15 and 02.<eos> - But that's good!<eos> Thanks...<eos> by now the train is my home.<eos> Do you stop at Parma?
HE'S ONLY ASLEEP, MISS REYNOLDS.<eos> WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A STATE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION.<eos> BOB!<eos> [Franz] BE PATIENT. HE'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.<eos> THIS FRESH AIR WILL REVIVE HIM IN NO TIME.<eos> YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I ENJOY THESE LITTLE REUNIONS.<eos> [Franz] YOU FUNNY LITTLE PEOPLE.<eos> I WONDER WHY IT IS YOU ALWAYS HATE ME SO AT FIRST.<eos> I HAVEN'T REALLY HARMED YOU.<eos> [Franz] YOU GET THE BEST CARE. I NEVER LET YOU GET TOO WARM OR COLD,
[Little Girl] AND PEOPLE, TOO.<eos> PEOPLE?<eos> LITTLE PEOPLE.<eos> HE MAKES LITTLE PEOPLE, DOES HE?<eos> HOW? OUT OF BIG ONES WITH A MACHINE.<eos> REAL LITTLE PEOPLE?<eos> PEOPLE THAT WALK AND TALK AND EVERYTHING?<eos> HOW DO YOU KNOW?<eos> MR. FRANZ SHOWED ME. HE SAID, SOMETIMES WHEN I'M GOOD I CAN PLAY WITH THEM.<eos> [Sergeant] HE ISN'T HERE TO LET YOU PLAY WITH THEM,
What are you looking for?<eos> Lipstick?<eos> All right, solly. Get going.<eos> Wait a minute, sheriff. I can't run my dogs anymore today.<eos> They need a rest.<eos> We got another good hour of daylight left. Never mind.<eos> Our men need a rest, too.<eos> It was that last waltz that did it.<eos> You're giving those cons a pretty good head start.<eos> They have to rest, too, you know.
THANKS, PETE. BYE.<eos> IT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK EVERYTHING WITH HIM.<eos> YEAH, A CLEAN SWEEP. EXCEPT FOR THIS. LET'S HAVE A LOOK.<eos> Pete: WELL, HERE WE ARE, BOYS.<eos> [LOCK CLICKS]<eos> Larry: AHEM. WELL, WHAT ARE THESE?<eos> THIS ROOM IS LIKE A CATHEDRAL TO ME.<eos> THIS IS WHERE I COME WHEN I NEED HELP<eos> FROM A SOURCE STRONGER THAN MYSELF.<eos> DON'T YOU THINK
Like a snake!<eos> She's a fantastic girl!<eos> To your health, Dorothy Lamour.<eos> Down the hatch!<eos> Thirsty in the desert.<eos> You know, Dorothy Lamour, frankly speaking, I love you.<eos> I've been around the world, but I never saw a girl like you.<eos> I love you, I swear it.<eos> Don't look at the other two.<eos> You know, we could be just like them.
There's nothing recognisable.<eos> We found in the notes that the Legion of Decency did not want any recognisable female undergarments hanging on the line.<eos> Even though we know that he's pulled her out of the bay, taken her back, taken her clothes off and put her into bed, the audience isn't supposed to really get that because there's no clothes hanging on the line.<eos> No, we wanted the audience to get that.<eos> This is what we call the deer in the headlights shot of Kim.<eos> But the Legion of Decency was doing everything they could to remove any signs of what was actually going on.<eos> They were a problem in those days.<eos> He hands her the robe and today she'd probably say, "I don't need that."<eos> How did censorship work at that point?<eos> Did you have to submit scripts?
- Before you say one word.<eos> I'll do anything you say.<eos> But I wanna say one thing first.<eos> I had enough of hospitals and I had enough of this crummy war and I wanna stay out of it.<eos> Just as long as I can.<eos> And I figure I'm entitled don't you?<eos> You mean, you want us to tell them what heroes we are?<eos> - I don't mean that.<eos> - We don't have to do it that way.<eos> I'll say what a great guy you are.
- Nice, that's two of us. What's this toy?<eos> - A present, a souvenir.<eos> I think it'll bring me luck.<eos> Maybe it's true.<eos> You're not going alone.<eos> I'll drive you up to Florence or Bologna. Oh, if he's coming, I'm not going.<eos> I don't want to be a third wheel.<eos> You're going!<eos> - With those two alone? No.<eos> Who said you'd be alone?
Two?<eos> Hey, there's old virge!<eos> Yahoo!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - Here we are, virge.<eos> We're watching.<eos> - You're doing just...<eos> - Hello there.<eos> Stop it, Bo!<eos> Sorry, lady, you're over there in the bleachers.
- But of course.<eos> The family will be here directly to welcome you.<eos> I wonder what with.<eos> - The south parlor.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Would you have four footmen bring me a large ashtray, please?<eos> Mike, be careful what you say.<eos> We may be wired for sound.<eos> They couldn't pay me to live in a joint like this.<eos> You know, they won't.
What are you talking about?<eos> Everybody's been on a picnic.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Not me.<eos> When I was a kid, I was too busy shooting craps or stealing milk bottles.<eos> You went on the steak fries in the fraternity, didn't you?<eos> And you know what they turned out to be.<eos> This picnic won't be that primitive.<eos> How do you talk to boys?<eos> Why, you just talk, silly.
Let a diamond bracelet disappear and they shout, "Robie, The Cat!"<eos> You don't have to spend every day proving your honesty.<eos> I do.<eos> Let's get down to business.<eos> The list.<eos> - Is something bothering you?<eos> - I told the police.<eos> - I didn't expect them to like it.<eos> - They thought it a splendid idea.<eos> They hope you'll provide the evidence against you.
Alcohol, tobacco, cinema, and politics...<eos> Why don't you sleep?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Away with all poisons!<eos> Away these too!<eos> In 10 minutes we are at Terrazzi.<eos> - We've almost arrived!<eos> You too go to Terrazzi?<eos> - Yes, first time.<eos> You've been there before?
Prince!<eos> My brother!<eos> I'd like to understand some too!<eos> The Countess is right.<eos> You can't afford hardships! After your meningitis, you must stay calm!<eos> Dear!<eos> - Dear uncle.<eos> - I, to this niece, would like to..<eos> put some questions!<eos> If you excuse me.
They need me. I don't need anybody.<eos> I'm here today, who knows where tomorrow.<eos> The less time in one place, the better, because people get on my nerves very quickly.<eos> I take off on my own. That's just the way I am. No house, no roof.<eos> Why did you say you'd die soon?<eos> It just stands to reason.<eos> Goes with the job.<eos> I'll break my neck, and no one will remember me.<eos> What about your mama?<eos> So what are you going to do?
- You're out of the tracks.<eos> That's far enough. Get in.<eos> - Maybe 100 more yards.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Another mile or two and we'll be okay.<eos> We're doing just fine, my boy.<eos> You brought it.<eos> - Are you nuts?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - Don't you see 'em? - Who?
Come in!<eos> Please.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Come in!<eos> Giovanni?<eos> No, no, stay as you are!<eos> Tea?<eos> Platoon, fall in!<eos> Giovanni, tea.<eos> You are the most important members of the camp?
That's for me to say.<eos> - I'm just going for a walk.<eos> - They're already here though.<eos> How beautiful and fresh the young leaves look.<eos> Shinnosuke, they've arrived, haven't they?<eos> You were right.<eos> - So you saw her, then?<eos> - If only I'd seen her before.<eos> - So you like her.<eos> You do know which one she is, don't you?
They won't get at you again.<eos> I'm going up to a meeting there now. Wait till I tell them! What a trump card!<eos> Yes, thanks, Bertha. There's a train to Manchester at 8.13. Manchester?<eos> What for?<eos> To give the newspapers the whole story.<eos> Here, wait a minute. What story?<eos> The whole thing. My invention and how people tried to stop it. - But they're not going to.<eos> - Whose side are you on?<eos> - The same as you.<eos> Don't you understand? They want to stop it.
Just that usual two-headed schoolteacher look.<eos> You're all dressed up.<eos> Saturday, no school, and you're all dressed up.<eos> Just my little old blue serge.<eos> First Saturday of trout season.<eos> Brad says ever since you were big enough lift a fish... Shh.<eos> Listen closely.<eos> Can you hear the grateful murmur of the trout as they whisper in the brooks and streams?<eos> This is what they whisper, "Phipps will not fish today." Mm.<eos> You're cute. But why?
Grandpa means that when things don't go right... it's useless to blame others.<eos> But, Grandpa, you have too much faith in people.<eos> You think others are as honest as you are.<eos> We don't care if they're honest with the others.<eos> I can't stand such shameless greed!<eos> They're getting rich off our backs! That's how things are:<eos> The wholesalers set the prices and that's all there is to it.<eos> Only up to a point, Uncle Peppino!<eos> Until you old fellows are the ones selling the fish... they will always take advantage of you.<eos> - Don't say such things, Bandiera! You're too good, that's what!
Illingenworth!<eos> - Get lost, I said. Or do you want to go missing?<eos> Thank you.<eos> What time is it, Scholtz?<eos> - Five past twelve.<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> What happened next I couldn't really take it all in.<eos> I have seen little of those days, no great events, no heroes, just a few little stories, and then only parts of them.<eos> But I have seen a few human beings.<eos> Isn't that what you were asking about, Willi?
Not me personally. This is on my own time.<eos> You don't look ambitious.<eos> It's not ambitious I don't like a perfect crime.<eos> I cannot accept that which mocks justice.<eos> Yes, I thought about it.<eos> I like them... or one of them anyway.<eos> You don't know which one?<eos> No I'm afraid not.<eos> I never had a talk with them together.<eos> - You think you'd know if you did?
This young lady..<eos> I'll be honest..<eos> I'm in love with her.<eos> It'd be.. too long now to explain the reasons, but I had to lie to this girl.<eos> Nothing bad.<eos> I don't have any parents.<eos> I told her they were alive and lived on the outskirts of Rome.<eos> To explain certain absences in which I was obligated many times by a relationship I couldn't confess.<eos> But that's not all.<eos> I have no friends and you know how weak a man in love is.
In short, if Giorgio doesn't come home tonight, tomorrow morning she leaves.<eos> And you'll have to clear out.<eos> So suddenly?<eos> The next day?<eos> - Mrs. Lina said that when she's gone, nobody can stay here.<eos> And as for the car, Giorgio must bring it back and hand the keys to me.<eos> But it's absurd.<eos> It's irrational.<eos> Even waiters are given a notice.<eos> Fact is, you're not waiters.
I'm alone so much, it's got me talking to myself.<eos> Paul.<eos> Why can't I have a baby?<eos> Maybe then I wouldn't be so... so lonely.<eos> There you go, singing the same old song.<eos> - You know we can't afford a kid.<eos> - It's the same old song from you.<eos> How long do you think I'm gonna stay young enough?<eos> The girls I went to school with have two or three kids now.<eos> The girls you went to school with were smart to marry guys with real jobs.
I'll see that you hang again.<eos> You?<eos> Alone?<eos> It took eight men before to say I was to be hanged.<eos> The same eight will find you guilty again.<eos> So?<eos> The same eight aren't here, Weber.<eos> No? Well, I'm one of the eight, and I'll be one again with pleasure.<eos> You, Neumuller.<eos> You were one.
Well, there's your receipt...$50,000.<eos> MAN:<eos> Now, now, now, my dear lady...<eos> Good riddance to bad rubbish!<eos> I'm keeping your trunk 'cause you ain't paid your rent.<eos> "Is this the face...<eos> "that wrecked a thousand ships... and burned the towerless tops of Ilium?"<eos> Doc.<eos> Doc, can they make me leave town when I don't want to go?<eos> Do I have to go? Dallas, don't you go makin' no fuss.
Lucrezia, that stupid! Cause she didn't trust me!<eos> But we...<eos> - But you now go to Lucrezia's farmhouse, and wait for me there!<eos> And if you come here again with these airs...<eos> No, I...really, I didn't want to come, I didn't believe that you...<eos> It was the others! Yeah?<eos> Take this, to the others.<eos> Scram!<eos> Let him go, order of the Count.<eos> You heard? They accuse me of kidnapping her in league with you. You, of being in league with them.
There's a moral there somewhere.<eos> Whats the matter with you?<eos> I'm in a mess. I've completely ruined myself with Pat.<eos> Thats what I've done. She's probably used to millionaires and counts and the way they behave.<eos> I acted like a drunken sod.<eos> Well how do you think millionaires act?<eos> Like millionaires? Its too bad though.<eos> I should've stayed at Alphons to take care of you.<eos> It might've been better for all of us.<eos> What do you mean, another riot? -No.
Oh, that's where Napoleon came from.<eos> Napoleon?<eos> Yes, Napoleon BonaFIDE.<eos> Father backed your first show, remember?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Here it is. "Tottley Castle.<eos> Present owner is Lord Marshmoreton,<eos> "his sister Lady Caroline and daughter Lady Alyce.<eos> "Since the 1400s, Tottley has been the seat of the Earl..."<eos> Oh, George, you must lose that Brooklyn accent. You mean "oil".
Why they would pay a shilling to be led about like dumb animals gaping into the interiors of their betters, I'll never understand.<eos> It makes them feel envious of us.<eos> Keggs, I'm expecting madrigal singers.<eos> Show them into the ballroom. Yes, m'lady.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Is it Thursday? I fear so, m'lady.<eos> Well, open the doors and windows after they've gone.<eos> Yes, m'lady.<eos> Keep in line, please.<eos> Try to keep in line and hand me a shilling as you pass.
Laugh.<eos> Be happy.<eos> It's the sheriff.<eos> - Hey, you.<eos> - I ain't done nothing.<eos> You've got nothing on me.<eos> My skirts are clean.<eos> Yeah? This letter from Florida says you're a horse doctor.<eos> Put them all under arrest.<eos> They won't run, sheriff, if you break their legs.
- You've got to!<eos> - Why wasn't I told?<eos> I'd have given anything to stop this from happening.<eos> I'm not going on, and I'll tell them why.<eos> - Kay is dead.<eos> You had nothing to do with that. - I killed her.<eos> - There are 50 living people depending on you.<eos> This show may mean as much to them as it meant to Kay.<eos> The ushers, the cleaners.<eos> Each one demands that you go on.
See if I care! I'm going to get this off my chest to know the reason why.<eos> I'll teach you to break poor old women's hearts just to see the pieces fly!<eos> Please, Mrs Walker. This is Mr Glidden.<eos> He's... - I'm going to tell you just what I think...<eos> - Just one moment, please.<eos> If you'll talk to me first, you can finish what you have to say.<eos> - I'm sorry, but Mrs Walker...<eos> - Try and stop me!<eos> - Well, what do you want?<eos> - I want to talk to you alone, if you please.
- Head back to Niagara Falls.<eos> - What do you want to do?<eos> - It's up to us now.<eos> - I'm in.<eos> - Let's do this.<eos> - I'm born ready.<eos> - Where's my chainsaw?<eos> Family rules.<eos> Hey, hey, come on. We're about to land. Come on.<eos> - Are you in charge here?
Your bosses are very angry at me.<eos> They're not angry.<eos> They gave me an advance on a second book.<eos> They know what happened in South America.<eos> College wasn't what I thought it was gonna be.<eos> I had a hard time, when my dad died<eos> I just couldn't see a point to it.<eos> My family has always had a missing part.<eos> What's missing is my sister, Charlotte and now I wanna bring my sister home.<eos> You're here to tell me if you'd feel safe should Charlotte DiLaurentis leave the hospital?
Exactly how many people have you lost?<eos> One.<eos> Who did you lose?<eos> Someone close to you?<eos> Who was she, Raymond?<eos> For someone who doesn't remember me, you sure have a lot of personal observations to offer.<eos> Fine, don't talk to me, but fix the suit.<eos> It's the only chance that poor girl has.<eos> I'm gonna make this very simple for you, Mr. Blake.<eos> You tell me where Vandal Savage is hiding his fortune and we will let you leave here unmolested.
Miranda and Jo... [coughs]<eos> Jonas.<eos> I will heal... and then I will rise... and I'll simply wait.<eos> I am looking forward to meeting them.<eos> Sara. Sara.<eos> Sara!<eos> Gideon, I need a check of the timeline.<eos> Vandal Savage.<eos> The timeline is unchanged, Captain.<eos> You know better than anyone that Savage is immortal.
Jeremiah?<eos> Six.<eos> Can I ask you to leave the room?<eos> Father, no, I need to help my brother.<eos> I need to help you. Father, I need to help God.<eos> It's technical, it doesn't concern you.<eos> I'm a eucharistic minister.<eos> Can you leave the room, please?<eos> I need to be here.<eos> You don't understand.
- You make some very good points Mrs. Rose.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But can I ask why are you talking to me about this?<eos> I'm hoping to take my complaint to council, and I've been told you'd be the easiest one to crack.<eos> Too kind.<eos> And I'd be happy to help.<eos> Excellent!<eos> But unfortunately, I'm no longer on the town council.<eos> I resigned a few weeks ago, too overwhelmed with my businesses.<eos> But uh, you're more than welcome to take it to council yourself, with my endorsement.
Um, I would really rather not dive any deeper.<eos> No, it's not necessary.<eos> Because I ended up in some really scary, dark places of the Internet that I would rather not revisit, so...<eos> I am suddenly overwhelmed with regret.<eos> It's a new feeling for me, and I don't find it at all pleasurable.<eos> You regret that embarrassing photos of you aren't online?<eos> No, I regret that they're lost.<eos> They were the one perfect memorial to who I once was.<eos> And I should've appreciated those firm round mammae, and Callipygian ass, while I had them.<eos> If you're talking about your body, uh... I think you still look amazing.
By the time they came to town, the whorehouse had a bidet, and the saloon had recessed lighting.<eos> John Booth, Quinn King.<eos> Well, well, it's true.<eos> You do fill a room.<eos> Oh, is that what these two have been saying about me?<eos> Oh, actually, they haven't mentioned you once.<eos> I did my due diligence. Mm.<eos> Should I be worried?<eos> On the contrary.<eos> Everyone here knows that you're the true creator of "Everlasting,"
Between you and me, we can make shows that actually mean something.<eos> And there is John Booth.<eos> The guy that just bought our network?<eos> Everyone here knows that you're the true creator of "Everlasting." You're a legend.
I have to stay.<eos> What?<eos> Because of the stuff I did with Romeo and Darius.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Romeo and Darius... they're gonna be fine.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> What did your mother say?<eos> Her mother said that Rachel is exactly where she needs to be.<eos> The question is, Mr. Wasserman, what are you doing here?
You're the one who drugs her up.<eos> She doesn't stay on drugs long enough to get any better, and then she keeps coming back here, back to... to this, to... to an environment that is toxic, plain and simple.<eos> That's rich.<eos> Yeah, this place is like "Little House on the Frickin' Prairie" compared to what I hear happens at your place.<eos> What happened between you two?<eos> The fact that you treat your own daughter is bizarre, not to mention unethical, wouldn't you say, Doctor?<eos> I am more qualified to treat Rachel than anyone.<eos> Oh, I'm not talking about your qualifications as a doctor.<eos> I'm talking about your duty as a mother.<eos> And what do you know about being a mother?
- So what next? You just win "Everlasting."<eos> Your editor was right... an exposé coming from this season's winner... That's gonna blow things up.<eos> Well done.<eos> Hey!<eos> So, um... any tips for getting Darius interested?<eos> Trust me, he's interested.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> When is he gonna start to show it?<eos> You know I'm with Rachel, right?<eos> Sure, you are.
My friends, it's time to begin.<eos> I know you're wondering why we're here.<eos> It's been a long time, but today, we're not here for a ceremony, but a celebration.<eos> We've devoted our lives to bringing the Hydra God back from exile, and I know some in this room have doubted that he'd ever return.<eos> You doubted me.<eos> Well...<eos> They were wrong.<eos> My exile's over.<eos> What is this?<eos> You're Grant Ward.
And we need to get you to the med bay.<eos> Ah, the med bay, where a morphine drip awaits me.<eos> Now just try and take it slowly.<eos> Don't bother telling him what to do he'll just do the opposite.<eos> Oh, yeah, it would be my fault that I got hurt, because I didn't listen to you in your infinite wisdom.<eos> I am sorry, Professor.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It seems this... partnership of ours has become untenable.<eos> Partnership?<eos> No, this is a dictatorship, one in which you get to call all the shots and I get to take all the shots.
Sorry, Professor, I had to do it.<eos> You idiot.<eos> I...<eos> I can still remove it.<eos> I just hope I can absorb the excess power. No.<eos> Do you have any idea the kind of energy that...<eos> Should have listened to your friend.<eos> What the hell are you doing, Gray?<eos> Jefferson?<eos> You are not Firestorm, you're just a stubborn old man who's about to make a really stupid decision.
He'll torture them if Stein tries to hold out.<eos> Well, we'll have to pray that he does.<eos> If Savage's goal is to create his own Firestorm, then Stein himself is the key, the missing piece of the puzzle.<eos> And if Vostok figures out how to turn Stein's powers against us, then... I'm afraid the world is beyond saving.<eos> Stein's a lot tougher than he looks.<eos> I mean, it will take a lot to break him.<eos> That's the good news.<eos> The bad news is that our compatriots are being held in an impenetrable Soviet gulag.<eos> Get a good night's sleep.<eos> You and Dr. Vostok have much work to do in the morning.
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't --<eos> I didn't quite hear what you just said.<eos> I said she didn't want to get fucked.<eos> You want to get fucked?<eos> Whoa, man.<eos> You want to fuck my friend?<eos> Kenny.<eos> Kenny, come on.<eos> I want you to say you're sorry.
Aerosmith?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She lives here.<eos> It's... Stupid.<eos> Maybe.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Um, we're here to see Katharine.<eos> Katharine...<eos> Nowicki. Oh, okay.<eos> And you are?
Yes, I suppose I was.<eos> All of those things.<eos> Frightened, mostly, that's my abiding memory.<eos> - Of what?<eos> - Of being found out.<eos> Found wanting.<eos> Not for a moment.<eos> A Congratulatory First was yours for the asking.<eos> If I'd known one had but to ask...<eos> - And you're keeping well?
I'm... concerned... for her safety.<eos> She's... That is, we are living apart, have been for some time.<eos> I'm here and she's got the house in Summertown.<eos> She's become involved with this... type.<eos> Paul Marlock.<eos> He works at The Royal... Some bingo hall in Cobb Street, anyway.<eos> Now she wants a divorce.<eos> Right.<eos> But you've no real grounds to think she's in any... - I thought perhaps you... might be able to look into it, into this Marlock.<eos> You have the means, presumably.
Right.<eos> But you've no real grounds to think she's in any... - I thought perhaps you... might be able to look into it, into this Marlock.<eos> You have the means, presumably.<eos> I'm a police officer, not a private enquiry agent.<eos> If you want my advice, you'd... let it go.<eos> Let it go?<eos> Christ.<eos> You know, I can still recall your exact words, the first time you saw her.<eos> I can see it now. As clear as day.<eos> You came in, sat down just there and said...

As clear as day.<eos> You came in, sat down just there and said...<eos> "I've just seen an angel crossing Carfax."<eos> "This brown-eyed blonde, "with the reddest lips you ever saw."<eos> That last term, you were a thing... .. altogether pitiable.

The money ran out.<eos> I got a job.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - Just factory work.<eos> Machinist.<eos> Done all sorts since then.<eos> Waitress. I work in a florist's now.<eos> What about your boyfriend?<eos> What does he do?<eos> You ask a lot of questions.
What do you hear?<eos> That he leaned on someone a little too heavily.<eos> At least, that's the word around the canteen.<eos> The canteen?<eos> I wouldn't trust the spotted dick in that place, let alone anything else.<eos> Did you get anywhere with Marlock?<eos> He looks a thorough scoundrel.<eos> He is, but irresistible to the ladies, it would seem.<eos> I thought him eminently resistible.<eos> You're a police officer.

Just not a stupid one.<eos> While you were talking to him, I affected an interest with Dolores, who brought me my winnings.
You think he might have left it there?<eos> At the bank?<eos> - Would you recognise it?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's just a carbon pad, pick 'em up at any stationer's.<eos> Thank you. For believing me.<eos> I'm not sure that I do, altogether.<eos> - I'm not lying.<eos> - I'm not saying that you are.<eos> You think what you think, but... the Dr. Lorimer that I know wouldn't be capable of such a thing.
Well, you watch how you go, then.<eos> Getting mixed up in other people's affairs seldom ends happily for anyone.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Do you?<eos> I'm not the one currently suspended.<eos> Was it worth it, Bernie Waters?<eos> Bernie Waters is up to something.<eos> It wouldn't matter if he was or wasn't.<eos> Sam off to the army.<eos> This bullet you're carrying around.
Not that I can see it means anything.<eos> It means something.<eos> Clissold didn't want anyone else to read it.<eos> It's enciphered.<eos> - Can you read it?<eos> - Not without the key.<eos> Good luck.<eos> It's all Greek to me.<eos> He's sighted.<eos> It's a good job you're here.
Stick 'em behind your notebook, then nobody will know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> A tip my old guv'nor gave me.<eos> Sergeant Vimes.<eos> Cable Street.<eos> No pasaran.<eos> All right?<eos> Let's have that jacket buttoned up, then.<eos> Sir.<eos> You'd better look after this.
You knew all along?<eos> It was on his desk.<eos> I told you. I don't like liars.<eos> But I hate a grass!<eos> She will be all right.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - You're not the only one who took an oath.<eos> Bless you, doc. But I can't let you go.<eos> Let me?<eos> You do your job, I'll do mine.
You always had a weakness for the fairer sex.<eos> People don't change.<eos> It was nothing personal.<eos> I had to get back Clissold's pad.<eos> - You do see that?<eos> - So you had a man killed.<eos> Not a very nice man.<eos> Not one of us, Morse.<eos> If it had come out about my selling degrees... I had to think of the college.<eos> You were thinking of yourself.
Not one of us, Morse.<eos> If it had come out about my selling degrees... I had to think of the college.<eos> You were thinking of yourself.<eos> No.<eos> Actually, it was Nina.<eos> You've ruined her life.<eos> Dragged her down with you.<eos> I didn't have a life until I met Felix.<eos> I don't want one without him.<eos> You know what I was.
Nature's remedy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A good night's sleep.<eos> Good night.<eos> She'll be all right.<eos> I just wanted to get everyone out of here.<eos> Do I look stupid?<eos> - Put him down.<eos> - No!<eos> It's a good job you're here.
I mean, I'm glad.<eos> Me, too.<eos> It's probably best if I wait in...<eos> I think it's probably best if you just do as you're told.<eos> - What do they call you, then?<eos> - Morse.<eos> Morse.<eos> Thought I'd be all right with a copper.<eos> There are coppers and there are coppers.<eos> What sort are you?
- What do they call you, then?<eos> - Morse.<eos> Morse.<eos> Thought I'd be all right with a copper.<eos> There are coppers and there are coppers.<eos> What sort are you?<eos> The sort that sees young ladies safely home.<eos> I think this is the bit where I say,<eos> "Thanks for a lovely evening."<eos> And we have a long kiss under the porch light, until my dad taps on the window and then I go in and you go home.
Miss Thursday, where are you going?<eos> Like this?<eos> I have to.<eos> Well, where will you go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Stay.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Just give it time.<eos> Everything that happened, just give it a chance.<eos> You mean the world to them.

What are they like to work for - the Mortmaignes?<eos> They've been all right to me.<eos> What about...<eos> Craven, is it?<eos> The land agent.<eos> He's Yell's man.<eos> He's not really a land agent, they just call him that for... ..well, something to call him, really.<eos> Bosses me about mostly.<eos> - You don't like that?<eos> - Do you?
It was a lovely evening - a little run out.<eos> Run out? Where?<eos> Home... she said.<eos> Where was that? Specifically.<eos> Out at Wytham. Wytham Woods.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> If you were planning on sending throughout the kingdom to know whomsoever the shoe will fit.<eos> I saw you up at the house yesterday.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You're the police.
Could have been my Joan in that hospital bed.<eos> Strange found evidence at his hut.<eos> A pair of knickers with Sandra Jordan's initials written on the wash tag. A length of rope in his glove compartment.<eos> You could have had him!<eos> Clean and by the book.<eos> There are no bad men, Thursday, only bad officers.<eos> Hodges fell down the steps... ..on the way back to his cell.<eos> - Sir -<eos> - That'll be my report.<eos> There isn't a man in this station who will gainsay it but you need to rest and keep your checkups.
We'll want firearms too, if it comes back.<eos> I'll need to use your telephone.<eos> There's no chance this is all some ghastly mistake?<eos> We found her bag at Goggins' place, presumably soaked in this musk in an attempt to bring it back.<eos> All the same, how do you know that Georgie put it there?<eos> The rag was tied with red wool, the same red wool I saw her with when I first came here.<eos> Red wool, you say?<eos> Yes, why?<eos> You must come with me now, Lady Mortmaigne.<eos> I believe you know why.
No more should we fail them.<eos> What's happened?<eos> I heard a shot.<eos> Just stay close by me.<eos> Get back!<eos> Get back!<eos> Get back.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> Come on.<eos> - When it jumps, you run.

I thought I could win him over.<eos> I'd wait outside his house... ..visit him at the lab and then...<eos> You saw him with Ingrid Hjort.<eos> I think I could have taken even that. I mean, it was obvious what they were to one another.<eos> No.<eos> It was when I followed him to Goggins.<eos> Something snapped... when I saw that the tiger was still alive.<eos> You broke into the lab, took the tigress musk. Doused Lorenz's handkerchief with it.<eos> I thought the next time he went to Goggins' place... ..that Brutus would attack him.<eos> But the tiger broke free. There was no way you could control it.

There was no way you could control it.<eos> I just wanted him to see what it was like.<eos> Just for a moment. That fear.<eos> I never meant anyone should come to harm.<eos> I just meant to scare him.<eos> If he could have understood... ..then maybe he could have loved me.<eos> I'm not sorry about Hodges. Only that you stopped me.<eos> You're better than that.
It is a deadly mistake.<eos> - They will all worship him.<eos> As far as we know, he was a slave to the Kree.<eos> What better beginning for a god?<eos> They called him "Alveus." Do you know that word?<eos> It's Latin.<eos> It means "Hive,"<eos> which is fitting, because he's a parasite ... swarms, eats, moves from corpse to corpse.<eos> Well, that's one way to see it.<eos> You're not really a religious man, are you?
She didn't, there was another guest leaving as I got there.<eos> Can you describe this guest?<eos> Uh, a man.<eos> I didn't get a good look. My hands were full of greasy bags.<eos> Why were you so eager to drop off food in the middle of the night?<eos> Hanna called and I was happy to hear her voice.<eos> And she sounded a little tipsy, so I thought that maybe we could have little bit of fun.<eos> Talking.<eos> He means talking. We talked until the sun came up. Mm.<eos> Now were you drinking alcohol too?
You're about to question a suspect in the Freddie Lau murder.<eos> You don't mind if I watch as you interview them?<eos> No, I don't suppose I will.<eos> I never expected to find you still here, Harry.<eos> Forgive if I'm confused, but when we ran into you last night you were having quite the party.<eos> The Chinese attitude to grief is very different.<eos> Death is part of the wheel of rebirth, the way to enlightenment.<eos> So singing '80s classics is your expression of grief?<eos> Can I remind you my client has come here of her own free will to help with your inquiry?<eos> You're absolutely right and we're very grateful.

So, Miss Lau, being so close to your father, you would know about his dispute with Kevin Grey?<eos> - You do know Kevin Grey, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> He used to work for my father and now he works for me but I'm not aware of any dispute between them.<eos> In fact, it was my father who recommended Grey to me.<eos> We were told they'd fallen out over a stripper called Kayleigh Fenchurch.<eos> - What?<eos> - Her body was found the day before your dad died.<eos> We were told Kevin Grey dated her before she left him for your dad.<eos> Detective Clayton, I like to think you knew my father very well.
We're viewing CCTV footage but there's a lot of blind spots, so we have to concentrate on this...<eos> Detective Chohan.<eos> A word?<eos> I see you're doing Harry's paperwork for him.<eos> That's... dutiful of you.<eos> Well, to be frank, after what he did last night,<eos> I thought he could use a break. Yes, he did very well.<eos> Harry's a great man for a crisis.<eos> He's decisive, brave, heroic even.<eos> I mean, it's obvious why you admire him.
- Hi.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Is your daddy home?<eos> Who is it, darling?<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm looking for Harry Clayton.<eos> I've no idea where he is.<eos> Perhaps I can come inside and discuss it?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Who are you?
And I think you love me a bit back.<eos> Mainly cause you're not stupid.<eos> OK?<eos> OK.<eos> God!<eos> That was awful.<eos> Say, can I come in and get naked with you, please?<eos> What is it?<eos> Hello, dear.<eos> You must be Ben's mum.
And that is...?<eos> Twelve.<eos> - Now, it says here you are 34.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How many children do you have?<eos> - None. - But it says here you're 34.<eos> - Correct.<eos> - Are you sexually active?<eos> - Yeah. And how many children do you have?<eos> ! How often do you and your husband, um...?
In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage conquered the world and murdered my wife and child.<eos> I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time and stop his rise to power.<eos> Unfortunately, my plan is opposed by the body I'd sworn my allegiance to... the Time Masters.<eos> In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.<eos> Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> You need to learn to embrace your human side.<eos> And what if that side of me is gone?<eos> What if she doesn't exist anymore?<eos> No, this is a dictatorship.<eos> You get to call all the shots, and I get to take all the shots.
No, this is a dictatorship.<eos> You get to call all the shots, and I get to take all the shots.<eos> The most powerful evil the world has ever known has just gone Red at the height of the Cold War.<eos> Valentina Vostok?<eos> She's trying to build a Soviet Firestorm.<eos> Your comrade here tells me you know quite a bit about this project of mine.<eos> They're hanging us out to dry, Rip! I need backup!<eos> Half the team is gone.<eos> I'm gonna remember that, comrade.<eos> You and Dr. Vostok have much work to do in the morning.
I simply want to open it.<eos> Finish the formula, and these little games of ours can stop.<eos> You'll never trick me into giving up my research.<eos> And since you also cannot kill me and destroy any hope of creating a Soviet Firestorm,<eos> I would like a hot shower and a change of clothes.<eos> And I thought I gave a good speech.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Have we met?<eos> 11 years ago, you bought a nuclear warhead off me in Norway.<eos> And then you and your time-traveling friends tried to kill me.

I was obsessed by your culture...<eos> Rachmaninoff, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy.<eos> Stop stalling. It's a shame I-I never got to see it before the collapse.<eos> What sort of nonsense are you talking about?<eos> In 1991, your economy fails, and your empire crumbles.<eos> But the truth is the world is better off.<eos> In my time, crooks and thieves rule your country, desperate to hang on to power and the riches they divide amongst their cronies.<eos> My country is by no means perfect, but at least we are free to criticize our government, vote in fair elections, and love whom we choose.<eos> I, uh, hate to break this to you, Dr. Vostok.<eos> You are on the wrong side of history.

- I cut myself.<eos> - Impossible.<eos> You've been monitored ever since your arrival here.<eos> So, unless some...<eos> So, unless someone else was cut, yet it appears on your body...<eos> - That's preposterous.<eos> - No, no, no. You are somehow connected to the Burning Man.<eos> That's how you were able to absorb the nuclear energy at Luskavic.<eos> You are mistaken.<eos> No, You didn't only create Firestorm.

You are somehow connected to the Burning Man.<eos> That's how you were able to absorb the nuclear energy at Luskavic.<eos> You are mistaken.<eos> No, You didn't only create Firestorm.<eos> You are one half of Firestorm.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> Bring the core online.<eos> And to think, all this time..,<eos> - you were the missing link. - Listen to me.
We are here in the Vanuatu Archipelago, a cluster of volcanic islands in the Pacific, about 1,000 miles east of northern Australia.<eos> Below, the village of Endu on the island of Ambrym.<eos> A year ago, most of it was destroyed by a tropical storm of phenomenal force.<eos> But the village also has to endure to the periodic fallout of volcanic eruptions.<eos> Punctuated by catastrophes, time does not seem to have found a grip on the community.<eos> We met Chief Mael Moses, here with members of his large family.<eos> This is Clive Oppenheimer, a volcanologist from Cambridge University, who brought us to this place.<eos> Chief Mael Moses, you're the head of this beautiful village of Endu, just a few kilometers from the volcano crater.

Because you are foreigners to that spirit, the volcano.<eos> Once I dreamt about volcano, I saw people in that fire.<eos> People and women and men.<eos> They're cooking their food in there.<eos> So, it makes me believe that there is somebody who is... their spirits are there.<eos> The molten rock, is that part of the spirit?<eos> The lava expresses the anger of the devil who are living in that fire, volcano.<eos> Do the ancestors, then, live under the volcano?<eos> Yes, we believe that anybody who dies here goes to the volcano, and that volcano has become their village, where you can talk to them and they can talk to us.<eos> - Can you talk to the volcano?
The population at large has very limited contact with the outside world.<eos> There are no international phone lines or Internet available to the public, no radio or television from the outside world.<eos> To our eyes, it is strange to see people not glued to their cell phones.<eos> There is no advertising anywhere.<eos> Instead, just the ever-present propaganda.<eos> There are no newsstands, only the official party newspaper on display.<eos> In the subway, in the streets, almost everywhere, you'll find pictures of the leaders, always in the vicinity of the volcano.<eos> Back on the mountain, we spoke to a historian who was assigned to us.<eos> We asked him about the photos and the precise location of where they had been taken.<eos> He probably stood exactly at the place you are standing now.
So well behaved. Angels on earth is what we like to call them.<eos> Dorothy, slice of pie?<eos> I'd love one.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You already have a slice of pie... Uh-huh.<eos> I was just, uh, fixing my three babies some plates...<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Sure.<eos> Fruit salad.<eos> Pastor mentioned you're a computer at NASA.
Good morning, Your Honor.<eos> Hampton High School is a white school, Mrs. Jackson. Yes, Your Honor.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> Virginia, still a segregated state.<eos> Regardless of what the federal government says, regardless of what the Supreme Court says, our law is the law.<eos> Your Honor, if I may.<eos> I believe there are special circumstances to be considered.<eos> What would warrant a colored woman attending a white school?<eos> May I approach your bench, sir?<eos> Your Honor... you of all people should understand the importance of being first.
Unheard of.<eos> And before Alan Shepard sat on top of a rocket, no other American had ever touched space.<eos> And now, he will forever be remembered as the U.S. Navy man from New Hampshire, the first to touch the stars.<eos> And I, sir...<eos> I plan on being an engineer at NASA, but I can't do that without taking them classes at that all-white high school.<eos> And I can't change the color of my skin.<eos> Sol have no choice but to be the first.<eos> Which I can't do without you, sir.<eos> Your Honor... out of all the cases you're gonna hear today... which one is gonna matter 100 years from now?<eos> Which one is gonna make you the first?
Obviously, we know the launch spot. Thanks.<eos> A Pentagon briefing should illuminate where the Navy needs the recovery zone. Then we work backwards from there.<eos> And the rest is on us, so let's get to work.<eos> Uh, Mr. Stafford.<eos> What, Katherine?<eos> If I could attend the briefings, I'd be more useful to the project.<eos> Pentagon briefings are closed door.<eos> Yes, but if we don't have the information of the changes... we can't keep up.<eos> I need those changes as they occur.<eos> As you said, it's a pin head.
Pentagon briefings are not for civilians.<eos> It requires the highest clearance.<eos> I feel like I'm the best person to present my calculations...<eos> You're not gonna let this go, are you?<eos> No, I am not. And she is a woman.<eos> There is no protocol for a woman attending these meetings.<eos> Okay, I get that part, Paul.<eos> But within these walls, who makes the rules?<eos> You, sir.<eos> You are the boss.

The main thing is answering the phones and organizational stuff.<eos> General assisting.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've never had an assistant before.<eos> We will figure it out together.<eos> And you swear this is legit?<eos> 'Cause I seen Shawshank and I don't wanna go to Seg because I did your taxes too good.<eos> I guarantee you, you will never see anything with my social security number on it.<eos> Never say never.<eos> You work for MCC.
-But not euphemistically.<eos> She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.<eos> You've gotta understand.<eos> Institutional racism... traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.<eos> It makes someone like you... someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.<eos> All right, so now let me get this straight.<eos> Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor? -Is that right?<eos> -Basically... yes.<eos> I think her mother was a crack addict or something.<eos> You might as well be an alien.
Oh, my God.<eos> "The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.<eos> The New Orleans police put out a call to... -Hi!<eos> My name is Brook...<eos> -Look and I was wondering if--<eos> Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.<eos> -But spare me the setup, all right? -I don't have a setup.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.<eos> You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I wish you wouldn't. I look across from me and I don't see a monster.<eos> I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.<eos> Not everybody judges you.<eos> What if I told you it was kiddie porn?<eos> I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions. Wow!<eos> You will really say whatever it takes.<eos> Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn. Wanna see?<eos> No, I don't... I don't need... No.<eos> No need.<eos> Wait, all you did was have sex on the beach?
-Listen.<eos> -Hmm. -I...<eos> I feel like I need to apologize... -...for just being all, like, weird and stuff, you know, I just...<eos> - I dig your whole thing, you know.<eos> And I just, I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just, you know, I got all tongue-tied, and fan-girly and stuff.<eos> So I'd try to say words, but when they came out of my mouth, it just sound like...<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Relax, darlin'.<eos> Your friend has told me the whole story.<eos> She has got you covered.
You handled that situation like a total boss.<eos> Meant both literally and in that hip-kid lingo way.<eos> Jesus!<eos> He's not even a fucking waiter.<eos> - He's a busboy.<eos> -What?<eos> -No, just... you could've lost your job... or faced prosecution had inmates gone missing that day.<eos> I mean, you're concerned about... these jerks that hung you out to dry.<eos> You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.<eos> There you go, sir. Whenever you're ready.
You have stable income.<eos> Have you ran her credit?<eos> About that...<eos> Here we go.<eos> No, it's not bad or good.<eos> You have a credit score of zero.<eos> You've never owned a credit card or leased a car?<eos> No.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Uh... Well, you can open up a credit card account, take an advance of $1,000, pay it back tomorrow, and you're an excellent credit risk.

This is listed as his address.<eos> His mom is incarcerated, and we have no other family on record.<eos> Could I, uh...<eos> Not to sound harsh, but there's got to be somewhere else he can go.<eos> Eventually we'll find him a foster home, but that could take a while.<eos> And there's a lot of minorities in the state facility.<eos> Not sure how long he'll survive.<eos> Fuck no.<eos> He can stay here until we find another relative, any relative.<eos> Need you to sign and confirm that you're a legal adult, that this is a drug-free household, that you will maintain--
You think?<eos> _ With publication in 1949 of her seminal text,<eos> "The Second Sex," Simone de Beauvoir redefined the semiotics of femininity throughout the western world.<eos> What has not been explored is the relationship between her loss of faith and subsequent revolutionary views.<eos> Sister Lillian Marie Montreau was a nun at the convent school that de Beauvoir attended, and it was Montreau who helped Simone grapple with the theories that--<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Are you saying Montreau was a formative influence?<eos> Without taking credit away from de Beauvoir, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> And you've read the letters?
- Yes?<eos> Are you saying Montreau was a formative influence?<eos> Without taking credit away from de Beauvoir, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> And you've read the letters?<eos> We don't have any surviving correspondence between them, but I've done extensive research on their time--<eos> We-- we do have letters.<eos> I'd be aware.<eos> Discovered a few weeks ago by an estate trustee.<eos> We have them at Loyola.<eos> Judge for yourself, but I think they prove the opposite of what you're asserting.
I threw up in a toilet and bidet.<eos> Might be a new low. Ah, well, the paramedics weren't called, so it's better than your average night in my house growing up.<eos> I vaguely recall an extremely earnest conversation.<eos> Sorry if I was a bore.<eos> No, no, it wasn't boring.<eos> Um, actually--<eos> There's nothing like a bottle of wine and a couple martini chasers to get me talking nonsense.<eos> So, do me a favor... pretend it never happened, and we'll just put this weekend behind us, okay?<eos> I'll check us out.<eos> Do you and your mother need a taxi?
- Oh, please. Claire.<eos> I couldn't help noticing yesterday, I came in to pick up Caleb, and, um, he had big scratches on his face.<eos> I saw those, too, yeah.<eos> I just wanted to know what happened to him.<eos> Well, he said he fell in the woods.<eos> You let him go in the woods?<eos> No, no, no, we don't do that.<eos> Hmm. Well...<eos> He came to school with the scratches on his face.<eos> Technically, I see a child come in looking like that, I'm supposed to pick up the phone, but... I assumed you already knew about it.
She ain't gonna be my woman that much longer.<eos> She gonna be my wife.<eos> She's a fine, fine woman.<eos> I don't wanna see you losing her to some other man.<eos> I want him, but he'll hurt me.<eos> He'll leave again, I know it.<eos> I still love him.<eos> You killed my baby brother.<eos> We need repeaters, automatics.<eos> You think you know what's up on that mountain, but you don't know a goddamn thing.
Let's go.<eos> - They're gettin' away.<eos> - They're... they're gettin' away!<eos> Goddamn it, Hiram!<eos> - I just told you no more firing! - Let me go!<eos> I just said that!<eos> - Well, go after them!<eos> - I'm goin' after them, Hiram!<eos> I just said that I'm going after them!<eos> Hey, what kind of sheriff are you anyway?
Go time.<eos> It's Danvers.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> - Elena, please, calm down.<eos> - How do you know who I am?<eos> I promise, we mean you no harm.<eos> Then start talking.<eos> My name is Sasha Antonov.<eos> It's my son Alexei, you met my daughter Katia.<eos> Your human daughter, who knows what you are, what I am?
You have to listen to me.<eos> Yes, Inhumans are real.<eos> But that's barely scratching the surface, 'cause I've stood on alien soil, and I've jumped through a portal to get there.<eos> So if it's discovery that you want and the science behind it --<eos> It's both.<eos> It's all of it.<eos> Okay, well, I can give you that.<eos> But first I need your help.<eos> Okay?<eos> 'Cause you're the only one that can save my friend.
Yeah?<eos> Your hands are freezing.<eos> Are they?<eos> They're like little ice buckets, aren't they?<eos> Do you think you can brave it?<eos> I'll do my best to power through.<eos> We'll return in a moment.<eos> All right, then what about "Hellfire"?<eos> It's better than "Scorch," but I'm worried it's too much.<eos> You're a difficult man to find, doctor.

- and that he doesn't know yet.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> It's quite possible that you'll be compelled to testify tonight.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - My contacts in court assure me that the prosecution has a brand new witness, that could provide a definitive turning point in your case.<eos> No word yet on who he is, but they are transferring him to the courts, to give a deposition within the next three hours.<eos> I told the truth.<eos> There are gaps in your statement, Mr. Doria and I need details.<eos> The reliability of your testimony is based on the details.<eos> With them, I can convince the world that you're innocent.
But I need you to cooperate.<eos> The police has turned this place in a cell.<eos> They watch me 24 hours a day.<eos> Don't you think that if I had more to say, I would have told you already?<eos> They will request your immediate incarceration, Mr. Doria.<eos> We have 180 minutes to review everything from the beginning.<eos> So I would stop complaining and get down to business.<eos> Good.<eos> First things first.<eos> What were you and the victim doing in that hotel?
- You'll be confirming the police suspicions.<eos> They believe there's no one who would have any reason to do this to you.<eos> So your version<eos> - sounds like 'invention', Mr. Doria.<eos> - It's not my responsibility to find the guilty!<eos> - No.<eos> - It's Felix's and yours.<eos> And, of course, the police, who must catch the culprit.<eos> Not me.<eos> You... are the guilty.
And, of course, the police, who must catch the culprit.<eos> Not me.<eos> You... are the guilty.<eos> Mr. Doria, if you were in my place, and I describe your theory of the plot to you, what would you think?<eos> I'm describing what happened.<eos> I don't know what else is expected of me.<eos> You know?<eos> In the 30 years of my career, I have had to deal with two types of clients.<eos> Those who take responsibility and cooperate, although it would mean to go where they don't want to, and those who think are smarter than me and expect that I save them from a guilty sentence, without getting their hands dirty.<eos> You belong to the latter.
Don't worry... I'll get mine.<eos> Yeah, it's the starter.<eos> Probably, the motor sensor is blocked.<eos> If there's nothing else, only that it needs the unit to be reset.<eos> It looks like the rest is okay.<eos> If you wish, I can tow it to my house, and I'll fix it there.<eos> If you prefer I can call a truck and tell them where they can find you.<eos> How long would it take?<eos> - The tow truck?<eos> - No, you fixing the engine.
Successfully completed Money Transfer<eos> What are you telling me?<eos> Your mistress was an expert in banking IT system, as well as a photographer?<eos> Do you think that the jurors are stupid?<eos> She met her husband while working as a clerk at the bank.<eos> Information technology is making headway by giant leaps, you should know this better than anyone.<eos> Your mistress was keeping up, while she was a photographer?<eos> Perhaps she was helped by her husband.<eos> Maybe she told him the truth but didn't tell me to keep me out.<eos> You didn't know Laura.
She adjusted her seat before putting it into gear.<eos> She was not driving.<eos> She lied.<eos> The car is my sister's. She lent to me, and I'm not sure where...<eos> She lied... and nobody lies without a reason.<eos> She lied to protect herself.<eos> Or to protect you.<eos> Do you have a light?<eos> That woman was hiding something.<eos> And so are you.
I went back to tell the police, but they didn't believe me.<eos> That's when I realized the power you have.<eos> The power that makes a wolf stronger than it is.<eos> But I'm not afraid of wolves like you.<eos> When you live through the most horrible experience as a father, that they take away your son, that he disappears without anybody caring, fear no longer exists.<eos> There's nothing.<eos> Soon they'll find out that I am an intruder.<eos> So tell me the truth... where is my son?<eos> I assure you that you are confused.<eos> You were in that car with that woman whose name is not Raquel.
And I never heard from him again.<eos> OK.<eos> By now, we have all the pieces on the board.<eos> Two dead and two bodies.<eos> The murder of your mistress seems to be a direct consequence of Daniel Garrido's death.<eos> But, for the police, there is only one murder 'cause they only have just one body.<eos> Laura Vidal's.<eos> And their suspect is you.<eos> But, for us, and for Daniel Garrido's parents there is another body and another death, that of the missing boy.<eos> And the Garridos suspect that you and your lover are the culprits.

Tell me, what about if it wasn't just a deer?<eos> If Laura did not get him to believe that the incident was between us?<eos> I'm glad it was nothing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Maybe he saw something suspicious about our behaviour, and that he pretended to leave, and then hide.<eos> Sure, I understand your problem.<eos> You are trying to deflect your story from Daniel Garrido's death.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - The passerby driver is one who acts only for the money.<eos> And you think that if you hide behind that blackmailer, no one will think about the poor boy, and you'd look less guilty.
I'll ask you three questions.<eos> If you only responds to just one we will continue with his absurd theory of yours.<eos> One.<eos> What is the sense of the incriminating message that you received on your cellphone?<eos> I'll tell you everything.<eos> Two: why did the murderer not take the money if that was his purpose?<eos> And three: how could he get in and out of the room as if he were a ghost?<eos> Do you see?<eos> You're giving the prosecutor exactly what he wants.<eos> Stupid connections that will destroy the illusion that you're making a coherent account...
Adrian?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No, no!<eos> No!<eos> I don't know where.<eos> Really, it wasn't me!<eos> It wasn't me, I don't know where is'...<eos> A moment.<eos> Do you suspect Tomas Garrido was the one in the room?<eos> You don't agree?
Now, he works near Bierge, in the valley, 20 minutes from home.<eos> It was no accident that he chose a hotel so isolated.<eos> Tomas Garrido set up a trap for you.<eos> He must have sent the package to him, so that you mistakenly assembled the pieces of your puzzle, Making it so you'd doubt what actually happened' Because he knew that this way he would find the missing piece.<eos> Yes?<eos> I look forward to seeing you at the Hotel Bellavista.<eos> It makes no sense, he couldn't have known about the swamp.<eos> The area where you buried the lad is full of swampy lakes.<eos> And the locals know it.<eos> For Tomas Garrido, it was enough to toss a coin in the air and wait for you to pick it up.

For Tomas Garrido, it was enough to toss a coin in the air and wait for you to pick it up.<eos> And you did.<eos> - Is that what happened?<eos> - You gave yourself up, and, at the right time, you handed Laura over.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> I have a reservation.<eos> Room 715...<eos> That's how Tomas Garrido could get in the room without leaving any evidence.<eos> He just had to wait for you and Laura to get up to the room.
Confirmed?<eos> One hundred percent?<eos> OK. Thank you.<eos> Is it about the prosecution witness?<eos> We don't yet know the name, but we know who he is.<eos> The passerby driver.<eos> - It forces us to think fast.<eos> - It also means that I'm fucked.<eos> Not entirely, if you obey me.<eos> Suppose that you did not stay at the cottage with your lover the day of the incident.

It was also easy to discover that his wife worked at the hotel.<eos> And did you wait for me to tell you?<eos> To make sure that I could put my life in your hands, Ms. Goodman.<eos> Where did you put it?<eos> This is where I sunk it.<eos> I have to tell you something else.<eos> We thought he had died, I swear.<eos> Laura had taken things too far and there was no going back.<eos> If the police found the body the autopsy would give me away.<eos> I had to be sure that you would help me avoid it.

But... what if it wasn't you that broke the promise never to meet again, but rather Laura?<eos> Can I know what you did to cause the police to believe that Daniel has run away?<eos> Come in 4 hours at the bar,<eos> - in front of the scrap yard.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Don't be late.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Withdrawal of small amounts from the customers' accounts, shortly before disappearing.<eos> You also could have gotten a hold of the lad's things.
Someone knows something.<eos> She made you believe that the passerby driver had seen something.<eos> ...then why the fuck are you using the phone?<eos> That he had found her and was blackmailing her.<eos> It was her way of trying to compensate those poor people for their loss.<eos> She didn't have the courage to confess it all empty-handed.<eos> Once in the room, all she had to do is wait.<eos> Then she set in motion the second part of the plan.<eos> She wrote a text message on her cell phone as a protection measure.<eos> Laura knew you would refuse to confess.

You thought the SMS could be useful, And you looked for the elements on which to base your convoluted theory.<eos> Police!<eos> You look fine?<eos> Police!<eos> Good.<eos> Do you want to play?<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Why did Tomas Garrido and his wife have not spoken up?<eos> If Laura call them to tell the truth Why did they not tell the police?<eos> Those parents know you will never incriminated yourself and tell them where their son is buried. Without a body, it is very difficult to prove a murder, and that you're capable of anything just to remain free,
including blaming them for the death of your mistress.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Second window to the right of the penultimate floor.<eos> Look carefully, Mr. Doria.<eos> Tomas Garrido has stopped counting on the police for some time now.<eos> And, since then, he's been watching you planning take the law into his own hands.<eos> You assume things that you can not know.<eos> About Tomas Garrido I know more than you think.<eos> Why?<eos> - You're very smart, make an effort.
The prosecution has no witnesses.<eos> It was all my invention, which I shaped, gradually, with the details you gave me.<eos> - I tell her that this photo shows...<eos> - This picture's fake, Mr. Doria!<eos> And it's faked.<eos> It's a composite.<eos> You presume things you can not know.<eos> On Garrido I know more than you think.<eos> - Because'?<eos> - You're smart, make and effort.
But, not trusting in the justice system, what did they have left?<eos> Study the enemy and wait.<eos> That's how we met.<eos> In a theater group.<eos> If I get to judge with what you've told me, you'd be lost!<eos> Now you're in my hands.<eos> Adrian, are you there?<eos> Your phone's off.<eos> Everything is under control.<eos> And the Garridos suspect that you and you mistress are the culprits.
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> Deputy, it's time you and your alter ego, had a proper introduction.
We need Parrish.<eos> I'm going to go find him.<eos> Lydia, he's dangerous.<eos> He's still a shapeshifter. And one who's just beginning to understand his power.<eos> And I'm not?<eos> You're not the same.<eos> You access the supernatural. It works through you.<eos> But it doesn't control you.<eos> How would you know?<eos> Why do you care?
Text me when you find Parrish. Hold on.<eos> What is this?<eos> Something I've been working on for a while.<eos> Just make sure Malia gets it.<eos> Is it plan B?<eos> It was plan A.<eos> Plan A never works.<eos> This one will.<eos> Hayden?<eos> They said that you can help us when we get hurt.
- Hey, you can't go in there!<eos> - You lying to me now? Oh.<eos> Ah, come on.<eos> What's this?<eos> - I never seen that before.<eos> - It ain't mine.<eos> - Police brutality. - I'm gonna file a complaint.<eos> Well, you go ahead and you call your lawyer 'cause your boyfriend's going to jail<eos> - for possession again. - Get your hands off of him.<eos> You're in big trouble.
And I told him what kind of shitty kisses those were, but I told him well, without being unpleasant or anything, because at that moment, I didn't give it too much importance.<eos> So now, he shouldn't say I've fed it to him because when we were saying goodbye, he was already being weird.<eos> And okay, dump me because I supposedly cause you insecurity or because I don't get angry enough or whatever.<eos> Look, I don't know your story and honestly, I'm not the one to say but from what you're telling me, he's the one who's not sure about.<eos> In fact, he's being very clever and he's turning the tables.<eos> - But that doesn't make any sense.<eos> - There're people like this, trust me.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> What do you mean "pregnant"?<eos> You're the first one I tell.
- It seems so. I wish I had it.<eos> Do you remember when you went to camp with the catechism group? I couldn't go because I was in the hospital.<eos> You got your tonsils removed, right?<eos> I said that because I was embarrassed.<eos> You know what really happened?<eos> My mum's friend told her in front of me it wasn't normal I ate so much and I was so slim, that maybe I had a tapeworm.<eos> - You know what that is, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I was 9 and I had no fucking idea, so I asked my grandma and she said:<eos> "It's a super long worm that lives in your stomach and scoffs all you eat, and you can't gain weight".
- A disaster.<eos> You say that to me and I wallow in misery.<eos> - I'm not going to say it to him.<eos> - Well, I hope so.<eos> Well, I think it's worse to be called a pedestrian.<eos> Don't laugh.<eos> Let's see, who has called you a pedestrian?<eos> Hell, the other day,<eos> I was crossing the street and a police officer behind me said:<eos> "Hey, sir, you're a pedestrian, and as one, you have to cross at the pedestrian crossing".
I'm impressed.<eos> With most of you.<eos> It really speaks to your study habits and your commitment to your own education.<eos> Everyone else, see me for extra help.<eos> Ms. Fleming, um...<eos> I already told you, Lydia, I don't give extra credit for alternate equations based on your own theoretical findings.<eos> Well, okay then.<eos> Malia. Claws.<eos> Claws, Malia.<eos> Excuse me, who are you?
After the orderlies at Eichen House, pretty sure we can handle some nurses.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> There's somebody...<eos> I gotta go.<eos> thing over there that we were gonna... Oh!<eos> Mother of...<eos> Yes?<eos> Is it time for my medicine?<eos> We don't have your medicine.<eos> Are you Elias Stilinski?
Oh, this is your vehicle?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Sounds like a no.<eos> It's mine.<eos> Uh, my Jeep.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll move it.<eos> Once I get the keys.<eos> From my locker.<eos> After you leave.
This mother is a bride.<eos> Did you bring all of these back from New York?<eos> 'Yeah, I tried to grab everything' without running into my former boss.<eos> - You can get that.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - It's Jordan. He'll call back.<eos> - No, please, answer it.<eos> I mean, I feel guilty that I'm making you do all this when you have your own wedding......<eos> No, this is work.<eos> And you're doing this now.
I wouldn't want people to think you stole somebody's phone.<eos> Somebody whose mother is running against your mother.<eos> That would be awkward.<eos> I'm broke.<eos> I'm donating my eggs.<eos> This isn't going to hurt a bit.<eos> __<eos> You've been my rock.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're here to tell me if you'd feel safe should Charlotte DiLaurentis leave the hospital.
Previously on "Pretty Little Liars..."<eos> I have an eyewitness from The Two Crows Diner.<eos> You fit the description, and I'd like it if you come in for a line-up.
She feels terrible.<eos> Just don't say it's okay if it's not.<eos> - It's okay. - No, it's really not.<eos> Please.<eos> Will you just take a good look.<eos> I'm willing to pay for it.<eos> I just want you to take a good look and make sure that there's no real damage done.<eos> Yeah, I mean, this is, like, my first accident ever since I've been driving for, like, a year and a half and I just, I really wanna make sure that you take a good look and tell me that there's no real damage.<eos> "Cause, you know, insurance and everything' can get a little expensive...<eos> I mean, I know how much my car means to me and I'm sure you feel the same way, and...
Two letters, requiring urgent reply - Bishop Talbot and the bank manager.<eos> If you're not too busy.<eos> I'll give them my immediate attention.<eos> Ignatius.<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> Dress suiting a saint.<eos> It's an anagram.<eos> Hello?<eos> Of course it is.<eos> You're a genius, Mrs M!
I thought you might like some tea and one of my scones.<eos> How wonderful, Bridget.<eos> Shall I be mother...?<eos> I can manage.<eos> Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.<eos> But I....<eos> So, you see what this means, Father.<eos> Yes.<eos> Inspector Mallory's got the bit between the teeth, and he won't rest until he finds the negatives.<eos> Even if he can't make a murder charge stick you face ruin... ..and imprisonment.
Inspector Mallory's got the bit between the teeth, and he won't rest until he finds the negatives.<eos> Even if he can't make a murder charge stick you face ruin... ..and imprisonment.<eos> I'll kill myself first.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Because if Inspector Mallory finds the real killer, he'll call off the hunt.<eos> What can I do for you, Father?<eos> May I?<eos> I was wondering if you'd like prayers said for you husband's soul.<eos> Vivian didn't have a soul and he wasn't a Catholic.<eos> But you are.
Vivian didn't have a soul and he wasn't a Catholic.<eos> But you are.<eos> And you of all people should know that he may have been seeking God up to the moment of death.<eos> I assure you he'd have hated it.<eos> In which case, you have my blessing.<eos> He was your husband.<eos> He broke every one of our wedding vows - except for "till death do us part".<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> Sadly, no.<eos> But you did send the death threats.
A deputation?<eos> My Universal offer is still on the table.<eos> We want to be released from our contracts when the Demon Brides is finished.<eos> Both of you?<eos> I'm going with him.<eos> You think I'd want to stay here after everything that's happened?<eos> Consider yourself terminated.<eos> But you, Billy, you're special.<eos> Too damn good for Cardinal, but why should I let you go?<eos> Because you're not your husband.
I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> It's all in here, isn't it, Billy?<eos> The beautiful young innocent in thrall to the devil.<eos> The heroic young scribe who rescues her by killing the demon.<eos> "Henry flung the holy water in Lord Hellion's face<eos> "and it solidified like wax, suffocating his screams."<eos> If you're praying for his soul then you're wasting your time.<eos> 'I suppose you removed its partner when you took off the mask.'<eos> 'I don't understand.'<eos> You didn't kill Vivian.
You said you'd come with me.<eos> Only to escape my crime.<eos> I needed to get as far from here as possible.<eos> Lies!<eos> You wanted to be with me.<eos> I was grateful.<eos> That's all.<eos> I killed that devil for you.<eos> You killed him for yourself.<eos> And now you are the demon.
Oh, Father, I know how you like to keep things to yourself but I'm curious to know the secret that is fit for everyone else's ears but mine.<eos> Well, I shouldn't be surprised.<eos> The truth is...<eos> Father Brown helped Rex recover some...photographs.<eos> And you couldn't tell me that because...?<eos> Because we didn't want to disappoint you.<eos> Cos the other party involved was, I'm sorry to say... married.<eos> Not... Not Lana Turner. There have been rumours.<eos> My lips are sealed.<eos> And I know I can rely on you to be the soul of discretion, Mrs M - after all, you're not one to gossip.
Well, that's rather cold-blooded.<eos> You really don't know her that well at all, do you?<eos> Ms. Michaels is one of my most trusted agents.<eos> She knows better than anyone that I'm perfectly capable of watching you execute every person in this room, and I'll still never give you the Rubicon access codes.<eos> Hmm.<eos> It's right.<eos> It's why I left.<eos> Amanda Waller doesn't make decisions based on the value of human life.<eos> Pity. No!<eos> Well, Ms. Michaels, most trusted agent, looks like you now have 20 minutes.
I think you're getting your wedding traditions confused, but fine, I will let it go.<eos> Lucky for you, I have more important concerns.<eos> I maxed out the computer power in the lair again, and I was hoping maybe your mainframe might have better luck.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Me on a screensaver. Hmm.<eos> Whatever this surprise, it better be good.<eos> Oh, it will be.<eos> Well, that's not your typical nighttime suit.<eos> Well, you're the reason I'm wearing it.
Because I'm not in their gunsights because I'm police. I'm in their gunsights because I stopped working for them.<eos> You were working with Damien Darhk?<eos> He threatened Laurel, and the truth is I'm glad Darhk came after me and not her because if he'd done it, I'd-- you were protecting her just like you were protecting me.<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Is it possible to go blind from too many flashes?<eos> Take a little bit of a break just for a moment.<eos> I literally can't see a thing right now.<eos> I think the cure for that is champagne.<eos> Dr. Queen, I do believe you are right.
The security that we had onsite was killed.<eos> And then he walked in.<eos> Let the record reflect that the witness is pointing to the defendant.<eos> And why did the defendant walk into Oliver Queen's campaign office?<eos> He was the leader of the gunmen.<eos> He took myself, Thea Queen, and Felicity Smoak hostage.<eos> And while you were held hostage--<eos> Damien Darhk-- or whatever he calls himself-- was there calling the shots the entire time.<eos> Pass the witness.<eos> This, uh, holiday party, were you, uh... were you there as a guest?
Continue, Ms. Lance.<eos> What else did you do for the defendant?<eos> He wanted me to give him access to the SCPD computer network.<eos> I did it.<eos> He wanted me to give him the departmental patrol schedules.<eos> I did that.<eos> He wanted me to break in to a federal server farm to install a computer virus. And I did that.<eos> He wanted me to give him information on the City's leadership. And I... I did that.<eos> And 3 days later, the City leadership were all dead.<eos> You did all of these things for the defendant?
I literally just had a dream where you were the Green Arrow.<eos> This is happening?<eos> - You're the Green Arrow?<eos> ! - Yeah. I could have sworn it was Neal Adams in data processing.<eos> And this is the Arrowcave.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Actually, we call it the bunk--it's the bunker, but yeah.<eos> You're Laurel Lance, the ADA.<eos> I--I've seen you on TV before.<eos> And you're Captain Lance!
It doesn't get any better than this.<eos> I was never in it for that, not ever.<eos> I wanted to make a difference, be a part of that beacon of hope you speak of.<eos> So come back.<eos> Rejoin the team.<eos> I think I figured out another way.<eos> It was actually that insane bee lady who gave me the idea, ironically...<eos> To remake this company to use the technology that helped me walk again to make people's lives better, to make Palmer Tech into the beacon of hope.<eos> Our mutual friends in HIVE have abandoned our other mutual friend Mr. Darhk, but he reached out to me, told me about you.<eos> He said you were his ace in the hole.
I'll let you and your former opponent catch up.<eos> Well, thank you for coming out tonight, Mr. Queen.<eos> It's a very gracious gesture.<eos> I am always gonna have this city's best interests at heart.<eos> Well, let's hope the same can be said for your friends.<eos> Miss Lance, I am so pleased to meet you.<eos> I was very impressed by your handling of the Damien Darhk hearing.<eos> I was just getting warmed up.<eos> Well, my hope is that you'll be too busy to handle the trial.<eos> District Attorney Remz has taken on a new position as my deputy mayor, and I would like you to succeed him as D.A.
Oh, come on.<eos> Stop being so high-handed.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Mr. Merlyn, do you know what the Khushu idol is?<eos> Khushu is an old Arabic term for humbleness, suffice it to say, something I wouldn't associate with you.<eos> When the earliest homo magi forged these idols, they did so in the image of those whose powers they wished to channel, so attention to detail is essential.<eos> It's missing a piece.<eos> The Ribalvei stone.<eos> They must have hidden it someplace else.<eos> Find it, or Genesis is not what you and your daughter have to fear.
What you're feeling isn't darkness. It's a schism.<eos> You're at war with two sides of yourself.<eos> Hello.<eos> Mr. Queen, this is Thomas Kemp.<eos> I chair the city council.<eos> Yes, of course, councilman.<eos> What can I help you with?<eos> That impromptu speech you gave during the city's latest crisis got a lot of people's attention, and there's something I'd like to talk to you about.<eos> It's only an interim appointment.<eos> A proper election will be held in August, but given that you got 48% of the vote before as a write-in candidate, well, I think that's just a formality.
I'm not the man my daughter thinks, you know? Don't tell me.<eos> Tell her.<eos> I've tried.<eos> I tried explaining that there are two sides to me, the father and the hacker.<eos> She sees only the criminal.<eos> I mention this because you strike me as someone with experience leading a dual life.<eos> Any insights you'd care to share? Yeah.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> You leading a dual life is why you lost her.<eos> You sound like you're talking from some personal experience.
What a pan, what a grill.<eos> Oh no, I'm at Denny's.<eos> Hey, I'm a drug addict and it's midnight-- where's my breakfast?<eos> Help, he's only gonna eat the toast and put a cigarette out on me.<eos> Okay, Stewie, you booked the last commercial without even trying, so this one should be a piece of cake.<eos> Oh, I guess there are other people auditioning, too.<eos> Oh, is your child up for the cough syrup commercial, too?<eos> You'd have no way of knowing this, but the moms tend to dress up.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> And you'd have no way of knowing that my son is the Scooter's Peanut Butter Kid.
Yes, this is Peter Griffin.<eos> Yes, I did call you about the eight-piece lawn croquet set.<eos> Now, it says "weathered," just how weathered is it?<eos> Yeah, go ahead and send me a pic, that'd be very helpful.<eos> Sir, shoot me if you must, but it is imperative that I look at these pictures.<eos> The hell with this.<eos> I'm getting my money back if it's the last thing I do.<eos> Hey, here's the guys.<eos> Who are you and why are you here?<eos> I'm Carter Pewterschmidt, and I'm here because you stole my money!

It's the Great Father Pewterschmidt!<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> You are a great hero to us.

You do.<eos> Wow, this is awesome.<eos> I want in.<eos> And there's the splitting headache from wearing someone else's glasses.<eos> Okay, Chris, here's a room I haven't hit, yet.<eos> Here, follow my lead.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Why are you in my room?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> You died, and I'm here to take you to heaven.
Like an actual Amtrak train, this is dangerously out of control!<eos> That's legally defensible, by the way.<eos> On your screen is a list of actual rail disasters.<eos> ♪ A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now ♪<eos> Good morning, I'm Tom Tucker.<eos> Coming up, the secret to remaining upbeat after getting an elderly waitress.<eos> But we begin with breaking news from the Quahog Mall, where a local fat man was stuck overnight on a child's train.<eos> We now go live to the newest member of the Channel Five news team, Dallas Portland.<eos> Thanks, Tom. Yes, quite an ordeal for Quahog's Peter Griffin.<eos> So, Mr. Griffin, you were going around in circles for 12 hours.
Now, we are gonna have to redo the entire roof here, okay?<eos> The entire roof.<eos> Because the whole base layer was totally rotted out.<eos> So...<eos> I know you got hard out at the end of the summer, but with all these issues,<eos> I don't think I can guarantee the completion of the original timeline we discussed.<eos> I mean, like... this place is a mess.<eos> I think you're a mess.<eos> You heard me.<eos> I said you're a mess.

I have to get it to leave Luke alone.<eos> Your fiancé is lying in that room.<eos> I shouldn't have to tell you what to do.<eos> - You can't tell me what to do!<eos> - You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Answers are easy.<eos> Faith requires effort.<eos> - You knew about the exorcism before I even came to see you, because you were there.
I... I ate them butter cookies.<eos> You mean... These butter cookies?<eos> There was... There was a second package.<eos> Just so you know, Sheriff, we had some trouble at our construction site the other night.<eos> Two of our vehicles were heavily vandalized.<eos> Okay. Come in, file a report, and I'll get onto it.<eos> Oh, no, we'll handle it.<eos> You have other things to deal with.<eos> I know how overwhelmed you are.<eos> Think you're pretty smart.
You have other things to deal with.<eos> I know how overwhelmed you are.<eos> Think you're pretty smart.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're pretty smart.<eos> Went to college, got your education, sitting behind your desk.<eos> You think you know me.<eos> Well, yes, I do.<eos> You think you know what's up on that mountain, too. But let me tell you something.<eos> You don't know a goddamn thing.
Previously on 12 Monkeys...<eos> - She said I was Primary.<eos> - You are Primary.<eos> Things I see...<eos> Changes made in time.<eos> - Primary.<eos> - I see everything.<eos> We destroyed the virus.<eos> I apologize, Dr. Eckland.<eos> You were not part of my original reality.
We have to stop them and find out what they were up to.<eos> Could be his research.<eos> It might be their plan B for the virus.<eos> They might know something.<eos> Crawford lived decades before anyone understood the basics of RNA propagation.<eos> His work would have been useless to the Monkeys.<eos> Maybe he was ahead of his time, and they killed him before he got a chance to prove it.<eos> We should go.<eos> To 1944?<eos> You want to just travel back through time 100 years to a world at war where people were paranoid and archaic?

You need me to beg for mercy while you break my fingers?<eos> - That's not what...<eos> - How about electrocution?<eos> You could tie a wire around my one nut!<eos> Mr. Cole is in jeopardy, and so is Dr. Railly.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What did you do now?<eos> They're both stuck in the past.<eos> Their tethers are broken, and we have no way of bringing them back.<eos> We need you to go back to 1944, find them, and bring them home safely.

Because at the moment I'm lacking of a great many things, and options are among them.<eos> So, let me get this straight, you want me to place a classified ad in the paper?<eos> Do it every day, and we'll find it.<eos> Assuming, of course, that some aspect of causality still works.<eos> That's gonna help you snatch us back home, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's not convincing.<eos> It is a theory at the moment, but it's a good theory.<eos> Still not convincing.<eos> You're afraid about what I saw out there.
I need to see her.<eos> Fraulein Jones.<eos> Miss Goines, I've noticed you have taken an interest in what's happening out there.<eos> Kat, strange things are afoot at the Circle K.<eos> No...<eos> Sit.<eos> I prefer to stand.<eos> I'm not sure why I'm here other than the fact that Mr. Cole...<eos> - Otter Eyes.<eos> - Mr. Cole believes that you are special somehow, connected to time. And, well, these days I'm not.

And, well, these days I'm not.<eos> Do you know what caused these anomalies out there?
I don't think you have any say in that, darling.<eos> Doc?<eos> - Mr. Ramse helped us today.<eos> - Thank you. Don't... thank me.<eos> Don't thank you?<eos> You know what?<eos> You can go live in hell for all I care.<eos> Your mission caused all of this.<eos> Your mistakes.<eos> And you were one of them.
Oh hey, guy.<eos> Miss Goines. How are you?<eos> It's Don, we've met, like, a bunch of times.<eos> I-I just came here to check on...<eos> Suite 607, right?<eos> To see if anybody's home.<eos> Just like clockwork.<eos> I get it...<eos> I'm the same exact way as you, you know?<eos> You like structure. I like structure.
People getting executed in the hallways? Mr. Cole.<eos> Very little in my life consists of what I want.<eos> Mr. Deacon is an arrangement of necessity.<eos> The longer the mission takes, the more vulnerable this facility becomes to the dying world outside.<eos> Deacon being here makes the facility more vulnerable.<eos> From the inside and out.<eos> You think the Foreman's the only guy looking for him?<eos> He's dangerous.<eos> He's a savage.<eos> So were you when you first arrived here.
So I ran down the hallway as fast as I could to this window that opened up across the city.<eos> I expected to find the world in death.<eos> Chaos.<eos> Plague.<eos> But it wasn't there.<eos> The world lived.<eos> Imagine my great disappointment... in you!<eos> Dr. Railly's immersion is complete.<eos> Olivia was wounded.<eos> Which I'm sure you have witnessed.
Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Did you seriously just propose at my school?<eos> I did everything for you.<eos> Eat ! Eat!<eos> - Eat !<eos> Eat!<eos> Eat!<eos> You, sir, can eat! Eat !
Got a family emergency.<eos> Nightwing out.<eos> Your timing really sucks, Alfred.<eos> Well, your trip to the rainforest seems ill-timed, Mr. Wayne.<eos> With the world tech summit coming up...<eos> It's not for another week, Ms. Bannister.<eos> We're down here studying rare Herbs that could prove revolutionary for medical research.<eos> And earn millions for our pharmaceutical interests.<eos> All well and good.<eos> But why did you have to lead the team?
She would follow in her father's footsteps, enrolling at west point, but ultimately expelled.<eos> Something broke inside Kate.<eos> Two years later, Katherine emerged as Batwoman.<eos> She's impressive, but her methods make her a danger to this city. And to herself.<eos> It's time for me to decide if I'm going to take her under my wing...<eos> Or take her down.<eos> Poor Katey.<eos> It always begins with death.<eos> Doesn't it, Alfred?<eos> I'm as astonished as you are, Master Dick.
Well, Dad always wanted me to work with Bruce Wayne.<eos> I'm proud to be a part of your team.<eos> We can handle this on our own.<eos> Nightwing, Robin, back to Gotham.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You really should be resting.<eos> The summit's tomorrow.<eos> It's been a week, I'm fine.<eos> Like father, like son.<eos> All things considered, Master Bruce, you're in surprisingly good condition.
She treated you... treated us... Like we were machines that she could just program.<eos> That's all we were to her.<eos> After Bruce Wayne completes his hosting duties at the summit, we'll gather any leads we can to find her. Why wait?<eos> I'll call in Kate and Luke and then...<eos> No.<eos> You shouldn't have involved them in the first place.<eos> Batwing pretty much involved himself.<eos> And Batwoman?<eos> Did she force you to reveal our secrets?<eos> You weren't here, sir.
Time Master Declan, I...<eos> I thought the tribunal was re-convening.<eos> It's been cancelled.<eos> Lieutenant Coburn assumed full responsibility for the affair.<eos> The other Time Masters were moved by her argument.<eos> They've dismissed the charges?<eos> Once Lieutenant Coburn resigned.<eos> - Why would she do that?<eos> - It seems she believes in you.<eos> Now you must prove to yourself and all of us that you are indeed the man she believes you to be.
He connects to the Inhumans, and they instantly joined the hive.<eos> I have to get back to the base.<eos> They have something we need.<eos> Daisy showed me the Kree artifact you gave to her, and it's missing its companion piece.<eos> I buried it.<eos> What is it?<eos> The only thing that can destroy me.<eos> How do we disinfect Daisy?<eos> Meet Dr. Holden Radcliffe.<eos> You're the only one that can save my friend.
Sometimes, the world's greatest miracles happen by accident.<eos> The world I was born into was primitive.<eos> It has evolved at a remarkable pace while I was away.<eos> So, what happened back then, to get you kicked off of Earth?<eos> People saw the connection I had with other Inhumans, and that made them afraid.<eos> That fear bred paranoia, which led to civil war.<eos> Not much has changed, really.<eos> Only now we have the ability to re-create the Kree experiment.<eos> Are the patients ready, Dr. Radcliffe?<eos> Yes... not that you did us any favors with your alien-abduction story.
No, no.<eos> Well, yes, but it wasn't an intentional mistake.<eos> You see, the thing is, I need DNA from a living Kree to complete the genome sequence.<eos> The DNA you gave me... your blood... it's from a... dead host... a handsome but dead host.<eos> It's no good.<eos> I mean, it's great for you, but it... for this, it's no good.<eos> If this were true, why are you just telling me this now?<eos> Ohh, I wasn't sure.<eos> I was swept up in the moment! I wanted to change the world!<eos> And besides, you're very frightening.
712 Hamlet Court.<eos> I'm sorry, but I need you to speed.<eos> Stop the car.<eos> I take you all the way.<eos> I don't want you to take me all the way.<eos> See you in a little bit, honey.<eos> All right, let's get in the car.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're Daphne?
The world is grounded!<eos> Need anything else fixed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Someone to watch the kids this weekend.<eos> - What is this about?<eos> - Mnh-mnh!<eos> Mnh-mnh!<eos> - What is this about?<eos> - Mnh-mnh!<eos> You said you were gonna look for a job, Buck.
This one took her top off.<eos> The other two was poking my ass with a stick.<eos> I'm just trying to be a responsible uncle, man.<eos> Uncle Buck, there's a drawing of a naked lady in the bathroom.<eos> Yeah, there is.<eos> You need to study that, little man.<eos> I learned more in the toilet than I did in school.<eos> This place is awesome.<eos> This place is disgusting.<eos> Give me my phone or I'll tell my parents you brought us to filthy Cheers.
They just want noise.<eos> This negotiation is over!<eos> Oh!<eos> You can leave, it's over, raise up.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know where the door is.<eos> Jackie, I was just fitting' to call you.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - I had an emergency, 'cause I had to get my brother's kids.<eos> Oh, and so you brought them to a bar?
We both had a complicated weekend.<eos> Look, I know it's all hard to move back and your mother going back to work.<eos> Starting over sucks.<eos> But it does get better.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I should know.<eos> I started over a thousand times.<eos> And with Jackie kicking me out of the house, that's a thousand and one times.<eos> You should come live at our house and take care of us.
What now ?<eos> Calm down !<eos> Why are you testing your vegetable sexual fantasies on us ?<eos> "It is well for a man not to touch a woman."<eos> Get dressed.<eos> If I see your phone again I'll confiscate it.<eos> It's good for a man to touch a woman, but he should wear a condom.<eos> You're saying the Bible is lying ?<eos> I'm not interested in the Bible. This is biology.<eos> You're teaching rubbish.
Put a rubber on !<eos> The Bible says...<eos> I don't care. Get dressed !<eos> "Let a woman learn in silence with full submission.<eos> I permit no woman to have authority over a man.<eos> For Adam was formed first, then Eve.<eos> The woman was deceived and became a transgressor, yet is saved through childbearing."<eos> How can she do that if no man has touched her ?<eos> How can she do it if the man wears a condom ?<eos> You're teaching it but you don't have a clue !
Later.<eos> Venya !<eos> - Where do I put the bucket ?<eos> - Leave it there.<eos> I wanted to tell you...<eos> Veniamin...<eos> - I understand you perfectly.<eos> - What do you understand ?<eos> That you're protesting, that you disagree with the way you're being taught in school.<eos> - You're part of it.
- I understand you perfectly.<eos> - What do you understand ?<eos> That you're protesting, that you disagree with the way you're being taught in school.<eos> - You're part of it.<eos> - Not completely.<eos> I'm only a visitor here. My home is the Church.<eos> That's your problem. Can I go now ?<eos> Listen, Venya...<eos> The Church needs people like you.<eos> - You don't know what I'm like.
Listen, Venya...<eos> The Church needs people like you.<eos> - You don't know what I'm like.<eos> - I do, I can see it.<eos> You're the sort who lives for his faith.<eos> I don't live for my faith. I'll die for it.<eos> Golden words !<eos> But you don't have to die right away.<eos> There are many ways to serve God.<eos> You know that's not true.

I don't live for my faith. I'll die for it.<eos> Golden words !<eos> But you don't have to die right away.<eos> There are many ways to serve God.<eos> You know that's not true.<eos> You have a comfortable position, eh ?<eos> Other religions make fun of us because of that.<eos> Other religions have suicide bombers, martyrs, who give their lives for their faith.<eos> No Christian does anything like that today.<eos> It's because you don't read the Bible.
Thus speaks the Lord !<eos> "Heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool !<eos> The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as ransom for the many."<eos> That's what we pray for in our churches.<eos> The Lord says:<eos> "When you pray, be not like the hypocrites, who love to pray in the synagogues that they may be seen.<eos> Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.<eos> But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father in secret.<eos> And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you."<eos> I don't know what you're praying for or preaching.
Woe to you who are full for you'll be hungry."<eos> Veniamin, that's enough.<eos> Why are you laughing ?<eos> "Woe to you who laugh now, for you will weep."<eos> I see, but how is all this related to industrialization ?<eos> - It's directly related.<eos> - This is a sermon.<eos> I was explaining why there's no need for industrialization.<eos> It is needed. it's a historical fact.<eos> You are just an old and fallen woman.
singers, writers, actors..."<eos> Father...<eos> Saint John of Kronstadt wrote that years ago.<eos> Times are hard so it's important for every human being who has that talent to spread the word of God.<eos> And to stay in the fold.<eos> Venya, you know the parable about the servant who hid his talent in the earth.<eos> And you know how it ends.<eos> You too have a talent.<eos> And God doesn't want you to hide it.<eos> Father... you've just mentioned his talent.
I could face everyone else if I knew that you'd forgiven me first.<eos> Sidney!<eos> You wouldn't be up for a pint, would you?<eos> By the look of you, you're about ready for a top-up.<eos> I'm gonna kill him!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Please, Mr Redmond!<eos> Please.<eos> - You knew where he was.
Braver than you know.<eos> In most things.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry. I'm trying.<eos> I really am.<eos> We were at home. We were in bed together.<eos> They've been harbouring him.<eos> Did you know that? The Church.<eos> No-one's been harbouring anyone.<eos> You might forgive the debtor his debts but we can't.<eos> You were the only one who knew Sam was back.
I thought you were wonderful.<eos> What happened to that girl?<eos> She's here.<eos> She's right here next to me.<eos> We were parents once.<eos> Harding was a father.<eos> I was a mother.<eos> Sometimes I wonder, what does that make us now?<eos> What time did he get home?<eos> See, I think you know what time, Agatha.
I just...<eos> How could he do that?<eos> There are days I feel like giving up.<eos> Please don't say that.<eos> - I've tried my best.<eos> - Of course you have.<eos> No-one needs you to be perfect.<eos> Or have all the answers.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know that. - They just need you to be here.
What d'you fancy?<eos> Knee-trembler's only a shilling.<eos> That's very kind, but I've just had my lunch, so...<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> I believe I have some damning information - which may well result in an arrest.<eos> - Course you do.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> I just want peace!<eos> This won't bring it. Where does it stop?<eos> If he dies, do you have to die?
I didn't help her.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Leonard.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> You've had time to mull over our little tete-a-tete, I hope?<eos> - Cutting out the dead wood?<eos> - Replacing it with fine new foliage.<eos> - What do you say?<eos> I say no.<eos> You won't be removing Sidney from the diocese because you'll no longer be here.

You won't be removing Sidney from the diocese because you'll no longer be here.<eos> And you'll no longer be here because you will be hanging your head in shame in a court dock.<eos> Accessory after the fact, they call it.<eos> You paid for Sam Milburn's shelter.<eos> I got the receipts from his landlady.<eos> I was keeping an eye on him.<eos> Did you know a 14-year-old girl was living there?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I...<eos> You're many things, Archdeacon, but you're not a very good liar.
- to say about this. Yes.<eos> I knew you were going to say that.<eos> He did.<eos> He said you'd say that.<eos> The Bishop knows.<eos> I've already told him.<eos> - Now...<eos> - No, wait. Let me finish.<eos> It's not Sidney who's the dead wood.<eos> You're rotten to the core.
Maybe if you had a name?<eos> Robbie.<eos> He never got off that ferry.<eos> Michael Thompson and Robbie Morton both have the same tattoo.<eos> They are connected.<eos> You're seeing something that isn't there.
They are connected.<eos> You're seeing something that isn't there.<eos> Michael Maguire's here on witness protection.<eos> Arthur McCall, that's who Michael Thompson was testifying against.<eos> He is no longer a client I want to represent.<eos> Neither is he a client I can afford to offend.<eos> Asha Israni.<eos> Michael Thompson's dedicated handler.<eos> It's about how men are with women.<eos> He said I was a message... you couldn't ignore.
- Yeah.<eos> Because two people have died and one of my officers, DS Macintosh, was attacked, to protect you, Phyllis.<eos> I couldn't live with myself if that were the case, I really couldn't.<eos> Yeah, you'd be surprised what people can live with.<eos> Now... ..Sarwar will have covered his tracks.<eos> He'll have hid behind Arthur McCall and I doubt any of this is going to lead directly to him.<eos> I'm going to need more.<eos> I don't know what else I can give you.<eos> I really don't know what else I can do.<eos> You know, I think you've got a wee bit of a crush on me, Perez, hm?
So, what's this about Michael?<eos> You arrest the bastard that did it?<eos> No need.<eos> He turned up dead in one of our fishing nets.<eos> Funnily enough, he's an old pal of yours, Eddie Kerr.<eos> You're joining up dots that aren't there, Perez.<eos> I know.<eos> You'd never do something so...obvious, would you?<eos> Like ordering the rape of a young DS.<eos> I mean, you're stupid, but are you that stupid?
Because that would be suicidal, wouldn't it?<eos> Trying to intimidate us like that?<eos> Because then you'd have every cop in Scotland after your blood.<eos> And that's why I don't think you'd anything to do with it.<eos> Calvin Sarwar.<eos> It was him that ordered the hit on Michael.<eos> And the attack on my DS.<eos> He's been systematically setting you up.<eos> He's got a fiscal in his pocket.<eos> Yet you still ended up in the jail.
A bomb at Jokkmokk?<eos> When was that?<eos> What happened? - Someone called.<eos> He found a bob at the dam in Jokkmokk. What?<eos> - So all the personnel are there or on their way.<eos> How far is that?<eos> - Several hours.<eos> But we're maybe just 10 minutes away from Eddie's house.<eos> I think we should go to Eddie's. - Ok.<eos> Who are you?
I did kiss a girl once.<eos> I didn't think that made me a...<eos> - You know.<eos> - A lesbian?<eos> What? It's not a bad word.<eos> Well, it is around here.<eos> Well, good thing I'm not from around here.<eos> Uh, Nurse Lance, may I have a word with you, please?<eos> Well, now I see what's been going on.<eos> While I've been busy working, you were busy seducing that young woman.
This poor young woman will have to remain in the sexually repressive 1950s long after you've returned to a timeship and disappeared from her life forever.<eos> You know what, Doc?<eos> I would love for someone to drop into my life and tell me that the future's gonna be a better place.<eos> Get to Hall H!<eos> Your husband must be a fool to leave a woman such as yourself alone at a party.<eos> He doesn't seem like your type.<eos> That's a rather interesting thing to say. You hardly know me.<eos> And yet I feel like I do.<eos> Let me ask you a question, Kendra.<eos> Do you believe in past lives?
Then he'll kill you.<eos> Thank you for the vote of confidence, but I don't need your protection.<eos> There's no reason to go alone.<eos> We're part of a team for a reason.<eos> Yes, and the team seems comfortable with me doing this, so that makes it about you and me.<eos> - Any updates?<eos> - We're making progress.<eos> In the meantime, we need to get ready to back Kendra up.<eos> She's going into the asylum to meet Savage tonight.<eos> Another opportunity for you to see Nurse Carlisle.
No.<eos> My husband thinks it's baloney.<eos> Oh, is that so?<eos> Well, my specialty is interpreting dreams.<eos> What do you dream, Kendra?<eos> To be honest, I've dreamt of you before... and me... together.<eos> Well, that's interesting.<eos> And what do we do in those dreams?<eos> I'm afraid you'll think me forward.<eos> Oh, but you are forward.
Stud poker.<eos> I won 90 quid.<eos> Davy shouldn't really have been in Aberdeen.<eos> I didn't mention it before because I didn't want to incriminate him.<eos> You're seeing something that isn't there.<eos> I've got a witness that places you near the connecting door to the car deck in the middle of the night.<eos> Is he seeing things?<eos> Your alibi doesnae add up.<eos> But then, I suppose it doesn't have to, does it?<eos> Just buys you time... ..and by the time I've unpicked it, you're off on the first flight to Glasgow.
Looks like it's going to be a rather bumpy ride.<eos> Come on, let's go and find the Champagne.<eos> PILOT: 'Ladies and gentlemen, as we start our descent into Glasgow, 'please make sure your seat backs and tray tables 'are in their full upright position.<eos> 'Make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened and all carry-on luggage 'is stowed underneath the seat in front of you 'or in the overhead bins.'<eos> Assistant Chief Constable Henry Grimes, head of the Organised Crime Group Task Force, and Chief Super Mike Gillan, head of the Witness Protection Programme, and DS Asha Israni. "Iss-rani"?<eos> - "Ish-rani."<eos> - Israni. Michael Thompson's dedicated handler.<eos> This is not an enquiry into the mistakes that have been made.<eos> It is a salvage operation to see how best to move forward.<eos> DI Perez, you are investigating the murders of Michael Thompson,
Assistant Chief Constable Henry Grimes, head of the Organised Crime Group Task Force, and Chief Super Mike Gillan, head of the Witness Protection Programme, and DS Asha Israni. "Iss-rani"?<eos> - "Ish-rani."<eos> - Israni. Michael Thompson's dedicated handler.<eos> This is not an enquiry into the mistakes that have been made.<eos> It is a salvage operation to see how best to move forward.<eos> DI Perez, you are investigating the murders of Michael Thompson,<eos> - Robbie Morton and... the shooting of...<eos> - Leanne Randall.<eos> ...Leanne Randall. Exactly.<eos> All of which you believe to be connected.
And you never mentioned the incident on the ferry with him - and Robbie Morton?<eos> - Not when it happened.<eos> - But later, yes.<eos> - And your first response to that was to provide him with a fake alibi and lodge a bogus complaint against me?<eos> We needed to keep him safe until McCall's trial.<eos> We would have handed him back to you, soon as he testified, if he'd been guilty of any crime.<eos> Do you think he killed Robbie Morton?<eos> He was not that stupid.<eos> Do you think he was in contact with anyone from his past?<eos> DI Perez, as with a marriage, does your wife know what you're doing and thinking every moment of every day?
Do you think he was in contact with anyone from his past?<eos> DI Perez, as with a marriage, does your wife know what you're doing and thinking every moment of every day?<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> - No.<eos> - We found it in Michael's flat.<eos> It was the only personal effect we found so it must've meant something to him.<eos> He didn't really talk about his family.<eos> How do you feel about all this?<eos> I mean, you persuade somebody to leave behind their friends and their family and their loved ones and to cut all ties with their past and to trust you, completely.<eos> You take their life in your hands.
She doesnae like her boss, though.<eos> Tommy's moving-in present for us.<eos> Right, Michael Thompson - surveillance reports, transcripts of intercepted phone calls.<eos> I need you to start going through all of this - associates, friends, family.<eos> Anyone he might have got in contact with after he went into witness protection or someone who found out that he was on Shetland.<eos> Cos if Arthur McCall ordered Michael's death, then how did he know where to find him?<eos> Was it an internal leak or did Michael give himself away?<eos> Now, see if you can make that link and we've got a chance of nailing Arthur.<eos> - OK.<eos> Where are you going?
This foot chase led to a confrontation in Prince's Court.<eos> We need you to tell us all about this confrontation.<eos> Once in Prince's Court, almost immediately, the suspect realised he was cornered.<eos> The suspect turned his weapon on us and fired.<eos> We returned fire. Shots struck the suspect in the head and proved instantly fatal.<eos> We've received written statements from yourself and the other AFOs on your team.<eos> Said statements agree you all entered Prince's Court together.<eos> Correct.<eos> See, the thing is, we've got a statement off of an eyewitness on Prince's Road.<eos> Says that you entered that rough ground at least 30 seconds before the rest of your team.
WALDRON: We don't shoot to wound.<eos> We shoot to neutralise the lethal threat.<eos> You were the only APO to strike the target.<eos> - Yes, that's what happened.<eos> - Listen to me, son. We weren't born yesterday.<eos> You shot that fella in cold blood while your wee mates stood by and watched.<eos> I shot first, the others fired a fraction later, by which time the suspect had collapsed and they missed.<eos> You saw all that in a fraction of a second?<eos> I've never been to this building before.<eos> You saw me walk into this interview room and sit down in a matter of a few seconds.
ARNOTT: We know it's not easy, being confined to desk duty.<eos> COTTAN: Particularly if you're the only one who didn't fire.<eos> Well, I didn't choke, if that's what you mean.<eos> No-one said you choked.<eos> Yeah, well, you're AC-l2, you're always looking for an angle.<eos> We appreciate there's trust issues.<eos> No-one wants to seem like they're telling tales.<eos> But no-one wants to let a bent copper off the hook, either.<eos> But we've read your record.<eos> You're an honest copper.
Well, you hope you know what to do in them situations, until it comes to it.<eos> Image 297.<eos> A ballistic simulation of the bullet's trajectory.<eos> It appears the fatal shot was fired in a position close to Sergeant Waldron's chest and aimed upwards.<eos> - That how it happened, Constable?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Now, forensics detected firearms residue on your hands, Victor Charlie 54, and the hands of your mates, Victor Charlie 52 and 53, so... that would all seem to fit.<eos> Well, case closed.<eos> We can all knock off early.<eos> There is an alternative explanation as to why you had your hands on that gun.
Victor Charlie 54.<eos> I didn't even know that Danny had drawn his gun and the next minute, Harry's wrestling him for the gun and he's shouting, "Danny, no!" And he's calling for me and Rod to help him!<eos> The three of us ended up fighting over the gun.<eos> We did everything we could to try and stop him, we just couldn't.<eos> - Did he make any kind of statement?<eos> - He tried to say something.<eos> What did he say?<eos> I couldn't make it out, sir.<eos> Now, Daniel Waldron, as you know, was involved in the shooting of a suspect during Operation Damson.<eos> You and Victor Charlie 52 and 53 were on his team and witnessed what really happened.

Once.<eos> I was very vulnerable.<eos> Following my mum's death.<eos> And, eh... he seemed like the only person in the world who understood... what I was going through.<eos> Sorry.<eos> And, as a police officer, what conclusion did you draw from that regarding Steve Arnott's relationship with you?<eos> That, as sexual relations are forbidden, he couldn't be undercover or investigating me any more.<eos> How many times was Steve Arnott in your house?<eos> - I'd say a dozen.<eos> - But you were always there at the same time, weren't you?
- No, she's not. ...but they said I need to make an appointment for a pee test.<eos> A pee test and a reservation in hell.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> He's opposed to abortion.<eos> I'm pretty sure that's on record.<eos> Can we do it today? Like, right now?<eos> Your mother would weep if she heard you say that.<eos> Can you make him leave?<eos> If I leave, I'm gonna go talk to the baby daddy.<eos> - You're not the father?
- We are aware.<eos> - Hand-delivered by a D.O.D. official. - It's not hackable.<eos> You won't be ... - We are aware.<eos> I'm sorry. The answer is no.<eos> I'm asking you for one Missile Launch Kill Code, General.<eos> Violating chain of command.<eos> "Chain of command." Chain of command's gonna take two weeks.<eos> You like to cut red tape. I get it.<eos> But procedures are in place for a reason.<eos> You'd say the same thing.
Radcliffe ...<eos> Dr. Holden Radcliffe.<eos> And I really can't apologize enough - for what's happened to those people.<eos> - No.<eos> You really can't.<eos> But I'm also a victim here.<eos> I was forced to develop that formula.<eos> - You better do right by those people.<eos> - I can tell by your mustache that you're a man of importance and not to be trifled with, so I will be absolutely honest with you ... the process is irreversible.<eos> And I can tell by your beady little eyes that you're a worm.
I suppose you know people involved in this trouble. No, why should I?<eos> - It's a small place. - I don't know anything about it.<eos> You're Irish.<eos> I am, but like you, I'm a subject of the British king.<eos> And where are your people from?<eos> My family are from Cork, Mrs Hammond. And what does your father do?<eos> He has a shop.<eos> - How quaint. - A tailor.<eos> Mine's a Sea Lord. He's at the Admiralty.<eos> And what do you do, Mrs Hammond?
Three months gone, he reckoned. It's funny,<eos> I took you for an adventuress, not a cheap whore.<eos> You're not the first, Miss Lacy. Is that so?<eos> When Charles was in East Africa, he grew close to a native, Mie-Mie or LaLa or some such.<eos> He didn't try to hide it from me.<eos> He told me about her.<eos> I forbore, knowing that he would grow tired of her, and he did.<eos> At the end of his posting, he returned to London and to me without so much as a backward glance, and there have been others, too.<eos> Bits of local colour and I doubt whether I, let alone he, could remember any of them.<eos> But you are the first to try a trick like this.

Getting yourself pregnant.<eos> Oh, I didn't get myself pregnant.<eos> Your husband got me pregnant.<eos> See, Miss Lacy, Charles and I were unable to have children.<eos> A top Harley Street practitioner found that the fault lies with the seed, not the soil.<eos> So I come to the conclusion that you must have taken other lovers.

You know that he left you a message.<eos> You know that in that moment, he called you...<eos> To tell me to tell them!<eos> Michael was negotiating to take you with him.<eos> He wanted a future with you.<eos> What future?<eos> - Take me where?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I'm not supposed to know that.<eos> But I thought you should.
Alec Ramsay, I'm charging you with being concerned in the sale or supply of controlled drugs.<eos> Drugs? My arse!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We have a warrant to search these premises for evidence.<eos> Oh, that gobshite Craig Cooper.<eos> He'd say anything to save his own skin!<eos> Yeah, he told me he owed you money.<eos> Aye, he did, but not for drugs.<eos> Little shite had a gambling habit like an itchy rash, ask anyone.<eos> He also told me that you sold the debt on.
So why are you here?<eos> You overestimate my client's subtlety.<eos> I'm here because he sent me to deliver a message.<eos> OK.<eos> Well, I've got the message.<eos> You'll forgive me if I feel free to ignore it.<eos> Your choice, of course.<eos> Is that it?<eos> All the way to Shetland just for this?<eos> Doesn't that just make you a very, very expensive errand boy?
HE thought it was the gun, we all thought it was the gun, but it can't have been, and Forensics have just confirmed it.<eos> - So, it was a bloody fishing rod!<eos> - Yes. What about the woman who saw a man dumping the car?<eos> Yeah, that was him.<eos> My guess would be that once he realised he'd missed the boat, he went back to the car and put the gun in there, that made it somebody else's problem.<eos> But, Rhona, the thing is, that means he's still on the island now,<eos> - if we can get to him before Arthur McCall...<eos> - But where is he?<eos> Boss, we had a burglary reported yesterday - a farm near Whiteness.<eos> So, when you came out, you checked every building and there was no sign?
It's Tosh!<eos> She just walked into a police station in Cambuslang.<eos> She's fine, Jimmy.<eos> She's fine, OK?<eos> Right.<eos> Apparently, they put a hood over her head, drove her to the edge of the city and left her to walk back without her shoes.<eos> Other than that, she's not been hurt.<eos> OK?<eos> OK.<eos> She wanted to wait on a doctor till you got here.
OK.<eos> She wanted to wait on a doctor till you got here.<eos> Right, well, then, let's get you seen to, then?<eos> Right.<eos> You got any preference as to AE departments?<eos> No.<eos> No, I mean no, not a hospital.<eos> Sandyford.<eos> The SARC.<eos> He said I was a message you couldn't ignore.
OK.<eos> Thanks, Billy.<eos> Sandy, you making any progress with Michael Thompson's file?<eos> Still ploughing through!<eos> Tosh?<eos> Tosh!<eos> I couldn't find a record of Michael Thompson ever having worked at Level Nine, but look who ran their door security.<eos> Do you know a man called Arthur McCall?<eos> Should I?<eos> He had a stake in a club called Level Nine and you used to work there.

- Canada.<eos> Montreal.<eos> - Montreal?<eos> For a man who hated maple syrup and snow?<eos> Did Michael speak French?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't.<eos> Well, maybe he thought you could learn.<eos> My God, the arrogance!<eos> He didn't take it for granted that you'd say yes.
I showed up at his doorstep and made nice, but he's not talking to anyone.<eos> So we start from scratch... a new investigation, no bias.<eos> We look at everyone... anyone who might have held a grudge or had something to gain from Edith's death.<eos> Whoever did it tried to make it look like a robbery.<eos> She'd been strangled, signs of a break-in, jewelry stolen.<eos> Can we get in to examine the crime scene?<eos> As of now, Edith's house and all of her assets belong to Jeffrey.<eos> Shall we ask our new client for a tour?<eos> That's where they found her, lying at the bottom of the stairs strangled with one of her own scarves.<eos> Jeffrey, you don't have to be here for this
He didn't threaten her.<eos> He said, "If you choose Jeffrey over me, you'll regret it."<eos> - That's a threat.<eos> - They had an argument.<eos> Payton said some thing he shouldn't have, and he left.<eos> We were supposed to go to the opera that night with friends, but Edith was so upset she decided not to go.<eos> - And when I came back...<eos> - Edith was dead.<eos> The police found signs of a break-in... a broken window, and Edith's jewelry was gone.<eos> And you think Payton did it.
And Rebecca was right.<eos> Jeffrey didn't do it.<eos> Payton.<eos> Is that your car?<eos> May I ask you a few questions?<eos> Well, you haven't answered mine yet.<eos> Yes, it's my car.<eos> Well, can you move it, please?<eos> Payton, I know about your relationship with Tracy Lassin, which compromises your alibi for the night of the murder.<eos> - What are you, a cop?
Hello?<eos> Alice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I saw your car out front.<eos> I thought you might be Payton.<eos> The police asked us to help find him.<eos> I thought if I searched his room...<eos> Did you find anything?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I should come back later if you and Rebecca are...
Agent Dao.<eos> I come in peace.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Now, please, go in peace.<eos> I'm here to apologize.<eos> After talking with my supervisor...<eos> "Being reprimanded" by your supervisor.<eos> You are no longer a suspect in this investigation.<eos> According to Max, I was never a suspect in this investigation.<eos> You were a lead, Ms. Vaughan.

The Larágan Consulate Building.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> _<eos> - ♪ Light up that old flame ♪<eos> - Agent Dao. Ms. Anderson.<eos> What brings you here?<eos> Work, unfortunately.<eos> Alice was supposed to meet a suspect, and I didn't want her going alone, so I showed up, and the guy cancelled.<eos> And yet you stayed.
She's inviting people in, meeting with local entrepreneurs about investment opportunities, opening herself up in a way that will allow us to monitor her calls, her texts, her movements, so that we can catch Christopher in the act...<eos> That is, if you're okay working on this together.<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> How does your partner feel about working with the FBI on this one?<eos> She doesn't know, and I'd rather she didn't find out.<eos> She does not approve.<eos> She thinks Christopher's taken too much from me already.<eos> She's not wrong.<eos> Perhaps you should let me take it from here.<eos> No offense, but you've been after him for two years on your own.
Speaking of which...<eos> They're here.<eos> Copy.<eos> I see them.<eos> Where's the man in charge?<eos> Money first.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Where's Phillip Thompson?<eos> I'm here on Mr. Thompson's behalf.<eos> And you are...
What's the black dot?<eos> When you see a black dot in the palm of someone's hand, it means, "I need help, and it's too dangerous for me to ask for it."<eos> But this is different.<eos> Karen's telling him that it's safe.<eos> It's like she's saying,<eos> "Look for the woman with the blue dot."<eos> Karen set this whole thing up.<eos> Is there news?<eos> Did you find Joey?<eos> I think you know the answer to that.
How does remyelination mediate neuroprotection?<eos> Exactly?<eos> That is an excellent question.<eos> Hold on to your boots.<eos> Princess, what are you doing down here, alone by yourself?<eos> I will call for your bodymen and your car right away.<eos> That won't be necessary, Qasim.<eos> Michael's hired a car.<eos> Using one of my fancy new credit cards.<eos> There's plenty of room, Qasim, if you and your boys want to join us.
That won't be necessary, Qasim.<eos> Michael's hired a car.<eos> Using one of my fancy new credit cards.<eos> There's plenty of room, Qasim, if you and your boys want to join us.<eos> It turns out, Michael's also a potential investor in the Runyon Towers.<eos> You're going to view the investment property?<eos> With father gone,<eos> Michael's encouraged me to take a more active role in my family's finances.<eos> Very well.<eos> Uh, but you will come with us so we can offer you protection...
It didn't take me long to convince her to help me.<eos> And then...<eos> How do you know - that she wasn't involved in whatever Christopher was doing?<eos> She wasn't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So, you see, my reasons for finding him are as personal as yours.<eos> Does the FBI know... about your connection to the case?<eos> - No.<eos> - Then why tell me?<eos> Because it's not safe for you to be pursuing him on your own.
Mum, Benji's got something to tell you.<eos> Hello, loves.<eos> Is now a bad time?<eos> - Listen, we... we can come back.<eos> - Yeah. No, your timing's perfect.<eos> We were just discussing the importance of family.<eos> George, this is my son, Rhys, and our dear friend Ben, who's been like a son to me for the last 15 years.<eos> These boys mean the world to me.<eos> And everything I've done in my life... every decision I've made... has been to provide a future for them, for our children, our sons.<eos> Well, you have sons, don't you?
Allie.<eos> You can't let her get inside your head.<eos> But she's not wrong, is she?<eos> If she were right about me, we wouldn't be on the phone right now.<eos> And you never would have seen me again.<eos> We are going to get through this.<eos> We are going to get through this.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> You're coming with me.
Is that so?<eos> Morgan, how do you feel about that?<eos> How do you feel about that, Morgan?<eos> Morgan is terrified.<eos> And not just because weddings are terrifying... Which they are.<eos> - but because...<eos> - He's frightened.<eos> Of hurting the two most important people in his life.<eos> Which is you two.<eos> He wants you to have the wedding you've always wanted, and he wants you to be able to give your family and friends...
Starting with the vault in your sub-basement.<eos> This morning, they smuggled in all the tools they'll need for the job.<eos> But not before they took control of your security cameras.<eos> We're gonna need to access these feeds, as well.<eos> Even if they get around the cameras, the vault door is reinforced steel.<eos> Yes, but your head of security, George Tyson, gave them the pass code.<eos> And a counterfeiter named Leah Wells gave them everything else they needed to replace your fortune with fakes.<eos> As we speak, the caterers are moving money from your vault, through the kitchen, and straight out the back door.<eos> But the real payoff for Sybil isn't the robbery.<eos> It's when you try to spend the fake cash.
You sure you're okay with it?<eos> Just promise you'll come back.<eos> And be careful.<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> Alice Vaughan?<eos> Emily Clark, FBI.<eos> Sorry about the intrusion.<eos> We got a tip about a stolen painting?<eos> One second, Val.<eos> We have a search warrant, and we're gonna need for you to come with us, ma'am.
I just have a few questions. Absolutely.<eos> Happy to help.<eos> Do you recognize this painting?<eos> I do.<eos> The Singer Museum hired your firm to protect it at a recent opening, yes? Mm-hmm.<eos> In fact, you apprehended a man named Mario Visconti, who attempted to steal the painting from the museum... Mm-hmm.<eos> The same painting we found on a wall in your bedroom this evening.<eos> Sorry. I was waiting for the question.<eos> Did you steal the painting from the museum, Ms. Vaughan?<eos> If I may, I think you're asking the wrong questions, Agent Clark.
I can get you out of here.<eos> You just have to do exactly as I say.<eos> First of all, she must demand a transfer to a different hotel because she's convinced there are criminals here.<eos> Which, of course, there are.<eos> During the transfer, my associates and I will intercept you.<eos> We'll protect you from Hamlin's thugs, and we are prepared to offer you a very generous salary for your continued services.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> All I need is your signature on this transfer request.<eos> You have no idea how screwed you are.
I want to do something about it, and you speaking to it, it means something.<eos> Our schools.<eos> Isn't that what you said?<eos> Why stir things?<eos> Too many teachers, they just want to keep their mouths shut, heads down, let the Unions fight it out with the legislator.<eos> That solves what?<eos> That's politics.<eos> How's politics working for students?<eos> You need help with your budget. I don't need help.<eos> Okay, my school needs help, and you're talking about grabbing a third rail.

I got him to see a doctor. But I-I-I think that scared him more than helped him.<eos> There doesn't have to be a rush to deal with this.<eos> Victims are allowed time to decide if they want to pursue their case.<eos> Well, he waited to say anything, and... and they act like it's his fault.<eos> I waited to tell the police, and they... they say, you know, you're negligent.<eos> There's a time, there's a window, for victims, when they're ready to talk. It might...<eos> I'm saying, consider it might be better for Taylor to wait until he's ready.<eos> So I should just leave it alone?<eos> You should make sure that what you're doing is having a positive effect on your son.<eos> How are you holding up?
Stop right where you are.<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> Detective Garroway, I need your badge and your gun.<eos> Who's this?<eos> His name is Fisk.<eos> Internal affairs.<eos> My hands are tied.<eos> You're gonna have to cooperate.<eos> Have ballistics run it through the system, see what pops up.<eos> You're coming with me.
Of course they will.<eos> I'll let your mother know that you're gonna handle this.<eos> I'm sure she'll be very glad to hear it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look familiar?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I'd have to ask my lawyer.<eos> That's the way you want it?<eos> One lawyer, coming up.<eos> You sit tight.
Made me feel boss when I was riding down the street, flossin'!<eos> You ruined them.<eos> Those were my cards!<eos> Mine!<eos> I hate this place!<eos> So, we've had some difficulty getting your son to play ball.<eos> That's because he can't play ball very well, so he gets self-conscious about it.<eos> You just need to start playing like it's no big deal, and eventually, he'll join in.<eos> Charles.<eos> You're a big meanie.

I'm fine. Thank you.<eos> Really, it's no problem.<eos> We're headed in the same direction.<eos> Just because we're neighbors doesn't mean we're gonna be friends.<eos> Have I done something, Mrs. McBride?<eos> Because you're acting kind of hostile.<eos> The apple doesn't fall very far from the tree, does it?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Your mom was a dirty slut, and God struck her down.<eos> And by the looks of it, so are you.
When she was young, she was a missionary in India and fortunately for us, she speaks a good English.<eos> Well, my sweet and Holy Father, now what is it you would like to have for your lunch?<eos> You just tell your Bice what you want, and I'll prepare it for you.<eos> Matriciana, pasta e fagioli, carbonara, lasagna...<eos> Am I mistaken, did she say "my sweet"?<eos> Your Holiness, Sister Bice is rather... quaint.<eos> No, Domen, she is not quaint.<eos> She's friendly.<eos> Mother...<eos> Let me explain something to you, that you, in your long life, have not yet had the occasion to understand:
No, Domen, she is not quaint.<eos> She's friendly.<eos> Mother...<eos> Let me explain something to you, that you, in your long life, have not yet had the occasion to understand:<eos> friendly relationships are dangerous.<eos> They lend themselves to ambiguities, misunderstandings, and conflicts, and they always end badly.<eos> Formal relationships, on the other hand, are as clear as spring water.<eos> Their rules are carved in stone.<eos> There's no risk of being misunderstood and they last forever.<eos> Now, you need to know I do not appreciate friendly relationships.
I don't even wear glasses.<eos> And your hearing?<eos> My only problem is my hair, Your Holiness.<eos> You mean it's falling out?<eos> Not only that.<eos> Sometimes it hurts.<eos> Your hair hurts?<eos> Good. Very good!<eos> I'll be frank, Don Tommaso, I need you.<eos> You must do something very important for the eminency of your pontiff.
Let's settle for long.<eos> What a telling joke!<eos> Jokes are never telling.<eos> They're jokes.<eos> Well, Holy Father, first of all, a small piece of information of a practical and picturesque nature...<eos> Under your desk, on the right, you will find a button.<eos> If you feel that an encounter is becoming disagreeable or a waste of time, all you have to do is to press it discreetly, and an assistant will swiftly appear with some excuse, liberating you from your engagement.<eos> He'll lie, in other words.<eos> Yes, but he'll have plenty of time and opportunity to repent.<eos> Well, Holy Father, if you agree, I would like to start with our top priorities.
Therefore, the Holy Father's inevitable lack of experience, together with Sister Mary's inevitable lack of experience would lead me to suggest an internal contribution...<eos> Of course, I realize how central Sister Mary seems to you.<eos> We could invent a sort of ad hoc role for her.<eos> We don't lack for imagination around here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're exactly right, Voiello, she's central.<eos> Sister Mary took me in at her orphanage when I was 7 years old, she raised me and she loved me.<eos> She made me a good Christian. A great Christian!<eos> Monsignor Gemelli is experienced, I would rely on him.<eos> Perhaps you didn't hear me correctly.
My English does have its limits.<eos> You'd better improve it then.<eos> Sister Mary will be my special assistant.<eos> As you wish, Holy Father.<eos> Then, of course, there is the matter of drafting and delivering your address to the College of Cardinals.<eos> They're all still here. They will not leave the Vatican until you address them.<eos> Later.<eos> In the office of the Secretary, we have been wondering if the Holy Father would care to provide us with some indications regarding the draft of an encyclical.<eos> Later.<eos> The prefects of the various congregations are of course eager to see you with their own eyes. But I imagine that you would like to deal with this matter... later.
Holy Father, Holy Father, smoking is not allowed in the papal palace!<eos> Is that so?<eos> Who decided that?<eos> John Paul II.<eos> - The Pope? - Yes, the Pope.<eos> There's a new Pope now.<eos> True.<eos> - Your Eminence...<eos> - Yes, Holy Father.<eos> You're too tied to the past.
The past is an enormous place, with all sorts of things inside.<eos> Not so with the present.<eos> The present is merely a narrow opening, with room for only one pair of eyes.<eos> Mine.<eos> Your Eminence.<eos> Yes?<eos> Our top priorities.<eos> Here I am.<eos> As I was saying...<eos> You will be in charge of politics, finance, theology, appointments and promotions.
And he is the Pope.<eos> Did you call for me, Holy Father?<eos> Papa!<eos> It all comes back to this in the end, doesn't it?<eos> To the mother.<eos> How was your mother like, Monsignor Gutierrez?<eos> She was a woman who did not scorn wickedness.<eos> And it had the effect of creating a son full of goodness.<eos> I've inquired about you.<eos> Everyone tells me you are a shining example of goodness.
It is I who should thank you, for allowing me to be here without hordes of tourists.<eos> That's my duty, Holy Father.<eos> Was it hard, close off the Basilica to tourists?<eos> No, all we had to do was hang up a sign saying "closed".<eos> I will never shed my aversion to tourists.<eos> Why is that, Holy Father?<eos> Because they are just passing through.<eos> I was late because I couldn't find your office. I know.<eos> You opened the wrong door and found yourself face to face with some visitors to our museum.<eos> So you've been inquiring about me, too.
Everybody is wondering who Sister Mary is to you, what she's doing here.<eos> What else?<eos> Everybody is also wondering:<eos> is the Pope thinking about his first homily?<eos> I ask myself the same thing all the time.<eos> Of course I'm thinking about it.<eos> It's all I think about. I even dreamed about it.<eos> I'll let you in on a secret:<eos> ever since I was little, I've learned to confound people's ideas of what's going on in my head.<eos> You're so wise, Holy Father.
I love you.<eos> Say something else.<eos> No.<eos> You don't love me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But love's not enough for you.<eos> Sex has its own rules.<eos> Sex only has one rule: procreation.<eos> No...<eos> Are you Sister Mary?
- I'm afraid it's premature.<eos> - Premature, Your Eminence?<eos> The time it takes to develop and update the merchandise, it means we have to move right away, before the fakes start appearing.<eos> The crooks are always so much faster, who knows how they do it.<eos> Criminal organizations are faster because they don't forgive inefficiency.<eos> At the risk of seeming too materialistic, Your Eminence, do you know how much the Vatican coffers lose for every day that passes without any new papal merchandizing on the market?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Now do you understand why I need the Holy Father's immediate approval?<eos> Yes, I do. But you don't know him.
He's not a saint, he's the center forward for Napoli.<eos> What a lame joke.<eos> I see you've lost your optimism along with your sense of humor.<eos> Sense of humor is irrelevant for the Secretary of State.<eos> May I smoke as well, Holy Father?<eos> Unfortunately not.<eos> His Holiness John Paul II, in his day, forbid it.<eos> May I tell you something, Holy Father?<eos> - That's why we're here.<eos> - With all due respect, seen from up close, you are an extraordinarily handsome man.

Do you see this plate, ma'am?<eos> Yes... of course I see it.<eos> Good.<eos> This is the sort of merchandise I'm prepared to authorize.<eos> But it doesn't have your image on it!<eos> I do not have an image, my good lady, because I am no one.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> No one. Only Christ exists. Only Christ.<eos> I don't understand, Holy Father.<eos> Of course you don't, because, as you said earlier, you studied at Harvard.

Whereas here, in the Vatican, we try to elevate ourselves.<eos> Who exactly is in charge of curating the image of the Pope?<eos> The Secretary of State entrusted that delicate task to me, Holy Father, two years ago.<eos> And now I'm going to tell you what you, as curator of the image of the Holy Father, are gonna do.<eos> You are gonna fire the Vatican's official photographer immediately.

And so, for my first address, you will see to it that the light is so dim, no photographer, no TV cameraman, and not even the faithful will see anything of me but a dark shadow, my silhouette.

Or Marina Abramovic.<eos> Banksy.<eos> Electronic music group?<eos> I don't know the first thing about electronic music.<eos> You say Harvard is a good university!<eos> Anyway, Daft Punk.<eos> The best Italian female vocalist?<eos> - Mina?<eos> - Very good!<eos> Now do you know what it is, what the invisible red thread is that connects them all, all these most important figures in their respective fields?

- You will, one day.<eos> At any rate, let me reassure you that we intend to tackle all the concerns that you have raised, one by one.<eos> We?<eos> Who's we?<eos> You and the Pope?<eos> Do we have two popes now?<eos> We also intended tackle the question of the Secretary of State.<eos> It's a good thing you've come, Sister Mary,<eos> I was getting bored.<eos> I must admit, you're a first-class adversary.
"If you want to see God, you have the means to do it.<eos> God is love."<eos> Thank you, Sister Mary.<eos> So, I finally get to meet the Prefect for the Congregation for the Clergy.<eos> I've been anxious to see you.<eos> Here I am, Holy Father.<eos> Did you vote for me in the Conclave, Your Eminence?<eos> Not even once.<eos> Why not?<eos> Even though I don't know your ideas, in truth, no one does, you are a pupil of Cardinal Spencer.

I figured that you were probably a conservative as well.

Are you, Holy Father?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think that if the name you have chosen, Pius XIII, is intended to signal a continuity with Pius XII,<eos> then there is the reason for concern.<eos> Let's not forget that Pius XI considered Mussolini to be a man of divine providence.<eos> At any rate, the College of Cardinals was very rash to elect a pontiff whose ideas and orientation they did not know.<eos> I agree with you.<eos> It was rash.<eos> At any rate, Holy Father, please do not take this as a criticism, or think that this will in any way dampen my obedience.<eos> You asked me a question I considered it my duty to respond truthfully.

!<eos> They're all asking, "what is the Cardinal Secretary of State doing?"<eos> I know what to do.<eos> What we need is a dramatic gesture..<eos> Voiello, you need to hand in your resignation today.<eos> Excellent!<eos> That's what you'll do, Voiello.<eos> It's a genuine miracle that this assembly generated an idea.<eos> A first-rate idea.<eos> I'm willing to bet, that in the aftermath of my homily, you're ready to hand in your resignation.
I've been expecting him.<eos> You wished to see me, Your Holiness?<eos> Yes, and for the last time, Ozolins.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Now... close your eyes and choose your new destination.<eos> What have I done wrong, Holy Father?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's just that your role under the previous three Popes was to organize their travels. A role which I intend to radically rescale, because this Pope won't be wasting time roaming the world. As a result, I no longer need you.<eos> It would be beneath your stature as a cardinal to accept a diminished role so...<eos> Then why do I get the impression that you're out to diminish me even further?
Holy Father, a little gift for you.<eos> Blessed Father, this is a very useful object, but only if you open it.<eos> You see?<eos> It can be perfectly useful even when it's closed.<eos> Your Holiness, will you allow me, given my venerable age, a vaguely critical observation?<eos> Yes, I allow you.<eos> To expect a devoted and adoring crowd to ponder the enigma of God's existence amounts to asking an obsolete question.<eos> The question now is not whether God exists, but rather, why do we depend on God?<eos> You surprised me, Holy Father.<eos> You're so young and yet you have such old ideas.
Voiello will be happy to face the press.<eos> Voiello won't be facing the press, you will.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm not up to the challenge.<eos> I wouldn't know how to respond.<eos> You won't be expected to respond.<eos> You'll be expected to affirm.<eos> Affirm what I am going to dictate to you.<eos> You look on edge to me.<eos> You always ask rhetorical questions.

What kind of Church is he looking for?<eos> You tell me, does he have a plan?<eos> I really have to tell you, Sister Mary:<eos> this Pope is strange and contradictory.<eos> Just like you.<eos> - Just like me?<eos> - Just like you!<eos> What can you say about a man who lives in an 6,500-square-foot apartment with a private sauna... and a billiard table, surrounded by fine tapestries, goldsmithery, damasks, and expensive artworks, but who also takes the time,<eos> and energy at night to babysit a disabled boy.<eos> You're unbeatable, Sister Mary.

"I, Pius XIII, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ,<eos> Successor of the Prince of the Apostles,<eos> Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church,<eos> Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Province of Rome,<eos> Sovereign of the State of Vatican City, and Servant of the Servants of God, wish to inform you of my total indifference to your doubts and criticism, in light of which I deem it necessary to reiterate my infallibility in contrast to your human fallibility."<eos> Is this Pope claiming divine status?<eos> "And by virtue of the prerogative, which is dogmatically sanctioned by the supremacy of the Roman Pontiff, I will not tolerate any delays or compromises as I carry out my plan."<eos> What plan?<eos> We didn't understand anything about the plan.<eos> And once more we don't understand who you are?

do you still think about me now and then?<eos> Let go of me, someone might see us.<eos> So, why did you come get me?<eos> The Holy Father wishes to see you.<eos> Haven't you ever been in the Apostolic Palace before?<eos> Never, in all these years.<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> It makes you feel uneasy.<eos> It was designed and built with that exact intent.<eos> You wanted to meet me?

That's not enough!<eos> Because it's not enough to just love it, you also need to perceive it.<eos> I think I perceived it.<eos> And what else did you perceived?<eos> What?<eos> Respect.<eos> What's your name?<eos> All right, let's get started.<eos> Holy Father, I am sure that there is no need to remind you that the cardinals are expecting your speech of thanks and to be sent home.<eos> You're right, there is no need to remind me, but you did it anyway.

Highly impartial.<eos> An impartial layman?<eos> Yes, that's Tavarelli.<eos> Your Eminence, you seem a bit impetuous when it comes to the Kurtwell case.
Anything a little more stimulating?<eos> In light of the statements made at the press conference, newspapers around the world have just begun to unlease holy hell.<eos> Well, that's always the first step on the path to paradise.<eos> I see.<eos> I'm not the one dispensing jokes in the Vatican anymore,<eos> Your Holiness, now it's you.<eos> Your Eminence, first of all: I suggest you recover as soon as possible your legendary, fake courtesy.<eos> And secondly: my jokes contain the truth.<eos> You know something, Holy Father?<eos> You are as handsome as Jesus, but you are not actually Jesus.
You know something, Holy Father?<eos> You are as handsome as Jesus, but you are not actually Jesus.<eos> I may actually be more handsome, but keep that to yourself.<eos> Cardinal Spencer, in a private conversation between the two of us, alluded to certain machinations that led to my being elected Pope.<eos> He was unwilling to acquaint me with the details.<eos> I'm not going to insist with Spencer, but I am with you, Voiello.<eos> So, tell me exactly the dynamics that went on to see me elected.<eos> Tell me right now, or what you've seen so far will be nothing but a foretaste of the macabre banquet that will bring on the ruin of the Church.<eos> Explain it all, right here, right now, because even a second later will be too late.<eos> Are you telling me that you're behaving irrationally with the faithful, the Vatican Curia, and the mass media because you were kept out of the loop on the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to your election?
Are you telling me that you're behaving irrationally with the faithful, the Vatican Curia, and the mass media because you were kept out of the loop on the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to your election?<eos> No.<eos> I am ordering you, beginning with your next utterance, to tell me why I was elected, and what my election was supposed to mean to you all.<eos> In truth, the Holy Spirit...<eos> You were not supposed to be the man of the Providence, you were supposed to be the Pope of compromise.<eos> What do you mean by compromise?<eos> Your prudence as a cardinal was interpreted as a potential bridge between the progressive positions so dear to me and the more conservative ones so dear to Spencer.<eos> You were considered to be a synthesis.<eos> A happy synthesis, pleasing both to the Holy Spirit and myself, the great elector who, believing in you and your young talent, influenced a majority of cardinals.<eos> Now, for reasons that are unclear to me, you no longer want to be a bridge.
Fuck, you were supposed to share your sovereignty with my advice and Spencer's!<eos> Not like this!<eos> A decidedly undiplomatic response, Your Eminence.<eos> You're right, Holy Father, and I humbly beg your forgiveness.<eos> I'm not sure that's enough.<eos> Do you want my resignation?<eos> I'm not sure that's enough.<eos> Tell Valente to go to the archives and bring the procedure for deposing a cardinal.<eos> May I ask you both to leave us for a moment?<eos> Your Eminence, would you have me believe that I am Pope thanks to you.

How great was the papal state when fear among nations was part of our DNA?<eos> How small did we become, how greatly did our influence decline, when we decided to yield.<eos> To succumb, to withdraw, to become accommodating and reassuring?<eos> This place, these people, placate my sense of disquiet,<eos> all my anxieties, both ancient and modern.<eos> It's nice and cold, Holy Father.<eos> I don't doubt it, Sister.<eos> Would you be so kind as to bring me three oranges, as well?<eos> Certainly, Holy Father.<eos> I so wish that I could have been thunderstruck, as you were, one May afternoon, in the heart of the Church.
There are times... there are certain times, or possibly always...<eos> In short, there are times when I don't believe.<eos> There are times when I think it might be better to leave it all in Voiello's hands.<eos> He knows how to do things.<eos> He believes in what he says.<eos> And he still believes in God.<eos> No, Holy Father.<eos> No.<eos> Voiello is a politician.<eos> You are the Pope.
I'll bet that you don't let your husband do it either.<eos> I think that's a mistake.<eos> The punishment of God is never over beauty. Never.<eos> Now tell me what your problem is.<eos> Then I'll do it for you.<eos> Esther is a fervent Roman Catholic woman, who is happily married to Peter and childless.<eos> She enjoys spending her mornings roller skating with the children of the other Swiss Guards.<eos> But it's not roller skating that Esther loves.<eos> She loves what she cannot have.<eos> You ask me what my problem is, but you already know because you are so profound.
Carolus.<eos> Holy Father, I beg your pardon,<eos> I really had no idea I was in the men's bathroom.<eos> Actually, this is neither the men's bathroom nor the women's.<eos> - This is the Pope's bathroom.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> Do you mind if I finish applying my lipstick?<eos> Even if I did mind, a woman like yourself would find a way to go on applying it anyway.<eos> So please, go right ahead.<eos> You know women, Holy Father!
Holy Father, first of all, I bring you the greetings of the Catholic community of Nuuk, in Greenland.<eos> Yes, I know all about Nuuk.<eos> It's a small Catholic community that you have, in Greenland. - Am I right?<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> The predominant Faith in Greenland is Evangelical Lutheran.<eos> And you have a female bishop, if I'm not wrong.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Sofia Petersen, an estimable woman.<eos> All bishops are estimable.<eos> Did you know that Pope Pasquale II appointed the first bishop to Greenland? A place that, as you know very well, is technically part of North America, four full centuries before Christopher Columbus?
All bishops are estimable.<eos> Did you know that Pope Pasquale II appointed the first bishop to Greenland? A place that, as you know very well, is technically part of North America, four full centuries before Christopher Columbus?<eos> I do know that, Holy Father.<eos> The Catholic Church was the first to arrive in Greenland.<eos> But it's not always the case that the first to arrive remains first.<eos> I agree, Holy Father.<eos> In Greenland, we Catholics are like the native Americans.<eos> We got there first and then we were confined to reservations.<eos> I agree, Holy Father.<eos> You are a woman who tends to agree.
These are supposed to be worse than real cigarettes.<eos> I was told that they're good for you.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It's a substitute for the real thing.<eos> What I want, always, is the whole truth.<eos> Then you've come to the wrong place.<eos> Holy Father, don't call me repetitive, but when is your speech to the cardinals going to take place?<eos> - In due time.<eos> - Yes, but when?<eos> You really don't understand, do you?
Two thirds of the Clergy.<eos> Then what becomes of Mother Church's capacity for forgiveness?<eos> Our abuse of forgiveness we've become a laughingstock.<eos> As unreliable as some miserable little third-world country.<eos> With your methods, on the other hand, we're likely to become as reliable as, say, North Korea.<eos> No.<eos> And do you wanna know what the difference is?<eos> We don't imprison ours, we set them free.<eos> We pardon every one of them, but one second later we kick them out the door.<eos> All right, Holy Father, as you command.
All that's needed is the threat of scandal to turn things around.<eos> What things?<eos> The Holy Father intends to issue new measures that could lead irreversibly to the extinction of the Church.<eos> Do you understand what significant stakes we're talking about?<eos> Me, you, all of us have the sacrosanct duty to stop him, in God's name.<eos> But I could try to talk to him.<eos> He respects me.<eos> Sorry, I was about to laugh, but I stopped myself, because I have a certain class.<eos> We seriously doubt that Pius XIII even respects God.<eos> You don't know him at all.
- Yes.<eos> - What did She say?<eos> - She said: "Tonino"...<eos> - Yes? "You are a descendant of Mine and also of Padre Pio.<eos> You have the Light.<eos> You have the power to see Me, and to heal the sick.<eos> You have..."<eos> In any case, my friends, let me say that... Tonino Pettola lives here in Montecruccoli, and for the past two years, since he began having visions, thousands of faithful have come from all over Europe, right?<eos> Just to see him, to meet him, to touch him, to ask him for a miracle.<eos> Tonino, you've already done some healings, right?
You must, please.<eos> You must.<eos> Amen.<eos> They're taking their afternoon nap.<eos> The fat one is snoring.<eos> Yes, she is Mother Letizia.<eos> She's the metronome of sleep.<eos> I've made an important decision.<eos> What?<eos> You will go to New York to investigate the Kurtwell case.
What?<eos> You will go to New York to investigate the Kurtwell case.<eos> Why do you want to punish me, Holy Father?<eos> This is no punishment, this is a promotion.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Holy Father, spare me.<eos> I'm a modest, limited man, believe me.<eos> The Kurtwell case is something far too big for me, beyond my scope.<eos> Quit selling yourself short.<eos> You're going to New York.

My Papacy won't let the harm done to even a single child slip away into indifference.<eos> And you will help me, because I trust you.<eos> Blindly!<eos> Holy Father, I am a recluse.<eos> I only know how to live inside these walls.<eos> In all these years, I've left here only twice, both times to go to the hospital.<eos> I don't know how to cross the street, I don't know how to get a hotel room, I don't know how to order a meal in a restaurant.<eos> I'm like those canaries in cages.<eos> If you free them, they die.<eos> You're afraid.
He's decided that He's lost the u.<eos> Now it's up to you.<eos> The attentions that Your Holiness has been paying to the wife of the commandant of the Swiss Guard have not gone unnoticed.<eos> According to vox populi, it is believed that the Holy Father is conducting an unseemly relationship with that woman.<eos> Monsignor Gutierrez was right:<eos> in the Vatican, gossip is called calumny.<eos> Your Holiness, what do you intend to do?<eos> Revolution, Tommaso!<eos> I intend to start a revolution.<eos> People say you're a saint.

The Holy Father isn't in the Apostolic Palace.<eos> Nor is the Cardinal Secretary of State.<eos> What time is it?<eos> Three in the morning.<eos> I'll take care of it. You go to sleep.<eos> And don't say a word to anyone.<eos> - Will you let me in?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You are very beautiful at night, Sister Mary.
- Why did you come here?<eos> - Because of the Pope.<eos> How disappointing!<eos> I thought you came because of me.<eos> Nobody knows where the Pope is.<eos> Oh don't worry.<eos> Sooner or later all popes need to remind themselves what freedom is.<eos> Then they come back.<eos> We had to go to retrieve Pius XIII's predecessor from a bingo parlor.<eos> When you want, you know how to be quite comforting.

What if I knew all your secrets, Your Eminence?<eos> What were you hoping to achieve?<eos> Start a scandal?<eos> The idea of threatening that poor girl, who suffers from sterility!<eos> Will you stop at nothing, Your Eminence?<eos> Don't you know the meaning of the word pity?<eos> How far were you willing to go?<eos> Would you have blackmailed the Holy Father?<eos> Would you have gone so far as to give those pictures to the press, to insinuate a nonexistent sexual relationship between me and that young woman?<eos> You haven't figured out that your old methods only work on the old popes, who were afraid of losing consensus.

There is not much that the Vatican Bank can do.<eos> Our days of free willing finances are over.<eos> Changes in banking regulations mean that our hands are now tied.<eos> If we continue on this course, we'll be forced to start selling off our artistic patrimony simply to survive.<eos> The faithful will return.<eos> It's a natural cycle.<eos> For now, the faithful are not returning.<eos> And small but dangerous enclaves of Catholic fundamentalism are starting to spring up, just like in Islam.<eos> Islam has more followers than the Catholic Church.<eos> Don't you find it a burden to take on the responsibility of such risky and unpopular decisions?

Are you asleep, Holy Father?<eos> No, Mr. Prime Minister. I'm praying for you,<eos> That's very thoughtful of you.<eos> And thanks very much for giving me this audience, after just nine months.<eos> I didn't think you'd be running the Country this long.<eos> I said to myself: why bother?<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> Well, how is this Italy of ours doing?<eos> Much better, thanks to me.<eos> - You think so?
Or perhaps in their sleep!<eos> At the polls in the next election.<eos> And what's more: I, as the vicar of Christ, will be happy to help God eradicating that 41%.<eos> And if don't stop playing the idiot, I'm gonna be forced to prove to you that God does exists.<eos> - Let me explain something to you, Holy Father.<eos> - Please.<eos> Your demands might have some basis in fact at any other point in history.<eos> At a point in history when the Church was stronger than it is right now, the Italian political equation would have been obliged to take your demands under serious consideration. The way it always has in the past.<eos> But now let us briefly analyze your Papacy, Holy Father.<eos> In the past nine months you have never shown yourself to the faithful, you have not recited a single Angelus in St. Peter's Square, you have not communicated with anyone, you have simply retreated into your palace on the hill
Unrealizable?<eos> We shall see about that!<eos> Now, if you'd care to listen to me, I'll show you that God exists, and how God and I can annihilate that 41% of the population that makes you feel so cheerful and full of yourself.<eos> I am very eager to hear what you have to say, Holy Father.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> You see, Mr. Prime Minister, in the Sixties the young people that protested in the streets spouted all kind of heresies, all except one:<eos> power to the imagination.<eos> In that, they were correct.<eos> The only problem was they had no imagination.<eos> And neither do you.

- Do you know what that means?<eos> - No.<eos> No, of course you don't. You're far too young.<eos> The "non expedit" was first issued by Pius IX in 1868. It was eliminated by Benedict XV in 1919, but guess what I can do?<eos> What I, who am not answerable to 41% of the Italians, but only to God who, by the way, does not express His displeasure on social networks if I make a mistake. Guess what I can do?<eos> I can restore the "non expedit".<eos> The Catholics will all rush to Google those words.<eos> What do they mean?<eos> The "non expedit" means that the Holy Father decrees it is unacceptable for Catholics to vote in the Italian elections.<eos> And do you know what the surveys that you have commissioned tell us?

And I'll be happy to provide him with some answers.<eos> This is for you.<eos> Read it!<eos> What do you recommend?<eos> Father Antonello did a great job with "A Great Little Soul", So did Liliana with "A Man"...<eos> I'll take "1001 Illustrious Names Blackmailed by Angelo Voiello."<eos> There, only there.<eos> May I have some cane sugar?<eos> We don't have any cane sugar, Captain.<eos> Eminence, do you have any idea why I'm here?
Never.<eos> Pettola's relatives claim the exact opposite.<eos> They say that Tonino Pettola, one evening a few months ago, in his home met with you, the Pope and other Cardinals. From that moment on he seemed shocked and obsessed with your meeting because they say that you threatened to throw him in quicksand.<eos> Does it strike you as plausible, Captain, that the Cardinals, the Secretary of State and the Pope would all go to Tonino Pettola's house and threaten to throw him in quicksand?<eos> It does seem strange but not implausible.<eos> Why?<eos> What happened to Tonino Pettola?<eos> He disappeared.<eos> His relatives claim he was being persecuted by persons high up in the Vatican.<eos> Do you really think we'd waste our time on a poor raving lunatic?
I've been fighting for years against such wasteful behavior.<eos> Waste is not the point, Your Eminence.<eos> Don't you think it's a contradiction?<eos> If Pettola was an insignificant artist and you had no interest in him, why all the phone calls?<eos> The Congregation for the Causes of Saints was in contact with him, doing their best to check his urgent demands.<eos> The calls not only came from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints but also from Your Eminence's offices and from the Pope's.<eos> In the Secretary of State and the Pope's offices there are about 250 employees.<eos> I can't rule out that someone might have had a reason to call Tonino Pettola.<eos> Perhaps someone that believed all his fibs and wanted to meet him.<eos> Do you have any idea where Tonino Pettola might be?

You have an answer for everything, Eminence.<eos> That's my job, Captain.<eos> - I've heard the same thing.<eos> - What, Captain?<eos> That Maradona is still doing drugs.<eos> A friend of mine told me. He's in intelligence and stationed in Dubai.<eos> Why do you want to hurt me, Captain?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm a fan of Inter, Your Eminence.<eos> Cardinal Dussolier, I know you, but you don't know me.
If you're at loose ends, please come.<eos> It would be an honor for my husband and me.<eos> Ok, thank you.<eos> I'll keep it in mind.<eos> Bye.<eos> My name is Angelo Sanchez.<eos> I was born in Alicante into a family of manual laborers and I am not a homosexual.<eos> I had such a simple dream: to serve God.<eos> You murdered my dream.<eos> You are nothing more than a pathetic, miserable, cowardly murderer.
You've gotta cut it out with the fear, Your Holiness.<eos> The important thing is that they're alive.<eos> And they haven't forgotten you.<eos> That's the Madonna of the jungle.<eos> I know that.<eos> Was there something you wanted to tell me, Sister Mary?<eos> The Pope is upset, the Pope is experiencing a moment of weakness.<eos> The Pope is distracted.<eos> If you need to have him sign a document or something of the sort that gets our Church back on course, this would be the right time to do it.<eos> I've done my part. Now you need to do yours.
No, I won't tell you anything else.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I'm stupid, it's true, but not that stupid.<eos> Do you resent me for not having made you a cardinal yet?<eos> Yes, at first I thought that was the reason I wouldn't confide in you again.<eos> You'll assume the purple at the next consistory.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Because then I identified another reason I won't ever tell you anything again.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't believe in God, Holy Father.

I wouldn't rule out the possibility that they were a couple of the kind of lunatics who crawl out of the woodwork, and that our screeners allowed themselves to be taken in.<eos> Holy Father, I swear to God there is no conspiracy against you.<eos> Only a great deal of sincere concern.<eos> What did you have me sign the other day?<eos> A simplified procedure for ordaining new priests.<eos> And why did you have me sign it without talking to me about it first?<eos> I had the documents delivered to you the night before.<eos> - I assumed you had read them. - No.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> You knew my head would be in the clouds and you had me hastily sign those documents that were completely opposed in their intent to the direction I' advocating..

They make me feel like I'm having an adventure.<eos> Young people like you love adventures.<eos> Holy Father, may I remind you that we're the same age?<eos> We used to be the same age.<eos> I was so surprised and happy to hear that you wanted to see me.<eos> I too was surprised to learn that I needed to see you.<eos> Oh, not wanted, but needed.<eos> Weigh your words carefully, Holy Father.<eos> I'm really tired, you know that?<eos> If you will allow me, Holy Father, you're not tired.

Oh, it's very simple.<eos> We've failed to follow the eternal, unchanging principle of the carrot and the stick.<eos> The carrot and the stick.<eos> We brought the stick but forgot the carrot.<eos> What do you mean by carrot?<eos> An opening.<eos> What do you mean by an opening?<eos> A speech about love and a pastoral voyage.<eos> I don't like to travel and you know perfectly well that I don't like to be seen.<eos> I never said that you have to let yourself be seen.
By the way, something that may possibly cheer you up:<eos> Elmore Coen, your favorite author, is on vacation in Rome.<eos> He stated in an interview with the press that he'd like to meet you.<eos> Might that be of interest to you?<eos> I've always wanted to meet Elmore Coen.<eos> What became... of the roller-skating children?<eos> I've loved all your books, Mr. Coen.<eos> It's an immense honor for me to meet you.<eos> Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Your Holiness.<eos> After all, you're the Pope.

Not at all.<eos> Laymen always think we priests are scandalized by even the slightest things, whereas the truth is the exact opposite.<eos> We are never scandalized, no profession has to deal with sin on such a continual basis as ours.<eos> The confessional is our operating room.<eos> Just as surgeons have no fear of blood, so we priests are no longer afraid of scandal and sin.<eos> So how do you survive without women?<eos> An easy answer.<eos> The foolish ones go with women on the sly.<eos> The wise ones long ago understood the degree to which sex, as a source of pleasure, has overvalued in our society.<eos> Your Holiness, with a few words you have just razed to the ground three quarters of my literary production.

But you don't write about motors that purr, you write about motors that break down continuously.

But you don't write about motors that purr, you write about motors that break down continuously.<eos> And they should have given you a Nobel Prize for it, 20 years ago.<eos> Ah, it's true.<eos> Unfortunately, they've gotten into the habit of giving it only to those who don't want it.<eos> Have you ever had a girlfriend, Your Holiness?<eos> Certainly!<eos> I've only have had one and I remember everything about her.<eos> Whereas you, Mr. Coen, have probably had thousands and don't remember a thing about them.
I understand, Jennifer, but he's not coming out.<eos> Prince Abadi has prepared the stadium for the Pope's public speech. Will he go?<eos> Will he allow himself to be seen in public for the first time?<eos> He said he will.<eos> In any case, I'll keep you informed.<eos> Ok?<eos> Sofie, when am I'm gonna be able to ask my question?<eos> I don't know, Jennifer.<eos> Holy Father, reliable sources say that the Kurtwell investigation is at a standstill.<eos> They say that you've sent a man with no experience to conduct that investigation because you don't actually want to investigate.
The water condenses on the glass and then drips into containers.<eos> There are times when we manage to collect as much as three liters a day.<eos> - Would you like some water to drink, Your Holiness?<eos> - No thanks.<eos> Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.<eos> I met this famous American author.<eos> What a tempter!<eos> He said he remembered only the perverse and lustful details of women.<eos> Now I can't seem to do anything but remember my own very few details of that nature.<eos> You might say to me: which ones?
All I know is everything I do, I do for the love of God.<eos> And that's all.<eos> My penitence, Father?<eos> My penitence, Father?<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> You couldn't have told me before?<eos> You've just letting me rattle on like an idiot for the past ten minutes!<eos> "Sister Antonia hides the water." And she uses it to control the sick and the nuns.<eos> In exchange for a few glasses of water she demands favors, obscene acts, and filth I could never repeat.<eos> "I beg you, please, Father, only you can help us."

- Don't be in such a hurry.<eos> Think carefully.<eos> I try to live in accordance with Christian values.<eos> Which ones?<eos> You can use Christian values for all kinds of purposes.<eos> A good person is somebody who puts himself last, who renounces his own temptations and needs, working only for the interests of others.<eos> Now think carefully and answer sincerely, because I won't put up with even the tiniest lie from you:<eos> are you a good person?<eos> There seems to be a some kind of misunderstanding concerning the meaning of my visit here to you.<eos> You think I'm here to honor you.
Sleep well, Mrs. Romero.<eos> I'm keepin' my name!<eos> There's a morning yoga class outside if you care to join.<eos> It'll be good for you. Very relaxing.<eos> I'd rather stick hot pins in my eyes.<eos> But thank you.<eos> Another load's in.<eos> Mrs. Romero.<eos> Oh, uh, yes.<eos> We found this over by the dirt. Thought maybe you lost it.
Dopamine floods the brain.<eos> And the quickest way to achieve that result...<eos> Fear!<eos> Do not move!<eos> You can't be.<eos> What did you see?<eos> The Reverse-Flash. He's here.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Christina McGee.<eos> Who are you?

Maybe.<eos> A little.<eos> - I'm gonna miss you.<eos> - Miss you too.<eos> - It's nice to know someone will.<eos> - Wait, we talking about Barry?<eos> 'Cause it sounds like we're talking about Barry.<eos> He kept telling me there was stuff he couldn't share with me and I've been going a little crazy trying to figure out what that stuff is.<eos> Yeah, Barry's not great at sharing.<eos> - Neither are you.
I mean, the whole time I've been working here you never mentioned it to me, but then I realized why.<eos> I went through some of Barry's old cases.<eos> All of them involved The Flash saving the day with details that Barry couldn't have possibly even known.<eos> That's weird.<eos> It is weird.<eos> The only thing that does make sense is that Barry is The Flash.<eos> He waddles like a slow-ass duck.<eos> There's no way he's The Flash, Patty.<eos> You know, when I started this job, you told me I had to learn how to lie to do it.<eos> You're a terrible liar, Joe.
Yeah, it's gone dark after the earthquake.<eos> So either the Primitives found their way down to her or ...<eos> She found a way up. - No.<eos> - Take a look.<eos> - Report back ASAP.<eos> - Fitz.<eos> What the hell are your Primitives capable of?<eos> Well, it's hard to say, really.<eos> I mean, these creatures are in their infancy.<eos> - You did create them, didn't you?
'And then he leaves.'<eos> Lovely chap.<eos> 'And she and I start to get acquainted.' Grace.<eos> Sidney Carter, friends call me Sid.<eos> Did Grace say what they were arguing about?<eos> She said it was nothing.<eos> A misunderstanding.<eos> I spoke to her earlier.<eos> She believes someone started the fire on purpose.<eos> Do you reckon...?
Do you think she knew about the will?<eos> She didn't seem exactly... grief-stricken at your father's death.<eos> That's just Rose. She's getting grumpier by the year.<eos> We used to have such fun.<eos> We'd dress up as each other and play tricks on Daddy.<eos> But since I got married, she... She's just changed.<eos> This inheritance will make you a very wealthy woman.<eos> Grace, this will not look good to a jury.<eos> But I'd give every penny to have Daddy back.<eos> You do believe me?
Harry was being so cold - it was in a moment of madness.<eos> He fired Owen on the spot.<eos> Harry told Martin that Owen took something that didn't belong to him.<eos> After that, Owen wouldn't let it go.<eos> He followed me around, begging me to see him.<eos> Last night, he even asked me to run away with him.<eos> I said no, but he wouldn't listen.<eos> Not until Sid came to my rescue.<eos> Why didn't you tell me this before?<eos> Owen loses his job, and then you reject him.
I'll get you some water.<eos> I found this in Gabriel's study.<eos> Exactly the same.<eos> Pentobarbitone.<eos> A bit stronger than your average migraine medication.<eos> Give me one good reason not to arrest you for removing evidence from the scene of a crime.<eos> The paperwork.<eos> I've found something, sir!<eos> You think I pretended to be Grace? !<eos> You were bitterly jealous of your sister.
America? !<eos> When?<eos> I leave this afternoon.<eos> But...<eos> I'll never forget the night we had together.<eos> Would you like to say a few words?<eos> Would it be awful if I didn't?<eos> I don't think I can get the words out.<eos> I think everyone will understand.<eos> You're so kind.
Well, we weren't, really.<eos> He was one of the few to sign up to my literacy scheme.<eos> Poor man had just lost his job, and could hardly write his own name.<eos> Such a waste.<eos> Mr Cartwright, the letter you got today. May I have a look?<eos> Certainly, Father.<eos> Sid!<eos> Can you ask Inspector Mallory to meet me at the brewery?<eos> There's been another murder!<eos> Are you really prepared to let Harry and Rose be punished for something you did?
The redundancy notices you sent.<eos> Handwriting matches Owen's suicide note.<eos> Even an amateur graphologist would notice the similarities.<eos> Perhaps he had the same teacher as a boy.<eos> Owen was illiterate.<eos> He didn't kill himself.<eos> You shot him.<eos> That's quite a leap.<eos> Your alibi was, by his own admission, drunk.<eos> Simple matter for you to wait until he went to sleep, and then slip away.
It's a long story, but I like men.<eos> Well.<eos> - If you don't need anything else...<eos> - Yes, actually... I wanted to give you a present for you Saint Day.<eos> It's just a small thing.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Thank you so much, Miss.<eos> - No one's ever given me a present.<eos> - Well, it is about time.<eos> You are a very good person.
The "Apollo", and "Adonis and Venus" are there - and the "Psyche and Cupid" that I painted.<eos> - Those will be the next ones they steal.<eos> We should watch them tonight.<eos> - What a disaster.<eos> - What's wrong now, Velázquez?<eos> They could not have let me come on a sadder mission.<eos> I must make sure that my paintings are not stolen so that they can become fuel for the flames.<eos> Do you know how much time I dedicated to them?<eos> - The love that I painted them with?<eos> - I understand, really, perfectly, but you know that the Ministry's main objective is that history doesn't change.
We don't know what their plan is.<eos> The first one to see the thieves,<eos> - should advise the rest.<eos> - And what shall I do?<eos> We can't put you in any danger, Velázquez.<eos> - Salvador's orders.<eos> - I am supposed to stay here, and miss all the excitement, the adventure?<eos> Useless, like... like Goya's "Puppet".<eos> On the contrary.<eos> You will be in charge of communications,
Right.<eos> But why risk your life to help us?<eos> I've been risking my life for many months now.<eos> Also, I want to ask a favor in return.<eos> Ah, of course, I understand.<eos> Don't destroy the original works of art from the Alcázar.<eos> Do you want them to decorate your living room?<eos> I want them to stay here, in the Ministry, under your care.<eos> Fine, I accept.<eos> You liquidate Darrow... and I'll save the paintings.
Where have you been?<eos> I thought you had died.<eos> That would make your life easier, right?<eos> What happened to the mission?<eos> Do you have the paintings?<eos> "I'm going to answer your second question first.<eos> The paintings are here, in the Ministry of Time."<eos> And the mission... - is over.<eos> - "What are you talking about?"<eos> You promised me the art.
There are many things about my past that I do not know.<eos> In Madrid, in the '80s there was a rash of babies being stolen shortly after birth.<eos> I've treated you like a queen, little girl.<eos> We are traveling to your time and your city.<eos> Is there no danger of running into another you?<eos> How is it possible that the young woman we've seen will end up changed into such a monster?<eos> If you don't let me go, I'll kill the boy.<eos> I'll kill him.<eos> Agents, time is running out and we've got nothing.<eos> Do you have children?
It's fine.<eos> I see that you also admire Clara Campoamor.<eos> Yes, her and all the women the fought for their freedom and their rights.<eos> Irene Larra.<eos> Julia, Julia Lozano.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Miss.<eos> - What year are those pictures from?<eos> - 1930.<eos> If they're that old, why are you in them?
Then I'm inviting you for coffee since it's getting cold out.<eos> Not again.<eos> - Is something wrong?<eos> - No.<eos> I think that instead of a coffee I'll have some chamomile tea.<eos> Very good.<eos> Now I have both of their DNA.<eos> I'll send it to the lab immediately.<eos> There's something I don't understand.<eos> You say that she isn't among the known "Hatless Women".
I wish I had died, like the son that I'll bring into this world.<eos> Well, I see that you've learned all about your future.<eos> - And I'm going to tell you about it.<eos> - Me?<eos> Why?<eos> So that it pains you.<eos> My son will die from hunger.<eos> Because I'll be so poor and so starved... that my breasts won't make milk.<eos> When they write about me they'll say that it will be what drives me insane.<eos> Do you have children?
Do you have children?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Take good care of them.<eos> When I get out of here I'll pray that they won't suffer as will.<eos> Look, Mister, you can iterrogate me for 100 days and nights and I won't tell you anything more because I don't know anything more.<eos> But if, when you find her, you need me for anything, I swear that I will help you.<eos> - I'll do whatever you ask.<eos> - Why should I believe you?<eos> So far you've only helped yourself escape the police.<eos> At the end of the day, you are the Vampire.
This is the first time you've been to the clinic, right?<eos> - Yes, doctor. - Have a seat, please.<eos> Fine, tell me what brings you here.<eos> Some friends of ours reccommended that we come here after learning about our...<eos> - problem.<eos> - More like, mine.<eos> I can't have children.<eos> - You're looking for a second opinion.<eos> - We've already had one.<eos> You are an expert.
We want to be parents more than anything...<eos> We know that there are many children that need a family.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - It's a shame that there is so much buerocratic red tape because the most important thing<eos> - is that those children are loved.<eos> - Also, we wouldn't mind raising a child that wasn't a baby.<eos> I suppose that it is more difficult for those that are not so young.<eos> Money wouldn't be a problem, if there was someone who could facilitate such a transaction.<eos> I think that it would be best if you left. I am not who you think I am.<eos> We know perfectly well who you are:

I am not who you think I am.<eos> We know perfectly well who you are:<eos> a bastard that deals in children.<eos> Get out of here right now.<eos> Not before you help us find this woman.<eos> Marga, call security right away.<eos> "Right away, Doctor Madrigal."<eos> Who are you?
Two sisters seperated in time.<eos> How cruel.<eos> Do you see her?<eos> No.<eos> You know what awaits you if you have lied to us, yes?<eos> She'll come, I swear I haven't lied.<eos> Even if you haven't lied, I'd love to leave you alone with my friend here.<eos> I'm not a criminal.<eos> I make a lot of people happy.<eos> Are you fucking kidding? You steal children from their parents.
Mmhm, or try to escape through another door.<eos> - Warn security.<eos> - And the boy?<eos> If she feels threatened she's capable of anything.<eos> If she kills that boy she'll change history.<eos> Surely.<eos> I think there is a way to avoid all that.<eos> - Well, I see that you need me now.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You said that if we needed your help, you would give it to us.

you were bringing someone else.<eos> If it were up to me, I'd go home right now.<eos> - No...<eos> - This is Sonia, my daughter.<eos> I wanted her to witness my victory.<eos> Dad, can you stop talking nonsense, please?<eos> They're going to cover up all this for you?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Nice to meet you, Sonia.<eos> You're right.
Lombardi has changed history.<eos> Only we noticed the change because we were traveling in time.<eos> Those in the present didn't notice the big change?<eos> They assume it's indisputable truth.<eos> Let's suppose you are right, that Lombardi isn't the most important man in the 15th century but instead is just a tv personality that has traveled in time<eos> And that New Lombardía is really called Colombia.<eos> Already that's a lot to suppose.<eos> If that's true why haven't any alarms gone off?<eos> Why haven't there been any warnings?<eos> You said that not all the doors have agents.
Speak, you damned Portuguese.<eos> Eh... - "Boa noite".<eos> - Not a good night at all. Who are you?<eos> Why are you taking this man?<eos> We are...<eos> Cristiano... and Ronaldo.<eos> Are you not mercenaries working for King Joao?<eos> No. "Non, non, non,".<eos> We are traders of towels and codfish.<eos> Who are you?
I got multiple calls from new York.<eos> Multiple.<eos> If it's one thing I fucking hate, it's calls from New York.<eos> I moved to paradise to get away from those assholes in New York.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I know it was a bad look, Mr. Anderson.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And it's why I didn't want to go on the air in the first place.<eos> And you were the one who put me up to it.
Psst. - I add a small glass of liqueur too.<eos> - Sure, why not?<eos> Animal fats, industrial sugars, alcohol, coffee...<eos> A good cigar... and we're all going to die!<eos> We're all going to die!<eos> But what makes our tiramisu really special, the key ingredient, is the last one.<eos> And what is the last one?<eos> - Who's the last one?<eos> - Me.<eos> What drugs are you selling?
But I found my doctor, who gave me some very good pills.<eos> Good for you. And how is it going?<eos> - How is it going what? - Okay.<eos> Right.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Who's the last one?<eos> - You.<eos> Of course I'm the last one, I've just arrived.<eos> - I mean, who's going in before me? - I am. - What?<eos> If I had said I was the last one, to the next one arriving, you would have said
- Who's the last one?<eos> - You.<eos> Of course I'm the last one, I've just arrived.<eos> - I mean, who's going in before me? - I am. - What?<eos> If I had said I was the last one, to the next one arriving, you would have said<eos> - I was the last one.<eos> - And she's right.<eos> Who's the last one?<eos> It's him, even if he's pretending he's not.<eos> No, you're the last one. Salespersons always enter last.

Sorry, but...<eos> We were saying? Are you staying with us?<eos> He is.<eos> We're really close.<eos> Were you talking?<eos> Please, continue.<eos> You even have Franco's permission to talk.<eos> - We're really, really close.<eos> - How nice.<eos> In his firm, you get a percentage, a minimum income or...?
Look, for example, we have this little cream here.<eos> As you suggest, when the baby's bottom is red, you need to use a cream.<eos> What I suggest is that a little olive oil is enough.<eos> - That's what you suggest? - Of course.<eos> If that's your suggestion...<eos> Then...<eos> In Salutex, we'd like to be a little closer to you - and to your ward.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You tell me what you need. We need a painting in the Ward's chapel. Isn't that right, Sister Mary?
What do you like?<eos> A still-life painting, a washed up whale, a beautiful Pierrot?<eos> It was very fashionable, it still is, with his tear.<eos> A painting from Mantegna.<eos> Right. Mantegna?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - If you like Mantegna...<eos> I'm not very familiar with these foreign minor painters. So...<eos> Mantegna. This Mr. Mantegna, do we contact him or do you contact him?<eos> You give me an e-mail address, a phone number and I'll take care of it.
- Years of mortgage!<eos> - Mortgage...<eos> What the fuck are you laughing at?<eos> - No, no. Sir, I'll handle it. Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - You're really stylish and in perfect shape. - Thank you.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Very well. What...?<eos> Really stylish.<eos> You're really good looking, sir. Got it. That's enough.
Careful, many patients had problems with these tools.<eos> We can't take this risk. This is too risky. I don't feel like doing this.<eos> Had it come to your mind earlier, we could have cleaned, packed and dispatched it all, and that's it.<eos> How can we do that by tomorrow? It's too risky.<eos> If that's the problem, we can do that.<eos> Then why are we still talking about it?<eos> Of course that's the problem! Come on, hurry!<eos> Here. 2.880.000, also with a small margin profit.<eos> Perfect! Prepare the papers and print them.<eos> Clean, pack! Go, hurry, hurry! What are you laughing at?
- Which ones?<eos> - They looked like those these guys are wearing.<eos> - Did you give them my clothes?<eos> - Yes, are you happy?<eos> - Shall we clean your glass? - No.<eos> - Can you give me one euro?<eos> One euro?<eos> I already gave you my clothes. Isn't that enough?<eos> Father, after the ceremony, we're going to have something to eat altogether.<eos> Are you joining us?
- What the hell are you doing?<eos> Let's see how long he survives without us!<eos> I realize that we are all in an unusually stressful situation... that does not bring out the best in us, so I'm willing to forget this.<eos> That's because I'm a reasonable man.<eos> And if you think otherwise, then you really don't want to meet the people who spend their days plotting to take my seat.<eos> I'm sorry to be the bearer of unpleasant truths, Katie... but I'm the best there is.<eos> And I really am trying to help you.<eos> Situation report.<eos> We're close. She has him.<eos> What are you waiting for?
That was impressive.<eos> Well, I work better with quiet.<eos> Wait, so the plan is that the three of us are gonna keep 100 of the world's most ancient vampires occupied?<eos> Well, there could be another way.<eos> All you have to do is get us to the front door.<eos> Are we close?<eos> A few more minutes.<eos> That's a cute kid.<eos> Yeah. She is.<eos> She the reason you're here?
In the meantime, if you stayed put, maybe they could devote more of their energy to finding out who's got their hands on that missing white oak bullet.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I believe you already have.<eos> So, if you're looking for an easy target, you're looking in the wrong place.<eos> Some free advice, Mr. Griffith?<eos> Know when you're outmatched.<eos> I was expecting more of a fight from the regent of New Orleans.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm just a hired gun.<eos> Unfortunately, you're in my way.
No?<eos> And why is that?<eos> 'Cause it requires steps, Foster.<eos> You think the Farrells stole a 10-ton backhoe?<eos> Hauled it up Shay mountain.<eos> How'd they do that?<eos> As the witty sports analysts like to say, the film don't lie.<eos> Dina, can I get a, uh, I-128, please?<eos> Dina?<eos> Well, you just go on. Fill this one out to the best of your ability.
Well, you just go on. Fill this one out to the best of your ability.<eos> You do the top part. Don't do that down there.<eos> That's us. And, uh, that'll let the whole process get started.<eos> And by filling this out, that means you're gonna head on up there - to retrieve our stolen property?<eos> - Yeah. That's the first step of the process.<eos> And what are the other ones?<eos> Well, ma'am, I don't see nobody in those photos, much less a Farrell.<eos> Deputy, if I go to bed at night and there's no snow on the ground, and I Wake up to a blanket of snow,<eos> I'm pretty damn sure it snowed.<eos> Well, you fill that out.
Do you know where that might be?<eos> So how do you know this?<eos> Told you, Sheriff, I know all sorts of things.<eos> You know, I mean, I know all sorts of things, too.<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> I know who each of these men are.<eos> And, uh, I know they were all in a meeting in your office yesterday.<eos> Are you having me followed?<eos> No, I'm having them watched.<eos> But everywhere they go, you keep popping up.
Excuse me?<eos> Are one of you girls using the toilet stall as a babysitter again?<eos> 'Cause if so, Donnie's gonna flip.<eos> I just really need my mom.<eos> Baby, girl, we all do.<eos> I think I got my period.<eos> [Gasps] Okay, what's your mom's name? - Robin.<eos> - Do you know her stage name?<eos> Mommy?<eos> You're a mean person.
You don't seem to have a strong relationship with your wife.
You don't seem to have a strong relationship with your wife.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Our relationship is rock-solid.<eos> You lied to her about getting fired. You lied to her about the real reason you were going on vacation, which was to get your job back.<eos> - Do you tell your wife everything?
- Yeah, I'm gonna tell him tonight.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not on board with that.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna mention any names, but I can't start a new life with a lie.<eos> Welcome to Gender Now!<eos> I'm Professor Harper, and we're gonna kick things off with a pop quiz.<eos> Now, the quiz is only one question:<eos> "Do you consider yourself a feminist?"<eos> Show of hands, feminists.<eos> You, please state why.
- according to you.<eos> - I didn't<eos> - say that. - Well, I may be dumb, but I'm not blind.<eos> Well, I'm not dumb either.<eos> You guys are an item.<eos> Finally there's something I can work with.<eos> We just had a Twitter fling.<eos> There's nothing going on here, Cat.<eos> Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter, please.<eos> - Excuse me, who are you?
You guys are an item.<eos> Finally there's something I can work with.<eos> We just had a Twitter fling.<eos> There's nothing going on here, Cat.<eos> Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter, please.<eos> - Excuse me, who are you?<eos> - That's my editor.<eos> Oh, naturally.<eos> I can assure you there is nothing here to promote.<eos> And who are you, Salman Rushdie?
- Yeah, sure.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Were you looking for this?<eos> Uh, no, I don't need that anymore.<eos> - That's actually why I'm here.<eos> - Oh. I shouldn't have left class early the other day. I should have stayed and told you and everybody else what I think.<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm not a 20-year-old millennial fluent in gender-normative whatever.<eos> I do know that feminism shouldn't be about attacking other women's choices.<eos> And by the way, you telling us to draw ourselves naked is exploitative and creepy, even if you're trying to expand our consciousness, which...
Kate practiced with me for weeks to prepare.<eos> She wrote down talking points on 3x5 cards, told me to tell a few jokes.<eos> Kate couldn't tell a joke 'cause she'd always blow the punch line.<eos> Anyway, the... the cards were in her purse.<eos> When I couldn't find her in the office, I figured she'd be on the roof.<eos> She liked it up there.<eos> But we didn't find any 3x5 cards on the roof or by your wife.<eos> Why would I lie about this?<eos> Why does anybody lie, Mr. Warner?<eos> You think I killed my wife.
As next of kin, you're entitled to a copy and a receipt for the contents.<eos> I want to see what's inside before you take it.<eos> - Do you have a key to the box?<eos> I didn't know Kate had one until recently.<eos> Interesting.<eos> You didn't want to report it to the police?<eos> Where were you two weeks ago on Wednesday night?<eos> Why are you asking me questions without my attorney?<eos> I can ask.<eos> You don't have to answer.

Any crazy boyfriends or husbands trying to run you off?<eos> The only women I see are on pay-per-view. - Why?<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Just what we need.<eos> Mr. Warner, Mr. Oliver.<eos> I understand there was some trouble here this evening.<eos> What are you doing here, Detective?<eos> One of your neighbors heard a fight and called the cops.<eos> I recognized the address.<eos> Do you sleep?
We suspended one of the captains of the basketball team.<eos> I show you this in confidence.<eos> Here's the notice of his suspension.<eos> We don't play favorites.<eos> Every student is treated equally.<eos> I understand Ms. Blaine may feel otherwise, but we've done all that we can.<eos> Even at that, she's dissatisfied with our response.<eos> She's apparently dissatisfied with the police response, too.<eos> It might be more productive to focus on why her son was out binge drinking in the first place.<eos> I hope you'll give that equal weight in your article.
I will be back for both of you, shortly.<eos> _<eos> Mr. Desai... your duties are about to expand greatly.<eos> You will be pleased to learn that we have a great need for a helpful human confederate.<eos> That's very good to hear, Mr. Eichhorst.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Humans... think of evolution in terms of progress and advancement.<eos> This final errand will be the catalyzing event precipitating a new era on Earth, akin to the meteor that felled the dinosaurs and ushered in the Ice Age.<eos> I'm honored, sir... and humbled.<eos> Once we dock, you will take the suitcase and place it exactly where I showed you on the map.
Where is he?<eos> Waiting to make sure he isn't being set up.<eos> How do we know we're not being set up?<eos> We don't, but you wanted to meet him.<eos> So, you're the guy, huh?<eos> What do I call you?<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Care to explain, Mr. "Whatever-You-Want,"<eos> why I should trust a man willing to stab his own friends in the back?<eos> Because you're a survivor, like me.
- What was that all about?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Mother?<eos> I'll be patient, Mother.<eos> Sheriff?<eos> I-I need to see Norma Bates.<eos> Sheriff, I'm... I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - What drawer did you put her in?<eos> I don't think it's a good idea for you to be in here.
Yes, but-but we must...<eos> we must trust God.<eos> We must trust his plan.<eos> Like children, we must blindly f...<eos> E-excuse me.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Oh, I have something for you.<eos> Stop it!<eos> This is... this is a church!<eos> I think it would be best if you leave.
Are you okay?<eos> - Get away! - What?<eos> Get away from him.<eos> Get away from this man.<eos> - But he's my father.<eos> - It's not anymore! - Get away!<eos> - You're crazy!<eos> He's my son, are you crazy?<eos> Do yourself a favor, get out of here, go!<eos> You are crazy, you need help!
- Get away! - What?<eos> Get away from him.<eos> Get away from this man.<eos> - But he's my father.<eos> - It's not anymore! - Get away!<eos> - You're crazy!<eos> He's my son, are you crazy?<eos> Do yourself a favor, get out of here, go!<eos> You are crazy, you need help!<eos> Lady, please go, you're crazy!
- It's not anymore! - Get away!<eos> - You're crazy!<eos> He's my son, are you crazy?<eos> Do yourself a favor, get out of here, go!<eos> You are crazy, you need help!<eos> Lady, please go, you're crazy!<eos> You've killed your family since the day you went on that ritual.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Who are you?
And if you can help me find them, I'll be eternally grateful.<eos> I'm glad you became a priest, clung to God, because, in the end, he is the only salvation.<eos> As for your father, I cannot say the same.<eos> But that's just it, my father.<eos> After the day I bumped into you in the square, my father came home...<eos> He shot himself in the head in front of the whole family.<eos> And until today, I've been looking for answers, I don't know why he did it.<eos> Father Jaime, already deceased, without the help of the Vatican, suspected that he was possessed by a demon, called Alus Mabus.<eos> And your father, of course, in the last act of faith, did what he did to save you, not him.<eos> But how do you know all this?
And your father, of course, in the last act of faith, did what he did to save you, not him.<eos> But how do you know all this?<eos> I'm Lúcia,<eos> I worked with Father Jaime for 15 years, that is the reason.<eos> Oh, I knew!<eos> Look, Mrs. Lúcia, you removed a gigantic weight off my back.<eos> And I thank you for that.<eos> Deep down, I already knew, I just needed to listen.<eos> Good, excuse me now.<eos> Mrs. Lúcia, do you live near here?
I don't have the strength anymore.<eos> Go!<eos> It can be very dangerous.<eos> - Careful, my brother! Watch out!<eos> - Go on, quickly!<eos> Quickly.<eos> Watch out!<eos> Let me release you.<eos> What happened here?<eos> You are...
What is going on?<eos> Why am I tied up?<eos> What's happening, Father Thomas?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Father Thomas, it's me Lucas.<eos> Lucas, your friend.<eos> It is you!<eos> Father Lucas, my friend!<eos> Father Thomas, if anything is dominating you, some evil force, resist!<eos> You're stronger than that.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Look, uh...<eos> You know, I know that things are really, um... Really scary right now.<eos> They're scary for all of us.<eos> And, uh, you know, whatever it is, y-y-you know, you could have talked to your dad.<eos> You could have come to me.<eos> Yeah, well, you know you can talk to me.<eos> You suspended me, Coach.
And I need to get a better look at how they made my suit autonomous.<eos> Well, why don't you take Martin and Jax with you?<eos> Ms. Lance, Mr. Snart, and I will work on locating Savage.<eos> Tor Degaton holds daily meetings with his board of directors.<eos> And it's open to the public?<eos> 'Course not.<eos> Just Kasnia's shareholders.<eos> I hate to break it to you, but we're not shareholders.<eos> I'm more of a hard asset man, myself.<eos> You're clear to attend.
How did you know, Doctor...<eos> Lecter...<eos> Dr. Hannibal Lecter.<eos> So how did you get into robotics, Dr. Brice?<eos> Oh, well, it's in my blood.<eos> Robotics have been a passion of my family ever since my great-great-great-great grandfather founded this company.<eos> Is that...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Huh, weird.<eos> You look just like him. Yes, I...
- He always finds us.<eos> Maybe this life is different.<eos> Do you honestly believe that?<eos> Look... all I know is that Savage is not the only thing that's immortal, my love.<eos> So is this.<eos> What do genocidal maniacs dream about, I wonder?<eos> He's imagining himself baking cookies with his mother.<eos> Wait, you can monitor our dreams?<eos> Of course.<eos> For example, last night, you had a rollicking fantasy involving a young nurse...
How many hospitals did you help build?<eos> Negative three.<eos> Oh,myGod, I've got a cool teacher.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> I'm sitting up straight, and my hands are folded like a nerd.<eos> I've got to fix that.<eos> Yes?<eos> Now one's up in the air.<eos> Okay, let's show this innocent young veteran what happens when you call on Bart Simpson.<eos> Ma'am, my name is Bart, and I just want to say how delighted I am that you're here.
Bundy's five minutes out.<eos> Keep the press out of here.<eos> No statements or photos until we get this place spotless.<eos> - We control the narrative.<eos> - Of course.<eos> And before you leave, Mr. Nelson and Miss Page wanted a word.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Just one? Can I get that in writing?<eos> Oh, because written agreements suddenly mean something to you?<eos> You wanted your client in witness protection, right?
- I'm not gonna tell you again.<eos> - Quiet!<eos> Sit down!<eos> - Yeah? We're not startin' nothin', man!<eos> - He's the one that started it, all right?<eos> - You keep it up, you're out of here. You're a dead man, you understand?<eos> As soon as you get out.<eos> Hey, listen up.<eos> Police are waiting to take you into custody.<eos> The last thing I need is for you to come back here in two weeks, asking what happened, and blaming one of our people for your mistakes.
Uh, it's just... just a rat.<eos> We exterminated.<eos> Lot of guys... they half-ass it.<eos> Remember my uncle used to tell me that all the time.<eos> Hard work.<eos> Yeah, well.<eos> It's all he could get after the war.<eos> You know, curse of a soldier. Ain't that the truth.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You serve?
Nicole Kent got booted from your office after she failed to quiet the EnSynth scandal.<eos> Chris Davidson... did you ever meet him?<eos> Fired after the State Supreme Court disqualified your entire office from the Pell case due to "widespread misconduct."<eos> "Widespread."<eos> But not everyone got fired.<eos> See, Reyes walked out in one piece.<eos> She's good at throwing people to the wolves.<eos> So, sure, she can take down Nelson and Murdock this month, but how long before you are getting pulled into the shit with the rest of us?<eos> You trying to scare me?<eos> I am here to show you that you and Reyes are not on the same team.
And I have volunteered to perform at a charity event that she's organizing for a group of disadvantaged children.<eos> So, I'm excited to get down there.<eos> -Hello, there.<eos> -Oh, hello. Welcome, sir.<eos> Blumquist, AJ. They should have the John Wayne suite ready.<eos> Okay, we actually have you for the Slim Pickens suite.<eos> I don't think so. I think I'm in the John Wayne suite.<eos> I made a reservation. I got a confirmation number right here.<eos> -Okay. Yeah, let me take a look at that. -Sure.<eos> No, sir, you're actually in the Slim Pickens suite.
And you can't trust Wikipedia, either.<eos> Yeah, not everything on Wikipedia is true.<eos> Who made this complaint?<eos> I'm sorry, but rule 22C states that the president cannot disclose the identity of the formal complainant.<eos> -I don't know what to say.<eos> Um... -Please don't cry.<eos> I'm an armadillo.<eos> We're not the Leaping Squaws anymore.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But since you are representing something that might be considered offensive, this could be grounds for disqualification.

Come in.<eos> I was just watching a documentary on a sushi chef that works in a subway station.<eos> I don't eat sushi and I don't take subways, but it's interesting to me.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> The pride he took in his work, you know?<eos> Anyways... I have some good news.<eos> My sentence has been commuted.<eos> You're a funny criminal.<eos> --But no.<eos> I pulled some strings... and I've arranged for you to lead a cooking class.
I see.<eos> Thinking of calling it, the...<eos> King of the Kitchen... - Ah.<eos> - ...or, um, "Le Cordon King."<eos> Well, I hope this doesn't sound impolite, but I'd like to decline your considerate offer.<eos> Is that so?<eos> No, I mean, by all means, put me to work.<eos> I would love to learn a new trade, maybe plumbing or... or electricals.<eos> Mmm, well, electrical is, uh... poorly managed.<eos> Well, you choose. You're the expert.
How are you?<eos> Good, good.<eos> They do whatever they want.<eos> They can easily fit more than 10 there.<eos> - What do you charge for the room?<eos> - 300 euros.<eos> - For the view, huh?<eos> - It's downtown.<eos> My colleague will come and talk with you about the 300 euros and see what he thinks.<eos> Your colleague is probably aware, I'm surprised you aren't.
Yes.<eos> Did you ever notice an elderly man go in right before or after she was here?<eos> There are two hostals in the building, so there's no way to know.<eos> Would you have the address of her other house?<eos> Not on me, but I'll get it from the office.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> Detective Velarde, Detective Alfaro.<eos> We'd like to ask you some questions about the previous tenant. - Antonia Alvarez.<eos> You're her niece? - Yes, I am.
We can't rule out any... possibilities.<eos> - Velarde, we checked the file and found something odd.<eos> The other son's alibi was that he dropped off his mother outside because he couldn't park but he got a parking ticket that same night.<eos> I see.<eos> He has to be lying to us.<eos> We're going to question him tomorrow.<eos> - Good...<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> Velarde...<eos> You said that... you dropped off your mother that night and went home, right?
- Your husband...<eos> - He died 2 years ago.<eos> Wow, I'm sorry.<eos> That's life, you know.<eos> Husbands always die first.<eos> - No boyfriend?<eos> - A boyfriend at my age?<eos> How silly!<eos> This is it.<eos> You must have been gorgeous.
And a third, as well.<eos> Let it go.<eos> I'm sure you're wondering why I've asked you here.<eos> I assume it's because you want to use me as a pawn in your quiet battle with my mother and uncle.<eos> No.<eos> The people are upset.<eos> Our polls show a referendum to abolish would pass in a landslide.<eos> When it does, what change will you be able to affect then?<eos> Who said I wanted to change things?<eos> You did.

You're going to be removed from incarceration and absolved of any charges.<eos> And my position?<eos> My work?<eos> I can't forgive you for betraying me, Lucius.<eos> I can't and I won't.<eos> Then, with all due respect, Your Majesty... ..I killed the King of England.<eos> And I will remain in prison till my dying day.<eos> We're going to absolve you of all charges.<eos> You will not!<eos> All the work we put into this, all the sacrifices we made... you made... ..the monarchy cannot overcome another scandal.
I didn't know who else to call.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> May I speak to you?<eos> First child?<eos> Children change everything.<eos> Yes.<eos> King Simon said that very thing.<eos> You were close to Simon.<eos> Until you had me dismissed. Yes.
I know everything I need to know about the King.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Then hear me as a mother.<eos> Royalty is irreversible.<eos> If you expose your son to this life, to this world, there's no going back.<eos> Do you see this place?<eos> Do you think I enjoy living like this?<eos> That I want my son to live like this?<eos> Well, my son is going to enjoy the same life that you have.<eos> And, once I marry the King, I'll be Queen and you'll be irrelevant.
I know you've struggled.<eos> Believe it or not, I did once, as well.<eos> But this decision you're making is forever.<eos> And it's not just your forever.<eos> It's your son's, as well.<eos> The moment he's born, his life will be public and destined and not his own.<eos> And Cyrus will be his greatest influence.<eos> Consider that.<eos> I have. And I've made my decision.<eos> And now I would like you to go.
Deal with your homicidal mother.<eos> I need to try to fix a 30-year tragedy.<eos> And, Mum, if anything comes up about Dominique...<eos> Don't.<eos> It was driving me crazy like that.<eos> As you wish.<eos> I just wanted to check on you.<eos> - I'll leave you to it.<eos> - James?<eos> You are who you say you are, yes?
The jig is up.<eos> The what?<eos> The ruse.<eos> The scheme.<eos> They know I've been seeing them both.<eos> Well, you can stand down.<eos> Cyrus is expecting a son and plans to reinstate the right of primogeniture.<eos> Stand down?<eos> His first born son is going to inherit everything.<eos> The jig, as you say, is now officially up.
You're a brave man to take over during such difficult times.<eos> I just want to make sure we find a manageable resolution to this oil...<eos> I've read some of your books, Mr. President.<eos> I just finished Learning to Learn.<eos> It was good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There was a chapter on visualization that really interested me.<eos> Yes, it's a... a tool for students.<eos> It helps them...<eos> I would like you to visualize something.
It was good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There was a chapter on visualization that really interested me.<eos> Yes, it's a... a tool for students.<eos> It helps them...<eos> I would like you to visualize something.<eos> Now, you're standing in the tundra.<eos> Um, wind, snow... machines drilling through the ice, long pipelines stretching to the horizon. Do you see?<eos> If you want to talk about Siberia, I'm more than happy to...<eos> No, no, no. You're not visualizing, Mr. Vice President.
I agree with you. The less control the Chinese have, the better.<eos> Then why did you send Milkin to China?<eos> You weren't negotiating with us.<eos> We thought they might have more luck.<eos> Their demands would leave us worse off than we were before.<eos> I can get the IMF to provide half the bailout.<eos> This would counteract the Chinese demands for drilling rights...<eos> - You are playing us off each other.<eos> - Mr. President...<eos> I think you're in over your head, Mr. Blythe.
Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton have a proposal about how to deal with Russia.<eos> I imagine I'm the last person you expected to see today.<eos> I am a bit surprised, yes, to see both of you.<eos> I'm sure there's some wariness about us being here, but I think we have a good plan on how to handle Russia.<eos> Would you like to join us?<eos> Raymond can lay it out for you.<eos> Well, I don't know what I can offer.<eos> Well, we're going to catch some flack if word gets out that I'm back in business with the White House.<eos> You could help us smooth that over.
- You seem nervous.<eos> - It's been a while.<eos> What should I do, boss?<eos> Dr. Saxon.<eos> - I'd like to donate.<eos> - Mr. Stamper...<eos> My blood type is O. I'm healthy.<eos> Let's do the tests.<eos> That's not the only criteria for donation.<eos> You're a recovering alcoholic.
The attorney general says you pressured her to look into Lucas Goodwin's claims--<eos> I've read the attorney general's statement.<eos> We also have a deposition from a young woman, a staffer, who says Goodwin posed as a volunteer at an event in Cincinnati on March 8th.<eos> Did you meet with Mr. Goodwin?<eos> I shake hundreds of people's hands at every event.<eos> If he was in Cincinnati, there's a chance I may have shaken his.<eos> But the claim that he and I met one-on-one...<eos> So you're saying you didn't meet with him?<eos> We have phone records, Ms. Dunbar.<eos> You did speak to the attorney general.
Madam Secretary, I believe my people were very clear, hmm?<eos> Would you give us a moment, please, Cathy?<eos> Just a little while.<eos> I'll be outside.<eos> So... how is surgery going?<eos> So far, so good.<eos> Ah, you must be exhausted.<eos> Now, sit. Sit.<eos> I imagine you'd rather be at the hospital.<eos> Well, this is too important, and you weren't going to negotiate with Secretary Durant.
So far, so good.<eos> Ah, you must be exhausted.<eos> Now, sit. Sit.<eos> I imagine you'd rather be at the hospital.<eos> Well, this is too important, and you weren't going to negotiate with Secretary Durant.<eos> What makes you think I'll negotiate with you?<eos> Oh, well, isn't that why we're sitting here?<eos> Maybe I just wanted to... see your face again.<eos> Maybe I'm fond of it.<eos> You are a beautiful woman, Mrs. Underwood, hmm?
"Shame on you... Mr. President."<eos> Really, Viktor?<eos> Are we gonna dredge that up?<eos> An apology would do... if you want to negotiate...<eos> Well, you would lose respect for me if I apologized.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, this is true.<eos> I'm not here for a sightseeing trip, Viktor.<eos> So, Francis needs a liver and I need a bailout.<eos> - What do you need?
Nothing.<eos> A pretty face.<eos> So, yes, play the president if you like.<eos> Go.<eos> Tell the Chinese they get nothing on the Pacific.<eos> You think you can do that, Mrs. Underwood?<eos> Your people are hurting.<eos> Six months at most, they're gonna be marching on Red Square.<eos> I'm done letting you have your dignity.<eos> The truth is you're a beggar on your knees, and you will take whatever we shove down your throat.
Madam Secretary.<eos> Joint control of zones 61 and 67.<eos> We've got an agreement, pending the president's approval.<eos> Well, he's sleeping now.<eos> They're moving him back to the White House soon.<eos> - And how did he seem?<eos> - I only talked to him briefly, but the doctors say the organ is... taking well so far.<eos> They're expecting a quick recovery.<eos> You've done an outstanding job, Mr. President.<eos> - So have you, Claire.
You boys have any experience with law enforcement?<eos> Well, I have a fair bit of experience fighting crime.<eos> Congratulations, then.<eos> You're making me your deputy?<eos> Nope.<eos> Just made you the new sheriff.<eos> - Excuse me. - Stillwater gang has been shooting up this town for months now.<eos> It's only by the grace of the good Lord that I'm not pushing up daisies myself.<eos> And I am done with pushing my luck.<eos> But you're the... sheriff.
That was my fault, Professor.<eos> Et tu, Gideon?<eos> I suppose this is going to earn me a lecture on the perils of upsetting the timeline by introducing futuristic medicine to the 19th century.<eos> Well, it seems you've already given it to yourself.<eos> Except this isn't futuristic medicine.<eos> I've had Gideon fabricate simple streptomycin for me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Which won't be used in medical treatments for another 70 years.<eos> This is about a boy in town who's dying of an easily curable disease.<eos> Just as you couldn't turn your back on Jeb Stillwater and his gang, I can't turn mine on this boy and his mother.
Yeah.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I don't think we're done here yet.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> They found us.<eos> Ah, friends!<eos> Welcome.<eos> I think you'll find this slightly more effective than your current sidearm.<eos> Yes, I will be wanting that back, by the way.<eos> And you'll be needing this.
- I know, terrifying.<eos> - Also inaccurate.<eos> Look... that article was corroborated by multiple sources.<eos> NYPD, DA's office, we even had some eyewitnesses.<eos> Yes, everything that you reported is correct. It's what you haven't reported that bothers me.<eos> The article is inaccurate by omission.<eos> Okay, come here, come here.<eos> Excuse me, please.<eos> Go.<eos> Right, did you know that two years ago, Lieutenant Frank Castle was awarded the Navy Cross for his service in Afghanistan, right?
He had a family.<eos> He had a wife, Maria Elizabeth, a daughter, Lisa Barbara, and a son, Frank Junior.<eos> - Had?<eos> - All dead.<eos> Killed around the same time that Castle was hospitalized for a gunshot wound to the head.<eos> What, so...<eos> What, you're saying that he murdered his family and then shot himself?<eos> Some sort of PTSD murder-suicide attempt?<eos> No, see, if that's what had happened, the DA would have put it in her brief, in flashing neon if she could, because that supports her story that he's a psychopath.<eos> So, what do you think really happened?
I know I will.<eos> Sleep even better when he's dead.<eos> Uh, dead?<eos> Well, lethal injection, probably, although the electric chair is a possibility.<eos> New York doesn't have the death penalty.<eos> Yeah, but Delaware does.<eos> Some Dogs of Hell were murdered out there along Interstate 95.<eos> DA Reyes just has to link the killings to Castle, and then they'll be well within their rights to extradite him.<eos> And... you know...<eos> Are you and DA Reyes friends?
- Get your things and go.<eos> Uh, we have a little bit of business here left.<eos> Frank Castle already has counsel.<eos> So, unless you've asked the public defender for permission to speak to his client, you are in violation of New York legal ethics.<eos> We spoke to the PD this morning.<eos> To be honest, he doesn't seem all that prepared to tackle this case.<eos> Although, he did mention the conversation that you had with him yesterday.<eos> Matt Murdock, is it?<eos> - Yeah, pleasure to meet you. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> You have a reputation of being a smart man, Mr. Murdock.
Uh, 98 lesser...<eos> I mean, felony assault, burglary... criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment...<eos> Any number of criminal mischief charges.<eos> We're so screwed.<eos> You ready to go in?<eos> No.<eos> But considering the arraignment's in a couple hours, we don't have much of a choice.<eos> Time to play twenty questions with a killer.<eos> I've reviewed the charges you're facing.<eos> It's my understanding that... you wish to plead guilty to all of them?
This one, I can't read.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - It's in some kind of code.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> If invoices for drugs and guns and human trafficking aren't encrypted, then what is?<eos> Wow, what are they hiding?<eos> Same time tomorrow, Matthew?<eos> We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars, and decades of planning on this operation.<eos> And now... our most valuable secrets have been stolen.<eos> I'd be very disappointed to learn you aided this theft in any way, Gibson-san.
The Hand will decimate your city.<eos> Not if I stop them.<eos> - You'll die.<eos> - Yeah, maybe. But this is a war I need to fight alone.<eos> Goodbye, Elektra.<eos> The circumstances are unfortunate, but each loss brings opportunity.<eos> - I'm glad we have this chance to meet.<eos> You have something you wanna say to me?<eos> I've been following your case... as much as one could in this cage.<eos> I want you to know...
Uh... you know what?<eos> Actually, I think that, um...<eos> I think you should do this.<eos> - Trial's over. - So?<eos> So, Frank is in prison, and everyone's retreated to their corners, including my bosses, one of whom has repeatedly told me to let it go and move on.<eos> And do you... do you wanna move on?<eos> Case is closed.<eos> Castle tanked his own case.<eos> He got put away.<eos> I just think you should carry the torch on this. - Yeah?
I think I can help you.<eos> But I also think there are other people involved who could really use your help.<eos> I remember you.<eos> You were with the defense.<eos> - I'm not with them now.<eos> - We're with the New York Bulletin.<eos> Please.<eos> After what happened at the courthouse, the mayor asked me to step down.<eos> I know I sound paranoid, but... there have been people following me.<eos> You're a target because of what you know.
Please.<eos> After what happened at the courthouse, the mayor asked me to step down.<eos> I know I sound paranoid, but... there have been people following me.<eos> You're a target because of what you know.<eos> 'Cause whatever that is, they... they want to keep in the dark.<eos> Karen has found something that will bring the truth to light.<eos> Here, uh...<eos> This... is this the body they asked you to make disappear?<eos> - I shouldn't be talking to you.<eos> - I understand you're afraid.
Why am I still alive?<eos> Because plans change.<eos> Because if you want to survive, you adapt. Yes!<eos> The plan was to kill you.<eos> I needed to close that loop.<eos> I'd already made a deal with the rest of the guards.<eos> I doubled the cut that Dutton was paying them.<eos> But that didn't work out, did it?<eos> No, I was wrong.<eos> That's difficult to admit, but... you have a gift, Mr. Castle.
- And I've set you free.<eos> - What does that mean, "free"?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Stay back.<eos> 'Cause everyone warned me that prison would be an inhumane environment.<eos> It is. But I...<eos> I find it refreshing.<eos> The perfect microcosm of the animal world.<eos> When an animal wants something, when it needs something, other things... need to be stepped on.<eos> You want me on the outside so I step on every piece of shit I see.
Could you, uh...<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> Please.<eos> The second chair.<eos> I don't know what your play is, lady, but let's cut the shit.<eos> You brought us in expecting to sweat privileged information about our client out of us.<eos> Yes... if that helps.<eos> We have to get Frank Castle off the street before anyone else gets hurt.<eos> You're asking for favors, after all the shit you've pulled?<eos> If you want our cooperation, then we need to know what you know... all right?
Mind the cane.<eos> You have ten minutes, Mr. Murdock.<eos> We met once before, you and I.<eos> Before you went after me in court.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> It was at an art gallery, several months ago.<eos> I assume you've heard there's been a shooting at the courthouse?<eos> Unfortunate news.<eos> But why does that send you to me?<eos> Because I know you facilitated Frank Castle's escape.
Why would I do that?<eos> Frank Castle's path and mine are so clearly separate.<eos> Lack of motive.<eos> Enough to throw any rational law enforcement agency way off your trail.<eos> But I'm not biting.<eos> Not biting.<eos> He's not biting, Donovan. Barking!<eos> It's what you do.<eos> The scheming, the machinations.<eos> Frank Castle is a killing machine, and you set him free.
I can prove she was an accomplice to every one of your crimes.<eos> And now you're thinking you can serve your sentence, hop on a jet, go to her whenever you like.<eos> Live somewhere like Monaco, or... I don't know, wherever the hell you fat cats go to sun yourselves.<eos> But you can't.<eos> You can visit her, but you'll never live with her.<eos> Because this is New York, Wilson.<eos> You live here.<eos> This is your jungle.<eos> This is your blood, like it is mine.<eos> She will never come... and you'll never leave.
Because this is New York, Wilson.<eos> You live here.<eos> This is your jungle.<eos> This is your blood, like it is mine.<eos> She will never come... and you'll never leave.<eos> You screw with me now, just a little bit... and you'll never really be with your one and only Vanessa ever again.<eos> Speak her name again!<eos> Go ahead!<eos> Yes, the son of a boxer.<eos> You... You are running this place.
-Uh-huh. To show people that Mr. Castle wasn't just the Punisher.<eos> Right, although... how is it a lawyer is writing for a newspaper?<eos> Uh, no. I was a legal assistant.<eos> Past tense?<eos> Uh, turns out, I just have a knack for this.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Uh, may I? Oh, yes, of course.<eos> That's what they're there for.<eos> Thanks.<eos> During the trial, you talked aloud about Castle as a Marine.
Go ahead and pull your car around.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It's been a long night.<eos> Have there been any developments?<eos> Besides making sure Castle's face is plastered across every TV channel and newspaper?<eos> The DA and the medical examiner are dead, the same asshole takes a shot at you, and so far nobody in this entire city's seen a damn thing.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That wasn't, uh, very professional.<eos> Like you said, it's been a long night.
That's where they spread open the body cavity and examine the internal organs.<eos> Maybe it was some sort of freak accident.<eos> Uh, uh, unorthodox open-heart surgery...<eos> Look at him.<eos> He was gutted like a fish.<eos> Claire, you are not seriously suggesting that this guy's been dead before.<eos> Wait a minute, she said what?<eos> All right, that's it. I'm shutting this down.<eos> You and you, out!<eos> And you, not a word to anyone, understand?
Of course, by accepting our offer you'll get a personal assistant, a corner office, and the opportunity to branch out and build your own client base.<eos> Your former associate, Ms. Marci Stahl, recommends you very highly.<eos> And after reviewing the infamous Punisher trial, I would be foolish not to invite a talent like yourself onto our team.<eos> Hopefully, you'll find our starting salary competitive.<eos> That's... one way to describe it.<eos> It gets better.<eos> How does "Hogarth, Chao, Benowitz and Nelson" sound?<eos> Like a mouthful.<eos> A good mouthful.<eos> You think outside of the box, and that is exactly what we're looking for.
Come on, for what?<eos> Why would I...<eos> The jury has to know what happened to you, what you go through every single day.<eos> After this afternoon... I don't think we have any other shot.<eos> What?<eos> And what do you think is gonna happen here?<eos> We're not gonna win this thing.<eos> No, but we can still reduce the charges.<eos> Look, that might not be important to you, but it is important to me.<eos> All of them, they all think that you're a monster.
I estimate the robot should reach our location within the hour.<eos> Our propulsion engine was severely damaged in the crash and is no longer functioning.<eos> So where does that leave us?<eos> All right, our only option is to take the Jumpship and try and outrun it.<eos> The Jumpship seats seven.<eos> The cargo bay's filled with refugees.<eos> I'm well aware.<eos> Well, we can't just leave them there; we...<eos> Martin!<eos> Professor, you are gonna be just fine.
I know their tactics, their weaknesses.<eos> Why the change of heart?<eos> Ask him.<eos> Hey.<eos> I saw Sara.<eos> She said you brought Savage back onto the ship, but she was a little stingy on the details.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Ray, we need to talk.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Well, the team managed to capture Savage, battle his army and a giant robot... and you managed to sleep through all of it.
We need to talk.<eos> We saw what you did to Jax.<eos> And we're worried it's just the beginning.<eos> - The beginning of what?<eos> - It's like I said, Rip.<eos> As long as Savage is alive and on this ship, he is dangerous.<eos> The Time Drive is rebooting. We will soon be on our way.<eos> I'm asking for a little faith, gentlemen.<eos> Sorry, fresh out.<eos> I take it you and Mr. Snart are of the same mind?
Anything worth doing always is.<eos> Well, finally an intellect approximate to my own.<eos> My imprisonment was starting to get dreary, Professor.<eos> I'm not here to play mind games with you.<eos> I'm here to ask you if you remember a night in October, 1975, a place called the Greyhill Building.<eos> That night, you and your acolytes...<eos> Were celebrating the acquisition of your friend Carter Hall's body.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's my understanding this ritual involved you sharing your immortality with your followers.<eos> And you wish for me to do the same for someone else.
Someone dear to you.<eos> Your nuclear counterpart, perhaps?<eos> Yes.<eos> And as impertinent as this may sound, I need your help.<eos> Well, clearly, your friends didn't give you the full account of the ritual.<eos> You see, it was Carter's blood that worked the magic.<eos> Perhaps you should talk to him.<eos> Or better yet, Dr. Palmer.<eos> I'm sure that he would be more than happy to help you spill some.<eos> And I'm certain you would enjoy that.
- What?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Pull up all the surveillance monitors, now!<eos> I'm afraid Vandal Savage has already freed Carter Hall, and is preparing to disengage...<eos> That can't be good.<eos> Gideon's entire operational matrix is offline.<eos> And without her help...<eos> We'll have to make our approach the old-fashioned way.<eos> Shouldn't we be more worried about Savage and his brainwashed crony?<eos> Yes. Which is why I need you and Dr. Palmer to go and recapture him.
In the meantime, if the rest of us can't figure out how to pilot the ship without Gideon, we're never gonna be able to leave the Time Stream.<eos> If we live through this, you bumbling idiot, I might just kill you.<eos> Exactly how old-fashioned are you talking?<eos> So, if the Time Stream is like this vast river, these maps plot the safest course along that river's path.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I keep these here just in case of emergency.<eos> Well, this certainly qualifies.<eos> What's Jurgens Ridge?<eos> Pray you need never find out.<eos> Martin, you're gonna be our engineer.
You remember Mr. Savage?<eos> Of course.<eos> And we remember how you pled for us to remove him from the timeline once before.<eos> Well, as the first Time Master was so fond of saying, that was then, this is now.<eos> Incontrovertible proof that Vandal Savage has been engaged in the manipulation of time!<eos> Including a confession.<eos> When I saw you again in 1975, I realized that time travel was the only explanation.<eos> You showed a caveman fire, and I had almost 200 years to figure out how to strike the flame.<eos> Impressive, Captain Hunter.<eos> You and your team have accomplished what none of us here in the Time Council believed you would.
Who's doing this?<eos> A deep scan of Mr. Palmer's timeline reveals a temporal anomaly on December 19, 2014, in the vicinity of Palmer Technologies.<eos> The Pilgrim.<eos> Gideon, get us to that location now!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm no one.<eos> We have that in common.<eos> We need to get you to cover.<eos> What is that thing? Who is she?<eos> Who are you?
Unfortunately, my plan is opposed by the body Z<eos> In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.<eos> Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> Time Masters.<eos> They took me to a place called the Vanishing Point.<eos> I've spent lifetimes training by them<eos> Mr. Jackson's internal organs are aging at an accelerated rate.<eos> The res of his body will soon follow.<eos> The trip through the Time Stream should reverse you condition.<eos> If we're separated, you'll die.
I'd say I'm making headway.<eos> Okay, look, let me make myself perfectly clear.<eos> I will never, ever, ever sleep with you. Never. Okay?<eos> Got it?<eos> Playing hard to get, I like it.<eos> When Hell freezes over, Lucifer.<eos> I can arrange that, actually.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Well, hello.<eos> Here you are, Mr. Morningstar.
Because they said they'd kill her if I did.<eos> Maybe they already have.<eos> Excuse me, dear, I don't know why we bother with all these pithy little police questions.<eos> Tell me what game's the player playing, eh?<eos> What are you after?<eos> I just want Lindsay back.<eos> I swear, I would never hurt her.<eos> I love her.<eos> But she's a fluffy bunny.<eos> You're a wolf.
- And?<eos> - I want in.<eos> - In?<eos> - On the action.<eos> I got a taste of danger, and I want more.<eos> This case is the perfect method for me to explore my mortality in an exciting and dangerous way.<eos> And... help find out who's responsible for that poor girl's death, of course.<eos> I realize you've been very helpful to Detective Decker on her last couple of cases, but... exploring mortality is not really what I do here.<eos> - No? - Uh-uh.<eos> It's funny, 'cause you're an ambitious one, aren't you?
Still, no excuse for that man's rudeness.<eos> No, no, no, no...<eos> I can handle Paolucci.<eos> I don't need you to stand up for me.<eos> Understood.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hello.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Well, firstly, let me state that I'm in no way standing up for my associate, Detective Decker.<eos> But on behalf of myself, and only myself, I think you're a complete sack of ass.
I don't know what else there is to say.<eos> I'm just following up.<eos> I want to make sure there aren't any suspects we overlooked.<eos> But I was told Nick Hofmeister confessed.<eos> He did.<eos> Mr. Russell, I, um... I don't think Nick killed your son.<eos> What?<eos> Are you... Is this a joke?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Y-You just don't know what Robbie went through because of my work.
Not a monster.<eos> Not a villain.<eos> But a grieving family trying to say goodbye.<eos> She saw us.<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> I'm sorry, Mel.<eos> She's not, she's not looking for a fight.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> A fight? She...<eos> You have no right.
You can imagine how many people want to kill him.<eos> I can't, actually. Sounds like a great idea.<eos> You don't save a marriage by sleeping with other people.<eos> It can't hurt to try.<eos> Pretty sure it can.<eos> That's the wife Alexandra.<eos> She was out of town and just got back to find her husband dead.<eos> Poor woman.<eos> Excuse me! Your husband was the Cheater Therapist.<eos> Hey, I'm not sure who you are, but this is not the time for judgment.
There's so very much to discuss.<eos> So let's start with the most important thing, shall we?<eos> Me.<eos> And once again, Lucifer disappears.<eos> I think the case may have hit a little too close to home.<eos> Maybe things got a little too boring for Mr. Short Attention Span.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's grown quite a bit since working with you.<eos> I'm not sure I'm the reason.<eos> I think you've really helped him.
You wanted to speak with me?<eos> Lucifer Morningstar.<eos> Father Frank Lawrence.<eos> A priest walks into a bar.<eos> I've heard this one before. Never seen it, though.<eos> At least not here.<eos> Padre, how did you of all people find me?<eos> Don't let the collar fool you.<eos> I have friends from all walks of life.<eos> People who tell me you're the man to see when you run out of options.
It could be evidence.<eos> Well, I'm impressed.<eos> Looks like the priest handled it himself after all.<eos> - We don't know the priest did this.<eos> - Well, maybe you don't.<eos> Detective Decker?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Oh, can you take that? Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, you're the head counselor, right?
Dealing for Arietta.<eos> What, that's it?<eos> Oh, please don't tell me that's what you've been holding back all this time.<eos> Wait.<eos> If Connor's already in deep, why go to all this trouble to protect him?<eos> He's had it rough.<eos> Thinks he can only rely on himself.<eos> He's a good kid, Detective.<eos> There's still hope for him.<eos> Father, you were today's target.
God, you went from zero to 100 so fast.<eos> The way I see it, I'm doing you a favor.<eos> A favor?<eos> Another man spends so much time with my wife, I sure wouldn't like it.<eos> Especially knowing this guy's so dangerous.<eos> You want to kill Lucifer?<eos> Why?<eos> If I told you, I promise, you wouldn't believe me.<eos> But before you go growing any more balls, remember this... You thinking about taking another shot at me, try to take me down? Don't miss.<eos> So you're Anne Martin, the sous chef.
But before you go growing any more balls, remember this... You thinking about taking another shot at me, try to take me down? Don't miss.<eos> So you're Anne Martin, the sous chef.<eos> You're Javier's number two?<eos> I mean, I guess I was.<eos> I mean, I-I can't believe it. I... I just saw Pops this morning.<eos> And you cooked his last meal, is that right?<eos> So?<eos> You know how many people had their hands on that plate?<eos> Well, this is your kitchen, Anne.<eos> When Pops isn't here, you run the show. And from what I understand, you're not someone to be messed with, so... you really think someone's gonna go behind your back?
But I want to discuss...<eos> My client is grieving.<eos> You have any questions, you talk to me.<eos> All right, can you establish<eos> Vanessa's whereabouts at the time of Tim's death?<eos> Are you accusing my client of murder?<eos> No, but one quarter of murders are committed by family members.<eos> Yes, and half by acquaintances.<eos> Which gets to my next question.<eos> Where were you the night of Tim's death?
It's the least I could do.<eos> Oh, the very least.<eos> What better way to get intel on a murder than a gaggle of high-society frenemies? - Oh.<eos> Tim Dunlear was a true humanitarian.<eos> Oh, there's so few of us around.<eos> And I have no one to help me process my grief.<eos> Can you believe my therapist had the nerve to go on maternity leave?<eos> Oh, well, I'm here for you, Gayle.<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> You are a good man.
Never to go back.<eos> So I made a deal.<eos> And all I got to do is put a bullet in Lucifer.<eos> I pull the trigger. You take the fall.<eos> Five-second rule.<eos> Teaching, building, creating. I'm Tim Dunlear.<eos> Together we can educate Haiti today for their better tomorrow.<eos> Mr. Fleming?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I understand you've been asking some pretty invasive questions at a luncheon.
Together we can educate Haiti today for their better tomorrow.<eos> Mr. Fleming?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I understand you've been asking some pretty invasive questions at a luncheon.<eos> I have reason to believe that your client knows more than she's letting on about her husband's death.<eos> Vanessa Dunlear's entire world has fallen apart.<eos> I mean, what kind of a person targets a-a grieving woman?<eos> A very rich grieving woman who stands to inherit her husband's estate.<eos> Every cent that Tim had goes back into that foundation.<eos> Which you would know, because now that Tim's gone, you took control.
That is ridiculous.<eos> Besides, non-profit financials are a matter of public record.<eos> They are.<eos> But they're so complicated, it would be pretty easy to hide a few outgoing wire transfers. Here.<eos> I think Tim Dunlear looked into these financials and figured it out.<eos> So he flew to Pout Au Prince to see for himself, and when he realized where the money went, he confronted Vanessa and she killed him.<eos> That is pure speculation.<eos> It is.<eos> So help me get proof.<eos> If Vanessa transferred money to herself, it'll show up in her personal financial records, which you have access to.
And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> What did you really find out about Max?<eos> He's planning a countermove against the Kryptonians.<eos> Do not mistake my compassion for weakness.<eos> This is not a truce.<eos> And if you want to prove to me that you're not the bad guy, then help me find the real one.
And trying, even in my best moments, to forgive.<eos> But I still just hate him.<eos> I'm leaving an agent here, in case your father shows up.<eos> Agent Chase...<eos> There's, uh, something I have to tell you.<eos> If we're going to infiltrate Lord Technologies, we cut the power in the rear of the lab and infiltrate the basement.<eos> While the emergency generators kick in and his army pounces on us.<eos> This isn't the way in, Hank.<eos> You have a better idea.<eos> You are the greatest asset that we have and nobody knows about it.
Is that a "Y"?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It's a slingshot.<eos> Slingschott Toys was the company my dad created.<eos> It went bankrupt, but the old factory's still standing.<eos> - Do you think that's where he is?<eos> - I know it.<eos> Mr. Schott?<eos> I'm a friend of your son's.<eos> I know how much you love your son.
I got a couple of shots.<eos> What's in that IV?<eos> I'm guessing some combination of sodium sulfite and sodium iodate.<eos> The by-product of which would be hydrochloric acid.<eos> She'd be melting into goo.<eos> Her vitals were stable, her brain showed minimal activity.<eos> Lord's keeping her alive somehow.<eos> But for what?<eos> We don't know.<eos> I'm guessing you shapeshifted to get in?
You're just like me.<eos> I am nothing like you.<eos> Don't underestimate yourself.<eos> There's something unique in a child's view of the world.<eos> Something innocent and pure.<eos> There is love.<eos> And a way of looking that we as adults tend to forget.<eos> We at Dunholtz Toys want to bring this to the world.<eos> Each time you choose a toy, whether it be a doll or a figurine, a race car, building block, you are beginning a journey that's so...<eos> Who are you?
It gives our girl the benefit of the doubt.<eos> It shows that we're choosing not to believe the worst in people.<eos> Yes. Yes, I can see the headline clearly now.<eos> The word Supergirl, with a question mark.<eos> As in, "Supergirl?"<eos> Hmm, that's good, that's good.<eos> All right, everybody get out.<eos> Ms. Grant, um, can I ask you a question?<eos> Yes, my door is always open.<eos> You're not just being nice to me because I'm going on a date with your son, are you?
Well, that's what I am.<eos> I'm very boring and really normal.<eos> So, um, I'll just get out of your hair.<eos> Why?<eos> Have a building to leap in a single bound?<eos> So, we're still going with that joke?<eos> Which is great 'cause it's hilarious.<eos> Kara, there are many topics that I find appropriate for humor.<eos> English cuisine, black lipstick, but I will never make a joke about a good story.<eos> Ms. Grant, I'm sorry you think what you think, but it's not true.
If you go up against me, you will lose.<eos> Next time...<eos> I won't stop with the camera.<eos> May I speak with you, Ms. Grant?<eos> Oh, well, that depends.<eos> Show me your cape.<eos> I know you want me to tell you I'm Supergirl, but I can't do that.<eos> What I can tell you is that this job, this place, is more important to me than you realize.<eos> Whenever I'm confused or overwhelmed,<eos> I come in your office and you somehow sense it.
Which reminds me...<eos> Your presence is no longer required.<eos> You can thank my agents for completing your mission.<eos> Their idealism will doom this planet.<eos> No.<eos> That's what will save it.<eos> So...<eos> What did Alex mean when she said you had to "transform?"<eos> Or did you forget I had super-hearing?<eos> You're from Mars?
But I have a million things that I have to do right now.<eos> Yeah, I figured.<eos> Um, you know, I'm in town for a few days.<eos> You free for dinner?<eos> I will make myself free.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Have your cheerleader e-mail me.<eos> Ker-rah!<eos> What have you done?<eos> Well, you've been writing a lot of letters, but then throwing them away.
- Hank.<eos> - It's of the utmost importance...<eos> Hank!<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> I'll tell you what happened.<eos> You people screwed up royally.<eos> And I will not be kept here.<eos> Madam Senator, I assure you it's for your protection.<eos> I know your friend Sam Lane talks a lot of crap about the DEO, but we're here to help.<eos> The General told me that for all your big talk about monitoring aliens, you're the first one to let them in through the front door.
For all I know, you all staged that little stunt.<eos> It's just like an alien.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're all the same.<eos> Disgusting insects who've come crawling from your own diseased, backwater planets, looking to suck our resources for yourselves. - Ow! - Sedative.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> My team and I are currently tracking your attacker.<eos> We'll keep you updated.<eos> I told you, I'm not staying here.<eos> Madam Senator, as long as it's out there, you're in here.
My bad. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I got the Internet.<eos> - Where?<eos> - You got on Caputo's computer.<eos> That's a game changer!<eos> I know! I know, I know, I know! Okay, okay, okay.<eos> So, all we got to do now is find ourselves a cell phone, and we got ourselves a retirement plan.<eos> Yo... I'm gonna retire in that hotel with the indoor water park in Ohio.<eos> Lord, give me strength.<eos> You got kids?
Okay, you were going to a work conference and you were tacking on a family vacation.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - But then you got fired, so your company canceled your plane tickets, and you and your wife decided to drive down to fort lauderdale.
Order of bacon, miss parkerjar.<eos> Sausage and links, miss parkerjar.<eos> Sausage patties, miss parkerjar.<eos> Belgian waffle with ice cream.<eos> Now I couldn't make any fries, so I did find some home fries and put them on top for you, miss parkerjar.<eos> We have some ketchup for the home fries, miss parkerjar.<eos> Okay, we don't need to run through the condiments.<eos> - Nate, listen to yourself, come on.<eos> - And we keep the cups upside down so you don't get dust in them, miss parkerjar.<eos> All you have to do is give them a flip.
Look at this.<eos> Another building collapse.<eos> Fucking welfare hotel.<eos> That's one way to get rid of 'em.<eos> This city?<eos> You got kids off the West Side Highway waiting for cars to go over the potholes so they can collect the hubcaps.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So I guess you're wondering, you know, what am I doing here.<eos> Not you.<eos> I mean, you know what you're doing.
- The chop shop. The one I told you about by the stadium.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - How is it okay?<eos> Six hours after I mention it to this prick, four of my guys get pinched?<eos> Either I'm a fucking jerk, or somebody dropped a dime.<eos> Am I a jerk?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Am I?<eos> Answer the man.<eos> No, you're not a jerk, but I didn't do anything.
I love jazz.<eos> Have you heard of Sidney Bechet?<eos> Sidney bloody Beckett!<eos> A friend of mine's band is playing some of his pieces on Jesus Green tomorrow, if you'd like to join me?<eos> I'm afraid I'm busy tomorrow.<eos> You came.<eos> How are you?<eos> I thought that everybody hated me.<eos> Of course they don't, Gary.<eos> You're awfully kind, but I wouldn't want the village thinking you're taking my side over theirs.
But it was a clear night.<eos> That's when you get the best views.<eos> He was always doing it.<eos> - Mum!<eos> - Tala, go to your room.<eos> I'll be up in a moment.<eos> Vicar?<eos> Er... yes, thanks.<eos> - Sorry, they're menthol filtered, from London.<eos> - So, you were one of his students? - No.
I'm a police officer.<eos> Don't walk away from me!<eos> Split up.<eos> We lose each other, meet back at the station.<eos> Amanda?<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> How are you?<eos> Come with me.<eos> Who are you?
See you then.<eos> Inspector Keating, may I have a word with you?<eos> In private?<eos> The fact is sometimes people need protecting from themselves.<eos> Which is why I must ask you to stop investigating this case.<eos> Lyall was in intelligence.<eos> He was closing in on the identity of a man known only as the Tsar, a high-ranking mole based in the University.<eos> He's been passing our secrets to the Soviets for years.<eos> We believe... that's why they had Lyall killed.<eos> I can't tell you any more without compromising our operation, but that's why you need to disentangle yourself...
Not that you need to marry Margaret.<eos> I hear you're thinking of offering Phyllis Bell private communion.<eos> You have more spies than the KGB, Mrs M.<eos> I'll go.<eos> It's the victims the church should be helping.<eos> Mrs Bell is a victim.<eos> As is Gary. Just like the Redmonds.<eos> Sidney!<eos> This is a copy of Val's Will.<eos> I was hoping you might help me with the funeral?
Where's Geordie?<eos> He's telephoned for assistance at the Rivercam Boat Club.<eos> You can come in my car if you don't tell Benson.<eos> No, cars.<eos> No men in uniform.<eos> Please, Phil.<eos> Let me go alone, Geordie will understand.<eos> Kit Bartlett.<eos> I'm arresting you for the murder of Valentine Lyall.<eos> You're going to destroy everything.
It was full of tat.<eos> It had a great deal of sentimental value.<eos> "It is as healthy to enjoy sentiment as it is to enjoy jam."<eos> I don't know how many other ways there are to apologise unless you want me to say it in, I don't know, Hebrew!<eos> Words, words, words.<eos> Day in, day out.<eos> I can't help it if I'm learned.<eos> You're not learned.<eos> You've not lived.<eos> And you have?
Tough as old boots, you and I, aren't we? You don't have to pretend any more.<eos> Pretend what?<eos> That you like me.<eos> - Mrs Whitaker. - Vivian, please.<eos> Do you really think Theo is capable of doing something like this alone?<eos> His parents died in the bombing on Vicarage Terrace.<eos> The shelter took a direct hit. The police found him hiding in the family home.<eos> Barely spoke for a year.<eos> I suppose he's as capable as anyone.<eos> You have been in the wars, haven't you?
Of all the places, Amanda. (SIGHS) Why Cambridge?<eos> Why not London?<eos> Does my husband have to know?<eos> As long as we agree it won't become a regular occurrence, not in my city at least,<eos> I think we can draw a line under it.<eos> Does Sidney?<eos> Not if you don't want him to.<eos> Yeah, we can get you on the next train if we're quick.<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> So, uh, have you and Margaret, you know?
If the Lord had wanted us with wheels on our feet, he would've put them there.<eos> Some days I could happily throttle her.<eos> She thinks you won't need her.<eos> Once you have a wife.<eos> I don't have a wife. I don't even nearly have a wife.<eos> She's lonely.<eos> She once said loneliness is for the weak of mind.<eos> (sums) How was the library?<eos> Very good.<eos> Good. I didn't go. But you know that.
Are you prepared to take on that responsibility?<eos> I hadn't thought about marriage, Sylvia.<eos> I'm just in it for the sex.<eos> Ask the question.<eos> Were you involved in your husband's death?<eos> How is it you can even make an accusation sound amiable?<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> You were having an affair with Theo.<eos> I think you seduced Theo.
I hadn't thought about marriage, Sylvia.<eos> I'm just in it for the sex.<eos> Ask the question.<eos> Were you involved in your husband's death?<eos> How is it you can even make an accusation sound amiable?<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> You were having an affair with Theo.<eos> I think you seduced Theo.<eos> I think he'd do anything you asked.
On our wedding day, he turned to me and said,<eos> "You're mine now."<eos> So, while he spent and drank, I became his skivvy. Trapped in this place, with all these sad and lonely men.<eos> Some days all I wanted to do was feel the sun on my face.<eos> So can you blame me if I looked for affection elsewhere?<eos> Did you want your husband dead?<eos> No.<eos> Did you ask Theo to kill him?<eos> You're equating a woman who knows how to make love with a killer.<eos> You're glad. That he's gone.
I doubt it.<eos> And also, I don't drive.<eos> So, who did?<eos> Someone else I seduced?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> -(CHUCKLES) How many men would you have me sleep with, Sidney?<eos> Have you ever been in love?<eos> You killed your husband.<eos> And I'm pretty sure I know why.<eos> Are you married?
He'll never get over you, though.<eos> (sums) Do you want him to be happy?<eos> You know I do.<eos> Course I do.<eos> Then take my advice.<eos> Steer well clear, Amanda.<eos> It's just there are days when there is no one else.<eos> You think he's the only one who'll understand.<eos> I know he is.<eos> You must know how that feels.
I know he is.<eos> You must know how that feels.<eos> You must tell him things, too.<eos> Let him forget you.<eos> You can't do it, can you?<eos> Her husband is landed gentry.<eos> I could never offer her the same life he does.<eos> Amanda would never be a vicar's wife.<eos> Did you ask her?<eos> -(CHUCKLES) You're just like my husband.
If you don't like me, tell me.<eos> Don't worry, I'm not gonna top myself.<eos> I'm a grown up.<eos> I can take it.<eos> I'm no saint.<eos> Do you believe in ghosts?<eos> She won't leave me alone.<eos> - SIDNEY: Anna's with God.<eos> - She isn't.<eos> So you're the girl that keeping Sidney out of trouble, are you?
It's because Gary's not a murderer.<eos> He didn't mean to kill Abigail.<eos> I knew it was too soon to scrap that pram.<eos> We need to stick you in it, you're that naive.<eos> We can agree to disagree... can't we?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - All right, Mr Chambers? - Mr Lawson.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> How have you been?<eos> Do you believe in ghosts?
I do feel calmer.<eos> Clearer.<eos> They say you can see Lord Byron's ghost swimming in Byron's pool, just below the weir.<eos> I say any undergraduate in his birthday suit looks like Lord Byron.<eos> Easy not to believe in 'em till you've seen 'em for yourself.<eos> Goodness, Mrs M. Have there been many?<eos> My Uncle Bert.<eos> Died in a direct hit on the Anderson.<eos> That didn't stop him going down the allotments every night and sabotaging Dad's runner beans.<eos> - Oh, whatever did you do?
She was Anna's secretary.<eos> No, the real reason Kitty hates me is the age-old one.<eos> If only I was less Jewish (!<eos> You don't think someone erm...<eos> drove him to it?<eos> - With this haunting?<eos> - No-one could get Reggie to do anything he didn't want.<eos> It drove Kitty mad.<eos> Of course, now she can have her way with everything.<eos> But you can live wherever you want, though, can't you?
Paid by a rival owner to destroy Mr Lawson's best asset.<eos> - It wasn't me.<eos> - But you know who it was.<eos> Lawson.<eos> He did it himself.<eos> Why would Reggie harm his prize horse?<eos> Ask the Jew.<eos> - Reggie?<eos> - That's what Greaves says.<eos> He said you'd know why.
Mm, when you don't like seeing it through to its conclusion.<eos> I don't like murder.<eos> Even for murderers.<eos> It's not murder.<eos> It's justice, Sidney.<eos> People need it.<eos> The Redmonds.<eos> This job. The things we see. It has to mean something.<eos> I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<eos> You say that the defendant was performing an abortion on Abigail, which she had asked for.
You're leaving.<eos> It's only a matter of time before the new mistress of Kingsbrook gives me my marching orders.<eos> You'll want this.<eos> It's so worn at the tip, I suppose you use it as a stick. - Thank you.<eos> - It's not how you used it at the stables, though, is it?<eos> Is this about the insurance?<eos> I thought it was about money... or horses... or love.<eos> But it was about justice, wasn't it?<eos> A life for a life.<eos> Reggie killed your sister, so you killed him.
Right, right.<eos> There's always a better reason.<eos> It all comes back to polishing the badge.<eos> Oh, I'll figure out these Reese murders, and, uh, you know, since I'm a minority and a woman, I'll make lieutenant before I'm 35.<eos> We had a shooting last night, and the casings match up to the gun that killed Officer Reese, D.D.A. Rachel Gray, and her bodyguard.<eos> But if you're not interested...<eos> You need to be gone before my wife gets here.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Daniel Price shot Reese to death during the robbery of a flower shop, and that's settled.<eos> - Some people say you framed Daniel.
Well, you might be the best person to answer that question.<eos> Plus, you did all the work on Emile.<eos> Emile Fisher?<eos> He's in prison.<eos> Not as of two weeks ago.<eos> He just finished doing every single day of his time, so no probation officers to keep tabs on him.<eos> Emile gets out two weeks ago, and the gun comes back.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> Unfortunately, Steph, our list of Emile's known associates is over 12 years old.<eos> Unless you can recall something.
Look. I don't think we need to drag that all back up again.<eos> Oh, I think we do, Lieutenant.<eos> In fact, we have a big discussion ahead of us.<eos> But first, let's pay Buddha a visit and see if it gives us another crack at Emile.<eos> L.A.P.D. Everyone stop where they are!<eos> If you would lower your wrenches and assume a seated position with your hands clearly visible, it would be greatly appreciated.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Hold up, dawg.<eos> Greg Mann, A.K.A. Buddha, I presume.<eos> Well, we have reason to believe that you are working rapidly on these vehicles without their owners' permission.
And to show the community personally that the L.A.P.D. takes their deaths very seriously. Yeah.<eos> The cameras are over there, Chief.<eos> Leave it to you, Peter, to always know where the reporters are.<eos> All right, reverend, sooner you begin, sooner everyone here is out of danger.<eos> [Lowered voice] Lieutenant, I don't think we should clump.<eos> Then move.<eos> You move.<eos> What are you worrying about?<eos> That I might get struck by lightning.<eos> You smell like brimstone.
Sorry, reverend.<eos> I just reached the point in my life where I need to hear you say it.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Say you killed Reese.<eos> Say it.<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> Either you're gonna name the people you murdered in order, or I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Your choice.<eos> I'm ready to meet my maker.<eos> Are you?
Say it.<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> Either you're gonna name the people you murdered in order, or I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Your choice.<eos> I'm ready to meet my maker.<eos> Are you?<eos> Our father, Do you really expect me to buy this bullshit?<eos> who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name...<eos> - Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...<eos> - You sell heroin here.
- Wrong.<eos> They're kind of new.<eos> Those parts look like they might have been liberated from other vehicles. Look, Buddha, let the district attorney put your situation into context.<eos> You're about to go from working on cars to making license plates, unless you cooperate right now.<eos> Define cooperation.<eos> I'm interested in a crime that happened 12 years ago after Officer Reese's murder.<eos> Your client tells me what he knows about that... Come on.<eos> That's like blackmail.<eos> No, it's like a lifeline.<eos> You're suggesting complete immunity from any and all prosecution, both past and present action?
What is this?<eos> Wha...<eos> You guys wipe your feet on the constitution every chance you get.<eos> No, we were only waiting on...<eos> I'm, frankly, disappointed in you, Captain.<eos> We only now just sat down.<eos> You know better than to question him without his lawyer present.<eos> We haven't asked him any questions.<eos> We were just going to give him a... courtesy briefing on our progress.<eos> Because you're so famous for your courtesy, Lieutenant?
And without me beside you, they may well succeed.<eos> Mr. Price, we have more evidence about your brother's drug business than Peter knows.<eos> That is a statement of facts from Mr. Greg Mann, A.K.A. Buddha.<eos> Now, Mr. Buddha is going into the witness protection program.<eos> In exchange, he will explain how your brother used your church for drug trafficking.<eos> I don't trust Peter... But I don't trust you, either.<eos> How can I be sure all of this is true?<eos> There's only one way, Reverend.<eos> What would that be?<eos> We need you to have a heart-to-heart conversation with your brother.
During a seizure, a seizure that happened because you took her off her meds.<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> Why did you take Maria off her medication?<eos> The short answer is I didn't.<eos> In fact, because the dose was so mild, I suggested Maria keep on it for another year.<eos> No.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Maria said you told her she could go off her meds. No.
Now, you listen to me, Dr. Phil.<eos> I asked for your help, not your advice. And...<eos> And where does that come from, anyway... all your experience with weddings?<eos> No, sir.<eos> It comes from all your experience with weddings.<eos> Wouldn't you like to make Patrice happy and maybe... maybe get your sixth wedding off to a better start than the last five?<eos> Sharon: I just want to make sure you're prepared - to plead your own case.<eos> - [Handcuffs click] The state can provide you with a lawyer...<eos> I need help.<eos> And you need help.
- Andrea.<eos> - Thank you. Of course.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> Sharon. Hello, Mr. Mayor.<eos> Detective Sanchez.<eos> Chief.<eos> It's really great of you to make time for us.<eos> Oh, I'm so happy to be here.<eos> - Mr. Mayor.<eos> - And you must be the bride.
This whole thing is a disgusting display of how industry dollars are spent.<eos> And I was like you a few months ago.<eos> I used to come to this conference every year, and I never thought about the inmates.<eos> But, you know, maybe you're too afraid to admit it,<eos> Why don't you come with me?<eos> Well, I bought a ticket like everybody else.<eos> Hey, why don't you let him go?<eos> He's harmless.<eos> - Uh, don't call me harmless, but I...<eos> - Are you with him?
Previously on Beauty the Beast...<eos> Someone's willing to pay $5 million<eos> - to capture a beast.<eos> - There's a bounty?<eos> They may be after a beast, but they do not know it's Vincent.<eos> But I do, I'm at risk now, too, which is why I'm giving you the full resources of Homeland Security.<eos> You don't work at NYPD anymore, you work for me now.
What, has he got a lead?<eos> He didn't say, but something is up.<eos> He said that someone might have found out that he's the one who's been protecting your secret.<eos> - Another bounty hunter?<eos> - I don't know, but I'll let you know when I find out.<eos> I miss you.<eos> Yeah, I miss you, too.<eos> Coding, he's coding.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> - Are you Dorothy?
Told me to meet him here, he said it was urgent. - Well...<eos> - Wait.<eos> Where does he live?<eos> What's his address?<eos> - There. - Thank you.<eos> Vincent.<eos> I think they might have found Hill.<eos> I think he might be in trouble.<eos> Come on.<eos> You knew it was a matter of time before somebody figured it out that your agent knew who the beast was, and you had to know, too, right?
- Yeah.<eos> - By the way, how far along are you, if I may ask?<eos> Uh, I'm not sure actually... 12 weeks.<eos> Uh, first-time mothers don't usually show until 12 weeks.<eos> Vincent's a doctor.<eos> Oh, fantastic!<eos> What's your specialty?<eos> Specialty?<eos> Uh, E.R.<eos> And you're a Homeland Security agent?
Can I say hi?<eos> V, this is Milo Khoury.<eos> Hello, Mr Khoury.<eos> Hey, V. How are you today?<eos> Could you be more specific, please?<eos> OK, sure.<eos> Are you sentient?<eos> I don't believe so.<eos> Go dormant, V.<eos> I also heard you had 16 nets live at one point.
- Nor will I.<eos> There's too much contradictory data.<eos> Nothing makes sense.<eos> This excess of sensory feedback, it serves no useful function.<eos> Emotions have functions.<eos> You'll see.<eos> - Mr Khoury.<eos> - Please.<eos> Mr Khoury is the guy that emailed me after I got my start-up capital to let me know he was finally ready to be a dad.<eos> I am so stoked you're here.
Aah! Oh, my god, Nate.<eos> I'm so sorry we couldn't hold them.<eos> I'm so sorry, Honey.<eos> - Are you crying?<eos> - No, it's no crying.<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> Are you crying again?<eos> - It's chemicals!<eos> - It's tears.<eos> - Mr. Parker, you're in possession of P.F.R. intellectual property that we are here to collect.
When I last spoke to them, they believed you were a model employee.<eos> They found you meticulous and conscientious.<eos> - You know this, right?<eos> - I do.<eos> You've managed there for 10 years. You're functioning very well, Barry.<eos> And it's a rare and wonderful place for you to work.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You know, of all my other clients with your disorder, you've been the most consistent at your job.<eos> Did something happen, Barry?<eos> How old are you?

The Internet is inconsistent on this point.<eos> Why is that on your mind?<eos> Who's gonna look after us when you retire or pass on?<eos> You know, we're gonna have to take care of ourselves and nobody even believes that we exist.<eos> If ever something were to happen to me, I've made arrangements with a colleague from Baltimore to take over.<eos> Hey, do you, uh...<eos> You live alone?
No, it's okay.<eos> Hello, Dennis.<eos> One of the others emailed me just now.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Dennis,<eos> Kevin is really lucky to have you.<eos> You are quite extraordinary.<eos> I just don't want you guys to get hurt.<eos> You think we're extraordinary?
I've lost so many patients into the system.<eos> I want you to know, Dennis, I will never stop fighting for you.<eos> My patients have become my family.<eos> They are what I've chosen instead of a more traditional path.<eos> I hope you feel you can be truly honest with me.<eos> I actually wanna be honest with you.<eos> I lied before.<eos> When you asked if I'd ever met The Beast, I said no.<eos> That really isn't true.<eos> You wrote about a woman in Germany who'd been blind for 10 years.
When you asked if I'd ever met The Beast, I said no.<eos> That really isn't true.<eos> You wrote about a woman in Germany who'd been blind for 10 years.<eos> And then, it was discovered that she had DID.<eos> Then three of her identities developed sight.<eos> And you speculated that her optical nerves regenerated because of her beliefs.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> There are things, Dr. Fletcher, that all of us would find hard to believe.<eos> Are you trying to tell me there's a 24th identity?<eos> You protect the broken.

He's just emerged.<eos> You were right about everything.<eos> What does he look like?<eos> He's much bigger than I am and I'm the biggest of all of us.<eos> He's tall.<eos> He's very muscular.<eos> And he's got a long mane of hair and his fingers are twice the length of ours.<eos> He believes we are extraordinary.<eos> That we don't represent a mistake, but our potential.<eos> You say the same things.
We should discuss that so that you can understand fully.<eos> Understand what?<eos> Sometimes, there's just no other way.<eos> Who are you going to meet?<eos> Him.<eos> You know what?<eos> I would love to take notes on all of this.<eos> We should probably discuss this in a proper session tomorrow.<eos> Really?<eos> You're okay with this?
He is formed because of your time in this place.<eos> There's a lady.<eos> Someone's here.<eos> We need to get out of these rooms.<eos> Is there anything in your room?<eos> Anything that we could use?<eos> There's nothing in here.<eos> There's a hanger.<eos> Thank you, Dennis.<eos> Here you go, sir.
That's Chief Inspector Ruiz to you, Señor Wright.<eos> - To all of you.<eos> - Unit Chief Garrett.<eos> Agents Seger, Simmons, and Jarvis.<eos> Look, I won't lie to you.<eos> I don't want you here.<eos> This is my case and you being here complicates my life and I don't like complications.<eos> I like everything muy fácil.<eos> But my bosses in the capital think that the FBI's cooperation will help me, so, please, follow me.<eos> CI Ruiz, are you the only officer assigned to this case? See?
Daniel will agree to that. Like I said, muy fácil.<eos> One of you is a coroner, right?<eos> A medical examiner, yes.<eos> We were going to transport the body to Mexico city for an autopsy. Could you do it here?<eos> They don't just bring me along for my good taste and my sense of humor.<eos> I'd like Agent Simmons to walk through the villa crime scene.<eos> I have no problem with that, as long as I get to chaperone.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go to work.<eos> So you're with the FBI? Yes.
His behavior totally contradicts my all-in theory.<eos> All-in theory?<eos> Patriarchs who murder their wives with their own children present usually feel compelled to go all-in, killing the whole family, including themselves.<eos> Patriarchs perceive it as an act of love and mercy.<eos> That didn't happen here.<eos> Why?<eos> Hijos de la fregada.<eos> How can you look at evidence right in front of your face - and not even see it?<eos> - With all due respect, the evidence in this case is circumstantial.<eos> It's how you're choosing to contextualize it that makes it appear beyond a reasonable doubt.
Listen, son...<eos> If you don't press charges, I can't stop this from happening.<eos> Understand?<eos> You don't even know.<eos> Oh, I don't?<eos> You think all this just started, boy?<eos> - I ain't no boy.<eos> - The hell you ain't.<eos> If you were a man, there'd be four other knuckleheads sitting right next to you.<eos> You don't even know.
You want answers, ask Grace Rose.<eos> Thanks to her report on DHS cover-ups, I'm under official investigation.<eos> What for?<eos> Grace Rose doesn't even know anything.<eos> The press doesn't have to know anything. They just have to ask questions.<eos> Yeah, like, what does DHS know about beasts?<eos> How'd you answer that one?<eos> Well, I couldn't exactly tell the Secretary of Homeland Security that I lied, covered up the existence of the last beast on the planet, now could I?<eos> Well, at least we still have that.<eos> Well, I'm glad you see the glass as half full, Agent Chandler, because I nearly lost my life protecting you two. Now my career is at risk, as well.
You know, maybe I should get my coffee to go.<eos> Uh, joke, okay? Relax.<eos> I've got unis in the front and the back.<eos> If this so-called "Dr. Paretti"<eos> turns out to be another vicious bounty hunter looking for Intel on Vincent, I've got you covered.<eos> Weirdly, that doesn't make me feel better.<eos> Look, just chill out.<eos> Look for anybody who looks like a killer.<eos> I don't even know what a killer looks like.<eos> Excuse me, are you JT Forbes?
Why?<eos> What's he gonna do?<eos> I don't know, but Hill set Vincent up. So if you want to protect innocent lives, you have to let me warn Vincent that he is walking into a trap.<eos> You are gonna grant me access to computer HQ, now keep moving.<eos> You're making a mistake, Keller.<eos> Bigger than the mistake I made trusting you, Colonel?<eos> Start downloading now.<eos> You can check every computer on this base.<eos> You will not find evidence that I put a hit out on you, because it does not exist. Really?<eos> So 12 years ago, you killed an entire platoon of your own men and you expect me to believe what you've got to say?
You think I missed?<eos> Stop lying to me.<eos> I never disobeyed an order until that day.<eos> Stop lying to me!<eos> You were better than the others, Vincent.<eos> There was still good in you. Whatever had been done to you,<eos> I knew the man you'd been.<eos> The man maybe you could still be.<eos> That man didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, because if you're, you're telling the truth--
We need an explosives unit, now!<eos> Vincent.<eos> Looks like he set off some kind of explosive device.<eos> Typical suicide bombing.<eos> Actually there are no confirmed casualties.<eos> At least not yet.<eos> No thanks to you.<eos> Agent Chandler...<eos> You planted that bomb on Vincent.<eos> We saved your life, and you tried to kill him.

That is a lie.<eos> You know he's not.
What?<eos> Do you think you have a destiny?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I used to believe that crap too when I was young.<eos> There is no destiny, no born heroes.<eos> I can't tell you why-- why The Beast came sniffing for you.<eos> There's no reason it should be you.<eos> You can either step up to it or not, it's up to you.<eos> We'll just hope for the best.<eos> Who are you?
Hopefully soon.<eos> Where you think you're a student studying to be a magician?<eos> Okay, let's just skip the part where you don't believe me, okay?<eos> Um, yeah, it's a little chilly in here.<eos> How about a miniature sun?<eos> That'd be great.<eos> I hate these dreams.<eos> It's like your feet are stuck to the floor or you're paralyzed.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You released me, remember, in the real hospital?

That was just the mayor's suggestion. What matters to him is that at least one black church in Memphis show some support for the police in the midst of all this.<eos> And you're approaching calvary - because Nelson is on the roll?<eos> - That's correct. We're not asking you to honor officer Nelson specifically, of course. But if you could honor the force in general and he could attend, well, the message would be clear enough for our purposes, anyway.<eos> You knew this is what he'd come in here for?<eos> As I'm sure you know, bishop, Triumph Church is hosting this protest scheduled Friday night.<eos> That boy's mother wasn't even a member till after that boy was killed.<eos> We heard that as well.<eos> And I heard the Skanks went to her house and invited her personally.<eos> I believe that is correct.<eos> You don't find that cynical?
Tell me my life. It's about to get better.<eos> I gave some more thought about what you said about officer Nelson.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Give him a call.<eos> Have him come in.<eos> W... what changed your mind?<eos> Where were you when I laid The Earth's foundations?<eos> Just have him come in.<eos> Today, if possible.<eos> You don't seem to want to be here.
- Well, I'd like to know what...<eos> - What really happened.<eos> Yes.<eos> Between us, if that's possible.<eos> It's not.<eos> I can't talk about it.<eos> Not even with complete assurance of pastoral confidentiality?<eos> No.<eos> You understand my position.<eos> As much as you understand mine.
Please.<eos> You okay?<eos> I've been better.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I became a cop to protect kids like him.<eos> And you have.<eos> This was one mistake.<eos> [Scoffs] A mistake.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you ever made a mistake?
Previously on Greenleaf.<eos> You preaching on Sunday?
Previously on Greenleaf.<eos> You preaching on Sunday?<eos> I don't preach anymore.<eos> You are Grace Greenleaf, ain't you?
So where you folks flying in from?<eos> Phoenix.<eos> You preaching on Sunday?

It's not like I ain't going to see him when I get home anyway, you know?<eos> When are we going to get you married?<eos> I tried it once.<eos> Didn't take. - Oh.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Look who's down here again. Hmm?<eos> How long has she been down here?<eos> Couple hours.<eos> Can't you do anything to help her mom?<eos> It seems like you can fix everyone else here in Memphis.
I just might do it after all.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean, I don't know about all of you, but my phone's been ringing off the hook since Sunday.<eos> Mine as well, Connie. Mine as well.<eos> With people saying what?<eos> Is it safe to come back to the church?<eos> Are we going to continue to be targeted by these people?<eos> We weren't targeted.<eos> David Nelson was targeted... by one man.<eos> But you made a point of supporting the police, Bishop, all on your own.
You got it.<eos> The Voice of Life, huh?<eos> Number two Christian network in the country now, sir.<eos> And the gist of it, if I understand correctly, is we pay you.<eos> Well, the syndication fee is just to cover distribution and marketing.<eos> It's not like you're airing commercials, if that's your question, Bishop.<eos> It wasn't a question, young man, it was a statement of fact.<eos> You'll make ten times the fee once you're on the air.<eos> Look at it this way.<eos> We rent you the land. You put up your well. You keep the oil.

Isabel and I have been talking about moving after the wedding.<eos> Moving?<eos> Marvelous.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Denver.<eos> She's got people there.<eos> Then why haven't you said anything?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I felt bad.<eos> You and the bishop have been doing so much for us.
David Nelson is a member of my church, and this ain't about the police.<eos> Oh, I know. They are all brave men and women.<eos> They're so admirable.<eos> I saw your sermon online, the way you painted that whole picture in such glorious color, Bishop,<eos> Almost.<eos> But I'm afraid you fail to understand, Bishop.<eos> I was talking about you.<eos> I'm not sure I understand.<eos> Oh, I know you don't.<eos> But soon, Bishop James Greenleaf, soon enough. Yes, soon, Lord, that sun of righteousness will rise on you like a fiery furnace and you'll be longing for the days when all I did was call you out.
The fact that she was having a clandestine relationship with your son was no ground for termination.<eos> Of course it wasn't.<eos> So, what's surprising?<eos> All I meant, Miss Phillips, is Alexa and I have a... well, our previous relationship...<eos> Yes?<eos> Please, go on.<eos> You're right.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I shouldn't be surprised.<eos> Bishop Greenleaf, my client is well aware that both you and your church have been in the spotlight of late.
I'm so sorry about that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, would you say that Sophia's happy here?<eos> And the only reason I'm asking is at her age, her wishes are going to be taken into consideration when the judge makes the ruling.<eos> If she had her choice, I think she'd want to stay here, yeah.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you so much for doing this.<eos> Oh, no problem.<eos> Darlene is a friend, and now you are, too.
Is KJR Pharmaceuticals conducting a Phase One trial of my virosome on patients in Latvia?<eos> That is not a matter for the board to consider.<eos> Well, if research generated by our Rare and Orphan Diseases Lab is being improperly rushed forward without the knowledge of the lead investigator into a third-world environment in order to skirt safety regulations, then the board should be made aware.<eos> And if that were the case, Dr. Sacani, such discussion would be merited.<eos> Since it is not...<eos> Are you denying that my virosome research is the basis for a trial in Eastern Europe?<eos> - Because I made some calls...<eos> - The trial was accelerated for reasons inappropriate to discuss here.<eos> There are factors of which you are not aware.<eos> There are factors of which you are not aware, such as a basic understanding of microbiology and the potential cataclysmic immunological response engendered by the invasive presence of an untested virosome in a human environment.
Free Tibet!<eos> Free Tibet!<eos> Hey, you need to clear the area!
So, we send our own message.<eos> We won't be throwing warships into a U.S.-led pissing contest.<eos> We tell our allies to go and piss somewhere else.<eos> And I won't be shifting our policy that submarines will be made here, at ASC Osborne.<eos> It's a big boost for local manufacture.<eos> Minister, the Japanese contract is billions of dollars cheaper.<eos> So, we cancel a few joint strike fighters.<eos> The Pentagon won't like it.<eos> Well, I don't work for the Pentagon, General.<eos> Neither do you.
Thank you, Harriett.<eos> I need to speak to you.<eos> How did that photo get out?<eos> Hey, Sacha, do me a favour, I'm looking to why Mal Paxton was in China, circa 20 years ago.<eos> Because of a study trip or a union junket.<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> Already checked it.<eos> In June 1992, he was on a Young Labour Delegation to Beijing.<eos> Who was Head of Mission, then?<eos> Well, I am reliably informed that you are the resident expert on all things China, Mr. Rankin.

A lot of senior Australians visiting too.<eos> Oh, I did host a lot of important people from the<eos> Prime Minister down.<eos> I supposed some of them weren't such big names, but emerged later, like Malcolm Paxton.<eos> I understand that he was in Beijing for several months, in 1992.<eos> Yes, I... I do recall it, he was there.<eos> Was there a diplomatic incident of some kind?<eos> Police trouble?<eos> I know that he was arrested.<eos> And you were Head of Mission, so... you would know that too.
Well, Generals they're here forever.<eos> Or so the theory goes.<eos> You're dismissed, Corporal.<eos> Thank you, Sir.<eos> Is there something I can help you with, Minister?<eos> Yes, there is, General.<eos> I'd like you to sign this letter of resignation.<eos> You don't have Cabinet approval to sack me.<eos> I have evidence that your Office was involved in the suppression of those redeployment orders.<eos> And that you concealed records of your communications to the US Ambassador, calling back the Polar Star en route to Antarctica.
MSS, you say?<eos> There's no official record of him ever entering the country.<eos> And you wonder why we need my legislation.<eos> There's something else that I wanted to ask you.<eos> One of the dissidents that Zheng abducted,<eos> Qui Kwan Sing, he needs asylum.<eos> Where is Qui now?<eos> Well, he is in hiding because he doesn't trust anybody.<eos> I know how he feels.<eos> If you were to make the offer, I could let him know next time he reaches out.
No, if I was questioning you, there would be a lawyer present.<eos> We're just having a chat.<eos> You studied Engineering at Curtin.<eos> It's my hometown.<eos> Yes, Sir.<eos> Commanding Officer 817 Squadron, Commanding Officer HMS Albatross.<eos> Iraq, Afghanistan...<eos> How did you find serving under General McAuliffe, Vice-Admiral?<eos> I have great respect for the challenges he faced in that role, Sir.<eos> But you would have done things differently?
Sorry to rain on your parade, Mal, but I thought I should give you a heads up, on the coroner's report, on Lloyd Rankin's death...<eos> Have a look.<eos> It's an open finding.<eos> This was clearly a suicide.<eos> Not according to the coroner.<eos> Doesn't rule out the possibility of foul play.<eos> What's this got to do with me?<eos> I would have said nothing whatsoever. However, I have been reliably informed otherwise...<eos> Ivy?<eos> The night Lloyd was found in his car, you came to the house.
Seriously.<eos> You've reached Harriet Dunkley.<eos> I can't take your call right now.<eos> Leave a message and I will get back to you.<eos> Hey, Harriet, it's Gus.<eos> Call me when you get this.<eos> Better get a lawyer, she's been detained under the ASIO act.<eos> The only way to get to her is a complaint to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.<eos> You didn't hear it from me.<eos> I don't know who you are!
Senator Bailey?<eos> - Senator Bailey?<eos> [Journalists asking questions at the same time} - ... that I give for a conscious vote on this bill?<eos> When it comes to the safety of Australians, the Government is united.<eos> - Senator Bailey, does this new legislation make you the most powerful person in the country?<eos> [Laughs] The Prime Minister might have something to say about that, not to mention every shock jock around the country...<eos> [Laughs] - Do you consider that this is the first real success for your Govt.?<eos> You must be proud.<eos> You are a legacy.<eos> And you are a Dunkley lurking in the shadows?
Turn this off, Howie.<eos> I have to go back inside.<eos> Hi, Thomas.<eos> So, you've seen it.<eos> Do you know what you've done? Yeah.<eos> I've published my last article.<eos> The paper will cut me loose, *** certainly gets into prison.<eos> But until then, in the last hours of freedom I've got left, I am gonna find out who killed Kim and why.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> But I know you're gonna run to Vaugh, after this, because you've done it before.
I know you're down here.<eos> I saw you come down.<eos> I'm over here.<eos> In the time machine.<eos> Well, it's a work-in-progress.<eos> I'm still experimenting with the power source.<eos> So this is why you've been collecting materials.<eos> So you see now why I kept it secret from you, right?<eos> I didn't want you implicated.<eos> 'Cause then you would be a target, too.
No, no, no.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Our rescue swimmers didn't find any of our people in the wreckage.<eos> We still don't know if they were on that vessel.<eos> Lieutenants Burk and Green did manage to escape the attacks in Vietnam.<eos> They were attempting to gather intel from at least a half a dozen kidnappers when Burk was shot.<eos> He's here now.<eos> The corpsmen are taking care of him.<eos> All that said, we have no concrete leads right now to help us find our people.<eos> But you're certain Peng is behind this.
But you're certain Peng is behind this.<eos> He blew up our plane, to be sure<eos> But we have reason to believe that pirates from Shanzhai were responsible for the attack in Vietnam.<eos> So... We sortie the ships in Okinawa.<eos> Shackleton and Hayward can be in the region in a matter of days.<eos> I appreciate that, sir, but those ships need to be in Japan, investigating the possibility of the virus mutation.<eos> And a larger presence here may draw attention, and it could be counterproductive.<eos> I need a lower profile.<eos> You?<eos> You're the Chief of Naval Operations and, for all intents and purposes, the head of our entire military.
And a larger presence here may draw attention, and it could be counterproductive.<eos> I need a lower profile.<eos> You?<eos> You're the Chief of Naval Operations and, for all intents and purposes, the head of our entire military.<eos> I need you running our global operations from here.<eos> Sir, the James is without its senior leadership.<eos> I can't just leave anybody...<eos> I understand your loyalty to your people, Tom.<eos> This isn't just about my people.<eos> You sent me here because the region is a tinderbox.
I'm glad they fit, sir.<eos> Your name tag's being made, and we'll get those eagles for the collar.<eos> And you should know Lieutenant Burk is stable.<eos> HM2 Logan pulled a 762 slug from his leg.<eos> I heard.<eos> He's tough, your brother.<eos> Always has been.<eos> I want you to know...<eos> While I'm in command of the ship and until the return of your shipmates, I've decided to make Lieutenant Granderson my acting X.O.<eos> I understand you have seniority over her, but I cannot afford to lose you running combat right now.

Not contacting the CO when I sensed there was trouble in Vietnam.
Why take our blood when there's a cure?<eos> A feast for you.<eos> Eat.<eos> Apricots and steak...<eos> All rich in iron.<eos> Fattening up the cows for the milk.<eos> You join me, Captain.<eos> I eat with my crew.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're a captain.
Hey, are we going to war with China?<eos> What would make you say something like that?<eos> POTUS was a little dodgy on the subject at his presser last night.<eos> Haven't seen even one photo op of Chandler and Peng, not even a handshake.<eos> It makes me wonder what's going on.<eos> And so you jump to war as a conclusion?<eos> The President's strategy is classified.<eos> But rest assured, it's working.<eos> Mrs. Green...<eos> While you were out on the James, there was a deafening silence from the top.

I'd just remind him not to forget that.
I have thought a lot about my marriage.<eos> I don't need Bill to be all things.<eos> As long as my home and my family stays intact.<eos> Your home is safe.<eos> We do understand each other, Gin.<eos> Hugh Hefner sent us champagne?<eos> I still don't understand why he wants to invest in our research.<eos> It's not just Hef.<eos> I've got this big shot perfume guy from New York who wants in.<eos> We began discussing a potential investor, Mrs. Johnson and I immediately agreed that you were the right man for the job.

So...<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I have a year to send a gift, right?<eos> Do you know what my husband really is...<eos> Rick?<eos> He's protection.<eos> - From?<eos> - You, for starters. So why don't you grab your things and get out of here?<eos> Now.<eos> You've become quite the regular here at city hall, Dr. Masters.
You've become quite the regular here at city hall, Dr. Masters.<eos> Let's see, we have a recent investigation into a relationship with a minor.<eos> An investigation that was immediately dropped when the charges proved groundless.<eos> We have charges of pandering and promoting prostitution.<eos> Those charges have not been dropped.<eos> They will be shortly.<eos> I'm currently interviewing attorneys.<eos> And now you've destroyed private property as a result of driving with a blood alcohol level of twice the legal limit.<eos> I will pay the damages, despite the fact it was the other driver who hit me.<eos> But you were drunk, so I'm taking your license for three months.
And now you've destroyed private property as a result of driving with a blood alcohol level of twice the legal limit.<eos> I will pay the damages, despite the fact it was the other driver who hit me.<eos> But you were drunk, so I'm taking your license for three months.<eos> You'll also complete a mandatory AA program.<eos> AA?<eos> Look, I can assure you I'm-- 90 meetings in 90 days at the Alcoholics Anonymous chapter of your choosing.<eos> You'll also perform some form of community service...<eos> Come on.<eos> ...not of your choosing.<eos> My daughter attends St. Vibiana's Elementary, so you'll will go and tell those students the story of St. Joseph, now that, thanks to you and your car, his likeness is a pile of rubble and no longer there to greet and guide them each day.
Sure, if you want to be technical.<eos> I do. I-I'm also curious where you conducted this nipple study.<eos> Okay, everything I'm discussing either comes from my column or my book.<eos> Yes, "The Method,"<eos> but the data in "The Method" comes from...?<eos> My studies at the University of Michigan and my time spent at the Masters and Johnson clinic.<eos> And yet your face draws a complete blank, which is funny because<eos> I'm usually so good with faces, technically.<eos> I knew it.<eos> You're Virginia Johnson.
Libby, I know you probably don't want to talk to me right now.<eos> You're right. I don't.<eos> It's simple how they run, but I just don't understand.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm gonna grab my sad sack husband and get on the next bus to St. Louis because our sex life-- It's like Chinese water torture.<eos> Well, we are very busy, Mrs...?<eos> Clarice Penelope Plantagenet.<eos> Clarice.<eos> A long waiting list to see new patients in St. Louis.<eos> Then you and Doc Masters ought to franchise your operation, give people all over the country a chance to benefit from your good work.
I, uh, fucked up royally last night.<eos> Found myself in a bar with four shots of Jameson under my belt.<eos> Woke up this morning feeling like dog shit.<eos> But, uh, everybody makes mistakes, and I make more than your average bear, but I'll take this one-day chip tonight and try to do my best tomorrow.<eos> Thanks for listening.<eos> Thank you, Trevor.<eos> Before we go, if there's anyone else who has less than 30 days sobriety or is in the meeting for their first time, please feel free to identify yourself and your disease.<eos> I suppose I could sign this.<eos> Uh, the requirement of the court is just that I attend.<eos> And you did attend, but like all things in life, you gonna get out of AA what you put in.
Do you know what the first step is?<eos> The idea of AA is organized around--<eos> Steps. Lots-- lots of steps.<eos> Yes, I-I saw that in your-- in your pamphlet, which I read.<eos> Uh, the first step is admit you're powerless over alcohol. But that doesn't apply to--<eos> Admit you're powerless over alcohol and that your life has become unmanageable.<eos> If you're handing me court papers, can't we safely say your life is unmanageable?<eos> Thank you for that. In the meantime, I'd appreciate if you signed the papers.<eos> Or, if you have a problem with that, I could go to some other meeting.<eos> You will stay in my meeting.
And since you don't have a license, I'll drive you here every day myself.<eos> Oh, you will absolutely not.<eos> I'll insist on it.<eos> It'll remind me of just how far I've come.<eos> Do you know what the second step is?<eos> No, I stopped reading the pamphlet because I'm not an alcoholic.<eos> So, if you're not an alcoholic, what are you?<eos> Court mandated.<eos> Surely, you're more than that.<eos> Just out of curiosity, what are you?

I don't have a business partner or even likely a business by the time the court's finished with me.<eos> I am not an obstetrician. I haven't delivered a baby in years.<eos> I'm not a father of any worth.<eos> I am not a man with a home or a car or even a clean suit. So I really-- I really do appreciate you asking, Louise, because now that we know what I'm not, maybe you can check in your little book of steps there and tell me what I am.<eos> The second step is giving yourself over to a higher power.<eos> Well, God and I are not speaking.<eos> I said higher power.<eos> That simply means God as you understand Him.<eos> I do not understand God. I'm not a man of faith. I am a man of science.<eos> I knew you had to be something.
Ready to meet with the Connollys?<eos> They'll be very happy that you have arrived.<eos> Betty, Virginia was the one who took care of all that-- the intakes, the interviews, the--<eos> I'll be right there with you.<eos> That is not a solution.<eos> That is the only solution, doc.<eos> I have been here while you've been on your Rumspringa or whatever.<eos> So I'm asking you right now to please, please get your ass in there and do this for me.<eos> The truth is I have no interest in being reasonable or generous.<eos> I want you to do anything and everything you can to protect me and my children as we proceed though this ordeal.
- I definitely don't.<eos> I am the one who was left with confused children and nosy neighbors and gossiping friends.<eos> Just this morning, when I was canceling his subscription to the American Medical Journal, and the girl on the phone said, "Why?" So I told her.<eos> That you're getting divorced?<eos> That at first, it was a simple dog bite. Then he began to shake and suffer terrifying hallucinations.<eos> Eventually, paralysis set in.<eos> It's a horrible death.<eos> Excruciating, really.<eos> My husband suffered greatly.<eos> Mrs. Masters, you're not the first client to fantasize her husband's death or to feel anger at the demise of her marriage.
Hef thinks it's fun to have the girls on wheels, but he doesn't have to find somebody to refinish the parquet floors.<eos> Is Dr. Masters settling up with the driver?<eos> Dr. Masters isn't here.<eos> Oh, caught another flight?<eos> No, he is not coming at all.<eos> I came to talk to Hef alone.<eos> Oh. The wires monitor physiological response.<eos> So if you are able to get an erection, that would indicate secondary impotence, ruling out any physical reason for the lack of arousal with your wife.<eos> You're saying it's psychological?<eos> Are you saying it is?

You're the doctor.
You're gonna need a lot more than that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for telling me.<eos> I can get 'em for you.<eos> The Governor's the one holding the reins on this thing.<eos> He doesn't want the bad P.R.<eos> But it's also true he can't win without our help. So if you wanna do this right, you wanna go up there and find Breece's murderer, we're gonna have to work together.<eos> You know, the more I think about it... The more I think my sister is right.<eos> Got no right blowing up that mountain.<eos> You go ahead and make your phone call.

We're not... not dangerous.<eos> Were you expecting a thank you?<eos> From now on, stay inside the vehicle.<eos> _<eos> Let me help you, sir.<eos> Step aside.<eos> I am Eldritch Palmer.<eos> I own this ship.<eos> With all due respect, sir, I can't do that.<eos> - You are?
How is any of this useful?<eos> There's a commonality among all these hunters:<eos> the desire to act alone.<eos> They appear monomaniacal and often seem to be gripped by madness.<eos> Good thing none of this applies to you.<eos> Or you.<eos> It is rude to just stand there.<eos> Mr. Pirk, is it?<eos> Roald Pirk.<eos> And you are Ms. Van Orden?

A little help here, folks?<eos> - Alright, come on.<eos> - There we go.<eos> There you go.<eos> How many fingers am I holding up?<eos> - I'm fine. I just stumbled.<eos> - I'm going to get an IV.<eos> I... No need for that...<eos> We can come back another time if you're not up for this.<eos> Who are you?
- I'm fine. I just stumbled.<eos> - I'm going to get an IV.<eos> I... No need for that...<eos> We can come back another time if you're not up for this.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - Sanjay Desai.<eos> - He's a new associate of ours, Eldritch.<eos> Working to help us.<eos> A very impressive young man.<eos> And I hear that you are facilitating a very important shipment for us.
If you think I would let you within a hundred feet of the Lumen...<eos> I'm not going to steal it again, Professor.<eos> Yes, your word.<eos> I want these answers just as much as you do.<eos> Wait right here.<eos> Yes?<eos> What is it?<eos> Mr. Kruger?<eos> My name is Roald Pirk.<eos> I believe you are expecting me.
My name is Roald Pirk.<eos> I believe you are expecting me.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Have we met someplace before, sir?<eos> Not that I recall.<eos> Please.<eos> May I offer you a drink?<eos> If it's all the same to you, I wish to get our business completed as soon as possible.<eos> Why?<eos> Surely you don't believe all of the superstitious notions that people have about the book?
The problem is that we have been spreading our forces too thin.<eos> We need to fall back to smaller enclaves,<eos> - ones that we have the means to defend.<eos> - If we play this right, we can hold out until the labs in Atlanta, D.C., and Virginia come up with a cure for this.<eos> I understand your impulse to hang on. But the hard truth is, unless we pull out now, we're all going to die here.<eos> And where would we go, Captain?<eos> Saratoga Springs, in the mountains outside of Albany.<eos> They have a thousand troops.<eos> We can hold out there until D.C. gets their shit together.<eos> You want to cut and run?
It's been an honor, Councilwoman.<eos> _<eos> Good to see you again, Bob.<eos> - It's been too long.<eos> - Mr. Palmer.<eos> Sorry to barge in unannounced, but I'm here about a delicate matter; one that requires the utmost discretion.<eos> It's not an imposition, sir.<eos> I was just surprised to see you up and about.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> - Sanjay Desai told us he had to assume your responsibilities because you were incapacitated.
- Thank you for agreeing to see me.<eos> - I must say, I was surprised to hear from you.<eos> It's been a long time, and when last we spoke, you rejected my offer.<eos> I was young, impulsive.<eos> Frankly, the commitment seemed too daunting.<eos> And I thought that, over time, money would help me overcome my medical problems.<eos> I realize now that was folly.<eos> So I'm hoping we might revisit your proposal.<eos> - The door is still open.<eos> - I want you to understand that there will be no more hesitation.

They must be coming from underground somehow.<eos> They're digging their own tunnels now.<eos> Good news is that now I know where they're coming from.<eos> Central Park.<eos> Central Park, central nest.<eos> _<eos> So the convict teams will clear out all of the tunnels - underneath the park... - Got it, yeah.<eos> Ambitious.<eos> - Concerns?<eos> - Same ones you have.
- Would you put this on, please?<eos> - Better, thanks.<eos> I only have a few minutes here. - Oh, of course.<eos> - We can roll.<eos> So how big's the team covering what's going on here in the city?<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> Our New York bureau shut down three days ago.<eos> My guys and me refused to leave.<eos> All right, we're rolling.<eos> Ms. Faraldo, you've been leading the charge here in New York City.
That deceitful, half-human, full-on thief decapitated the King Rat, right?<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Na Zdorov'ya!<eos> Now the question is... what's next?<eos> Without the controlling intelligence of the Master, the strigoi are on their own.<eos> Untethered.<eos> Feral.<eos> - Every muncher for himself.<eos> - Precisely.<eos> Well, then, you're right;
That does not qualify?<eos> Could you have been wrong?<eos> About dying after the Master dies?<eos> One only has one chance to prove such a theory. Why?<eos> What is the state of the city now?<eos> Strigoi roaming the streets, still feeding, but rudderless.<eos> - No central intelligence.<eos> - That's promising.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You seem not to be convinced.
At best, I look like an inept asshole.<eos> At worst, a lying sack of shit.<eos> That interview was humiliating, Frank.<eos> Not to mention, a 16-year-old boy?<eos> We are doing what's necessary, for this city and for you.<eos> Ah, I love that.<eos> For me, yeah? - That's rich.<eos> - In case you haven't noticed, the prison system has collapsed.<eos> We're putting these dirt bags to good use.<eos> Since when do you make these calls, Captain?
I knew that you could.<eos> There's... there's something different about these creatures.<eos> OK? I mean, they're not moving together anymore.<eos> Right?<eos> They're doing their own thing now.<eos> I'll make a note of it.<eos> - Can I help you with something?<eos> - Officer? Hi, yeah.<eos> I'm Justine Faraldo, Director of Security for New York City.<eos> Yes, ma'am. We know who you are.
- Come on, let's go.<eos> You heard about all the shit that went down today?<eos> And still, this is what you're working on?<eos> I'm sorry, how is this any of your business?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Faith in the war effort is paramount.<eos> And what you're doing here undercuts all of that.<eos> Your work does nothing but serve your ego and cause me and my people more harm.<eos> And too many brave souls have given their lives for me to put up with your shit.<eos> You really don't have a choice about what I do or don't do.
We found a burner cell in Knox's apartment, not attached to any case he was working.<eos> It's the phone that called Lobos the day he went missing.<eos> It's the phone that belonged to someone in this office that leaked Lobos's location.<eos> Add that to his obsession with the case, luring Ruiz back, even while under suspension.<eos> Looks like Greg Knox was your leak.<eos> - No.<eos> - No way.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> It doesn't matter what you believe.

Let me let that add to your night. - Whoo.<eos> - Only the best for the best.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Hey, man, you really turned up the place tonight.<eos> Let me tell the bartender what to do for you.<eos> You make sure you take care of this man and all his people, all right?<eos> When that's dead, I got a whole crate upstairs.<eos> Mr. St. Patrick.<eos> Mr. Bassett.<eos> We feel you are right.
That will cause a catastrophic cascade of events.<eos> I know.<eos> Do it now, please.<eos> Alexa, did Otto say where he was going?<eos> Um, no.<eos> I said something to him I shouldn't have.<eos> I hurt him.<eos> No, Mary.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> I mean, you would never do anything to hurt Otto.
- Let me go!<eos> Calm down! Calm down.<eos> That's enough!<eos> That agent attacked me!<eos> You've got a big problem here.<eos> He took my daughter.<eos> He took her.<eos> I know what it looks like, but there was no other way. He took my daughter.<eos> Let me tell you what this looks like.<eos> It looks like you were assaulting Mr. Graff and your C.I. was attempting to restrain you.
Physically, his cells were recoded for optimal capacity.<eos> Physically, he is the best version.<eos> Inside, however, I'm still just me.<eos> You saw it.<eos> I think Gracie saw it, too.<eos> Don't you say her name.<eos> Agent Pritchard's facial effect indicates he is at 54% acceptance.<eos> What the hell is that thing?<eos> Agent Pritchard, let me take you through this slowly, from the start.<eos> You're not taking me through anything. Mnh-mnh.
Let's solve this case, Duval.<eos> When we get there, I do the questioning.<eos> You don't talk.<eos> They were so rare. Each of them.<eos> I remember some of their essays.<eos> Who could want to take these lives?<eos> That's what we're trying to find out.<eos> Maybe you can help.<eos> The only thing they have in common, other than being gifted, is an application to this school.<eos> As admissions director, you see every application.
But he sought out treatment.<eos> Well, we're understaffed.<eos> At most, I saw him once a week.<eos> I mean, it wasn't enough.<eos> Emotionally, he was like a child.<eos> Did he ever mention any of those names in that file there?<eos> Did he ever mention a Kevin Whitfield?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry, he didn't.<eos> May I ask... do you not speak?
Whatever you say.<eos> I really need you to consider canceling this presentation.<eos> You have to, Mary.<eos> You have to cancel.<eos> I can't. Our stock is cratering.<eos> If they don't see me out there today, it's all over.<eos> - It's too dangerous.<eos> - You almost died this morning.<eos> - Why risk it?<eos> - I'm not risking it. You're here.
You first. Come on.<eos> Arthur, did Otto tell you to do this?<eos> Yes. It was his last command.<eos> Did he leave a message for me?<eos> He said please don't forget to feed his fish... and thank you.<eos> Goodbye, Mary.<eos> You there?<eos> You seeing it?<eos> I'm seeing something.<eos> I'm not sure what it is, but I think you should come in.
So Davos or Rio?<eos> Neither.<eos> Work.<eos> I feel good. And I want to work.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Yeah, what do you have?<eos> She said she woke up on a table.<eos> There were three people in the room, but she only got a good look at one of them.<eos> Can she I.D. him?<eos> I think maybe you should go ask her that yourself, sir.
No, mustard is yellow.<eos> You know, you go to The Ball Park. You put it on a hot dog. Yellow.<eos> I don't need to be learning new things at my... age.<eos> - I'm calling Security.<eos> - Relax. - I'm a friend of Mary's.<eos> - Oh, are you?<eos> And where exactly on the Venn diagram of Ms. Goodwin's life does your circle overlap with hers?<eos> The Venn...?<eos> Corporate? Academic? Charitable?<eos> I'm quite intimate with all of her circles, and I don't remember you being in any of them.
Mr. Pritchard has been helping me with my vernacular phrasing.<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> And show me who's at the gate, please.<eos> My sister isn't here.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> I know. I want to talk with you.<eos> Arthur, run the possible scenarios if I let him in.<eos> Analyzing all the variables, including your social skills and what he might find in this house, the probability of you ending up in prison is 62%.<eos> Go away.<eos> I know you're a genius, so maybe you can help me understand why the guy your sister is with has DNA with a, uh, what do you call it, um, transgenic mutation?
All of them.<eos> What can you tell me about transgenic mutation?<eos> You're the one who said those words when you were standing outside.<eos> Yeah, but it involves Pritchard, right?<eos> What can you tell me about him?<eos> About Jimmy Pritchard?<eos> Nothing.<eos> A guy in your position doesn't usually surround himself with people he doesn't know.<eos> I don't surround myself with any people.<eos> You and your sister are very close.
Oh, I know you.<eos> I know how you beat the unions in '85.<eos> Pritchard!<eos> I remember a Pritchard.<eos> Drunk ex-Sheriff who killed himself in disgrace.<eos> I see a resemblance.<eos> Mary, Otto has let an FBI agent in the house.<eos> It is not going well.<eos> The agent has begun to touch things.<eos> You know, I read that you have issues you deal with... the need for order and predictability.
Mary said she needed it.<eos> Did she say for what?<eos> No, Otto, she didn't.<eos> If you want your hat, Sheriff... you're gonna have to come and get it.<eos> I think you hurt Lenny's feelings.<eos> I think he'll get over it.<eos> He said you wanted to see me.<eos> I prefer to do business with the boss.<eos> I can understand that.<eos> You're a man who knows what he wants.
Me?<eos> No, that was Uncle Jack.<eos> Maybe you two can throw that ball around outside.<eos> Mr. Brown.<eos> Joan.<eos> If you can prove funds, I think I have something to sell you.<eos> Joan Solodar was your father's C.I.?<eos> For the record, Duval didn't know that.<eos> Dad only told that to me.<eos> Because he's the good son and you're the bad son.
Dad only told that to me.<eos> Because he's the good son and you're the bad son.<eos> It's what makes me such a good C.I.<eos> I'm telling you, she's the money behind the Jalisco brothers.<eos> You're asking me to go after Joan Solodar, a clean record, taxpaying local businesswoman, based on the word of a corrupt, disgraced sheriff?<eos> Yes, ma'am, we are.<eos> I am.<eos> My father may have been all those things, but whatever he did, he did it for the good of this city.<eos> If he says she's the one behind that heroin, then we need to act on it.<eos> You want to stop these drugs.

We're... we're not a couple.<eos> This is just for me.<eos> So then you're just a... just a good friend, then.<eos> Well... well, we all need more of those.<eos> Why don't you show us around the loft.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's open plan, as you can see, and there's an outdoor space, as well.<eos> It's good for a dog.<eos> You sound like a man who'd have a dog.
Agent Pritchard.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Gentlemen, excuse us, please.<eos> We just got word that... that Gloria Mundy was pronounced dead at County General.<eos> Gloria?<eos> What happened?<eos> She stepped into the street.<eos> Hit-and-run. No witnesses.<eos> I was just talking to her.<eos> I know. You were her last call.
I'm sorry, is something wrong?<eos> Show me your papers!<eos> Stop it!<eos> He's one of mine!<eos> You got what you came for, now go!<eos> Now then, how are you feeling?<eos> Better since last time, hm?<eos> Yes.<eos> Has anyone ever told you you have a historically unlucky sense of timing?<eos> (with French accent): More times than you'd think.
Penicillin.<eos> I don't write them up or report it to their commanders. They get treated.<eos> They don't spread it to other Frenchwomen, and that's the only part I really care about.<eos> I promised them there would be no one here. They were scared.<eos> - And scared Germans are...<eos> - Unpredictable.<eos> Especially when they're itchy.<eos> (without accent): Doctor Durand.<eos> I came here to talk about your other sideline.<eos> Who are you?
- And scared Germans are...<eos> - Unpredictable.<eos> Especially when they're itchy.<eos> (without accent): Doctor Durand.<eos> I came here to talk about your other sideline.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You don't need to know my real name.<eos> I don't know what you mean by "sideline.<eos> Please.<eos> You're a source for hope.
You don't need to know my real name.<eos> I don't know what you mean by "sideline.<eos> Please.<eos> You're a source for hope.<eos> And I have "patients" who could use your help.<eos> There's been a misunderstanding.<eos> I'm going to ask you to leave.<eos> Oh, we didn't order dessert.<eos> Rote Grutze.<eos> You and your husband were kind enough to be our guests last month.
- I thought I told you to go away.<eos> - You did.<eos> But I kept thinking, a doctor in the Marais, not taking on new patients?<eos> No appointments in the middle of the day, no one coming, or going.<eos> So it's true.<eos> Most of your patients aren't around anymore, are they?<eos> These soldiers, they keep turning up. I can't risk it! I'm not helping anymore.<eos> Tell me how you did it, then.<eos> Let me take the risk.<eos> - It's not something you could do.
These soldiers, they keep turning up. I can't risk it! I'm not helping anymore.<eos> Tell me how you did it, then.<eos> Let me take the risk.<eos> - It's not something you could do.<eos> - My friends are hiding in the woods 20 kilometres from here. They'll die.<eos> A lot of people are dying.<eos> The world has gone mad.<eos> Again.<eos> What do you think those German commanders will do when they find out about your social sideline?<eos> You want me to help people, but you are threatening
I hope you're enjoying your dessert.<eos> My friend and I came here to share a coffee, without judgment.<eos> Ah, well, why don't you take my ration card, huh?<eos> Take our bread and our cabbage too.<eos> Andre, please, I must ask you to leave.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm going to go.<eos> - I've lost my appetite.<eos> - You have no right!<eos> - You don't know us!
30 seconds.<eos> Breaches guest privacy.<eos> I'm sorry, Sir.<eos> There are no possible circumstances in which that scenario could happen.<eos> - 50 quid.<eos> - Done.<eos> In and out, quick as you can.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Get out.<eos> Did you know about this?
Now... until we know enough to address the situation properly, I don't want anyone discussing it, okay?<eos> With anyone.<eos> No one, and that means... everyone.<eos> Okay?<eos> Am I clear?<eos> I think not.<eos> Boris! Uh, hello.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.<eos> Yes.<eos> You appear to have a knack for not expecting things, Mr. Lawson.
Well, I appreciate that. I do, but as you can see, the damage has been done.<eos> Safely from her diagnosis...<eos> Well, this is just one show, right?<eos> - This once proud...<eos> - Political hopeful Diana...<eos> - Well, that... - New York Senate candidate...<eos> Again, I am so... so sorry.<eos> On the bright side, Mr. Lawson, now I have a few more campaign issues to which I intend to speak personally like privacy, cyber security, how our health care system is being run by marginally competent bureaucrats.<eos> That doesn't include me, right?<eos> I need to address this, Mr. Lawson, and you and your hospital need to be held accountable.

And don't forget to bring chips!<eos> This is my floor... no, no...<eos> So... now we are not only married, but we have my daughter and his twins, and another boy or girl on the way.<eos> Which, of course, is the perfect time for me to be starting medical school.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I don't know why I just told you all of that.<eos> Oh, I have that effect on people... it's my gift.<eos> Sometimes my burden, but... it's my calling and it gives my life purpose. - Oh, so you're a...<eos> - Hairdresser.<eos> You and your son could not be more different.
Good or bad?<eos> Uh... both?<eos> Hi.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> My attorneys will be glad to speak with you.<eos> You leaked your own medical record.<eos> What?<eos> I just found out that none of our patients' medical records were copied or even opened, for that matter.<eos> Yet somehow, right after you found out about the hack, your information was mysteriously... everywhere.<eos> Because you... wanted it that way.
I'm very glad.<eos> - What about the girl?<eos> - She...<eos> She's a friend, boss.<eos> We went to school together in Envigado.<eos> I know her very well and I know where she works, so she's someone we can trust, boss.<eos> Listen, Limón...<eos> Do you know what it means to work for me?<eos> It's an honor to work for you, Don Pablo.<eos> You've done so much for the poor in Medellín... if I have to lose my life for you...
Good? Good?<eos> -How are you, Don Pablo?<eos> -Good.<eos> -It's him. -How are you?<eos> -In the flesh? -How are you, son?<eos> -Good?<eos> -Boss, we should get going.<eos> Let them see me. Let them see me.<eos> -I never thought I'd meet you in person. -How are you?<eos> I'm well, ma'am, how are you?
I know where you can find one of Escobar's men.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Which one?<eos> There's a reward, right?<eos> Yes, there's a reward.<eos> What's your information, miss?<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> La Quica.<eos> La Quica?<eos> You know La Quica?
Yes, he's on very good terms with his mother.<eos> He'll go and see her once a month.<eos> By himself?<eos> What did his father do?<eos> His...father died when he was 14.<eos> But what did he do?<eos> He was a butcher.<eos> Look... ..when will I be able to see my husband?<eos> Why-why has he been taken away?<eos> How do you pay for this apartment... ..and the maid, if you don't work and your husband earns little money?
Are you?<eos> I am...special.<eos> What did your father, the butcher, think of you?<eos> He, er...he never spoke to me.<eos> The most expensive lawyers in Paris... ..are coming after you...today.<eos> Your mother can't afford an expensive lawyer.<eos> Neither can your wife anymore... ..can she?<eos> We've learnt from your concierge that she hasn't paid the rent for seven months.<eos> And the money's dried up, hasn't it?<eos> You're a failure, Moncin.
I think that your mother felt very threatened by your wife... ..because she also wanted to be mother...to her little baby doll.<eos> I think, at first, she probably tried to contain her jealousy, and tried to control her, like she controlled you.<eos> Mother arranged for us to be married, so long as we stayed with her.<eos> How long did that last?<eos> Until Yvonne found the place on Saint-Germain.<eos> We moved one night as Mother slept.<eos> Did you feel free there?<eos> No!<eos> Thank you.<eos> They both knew that you were the killer, didn't they?
Self-fulfillment, word travel, career advancement?<eos> At least I get to lie in.<eos> Danny!<eos> Listen...<eos> You do not go in there on your own.<eos> Don't you remember what happened last year?<eos> Last year?<eos> His friend's little brother went missing from here.<eos> Terrible.<eos> You worked on that case, didn't you?
How are you doing after last night?<eos> Yeah, you know, fine.<eos> I really don't have a lot of time.<eos> OK, let me put you on speakerphone.<eos> - Hey, Simon.<eos> - Why haven't you found my dad?<eos> Your dad's alive.<eos> You wanna see him?<eos> Come with me.<eos> Who are you?
So I ask you, sir, please, please do something about this.<eos> What do you want me to do about it?<eos> Stop it!<eos> It's your company.<eos> Please.<eos> A very wise man once told me, what's right is right.<eos> What's what is what?<eos> - What's right is right. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Who said that?<eos> - You did.
I'll make a mint.<eos> David! Bring in an N.D.A. so he can sign it so I don't get busted again for insider trading.<eos> Sir, if you could just sign this.<eos> Lobsong?<eos> Lobsong, y-your... your leg.<eos> - Y-you have one.<eos> - I have two legs.<eos> No.<eos> No, you... you lost one on... on the mountain.<eos> When you were climb... you hacked it off with a crampon.
So who is running the place?<eos> !<eos> You tell the animal to go back and kill the wife and kill whoever's running it!<eos> Ow!<eos> What if he told them what he saw?<eos> !<eos> Now, shh, shh!<eos> No, no.<eos> Dope.<eos> You give them the dope.
Harvick up to fifth place by Edwards. A valiant effort.<eos> Just overtake him, you idiot.<eos> Clark Bronwen?<eos> Who's asking?<eos> You're that chick who was hanging around Tail Lights.<eos> I'm a reporter for CCPN.<eos> I want you to stop holding the races.<eos> Sweetheart, unless you could find me another way to make five grand a night, it ain't gonna happen.<eos> Here's a preview of the exposé that I am writing.<eos> You are the star of the piece.
I had a little chat with some of your previous associates and dug up some revealing details about you.<eos> Like the gambling rings you run or the thefts you've been involved with.<eos> I'm sure the CCPD will be interested in this one.<eos> You're forgetting something in here.<eos> Aggravated assault.<eos> You think you're the only one that can play this game?<eos> I could find out where you live, what you eat, when you sleep, every little detail about your life.<eos> Publish that trash, we'll see what happens to you, hmm?<eos> This entire conversation is being recorded and sent to CCPN.<eos> If you or any of your people lay a hand on me, my colleagues will send this to cops immediately.
- Yeah.<eos> - Wow. - No, it took me a year to get $200,000... now I'm gonna have to start over.<eos> Why don't you do something people want to see, like... gun control?<eos> Hey, I can get you an NEA grant tomorrow...<eos> Okay, how about we let Laurel control her own life for a few hours, please? - Thank you.<eos> No, sir.<eos> No, I am still here. I did not have you on mute.<eos> No. No, I understand, Dr. Daudier, but the Republicans want to decimate your budget.<eos> No, I know it's science and I know it's important.<eos> I don't think you understand how important, Senator.
You will investigate their complaints... this is your brother's office... and then you'll do what you can to satisfy their complaints.<eos> This... is where you'll be meeting them.<eos> And then you'll give them these pens, caps and signed photos.<eos> It's all about getting them to vote next election, so just keep them happy.<eos> I'll be right down the hall if you need anything. Good luck.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Laurel.<eos> You're all meeting with me today. I guess.<eos> It's my first day, so, you know... go easy on me.<eos> It says here you're having Social Security problems, Claire?
Oh, God, I can't remember.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Just take a breath.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> Can't you do anything? !<eos> - Move, move, move! We have to move!<eos> Let's go! - I can't hold him.<eos> Get them out!<eos> Just focus on my fingers.<eos> You're okay.
You're an excellent liar.<eos> I need to fix you up, all right?<eos> So we're gonna go to my room.<eos> I bet you say that to all the girls.<eos> Only deposed presidents in the middle of a military coup.<eos> Is this all strictly necessary?<eos> It's for your own protection.<eos> And you're the one from the party.<eos> Matt Gibbons.<eos> And you are?
My motorcade got attacked.<eos> I know, we saw it on TV.<eos> They said you were killed.<eos> I managed to make my way out of the car.<eos> Some of my men made it, too.<eos> They told me to run.<eos> But then they stayed behind to fight.<eos> Good men.<eos> I didn't realize how badly I was hurt.<eos> And then you found me.
Open the door. Open up, this is your last chance.<eos> Oh, hi, guys.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was in the john.<eos> How can I help?<eos> You really should be downstairs.<eos> We don't want civilians running around, getting into trouble.<eos> Yeah, uh, sorry.<eos> I recognize you.<eos> You were at the reception earlier with... let me see, Gabrielle.
The leaders would make sure they have at least tacit outside support before they move, corporations that would jump in and do business with new bosses.<eos> All in exchange for extremely favorable contracts to be negotiated later.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I still don't see how it helps though.<eos> Because there's more going on here than a coup.<eos> I think Lazar just met with his fixer and... I think I know who it is.<eos> I'm gonna try and get something going. Slow down Lazar, give you some time.<eos> Oh, so I should just stay here, like a good girl, while my hero saves the day?<eos> No.<eos> Your people need you to stay alive, - right?
Petrenko!<eos> You are too late.<eos> The people know that I am alive.<eos> Your little adventure is over.<eos> And what if they see you shot dead on live TV?<eos> Who will they believe then?<eos> It's bad PR, General.<eos> What will your corporate sponsors think?<eos> Better to arrest her, put her on trial.<eos> You don't understand this country, Mr. Gibbons.
The circumstances are perfect.<eos> When I'm done with you, we shall leave.<eos> There's a reason it was called The Dark Ages.<eos> Traitor!<eos> In a startling reversal for the military rebels, President Petrenko has been found safe, and the coup's leader, General Lazar, has been killed in the fighting.<eos> Rebel soldiers have surrendered to government forces and it seems that this short-lived, but bloody coup is now over.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay...<eos> So, Mr. Henderson, we never established whether you were CIA or not.
His apartment was tossed, and... he hasn't been to work since Kate died.<eos> Maybe he quit and just packed in a hurry.<eos> - This is a waste of time.<eos> - Attrition, Mr. Warner.<eos> What?<eos> Your guests were led past Kate's body in a pool of blood.<eos> It's a miracle anybody went back to work at all.<eos> We're a family.<eos> Still, most people don't come that close to violence and remain unscathed.<eos> You seem to be handling it rather well.
Something about Tina Sawyer, and who is Tina Sawyer?<eos> I'm not going back there.<eos> Eric, I hear you, and I get it, but she's not gonna drop it.<eos> Would you rather she come to you?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll see you in a half-hour.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I understand you took out a T.R.O.<eos> So?<eos> I found out more about Ms. Sawyer's story, and it turns out you're not the only man that she's accused of domestic violence.
Previously on Angel From Hell...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No worries.<eos> Accidents happen.<eos> I'll bet you're a very sweet person, Dr. Allison.
Bit of a white lie.<eos> I just had to come up and meet Papa Bear.<eos> Marv!<eos> You're getting a face full of the sisters now, aren't you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Or should I say You're welcome?<eos> Sorry works.<eos> Well, congratulations on that one. She's a masterpiece.<eos> - Thank you. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Who are you?
Now, you can't be having all the fun.<eos> - So I guess he's ready, huh?<eos> - His hands work...<eos> Both of them.<eos> I'm gonna take a shower.<eos> I put my top guys on your personal detail.<eos> They've been running full-spectrum surveillance on you, tailing you here, and your apartment, to your wife's place, and despite your concerns, there doesn't appear to be anyone following you.<eos> Well, that's good to hear.<eos> Thank you for all your hard work.<eos> Uh, you and your guys have been rock solid, all right?
Hello?<eos> _<eos> Only a coward runs.<eos> Hierher.<eos> _<eos> - Go, go, go!<eos> - What the hell happened?<eos> The bastard's still alive.<eos> Sir.<eos> I want you to know I accept full responsibility for the bad intel regarding Brandt's movements.
- Have you read it?<eos> I thought you'd want to look at it first.<eos> - I'll leave you to it...<eos> - No... please.<eos> It's not William.<eos> - That's good news.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Every time I open one of these, I don't know what to hope for anymore.<eos> I'd be happy he's not dead.<eos> And I would hope that if he is in captivity, he's got someone looking out for him, like you are with Klaus.
I'm a military man, Mr. President.<eos> I don't imply.<eos> As I have told your president several times, we are doing everything we can, but even China cannot deliver the cure so quickly over so large an area.<eos> Due respect, Mr. President, I don't think you're trying hard enough. Captain.<eos> Sure, Honk Kong may get the cure.<eos> Shanghai, maybe. But what about the countries around you?<eos> Doses of the cure languish inside Chinese warehouses as we speak. While the rest of Asia goes begging, nobody here seems to be complaining.<eos> I don't know if they're afraid of you.<eos> I'm certainly not.<eos> If you won't spread the cure, my president wishes you to know that we will.
- How do you mean?<eos> - I didn't realize how much I lean on you.<eos> The way you handled everything after I was shot, it was masterful.<eos> Well, I... I guess I kept my head above water.<eos> Claire told me how supportive you were, what a natural leader you proved to be.<eos> I want that by my side, Donald, the same way that Meechum was, as my running mate.<eos> You want me on the ticket?<eos> A heartbeat away from the presidency is a serious matter now.<eos> Conway is a tough opponent.<eos> I never expected you'd want me.
- How would this even work?<eos> To get backbone access requires--<eos> We're getting a FISA ruling, counter-terrorism.<eos> I've never won a bid from the NSA--<eos> - LeAnn, let's go.<eos> - You'd win the bid.<eos> This is what you want, Aidan.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You came here to see if you can trust me. How do I know I can trust you?<eos> I don't care whether you trust me or not.

You're giving me far more credit than I deserve.<eos> If you bring the Justice Department into this,<eos> I'll come down hard on you for abuse of power, and that'll hurt you just as much as it hurts me.<eos> I won't have to.<eos> They read the newspapers, just like everyone else.<eos> Well, then you better hold them back.<eos> Let me remind you, Governor, in case you do become president one day, the Justice Department is autonomous.<eos> If I were to intervene, it would be illegal.<eos> Just like when you raided FEMA?<eos> See, the country wants to believe that you're corrupt, and I'll draw a very clear line between you--

Our conversation was in confidence.<eos> I don't feel comfortable with this.<eos> The Congressman is just as frustrated as you are, and he spoke to me because he wants to help.<eos> And so do I, General.<eos> Governor, I'm a soldier.<eos> I'm not going to play politics.<eos> You played politics the moment you opened your mouth to Pete.<eos> - Did you see my speech yesterday?<eos> - Yes, I did. I meant every word of it.<eos> Now, you and I have both fought for our country.
Think about the data they have already gathered.<eos> When you sold us this, you said it was going to be a last resort, not the only resort.<eos> There is no risk in getting surveillance approved.<eos> Then we either use it or we don't.<eos> But if you order this strike, sir, we don't even have the option.<eos> - You've met with him, Macallan.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - So, can he be trusted?<eos> - I honestly can't say.<eos> He understands the risks even better than you do.
- I'm gonna authorize the strike.<eos> - Sir... - Your guy's an unknown.<eos> Brockhart isn't.<eos> - Ma'am...<eos> - I agree with Francis.<eos> - Get me the Secretary of Defense.<eos> I've asked Claire to join us today because this directly affects the legislation she's trying to get passed.<eos> Your top three choices for running mate, they're all tight with the gun lobby.<eos> Mrs. Underwood...<eos> You know everyone in this room agrees with the reforms you want, but we're thinking about the general election, and the NRA is a terrible enemy for us to make.
They are.<eos> My meeting with the NRA did not go well.<eos> They're going to fight this tooth and nail.<eos> Well, of course they are.<eos> And... and the chances are the legislation won't pass.<eos> Oh, it'll pass.<eos> Because you are going to push it until it goes through both houses and gets on the books.<eos> We may have support now...<eos> But by the time this bill gets onto the floor...<eos> You focus on the language, Congressman.
Timing couldn't have been better.<eos> Oh, I see how you won.<eos> - Well, he must be on top of the world.<eos> - I... I can't imagine.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> How old are you? Thirty-five?<eos> Thirty-six.<eos> Oh, you've never thought about it, late at night?<eos> - The White House?<eos> - What else? - Have you?
- The White House?<eos> - What else? - Have you?<eos> - Haven't we all?<eos> I'm in no rush.<eos> Who knows? Maybe, one day.<eos> Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln.<eos> Tall men make great presidents.<eos> It's like you want me to run.<eos> Oh, goodness, no.<eos> You running?
You're not the only one who has to deal with children.<eos> According to international law, this ship is subject only to the laws of the country under whose flag she flies.<eos> Not while you're in port.<eos> Here, I am the rule of law.<eos> If you think I'm letting you - or any of your thugs on board this... - Thugs?<eos> You heard me.<eos> The crime happened in your square.<eos> Why won't you let my men come into town and investigate?<eos> Because you are visitors.<eos> And you're incompetent.
Unit Chief Jack Barrett of the FBI.<eos> The first thing for both of you to remember is that we're here to get Peter and Kate Carson back alive.<eos> My team has been in touch with the kidnappers.<eos> Their P.O.C. is a man who calls himself Ben.<eos> We want to focus our efforts on locating him. What do you have?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Great.<eos> Chief Inspector Rains, considering the victims are Americans, would you mind if the FBI ran point on this? No.<eos> That would be fine.<eos> Mr. Veidt, while you may be head of security while the ship's at sea, on land, we're all subject to the laws and conventions of the kingdom of Morocco.
Mr. Veidt, while you may be head of security while the ship's at sea, on land, we're all subject to the laws and conventions of the kingdom of Morocco.<eos> Please order your men to stay on the ship. Yes, Sir.<eos> We'd like to interview some of the crew.<eos> Great. Let's go to work.<eos> Agent Montgomery, my dad taught sixth grade for 40 years.<eos> I mean, my mom was a social worker. They built habitat houses in the summer.<eos> There's no way we can come up with $400,000.<eos> I'm not asking you to.<eos> I just have to let you know that the rules have changed.<eos> The FBI would be allowed to help facilitate any ransom exchange if you had the money and if that were your choice.
I told you. We're not rich.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> I can do that.<eos> I understand.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good news?<eos> Yes.<eos> The bank agreed to give me an emergency loan against my house.<eos> I can pay the ransom.<eos> You have news.
What if somebody wanted a more formal schooling?<eos> We are an open people.<eos> Some have been known to leave the camp and pursue an education.<eos> How do they pay for that?<eos> We are not without some resources.<eos> Families share.<eos> Mr. Jack.<eos> Your people tell us that we are poor, and they tell us that money can bring hope.<eos> Is it any surprise to you that men would do terrible things in the name of hope?<eos> So you do know who these men are.
Mr. Jack.<eos> Your people tell us that we are poor, and they tell us that money can bring hope.<eos> Is it any surprise to you that men would do terrible things in the name of hope?<eos> So you do know who these men are.<eos> Let us assume for a moment that someone from my camp committed the crimes of which you speak.<eos> I can assure you they will be found and they will be dealt with.<eos> The Carsons don't have time to wait for tribal justice.<eos> I mean no offense, but would you mind if we look around your camp?<eos> Of course I would mind.<eos> You want justice.
Suppose Jesse tells?<eos> He won't.<eos> I'll reassure of it.<eos> And neither will we.<eos> We tell no one.<eos> Hi, it's Gemma.<eos> Sorry to call.<eos> Oh, no! That's why I gave you my number.<eos> Can we meet right away?<eos> You have one new message.
About him?<eos> - Yeah, do you know him?<eos> - He's my neighbor, why?<eos> Do you know his name?<eos> What's he done?<eos> Oh, we're just following up a lead.<eos> His name is Jay Newman.<eos> He's a music producer - or used to be.<eos> He had a hit way back with Lucky Girl, Belinda Salt?<eos> You're too young to remember. But you should. It's
Emma, if you want me to come, I'm gonna go with you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> People sometimes make accusations in therapy that they believe are true but are not, in fact, true.<eos> Of course, yes, but what I told you is true.<eos> And I have reported it to the local authorities.<eos> They're looking into it. It will take some time.<eos> They will get back to me, but in the meantime, you are under my care,<eos> and we should simply continue to do the work you were here to do.<eos> You don't believe me.
God fucking damn it!<eos> I'm a sucker!<eos> What if she's not the only one?<eos> You sat and played board games with Mildred for two years, and you didn't have a clue.<eos> What if it's the same with Allison?<eos> Turn the car around.<eos> - Kyle...<eos> - I gotta see my wife.<eos> I understand, but you can't just go charging in there.<eos> You were about ready to kick in Mildred's door.
They're excitable.<eos> This is, um... Henry Hewitt, lab assistant.<eos> Pleased to make your acquaintance.<eos> And you... um, this is Barry.<eos> This is Cisco.<eos> - I'm Cisco.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And you are just a nice, normal guy.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> Dr. Wells, will you and your visitors be needing the conference room?
You can dance again.<eos> The French have failed with his leg.<eos> Thank you Doctor.<eos> For months we do not see in our meetings, doctor.<eos> I love Germany, but even more loved my son.<eos> I understand.<eos> But we have to endure this defeat?<eos> Is this humiliation?<eos> You share our desire for a strong nation, powerful.<eos> You are here for your leg,
From Paris.<eos> French.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry, I can not attend.<eos> Doctor, I have to talk to you ...<eos> No. Vayas.<eos> I'm not sick, I just want ... Shut up.<eos> each French It is the murderer of my son.<eos> Now go away.<eos> You are right, doctor.
As soon as I can, I will go to see them. I promise to Dr. Hoffmeister back to fiddling Frantz.<eos> Dear friends, I hope you are well.<eos> I miss, like the pure air of Quedlinburg.<eos> See you soon,<eos> Adrien."<eos> Do we have read everything?<eos> Yes.<eos> We received your letter well.<eos> Y...<eos> You know my lies and all my torments.
He returned to ask for my hand.<eos> It is tenacious.<eos> And if I said yes?<eos> Do you want to marry him?<eos> It was the desire of you.<eos> Before meeting Adrien.<eos> Dear Adrien.<eos> Forgive me for waiting for answer.<eos> Our pain is still deep.<eos> But we know that you are, as Frantz, a victim of this horrible war.

Both legs amputated.<eos> After that, he lost the will to live.<eos> And he made sure to end his life.<eos> But it is not Anatole whom you seek, is Adrien?<eos> Yes.<eos> Memory I am having met him at the Opera, before the war.<eos> He was a nice boy.<eos> His mother was angry with my husband, as a matter of inheritance.<eos> Do you know where he might be?<eos> You will come from Germany, does not it?
Yes.<eos> What relationship do you have with Adrien?<eos> We are friends.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Excuse me sir.<eos> - Yes? I seek Rivoire family house.<eos> - The castle is there, outside the city.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Good Morning.<eos> - You're the little Anna?
I guess you had not scheduled the meeting tonight.<eos> We have almost the same size.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> You're going great.<eos> I'll help with the belt.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Anna ... for all you have done for Adrien.<eos> I did nothing.<eos> You have received it, thou hast heard, when You could have refused.
Then you have not understood anything.<eos> Anna ...<eos> Anna. Espera. Anna, cálmate.<eos> Where will you sleep tonight?<eos> Stay. Go away early tomorrow morning, if you want.<eos> Nobody has anything against you.<eos> I explain to them that ...<eos> I...<eos> Forgive me, Anna.<eos> You're right.
For private concerts, sometimes he asks me to accompany the piano.<eos> We spent wonderful moments,<eos> I did go Paris and all sites of which Frantz had told us.<eos> Yesterday at the Louvre, Manet saw the box.<eos> I would love to you were here to share these moments.<eos> I do not know when to come back, I am happy in Paris, in the city Frantz loved.<eos> Beware.<eos> Beware.<eos> All my Love, Anna."<eos> Do you also love this picture?
Oh, you'll be back later?<eos> Well, I... I need to be with my wife.<eos> She's just a few blocks away.<eos> Listen, the only way to find a treatment or a vaccine is to use the virus.<eos> And since it's too dangerous to transport the virus out of the quarantine zone, I'm the only doctor who has access to it, and I can't do any more testing without more rats.<eos> Please come back.<eos> I'm counting on you, Bert.<eos> Doctor?<eos> Take care of that.<eos> Officer Riley, you come with me.
What we need is to shut down Leo Greene.<eos> I've seen this before in every hot zone I've been in.<eos> People want to be good and follow the rules and they do until someone pushes the panic button hard enough and they stop listening to the authorities.<eos> Which is exactly why we need more cops inside.<eos> We can't police the Internet, but 50 more cops making sure that...<eos> Lex, this isn't a parade.<eos> This is a quarantine.<eos> No one in.<eos> No one out.<eos> Right now, I need you to go talk to Leo Greene.
You think I wanna be here?<eos> 400 to 1, huh?<eos> Is that an official comment?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna walk outta here and try to do my civic and moral duty to help...<eos> - Your moral duty?<eos> - To help the people on the inside!<eos> - You actually believe...<eos> - I expect you to do the same!<eos> - Do you believe in the cordon?
- You actually believe...<eos> - I expect you to do the same!<eos> - Do you believe in the cordon?<eos> - I do.<eos> All right. I have one question for you, then.<eos> What happens when someone tries to leave the cordon?<eos> Major?<eos> You shoot 'em?<eos> That's the difference between me and you, Mr. Greene.<eos> You'll never have to answer that question.
Ugh!<eos> Ah, don't touch him! Don't touch him!<eos> Don't touch him!<eos> Pig!<eos> Go! Go, go, go!<eos> Follow them!<eos> Hey, Lex. Lex.<eos> Hey, Baker, with me.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Sir, you are breaking the law.
What I need is the truth... Yeah, I'm in the middle<eos> - of the damn hot zone, Lex. - Jana!<eos> If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You OK?<eos> The lobby. Have you seen the bodies in there?<eos> I have, unfortunately.<eos> We've converted the lobby to process incoming victims.<eos> The hospital is now dedicated exclusively to combating the virus.<eos> And I'm sorry you had to see that.
You got a tracker on me or something?<eos> If I said "yes," would you quit trying to break in to see your girlfriend?<eos> I think this is the part where you apologize for shooting me in my back.<eos> - You're the one who broke the law.<eos> - It's a bad law.<eos> And what do you care if I get in?<eos> It sets a precedent.<eos> When people stop believing in the quarantine, people like you trying to slip in, sick people trying to slip out.<eos> OK, the thing is, the government says this is almost over.<eos> And you're here talking about precedents, like... like it's something we might have to live with for a long time.
Beth, come by three today.<eos> -Hello?<eos> -Yeah, heard you.<eos> I need you home with grandma tonight.<eos> I got offered overtime at the store.<eos> Hire a babysitter.<eos> Hey!<eos> --Beth!<eos> Oh, look what you got here.<eos> There you go, sir.
And the hearing's is day after tomorrow, as scheduled.<eos> This is the plan from the beginning, so what is the matter?<eos> You know for sure that having him there would give us what we want.<eos> I know.<eos> We would be presenting the best case possible with him involved.<eos> Then fix it already.<eos> Do your job.<eos> It is your job.<eos> Right? Not mine.<eos> That's exactly what I've been trying to do, but you are not cooperating one bit...
- "Though your sins are like scarlet,<eos> "they shall be white as snow."<eos> "Though they are like crimson, they shall be like wool."<eos> - Isaiah.<eos> - One of my favorites.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> The Lord's words in your mouth?<eos> It makes me sick.<eos> Luke and I saw a lot of sin.<eos> More than you will ever see in your line of work, Reverend.
How did that turn out?<eos> Are you still together?<eos> Any kids?<eos> How do I stop this?<eos> Why would you want to stop it?<eos> You're special.<eos> Didn't your mama tell you not to keep your light under the bushel?<eos> Kyle!<eos> - Kyle!<eos> - You chose this, all right?
Also, I found a lab that'll do all the DNA testing.<eos> It's not that expensive, but it takes about a month.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> What?<eos> And get yourself cleaned up.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> He said I'd never be free of this.<eos> He was manipulating you, making you doubt yourself.<eos> What about you?<eos> He make you doubt yourself?
Nice.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> She's innocent.<eos> Yep.<eos> Everyone here at cloud 9 is so, so sorry To have inconvenienced you, and we are willing to Do anything to make it right.<eos> Here are some coupons.<eos> Uh, 25% off air fresheners. Ooh.<eos> Uh, buy one, get one free toothpaste.<eos> And, um, and a free slushie.<eos> But, you know what, something tells me You're not a slushie girl, so i'll just keep that.

You have two options.
I like her less than i like other people.<eos> I can't believe i'm gonna lose my job.<eos> I just upgraded all of the trash cans in my apartment.<eos> Stupid, dina, stupid!<eos> Relax, things have a way of working out.<eos> Oh, i'm sure you'll be happy with me gone.<eos> You can turn this place into some sort of Deranged religious cult.<eos> Well, well, look who didn't feel like Paying for their copy of "barney's great adventure."<eos> That's not mine, someone else must have put it there.<eos> Now, let me be clear. You have two options.
First time in our store? Oh, no.<eos> I've been here before.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I have a pretty good memory for faces, right there...<eos> In my brain.<eos> Well, you must have forgotten mine.<eos> Yeah, I don't think so.<eos> It's very distinctive looking.<eos> But maybe it was my mistake.<eos> Guess you're just a regular customer doing some regular pet food shopping.
Everybody's into Billy Joel.<eos> Was he a vegetarian or normal?<eos> The kind of guy you trust with a lot of money or...<eos> Enough, all right?<eos> I see what you're doing, and you're right.<eos> By the end, I didn't really know him anymore.<eos> May... maybe I never really knew him.<eos> The point is, I wasn't there for him when he needed me the most.<eos> Funny.<eos> You don't look Jewish.
You know they just sent the same guy they did last time, right?<eos> So what does this mean for us?<eos> Well, luckily, we still scored pretty well compared to Richmond Heights.<eos> Turns out they had a meth lab in their basement, which, turns out, was just a front for a dog fighting ring.<eos> This is my favorite part.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> I know a camera when I see a camera.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - You're crazy.
That's not yours!<eos> Hey!<eos> Get off that!<eos> That's our stuff!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What room's Erica Wexler in?<eos> Oh, you're not Mr. Jorgensen. I'm in the wrong room.<eos> - Mr. Gallagher?<eos> - Do I know you?<eos> Oh, you're the woman who hired my daughter. - That's right.
There are a lot of jobs a Northwestern grad could get that pay a heck of a lot more than this.<eos> You went to Northwestern?<eos> Go Wildcats.<eos> I tell you what. Let's use today as a trial run.<eos> No charge.<eos> To be totally honest, I'm happiest when I'm paid in smiles.<eos> What about your other patient?<eos> He's just a stage two.<eos> Time is a luxury he still has.<eos> You finish up what you're doing here, and I'll take you to my casket guy.
No, no, it was more than a visit, but she dumped me.<eos> I broke the cardinal rule-- never fall for the singer.<eos> And I cannot shut up because I am so stoned.<eos> You sure I can't interest you in a bathroom quickie?<eos> I'm not that stoned.<eos> Excuse me, I'm waiting for an appointment.<eos> No wait no more, baby.<eos> Dope pad.<eos> Shit, you guys got Jacuzzis up in here?<eos> You're Carl Gallagher?
Excuse me, I'm waiting for an appointment.<eos> No wait no more, baby.<eos> Dope pad.<eos> Shit, you guys got Jacuzzis up in here?<eos> You're Carl Gallagher?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Don't get too juiced up.<eos> I only go for sistas.<eos> You accept hundreds?<eos> You don't look like the trust fund kids I normally work with. Are you a rapper?
Why are you still here?<eos> You take on so much for your family, but who's looking out for you?<eos> My wife.<eos> Yeah, for now.<eos> I'm not just here for the kids, Mr. Wexler. I'm here for you too.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> She's dying!<eos> Just because you don't want to admit it doesn't mean it's not happening.<eos> Dierdre has night terrors, Betsy keeps wetting the bed, and George keeps getting into fistfights at school, but at least they're facing reality.<eos> You're too scared to even do that.
We have a room available.<eos> I overheard you, sorry.<eos> We have a room.<eos> Uh, my name is Nick, uh, Nicholas for long.<eos> Uh, my friend and I have a lovely room for rent in our loft downtown.<eos> You see, our old roommate is on jury duty.<eos> Her name is Jess, Jessica.<eos> We had a little "will they/won't they." Then we did, and then we fought a little bit too much.<eos> We still have a really nice thing. WINSTON: Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> I am truly sorry for my friend here, but I am sure it is not realistic that you would want to rent a place from total strangers.
They would not listen.<eos> We understand.<eos> Do you?<eos> Are you two mothers?<eos> Do you know how it feels to be alone in the world and wonder how you will feed your child?<eos> I don't.<eos> But I do want to find out who did this to your husband and bring them to justice.<eos> Yeah, I would like to believe you, but nobody cares for the poor in this country.<eos> We can help you.<eos> Did you or your husband know either of these men?
He had headaches, coughed a lot.<eos> How am I supposed to know?<eos> I'm not a doctor.<eos> What did he do for a living?<eos> There are few jobs in Cairo.<eos> Like most men, he went down to the barricades every morning.<eos> The barricades?<eos> It's a wall in Cairo where men go to find work, if you're picked.<eos> Mostly manual labor, but every little bit helps.<eos> The day of his death, where were you and your child?
From the look of this blood splatter, someone was struck here, then they fell to the ground.<eos> This was a blitz attack to incapacitate Hank.<eos> He's not our unsub.<eos> He's a victim.<eos> Mrs. Said, I am sorry for your loss and appreciate you coming in at this time.<eos> If it helps catch the monster who did this to my son, then so be it.<eos> Now, can you tell me what Malik was doing in Egypt?<eos> Malik had been visiting Cairo since he was young.<eos> He had a special connection to the land.<eos> - That you left.
I'm sorry. Of course.<eos> Mrs. Said, I can reach you wherever it is you're staying and give you updates as I receive them.<eos> I cannot go until my son's body returns home.<eos> Then I will take him and have him buried next to his father.<eos> Now, Mrs. Willis, if you'll come with me, I'll be able to fill you in on the details of your son's disappearance.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. Mrs. Willis, what aren't you telling me?<eos> I was just trying to protect her.<eos> Malik's mother doesn't know who her son really was.<eos> But you do?
Has your team identified the last person in the picture?<eos> No.<eos> But we aren't supposed to, are we?<eos> Let me be blunt.<eos> These are starting to feel like government-sanctioned hits.<eos> You think we're doing this?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I can assure you that we're not behind any of this.<eos> So it's just coincidence that Americans and subversives are dying on your watch.<eos> Maybe you and your team have overstayed your welcome, Agent Garrett.
You tell me.<eos> I can assure you that we're not behind any of this.<eos> So it's just coincidence that Americans and subversives are dying on your watch.<eos> Maybe you and your team have overstayed your welcome, Agent Garrett.<eos> Or maybe we're just getting closer to the truth.<eos> And which truth is that?<eos> The one where you withhold information from us about Malik and Hank's sexuality?<eos> I would have liked to have shared it, but I have concerns about your country's policies.<eos> Not the ones you march out to the world, but the ones behind closed doors.<eos> You can't possibly condone this kind of abnormal behavior.

It's our job to uphold it.<eos> Your government has records on everything that happened during the Arab Spring.<eos> I believe you know who this last person in the picture is.
You said it was important.<eos> It is, Mrs. Said. I need your help.<eos> My son is dead. What else do you want from me?<eos> To help save someone else's son.<eos> A son whose mother is a liar. Look, Hank is still out there.<eos> Now, if you'll just take a look at this...<eos> I won't!<eos> I won't look at anything else!<eos> You know, I spoke to Brenda earlier, who told me about how Hank and Malik came out to her farm last summer and what a lovely time they had.<eos> Now, you may not be able to accept Hank and Malik's relationship...
Do you understand?<eos> You have my word.<eos> And the position we discussed, in your new company?<eos> All in good time, Mr Lowten.<eos> Now back to your desk before you're seen here.<eos> So, I had to remind him whose damn pheasants they were!<eos> Nerve of the man!<eos> He won't make that mistake again!<eos> Well done, Sir Leicester!<eos> Well, you would have done no different yourself if you had been there, Barbary.
Here she is!<eos> Good evening, Sir Leicester.<eos> You look sparkling as ever.<eos> And tell me, Inspector, were we correct?<eos> Is the killer a simple man with a family pushed to breaking point.<eos> Suffice to say that discovering their identity has brought me no pleasure.<eos> None at all.<eos> - The killer pleads self-defence?<eos> - They do.<eos> You believe him?
By the way, have you seen the price?<eos> The, uh - - The owner wasn't the only thing that's been slashed.<eos> And the Dolphins win, 21-0.<eos> All right! Hey!<eos> That boy is like a professional.<eos> It's amazing how one kid can carry a whole team.<eos> I feel like you're doing this on purpose.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Pritchett.<eos> Leslie Kwan Collins, Daily Dolphin.<eos> For heroically taking in Dwight, you are this month's "Person with a Porpoise."
Leslie Kwan Collins, Daily Dolphin.<eos> For heroically taking in Dwight, you are this month's "Person with a Porpoise."<eos> Oh, I don't know about that. It's --<eos> Embrace it.<eos> Hey, come over here for just minute, buddy.<eos> Good game! Good game.<eos> - Thanks, Coach.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So, listen, I got something kind of rough I need to tell you.<eos> No, I know you and Mitchell aren't just roommates.
-Flimsy.<eos> -It's clad in iron.<eos> -It's flimsy.<eos> -Ironclad. Ironclad. Ironclad.<eos> I can do this all day.<eos> I have done this all day.<eos> Flimsy!<eos> -Home.<eos> -Home.<eos> Were you out looking, too?
I really don't wanna be alone right now.<eos> If you could just please stay.<eos> We can get a movie or we can get something to eat or...<eos> We can do whatever you want.<eos> Around here, if you wanna run for office, you have to talk to Burt.<eos> Burt's run campaigns for half the elected officials in Monroe County.<eos> Truth is, politics is pretty damn simple.<eos> All you have to do is choose the right candidate.<eos> Well, I appreciate that.<eos> I didn't say you were the right candidate, Detective.
- Your brother.<eos> In a race like this, his story will be a liability.<eos> We've already addressed that issue.<eos> To a small group of party faithful.<eos> As I understand it, he was accused of drug trafficking and possible homicide before he, uh...<eos> Anyway, make no mistake, this is gonna be your opponent's main line of attack.<eos> Sheriff Aguirre and I have had a conversation.<eos> We plan on keeping this a clean race.<eos> See, this is why you need me.<eos> Why do I get the feeling that you're interviewing my husband instead of the other way around?
Hi, how are you?<eos> Detective Diaz, Detective Rayburn.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> The guy that was bothering you, do you know him?<eos> Never seen him before.<eos> He came in, he was drunk, and started talking weird shit to me.<eos> - Talking about what?<eos> - All sorts of crazy shit.<eos> - Yeah, so, what'd you do?
Nice to meet you.<eos> The guy that was bothering you, do you know him?<eos> Never seen him before.<eos> He came in, he was drunk, and started talking weird shit to me.<eos> - Talking about what?<eos> - All sorts of crazy shit.<eos> - Yeah, so, what'd you do?<eos> - Told him to leave.<eos> So, he went ballistic, my manager got involved and then things got physical.<eos> You okay?
- All sorts of crazy shit.<eos> - Yeah, so, what'd you do?<eos> - Told him to leave.<eos> So, he went ballistic, my manager got involved and then things got physical.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> I don't need no police.<eos> - So why'd you call us?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> You didn't call us?
Ask him what he was doing with the waitress inside.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> He says that there's a young couple from his church and that this woman offered to help bring over their family, because she has access to boats and that she would be willing to do it for a price.<eos> Recruiting traffickers?<eos> He says that...<eos> That a boat's about to get here, and he thinks maybe these are the same men that killed his Ana.<eos> Tell him we'll take care of it.<eos> You gotta let...
Usually when you guys pop up this quick, the clients have a lot to say.<eos> - Are you charging her with something?<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> She's got pending charges and a bench warrant for missing her last court appearance.<eos> Well, then I'm here to bail her out.<eos> Why don't you take a seat, because she's gotta be processed and go in front of the judge.<eos> For your own sake, I'd encourage you to stop what you're doing and let her go.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Because Miss Cortez is prepared to provide information on another case.<eos> A case Wayne Lowry is certain that you don't want the district attorney reopening.
John?<eos> Miss Rayburn?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You stay right there.<eos> Why were you looking for me?<eos> I just wanted to talk to you.<eos> I know the truth about your case.<eos> I know what you and Danny did to that witness.<eos> I'm so sorry, Miss Rayburn.<eos> I mean, you trusted me and you helped me.
Is he OK?<eos> Is he here?<eos> I'll take over from here, Sergeant.<eos> Mrs Maxwell, I am Colonel Lee.<eos> I'm in command of this operation.<eos> This, uh, change in the status quo is difficult for you.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do understand, and if I was in your position, I would protect my family as well.<eos> However, choosing not to cooperate is not the wisest course of action.<eos> You have alternatives, for the moment.
Well... as you can see, not great.<eos> I find it helps to talk about the loss.<eos> Tell me about your husband.<eos> What was he like?<eos> He was funny.<eos> He was... caring.<eos> And smart.<eos> Loving.<eos> At least I thought he was all those things.<eos> Well, if you felt that way about him, it must have been true.
Yeah, I got to call you back. Something amazing is happening.<eos> All you fucking cared about was your stupid, bad selves.<eos> Your numbers... your numbers are garbage.<eos> Your speeches, garbage.<eos> And you're supposed to give her advice?<eos> Is that right? All I heard was dumb, stupid I don't know what the fuck it was.<eos> Garbage?<eos> - Gary...<eos> - Oh, shut up!<eos> You screwed her the worst.
Lex, I recognize that there's a lot going on here behind closed doors.<eos> If I can count on you, your access will grow in direct proportion to your level of cooperation.<eos> Oh, I got to be honest, Ms. Lommers. That sounds like a bribe.<eos> It's an incentive.<eos> I've been doing this job for 12 years.<eos> The reason people like me is because I'm fair, I'm honest, and I got a great jump shot.<eos> I don't need access.<eos> What I need is the truth, and I'm not convinced that's what I'm getting here.<eos> Major...<eos> I've been doing my job as long as you've been doing yours.
Copy that.<eos> The doctors told Lex it only seems to be spread through fluids... blood, sweat, semen, urine.<eos> There's 100% a joke there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, keep it to yourself.<eos> Put gloves on and lower your visor. Don't touch anything or anyone.<eos> - Officer Riley?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jim banks, EIS.<eos> You take the lead. Not sure who these people trust less, doctors or cops.

They'd have been heading for the research labs.<eos> Can we just take a quick look?<eos> I can't let you in there.<eos> Please, I just need to look.<eos> Hey, 4 to 6 feet.<eos> The officer and I were just in the same hallway as the infected man.<eos> Better not get too close. Hey, hey, you're... you're a cop, man.<eos> What do you want me to do, shoot her?<eos> Here. I ain't dying for this job.<eos> You're a piece of work.
I mean, it's the freaking zombie apocalypse up there in Isolation Ward.<eos> - I'm not getting out.<eos> - Jake...<eos> Screw you, Lex, all right?<eos> You're the one who sent me in here.<eos> Jake.<eos> Ja...<eos> I really appreciate all of you coming.<eos> Ms. Lommers, I asked you what your intentions are for our city.<eos> It's Dr. Lommers, actually, since you're insisting on remaining formal, and you don't fall within protocol.
Yes, Bert.<eos> My wife Micheline is home alone.<eos> Who decides when we get to leave?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> I will have to get back to you on that.<eos> Showing us that even as the city is torn apart by this volatile situation, there is always room for a hero.<eos> Nice piece.<eos> Just a hack blogger looking for an angle.<eos> Still, it is why I hand-picked you to be the representative for the Atlanta P.D.<eos> You're a good guy.
I appreciate the update.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Guys, seriously?<eos> I said walk.<eos> No worries, just some innocent kids running around a creepy hospital. I got this one.<eos> You seem super busy.<eos> Need some help?<eos> Too little, too late, Jake Riley.<eos> Officer.<eos> Your friend Major Carnahan said you might be of some assistance.
She's busy. We'll sneak out back.<eos> All our friends are there.<eos> In a month, you're gonna be a mom and your life will be over anyway.<eos> Live a little while you still can.<eos> I'll catch up with you.<eos> You're so boring!<eos> Hi, Grandpa.<eos> Let me know when you get something. Yeah.<eos> Bye.<eos> You're my new stalker, aren't you?
A lot of people in danger if she's sick outside the cordon.<eos> A lot of people in danger if she's sick, period.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I still have connections in a lot of places from the days when people actually liked me.<eos> You're welcome, by the way.<eos> For the piece.<eos> Oh, you think I'm looking for validation?<eos> I'm just doing my job.<eos> You know, I asked Public Health PR for a one-on-one with you and they said no.<eos> But I don't really care because you're clearly just part of their machine, aren't you?
You know, I asked Public Health PR for a one-on-one with you and they said no.<eos> But I don't really care because you're clearly just part of their machine, aren't you?<eos> You go wherever they want you to go.<eos> You say exactly what they want you to say.<eos> Maybe they respect your policing.<eos> Maybe what they really like is having a black man as their mouthpiece while they lay the blame at the feet of the Middle East.<eos> So, last night I'm a hero but today, I'm the enemy.<eos> No, last night I thought maybe you were one of the good guys.<eos> Good guys get a lot of clicks in these situations.<eos> Villains, too, but no, I've decided that you're not really good or bad.
- _ - So, what's going on? Possible flu outbreak.<eos> At 1627, Dr. Saunders succumbed.<eos> Her boyfriend died shortly after that, suggesting that the virus can replicate at an accelerated rate.<eos> Since the virus spread, it could be anywhere inside the quarters.<eos> You need to hunker down.<eos> Stay indoors.<eos> Ration your food.<eos> You're a good guy.
The PR task isn't for you.<eos> I can see that now.<eos> I never should've asked you to do something you weren't comfortable doing. I apologize for that.<eos> Apology accepted.<eos> Somehow I sense there's more.<eos> Told you he was intuitive.<eos> You want to help the people inside?<eos> That's all I've wanted to do.<eos> I've contacted FEMA, the Red Cross, and the Army. There are 50,000 meals on their way as we speak.<eos> I want you in charge of a food drop.
How can I help you understand it?<eos> For one, Dr. Sanders was M.I.A. in the morning when she was supposed to give my class a tour.<eos> She was already sick, wasn't she?<eos> I don't have Dr. Saunders' whereabouts committed to memory, unfortunately.<eos> Was she coming off a night shift?<eos> The nurses said that her boyfriend was always here on those mornings to see her.<eos> I saw two bodies... her and him, the bearded guy.<eos> They were both dead before Patient Zero... the Syrian guy.<eos> As I said before, people have different resistances.<eos> But Bert was here with the rats before the lockdown because you told him it was an emergency.
Then we'll all be sent home.<eos> I've come to take my son.<eos> But he's been exposed.<eos> You can't.<eos> I said I've come to take him home.<eos> I'm at your friends' house now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sam. Head of Building Ops and Maintenance.<eos> Well, he's not coming in when your 48-hour quarantine is over.<eos> I want you in charge of a food drop.
Buzz us out.<eos> Sooz...<eos> My boyfriend's a cop.<eos> You never leave a man behind.<eos> In turbulent times, when tensions with the Middle East are at a peak...<eos> What?<eos> Atlanta is making a case for baseball, and that...<eos> They're just about to discuss the baseball game for the 27th time this morning.<eos> Listen, you said that I should come to you when I was ready for the truth.<eos> So, I'm here and you're... hungover.
That would get me in with a legit reason. Then I could watch the footage that I wanted.<eos> But it's expired.<eos> You gotta forge it, man.<eos> You gotta change the date or the judge's signature, whatever.<eos> That would be a felony.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want to know how you would do it.<eos> - You upload security video...<eos> - I see.<eos> OK, so, you come to me so I can get my hands dirty but you, Major Carnahan, you want to stay clean.

When I'm standing up, if I turn my head just right, I can see right onto my terrace.<eos> They're gonna tear down this building, Hank.<eos> They won't do it with you in it, but they'll do it eventually.<eos> You'll get tired, and hungry, and someone will arrest you.<eos> And instead of being there for whoever's inside that apartment, you'll be in jail.<eos> It's not much of a terrace.<eos> It's really a... fire escape with some potted plants.<eos> City life, right? Right.<eos> On days like this, we'd sit out there with some iced tea... just me and my daughter.<eos> You got kids?
What?<eos> It'll be cold.<eos> That's all that matters. And sandwiches.<eos> God knows how long we've been up here.<eos> Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm starving, actually.<eos> OK, then.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> So, you came back.<eos> Yeah, I realized something.<eos> You're a cop.

I'm starving, actually.<eos> OK, then.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> So, you came back.<eos> Yeah, I realized something.<eos> You're a cop.<eos> And you're slower than I thought.<eos> No, you're a cop, which means you couldn't not come up here.<eos> And I'm a journalist, and you gave me a story. Now I can't shake it.
Wait here.<eos> Please.<eos> - Driving a reporter around.<eos> - It's not like that.<eos> And not just any reporter, either.<eos> The one who made it his mission to antagonize Lommers.<eos> I'm just doing my job.<eos> Protecting people inside the cordon.<eos> That's all I can do.<eos> Wherever you're going, I suggest you change direction before it's too late.
Jana!<eos> If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city.<eos> Go on.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Yeah. There you go.<eos> Take your stairs.<eos> Well, it seems like you got everything well in hand in here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> You're the guy that helped us at the grocery mart.
Now, you can discipline me later, but please... help me find out.<eos> Sorry, son, but you don't have access.<eos> - That's on you. - I heard Jana screaming.<eos> Being attacked, maybe even killed.<eos> I couldn't care less who I pissed off trying to get to her.<eos> Well, you should.<eos> Those are the people who could've helped you now.<eos> I don't trust any of those people!<eos> But you?<eos> I thought at least you would've had my back.
If you have faith, nothing is impossible.<eos> Let those without fear or doubt come forward and be healed.<eos> As you have believed, so it will be done.<eos> What happened?<eos> She's fine, I promise.<eos> What happened?<eos> BitScan got overrun by tweakers.<eos> Little hairy for a minute, but we... we pulled through all right.<eos> It actually was... it was her plan that saved all of us.<eos> You'd be proud.
Just be nice to not have any responsibilities for a while, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sounds nice.<eos> What is this, a bribe?<eos> It's an olive branch.<eos> I need you in uniform for this.<eos> There's a child under Cannerts' care who represents a chance for a cure.<eos> Hope.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I need you to help me sneak him out of the Cordon.
May need to dust off my B and E skills for it.<eos> I didn't hear that.<eos> Hey, now that you're back on the force, you think you can get those phone records?<eos> One thing at a time, Leo.<eos> Hey, look, I'm getting close to the Cordon, so I might lose recep...<eos> Hello.<eos> Come on! You got to be kidding!<eos> What the hell is this? !<eos> I said no armed guards on the wall!<eos> You're logistics.
The eyes of the world are on us.<eos> Once that virus is out, it is out.<eos> There's a child.<eos> I don't get sick.<eos> Thomas's cells contain the blueprint for a cure.<eos> LOMMERS: I need you to help me sneak him out of the Cordon.
How long does it take to hunt down a walkie?<eos> Maybe if you pace faster, it'll speed things up.<eos> What is your issue with me, Major?<eos> I have given you nothing but opportunities.<eos> To do what, exactly?<eos> Be your puppet?<eos> To smile and lie for you?<eos> Information needs to be managed in a crisis. I thought you understood that.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> But you're managing what you tell me just as much.

I thought you understood that.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> But you're managing what you tell me just as much.<eos> When have I ever been less than honest with you?<eos> You can start with the day you showed up here saying this would all be over before it began.<eos> - Truth is, you knew better from day one.
My men are going in.<eos> Captain, you will sentence your men to die in there.<eos> Do not do this.<eos> My men are not the APD, Major.<eos> They're trained for this.<eos> People need reassurance.<eos> They need to see boots on the ground.<eos> Trust me, this is what we do.<eos> Captain, this is a different situation.<eos> You are dealing with an active virus.
The virus dies with it.<eos> Doesn't serve the virus to kill its host so quickly.<eos> It's suicide.<eos> A smart virus keeps its host alive.<eos> Hepatitis, polio, HIV. Beautiful, evolved viruses.<eos> This virus? It isn't smart or elegant.<eos> It's just brutal and short-sighted,<eos> - and it doesn't deserve to win.<eos> - And it won't. Sending those men in may be a mistake, but that's not on you.<eos> Sabine, whatever happens, you will fix it.
I've never seen anything like this virus before.<eos> Thomas' cells contain the blueprint for a cure.<eos> I need you to help me sneak him out of the Cordon.
That's what she told you.<eos> What?<eos> The evidence in that apartment would not have damned the Syrians.<eos> It would've damned her.<eos> Sayid was not Patient Zero... he was just some kid.<eos> The real guy is someone Lommers knew.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Why would she do that? We don't know.<eos> But you can help us get closer.<eos> Chief, you can fix this.
Katie, I assure you there is nothing to figure out.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sure that's why you ripped up a hospital logbook.<eos> That's okay.<eos> We were still able to find out who Henry Burns was.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, I have, um... Like I said, there's work to be done.<eos> I should...<eos> Hey, Dr. Cannerts?<eos> You're a coward.
_<eos> You're late.<eos> We've got a meeting.<eos> This is the meeting.<eos> Do you want to explain yourself?<eos> I want you to resign.<eos> That's a pretty bold request, Major.<eos> Would you like to tell me why?<eos> Or should I just read quietly?<eos> Well, I see that you and your vlogger buddy have been rather busy.
Like my muscles are slowly turning to stone.<eos> I can give you some medication for the pain if you'd like.<eos> No, um...<eos> I worked too hard to get away from all that stuff.<eos> If there's a chance I can make it through this clean,<eos> I'd like to try.<eos> Narcotics Anonymous is a great program.<eos> I particularly liked step four.<eos> Make a fearless moral inventory of yourself.<eos> What do you suppose you'd find, Dr. Cannerts?
She told you to say he was Patient Zero.<eos> The true Patient Zero was Henry Burns, a researcher conducting illegal viral testing.<eos> There was an accident, he became infected, and passed it on to Dr. Sanders here at the hospital.<eos> If our contact tracing was correct, it would only have been 48 hours until the danger passed.<eos> No one else would've died.<eos> You need to confess this to someone who isn't on their deathbed.<eos> I know I need to be held accountable for what I've done.<eos> But I'm not telling you the truth because I think you're going to die, Katie.<eos> I'm telling you, because more than anything in the world...<eos> I hope you live.
Well, um, you might be waiting on the bus for a while.<eos> It's not too far.<eos> Just need to rest for a minute.<eos> Not much in the way of food or drink out here.<eos> Here.<eos> Keep it.<eos> I never put my mouth on it, so it's clean.<eos> Promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Two days out on these streets and... you're the first person to even look at me, let alone help out.
Two days out on these streets and... you're the first person to even look at me, let alone help out.<eos> Well, yeah, I...<eos> I don't think anyone in here is their best self.<eos> Including me.<eos> Here.<eos> There's some food for you and your wife.<eos> And you can use the cart as a walker, take some pressure off your foot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Truly.<eos> You're one of the good ones.
Thank you.<eos> I'm so sorry, Katie.<eos> No.<eos> You don't get to be sorry.<eos> You talk about courage and integrity.<eos> Well, I'll tell you the same thing I tell my 11-year-old son.<eos> Be brave and take responsibility for your mistakes.<eos> You don't need me to hold you accountable.<eos> Just fix this.<eos> You're the only hope people in here have.
Patient Zero wasn't Sayid Nassir or Henry Burns.<eos> Patient Zero was Noah Hobbs.<eos> 18 months ago, while conducting illegal gain-of-function studies,<eos> Henry Burns successfully mutated a virus so virulent that when Noah Hobbs was exposed to it,<eos> - _ - you and Henry Burns covered it up and closed the lab.<eos> Cannerts didn't create this thing.<eos> Henry Burns did.<eos> It's a miracle that Noah Hobbs didn't leave that building after he was infected.<eos> It was a miracle that he didn't start an outbreak a hundred times as deadly as this one.<eos> But after dodging that bullet, you set Henry Burns up with a new facility to recreate the virus.
If we can mutate this virus, so can our enemies.<eos> If we can mutate it and create a cure, then we can survive an attack.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> But with government funding cuts and pharmaceuticals focused on the next little blue pill, staying ahead of the game isn't easy.<eos> Who are you staying ahead of?<eos> Sayid Nassir?<eos> The innocent kid that you-you pinned this outbreak on?<eos> The Syrians who you falsely accused of attacking us?<eos> Leo Greene said that we were the loose ends that you needed to tie up.<eos> You're letting conspiracies go to your head. - I...
I said you were working on one.<eos> That's the only reason I'm protecting you.<eos> He's the reason I'm sick.<eos> Cinco, Cinco.<eos> Stay away from my brother!<eos> We should, uh, disinfect your cut again.<eos> - How's it looking?<eos> - Not so great, Bertie.<eos> Cannerts didn't create this thing.<eos> You set Henry Burns up with a new facility to recreate the virus.
Keep trying to get our baby out.<eos> All right, so we continue on.<eos> _<eos> Lex Carnahan,<eos> I never expected to see you under investigation.<eos> And yet you called me in.<eos> I don't remember getting your name.<eos> Blake.<eos> And, Lex, I'd like to look at this as a conversation between coworkers.<eos> We want the truth to emerge, and I would imagine you want that, too.
And, Lex, I'd like to look at this as a conversation between coworkers.<eos> We want the truth to emerge, and I would imagine you want that, too.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> And your cronies watching from that camera in the ceiling, they want the same thing, too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> And what we all want is to try to ascertain who facilitated the breach of one of the sealed manhole covers to allow the escape attempt two days ago.<eos> Coordination is taking place from someone on the Force.<eos> So you're accusing me.<eos> You did try to break in, didn't you?
Yes, they do.<eos> And what we all want is to try to ascertain who facilitated the breach of one of the sealed manhole covers to allow the escape attempt two days ago.<eos> Coordination is taking place from someone on the Force.<eos> So you're accusing me.<eos> You did try to break in, didn't you?<eos> Word is you tried to reach your... girlfriend inside.<eos> - Look, I'm not the criminal here.<eos> - From where I'm sitting, this looks bad.<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> No, you're trying to nail me with something I didn't do.
Lex.<eos> There are gonna be more people escaping.<eos> They're already down there.<eos> Any success in rounding up donors?<eos> The people are scared.<eos> Scared of the virus.<eos> Scared of each other.<eos> I'm not the right person for this.<eos> Any of this.<eos> You're a good police officer, Jake.

Take a look at this?<eos> - Whose is this?<eos> - That guy in the white.<eos> You!<eos> You there!<eos> Stop that man. - But don't touch him! - Hey!<eos> Hey, Father?<eos> Stop.<eos> Yes?<eos> Your blood... you have the antibody.
- Are you hungry?<eos> - No. Thank you.<eos> And your car.<eos> I hope you understand that's only a short loan.<eos> Feel free to take a shower once you've finished cleaning.<eos> - Can I ask a question?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> You're cleaning the Command Base, that's all.<eos> Take any items that you or your husband and son might need to make your lives more comfortable.
Door was open.<eos> Hey, Helene, listen, I am so fucking sorry, okay?<eos> I'm gonna fix this.<eos> Helene?<eos> Look, you have every right to be pissed, I just--<eos> Helene.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Doc.<eos> Where's our trooper?<eos> You the, ah, cancer concierge?
_<eos> _<eos> We need to do TB tests on the local POW camp in Beaumontville.<eos> Jerry officers.<eos> Certainly is a stroke of luck your CV came along when it did, - Cameron.<eos> - Yes, uh, I wish I could be overseas, but, uh, bum ticker.<eos> Your girl said the last man you had just - up and disappeared last week. - Mmhmm.<eos> One day, he's here; next day, pfff.<eos> People go off, do crazy things.<eos> You won't do anything crazy on me, will you, Cameron?
And to go from trucks to tanks has been a challenge, but by Wednesday my workers will be ready to do as many hours - as you require.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> - And how many guards do we have?<eos> - We have 15 fully armed guards from the local SS detachment.<eos> Ah, one thing... we are replacing the test gauges in the automobile crank shafts, but should we calibrate for the Panzer shafts or the Renault FT?<eos> They can discuss those details later.<eos> My superiors are very happy with your cooperation.<eos> France and Germany should be friends, always.<eos> Just one thing.<eos> You could not even answer a simple question about the crank shafts. You are no engineer.
France and Germany should be friends, always.<eos> Just one thing.<eos> You could not even answer a simple question about the crank shafts. You are no engineer.<eos> What are you? Resistance?<eos> Looking to make trouble for me?<eos> You don't think you're already in trouble?<eos> - A collaborator?<eos> - I'm a good ally and a businessman.<eos> I'm also the man with the gun.<eos> What do you have?
Have a seat and roll up your sleeve, please. Thank you.<eos> Good to meet you, Frommer.<eos> How have they been treating you here, everything all right?<eos> You can speak freely.<eos> - You getting enough food?<eos> - I have no complaints.<eos> Good, good.<eos> I hear you've been getting some RR at that training camp in Whitby.<eos> Well, you know how boys talk.<eos> It seems you have private meetings with Colonel Sinclair himself.
- What about Harry?<eos> - Still not confirmed.<eos> - We don't know what's going on. - Mayhew'll be here tomorrow.<eos> I need to know they're in place at Dieppe.<eos> - The minute I know.<eos> - To come this close... I know.<eos> I'll keep the line open, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You'll talk, make him feel comfortable, as you always do.<eos> At 1600 hours, I will cause a distraction, and you'll move to your target...
Of course, if you're successful, then this is goodbye.<eos> But this is also your chance to strike a blow for Germany.<eos> He saved me.<eos> He brought me here.<eos> And why do you think he did that?<eos> Why do you think he meets with you every week?<eos> For a friendly game of chess?<eos> He's using you, Frommer.<eos> He's doing his job.<eos> - Now you do yours.
He brought me here.<eos> And why do you think he did that?<eos> Why do you think he meets with you every week?<eos> For a friendly game of chess?<eos> He's using you, Frommer.<eos> He's doing his job.<eos> - Now you do yours.<eos> - It's not like that.<eos> If that's what you think, then he's doing his job well.<eos> And you are failing.
Yes.<eos> What is it that you're not saying, Michael?<eos> Well, there is still the other hurdle.<eos> The second part of the Royal Marriages Act.<eos> The fact that Her Royal Highness has turned 25 merely means that she has reached an age where she can give notice of her intention to marry.<eos> Not that she is free to marry.<eos> What?<eos> Well, if both Houses of Parliament approve, only then, after 12 months have expired, can the marriage take place and any marriage contracted in defiance of these rules would be void.<eos> Why did no one tell me this at the time?<eos> To which I hope you replied...
Now, I take no pleasure in his punishment.<eos> Whether they know or not, those parents aren't going to give you any information.<eos> He's not one of theirs.<eos> He's alone in there.<eos> It upsets you, but I have a mission to complete.<eos> One day we might all be at someone's mercy.<eos> I'd like to think there'd be someone in my corner.<eos> This war will end, and when it does you'll have to live with what you've done here.<eos> We all will.<eos> I don't believe you're a bad man.
Yeah, okay. I really need to tell you a secret, but you cannot say a word.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hi.<eos> - You're Barbara Rutledge, right?<eos> - Yes. - I'm Josslyn Carver. - Hold it.<eos> The one from the Calista Raines trial?<eos> Uh, yeah, but that's not what I... So, tell me, was that guy really wearing a kaftan and a wig?<eos> I guess so, but we... we can talk about that later.<eos> Right now, I really need you to read this book and come to a launch party tonight for the author, Karen Kim.<eos> Oh! I get it. You're mentally ill from the trail.
Come here, huh?<eos> What was that?<eos> Barbara Rutledge, Dr. Karen Kim.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I actually didn't know you were coming.<eos> Well, I wasn't planning on it.<eos> But your P.R. lady attacked me on the street and started reading your book out loud, and I was impressed.<eos> Not with you, with the book.<eos> I can't wait to hear more tonight.<eos> And I also can't wait for you to get me something alcoholic to drink.
No, we were doing some, um, laundry.<eos> Got it.<eos> Laundry.<eos> So, we ask our fellows to commit to a minimum of eight hours a day in the studio.<eos> If you're accepted, is this something you feel like you're willing to work toward?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> This is all I have ever wanted since I was 16 and illegally painting murals on the sides of freeways.<eos> Okay, well, then since you're serious, can I give you some advice?<eos> Your work should speak for itself.<eos> I'd like to see a new piece, something that shows us who you are.
- Okay.<eos> April, it's good.<eos> I am so happy you think so.<eos> - But it's not great.<eos> You know, one thing I've really learned since being on this board, it's always best to be honest, even brutally so.<eos> Brutally, huh?<eos> Your work just isn't at the level required to get into this program.<eos> Now, listen.<eos> Now, don't get me wrong.<eos> - April, you can paint. - But... You just don't seem to have "it."
You've been through a lot, Joss.
- That's none of your business.<eos> - And who was watching Vivian while you were having sex in the bedroom with the nanny?<eos> - Should I go?<eos> - Yes!<eos> No.<eos> You... get out.<eos> So, when can you start?<eos> And when he slammed her into that wall, I just... I snapped.<eos> Completely understandable.<eos> You've been thinking about Marisol, and you wanted to protect this girl from the same fate.
I actually think it's for the best.<eos> - Great. Two dictators.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Thanks for sticking to the script.<eos> - Are you sure you don't want to come?<eos> - Yeah. No, I'm...<eos> You have a nice time.<eos> You too.<eos> Are you Karen Kim?
And I don't care how many sluts you banged.<eos> Yeah, I'm talking to you, Sheila.<eos> How fun is she?<eos> Okay, Karen Kim, my first question is this.<eos> When you sat down to write this epic, was the intention to set back the women's movement 100 years, or was that just a happy coincidence?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - You must have realized that in success, you were basically creating a zombie tribe of whores who will spread their legs for any Tom, Dick, and hooker-loving Harry.<eos> Not that I don't appreciate you keeping the bar low.<eos> - I don't think...<eos> - But you're one of those edumacated lady folks with all kinds of fancy degrees, so I just assumed you wouldn't bother promoting that tired cliché that women can have it all.
You can blame it on me if you like.<eos> It's your call.<eos> There are lots of other agents out there, Dr. Kim.<eos> Not really.<eos> Not when your first book was only somewhat successful.<eos> I can't afford to take another year off to write something on spec, and I don't know how to get another deal without an agent.<eos> Maybe I should give up.<eos> Maybe I don't have another book in me.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> You have as many books in you as I have songs.

Yep. Here it comes again.<eos> Make it stop!<eos> It's a clean break.<eos> So I agree with your previous doctor's opinion. You won't need surgery.<eos> See?<eos> So, how long before she can use her arm again?<eos> Actually, there's something more pressing we need to discuss.<eos> Oh. Marjorie, have you been feeling weak lately?<eos> - Has anybody talked to you about your test results from the E.R.?<eos> It appears you have late-stage cirrhosis.
They're easier to talk to.<eos> I mean, I haven't had a date in... I can't even remember.<eos> - Come on. I don't believe that. - Yeah, it's been like... three years?<eos> Have you tried dating online?<eos> Maybe it's a good baby step.<eos> Um, once, but it was kind of a disaster. Oh.<eos> Disaster how?<eos> I didn't really know what to write in the profile, and I hate all the pictures of myself, so I just got a bunch of Nigerian princes asking for money.<eos> I don't think you should give up.<eos> You're so brave.

Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> So, I talked to the Food Network.<eos> There's definitely interest in another season.<eos> - Great.<eos> - But before you go any further, I think you should run it by Jonathan first.<eos> That's not happening.<eos> There's no firm offer yet, right?<eos> And he won't find anything out because you are very discreet.
Jonathan's not a man you want to piss off.<eos> Please, Jonathan's a big boy. He'll understand.<eos> And he would do exactly the same thing.<eos> There's an opportunity here, and I need to take it.<eos> I mean, that's what businessmen do, right?<eos> But what if nothing happens with the IRS, Harry?<eos> I have worked too hard to risk my career and hope this guy's never done anything illegal, so get me the offer, then I'll talk to Jonathan.<eos> I'd feel much more comfortable, Harry, if you slept on...<eos> Why do you keep questioning me, Eliot?<eos> This is what I want. You work for me.
I mean, it's not stupid.<eos> I just wish I didn't care.<eos> I have a beautiful daughter and an amazing life, really.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> Just in a nostalgic way.<eos> I guess I'm feeling a little lonely.<eos> This is why social media is evil.<eos> Well, any guy would be lucky to have you.<eos> That's sweet of you to say.<eos> If you can't land a good guy, there's no hope for the rest of us.
- I've always wanted to see New York.<eos> - You should go.<eos> It's the most alive you're ever gonna feel.<eos> Walking through the streets, it's like pure energy.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> 'Cause I'm a very energetic person.<eos> Kate.<eos> A word, please.<eos> Whoa, y-you're, um...<eos> - You're Harry Davis.
It's a pleasure.<eos> You know, I've been looking for a manager.<eos> Actually, I've got a pretty full plate with Peri at the moment.<eos> You hear that?<eos> He's all mine.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> It's the caterers.<eos> You're 30 minutes late!<eos> Do you have any idea how lucky you are to cater an A-list party like this?<eos> ! Mrs. Westmore, why don't you let me handle this so you can... get back to your party?
Because I'm whining again? No.<eos> Well, yes.<eos> But I can relate.<eos> I may have lost Zoila forever, too.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you two were close.<eos> But it's you and me now.<eos> And I know just the thing to make us feel better.<eos> Cleaning!<eos> I think that would only make you feel better.
I told you a hundred times. I don't know what time I got home.<eos> I don't remember anything.<eos> Yeah, but you said you got your memory back.<eos> I did.<eos> But then I started drinking and I blacked out.<eos> So you remember everything except last night?<eos> Awfully convenient.<eos> Spence!<eos> I came as soon as I heard.<eos> Who are you?
- I know, but you didn't.<eos> - I don't know!<eos> I remember being angry, but I don't know...<eos> Stop!<eos> You didn't kill anyone.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Because I know you.<eos> And you are the sweetest, most gentle man in the world.<eos> I know you're not a killer.<eos> Spence Westmore, you're under arrest for the murder of Peri Westmore.
Of course not!<eos> You all knew him.<eos> You worked for him.<eos> And when he got drunk, he was a totally different person.<eos> One time, I thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> I'm alive!<eos> Yay.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I understand you're handling the Peri Westmore case?
This man is only pretending to be a cripple!<eos> Perhaps you should stop saying "cripple."<eos> - Get out of that chair!<eos> Uh, Evelyn, have you lost your mind?<eos> You said if he did something horrible, I could divorce him!<eos> - Did he cheat on you?<eos> - Worse...<eos> He can walk! Please!<eos> Don't hurt me! Get your lousy ass out of this chair!<eos> You're a monster.
Previously on "Devious Maids"...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Spence Westmore, you're under arrest.
It's my plej. Ah. Look at your hair.<eos> Drop-dead gorge.<eos> It used to be drop-dead gorge, but I recently had a falling-out with my previous stylist.<eos> Whoever did this to you is a criminal.<eos> Seriously, they should be taken out and shot in the face.<eos> What a sweet thing to say.<eos> Anyway... I'm in the market for a new look.<eos> Makeovers always make me feel better.<eos> And truth be told, I've been a bit depressed lately.<eos> Unh-unh. You are way too fab to be down in the dumps.
- Bless her little soul.<eos> - Oh, she's not dead. She just doesn't want to be friends anymore.<eos> You were friends with your housekeeper?<eos> I know it sounds funny, but she's always been my closest confidante.<eos> I miss having someone in the house to talk to.<eos> Well, what about the new maid?<eos> Rosie? No, I'm afraid we don't have much in common.<eos> Well, I'm sure you didn't have a lot in common with the old maid when you first met her.<eos> That's true.<eos> So get to know this Rosie chick. I mean, you're so stylish, you live in this amazing mansh, and you're impossibly thin.
I miss having someone in the house to talk to.<eos> Well, what about the new maid?<eos> Rosie? No, I'm afraid we don't have much in common.<eos> Well, I'm sure you didn't have a lot in common with the old maid when you first met her.<eos> That's true.<eos> So get to know this Rosie chick. I mean, you're so stylish, you live in this amazing mansh, and you're impossibly thin.<eos> Who wouldn't want to be your friend?<eos> That's an excellent point.<eos> See?<eos> Things are looking up already. Now let's make this hair as ferocious as you are.
But I thought you wanted her back. I do.<eos> But first she needs to learn a little lesson.<eos> So this never happens again.<eos> Maybe instead of punishing her, you should be wondering why she left you in the first place.<eos> Give her a kiss for me.<eos> You're an ass.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Is anybody out there?<eos> Who the hell are you?
Do we, though?<eos> See, I'm supposed to be looking for a job, but I don't know the first thing about them.<eos> What does someone in your position make?<eos> A million a year?<eos> Less?<eos> Your total is $6,836.16.<eos> Ooh, something must've been on sale.<eos> Put it on this.<eos> Great.<eos> You're Marisol Suarez?
Previously on "Devious Maids"...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I've been keeping Tucker away from it all.<eos> Does he know what happened to his mommy?<eos> He knows, but I don't think he understands.<eos> Spence Westmore, you're under arrest for the murder of Peri Westmore.
Except the part where Genevieve fills my car with snakes.<eos> She won't.<eos> All we have to do is keep ignoring her.<eos> You've been doing that for years.<eos> Maybe it's time to fight fire with fire.<eos> Adrian shut down my credit cards and access to our bank account, which is outrageous because a lot of that money is mine, passed down through my family.<eos> Pardon me, but while I'm explaining my situation, could you please refrain from playing with your balls?<eos> - Sorry. - Thank you<eos> I'm here because my husband is being a real a-hole, pardon my French, and I need an even bigger a-hole to put him in his place.<eos> You seem to fit the bill.

Nope.<eos> I'm all yours.<eos> Ms. Shannon.<eos> Rosie.<eos> I didn't realize you were still here.<eos> I wanted to stay with Tucker until he fell asleep.<eos> Well, you didn't have to do that.<eos> Jesse went home an hour ago.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Actually, I could put Tucker to bed every night, if you'd like.
Open.<eos> Ah. Now take these out there.<eos> Come on.<eos> And the next thing I know, Zoila tells Mario Batali his meatballs are good but that hers are better.<eos> Well, they are.<eos> So I turn to Mario and I say...<eos> Oops.<eos> "Oops"?<eos> You just ruined my blouse.<eos> Well, you bumped into me.
Let me introduce you to the gang.<eos> Hugh Metzger, I'm obsessed with your films.<eos> The truth is I didn't want to get your hopes up.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About your movie - being back in production.<eos> - I thought it was dead.<eos> Now it's not.<eos> Hugh Metzger wants to direct.<eos> We want you to write it.<eos> Oh, you're the reverend?
I'm no saint.<eos> Reverend. Oh, hello, Laverne.<eos> I just wanted to thank you again for everything you did for my family.<eos> The money you raised for Timmy's surgery was a Godsend.<eos> You should really thank Dr. Levin.<eos> I'm so glad he and I stayed in touch after we volunteered in Africa.<eos> Hey, Timmy.<eos> How you doing, buddy?<eos> My doctor says soon I'll be running and playing just like the other boys.<eos> You must be a very special woman to be with the reverend.
My hair looks perfect.<eos> I just think Fabian made it look extra special.<eos> He did give an amazing blowout.<eos> But he insulted me.<eos> Besides, he's involved with that awful cult.<eos> It doesn't seem that bad.<eos> And cults are a great place to meet new people, maybe a new man, huh?<eos> Rosie, what's going on?<eos> Is this about Peri's murder again?<eos> I think the cult had something to do with it, but The Circle doesn't want me, because I'm not rich... like you are.
Here I was thinking I was too good for him.<eos> It turns out it's just the opposite.<eos> What happened?<eos> He's just... kind.<eos> He wants to make the world better.<eos> Sounds like a breath of fresh air after Adrian.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to revamp my entire personality.<eos> All right, take this to the truck and ask Rafael to help with the rest.<eos> Are you James Hamilton?
Adrian Powell, have you ever met my dear friend, Zoila? No.<eos> No?<eos> I think you and he would be an excellent match.<eos> I knew those two would hit it off.<eos> Fabian, my hair dresser.<eos> He's fabulous, funny, fierce, ferocious, and officially my new best friend.<eos> You should read this.<eos> It's going to change your life.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Spence Westmore, you're under arrest.
It's, um... about Spence.<eos> I don't know if you've heard, but he's at Doheny Medical.<eos> Spence is out of prison?<eos> I thought you might like to visit him... since you're friends.<eos> That was before he murdered Peri.<eos> But he's going through withdrawal from drugs.<eos> Isn't that strange?<eos> Well, he's an addict.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> You were his sponsor.
She was saying that we're all vapid and wasting our lives.<eos> Marisol, this is Candace Sosler, chairperson of the studio.<eos> - What?<eos> - My boss.<eos> Oh, you poor thing. You must be exhausted.<eos> - Let me help you.<eos> - Why are you being so nice? My husband is a moron.<eos> Isn't it wonderful?<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, you're the reverend, aren't you? Hello.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.<eos> - I can't believe that just happened.<eos> - Me, neither.<eos> You had to make a choice between the life of a baby and my life, and you made the wrong one.<eos> If you can't stand up to your mother, then this is over.<eos> Go to hell, Mother.<eos> I broke up with my mother, so can I stay here?<eos> With me?<eos> I don't have anywhere else to go.<eos> Oh, you're the reverend? Hello.
You keep saying "the Valley" as though it's a third-world country.<eos> This is Encino.<eos> It's upscale.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Anyway, I would like to move this divorce along so I can adjust my current living arrangements.<eos> And what are they?<eos> I'm staying with my friend Marisol, and it is not the picture of luxury.<eos> You moved out of your mansion.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> If it appears to the court like you're the one who abandoned your home and your marriage, it may negatively impact your settlement.
You have to accept that.<eos> You were right.<eos> Marisol's seeing her ex again.<eos> I know you're my mother now.<eos> I'm not your mother, Danni.<eos> I gave you up for a reason.<eos> From now on, you're nothing to me.<eos> I'm leaving you.<eos> Evelyn, we were meant to be together.<eos> Oh, you're the reverend.
Why would you want to be with a guy like me?<eos> Fashion exec just bought this place. She's gonna be gone for six months.<eos> This really cute guy came over and assumed I owned the house.<eos> I broke up with my mother, so can I stay here?<eos> - With me?<eos> - I don't have anywhere else to go.<eos> I'm barely used to hanging out with you. Can we agree to never talk about sex?<eos> That feels nice!<eos> I'm so glad you like it.<eos> Spence Westmore, you're under arrest for the murder of Peri Westmore.
She doesn't have a clue.<eos> There's this bad man named Ben. Maybe he's got someone spying on me.<eos> I was thinking, if I follow Miss Shannon, I can find out where The Circle meets.<eos> Someone's going around asking about Peri's murder.<eos> What's in this?<eos> Tucker Westmore is the key to everything.<eos> That Spence isn't Tucker's father?<eos> You didn't hear that from me.<eos> I'm leaving you.<eos> If it appears to the court like you're the one who abandoned your home, it may negatively impact your settlement.
We'll be fine.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I'll check the attic out myself.<eos> Thanks for being so thorough.<eos> Ms. Shannon?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Why are you burning this book?<eos> 'Cause I don't need it anymore.<eos> You knew.
Previously on "Devious Maids"...<eos> Spence Westmore, you're under arrest - for the murder of Peri Westmore.
Uh, yeah.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, killing Peri was a public service.<eos> They should pin a medal on me, really.<eos> I'm just surprised.<eos> I figured you wouldn't want to tell me the truth. Come on.<eos> I mean, who's gonna believe you?<eos> You're nothing but a dumb maid.<eos> - I believe her.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> Gail Metzger Fleming, you are under arrest for the murder of Peri Westmore.
Russell and I have known each other since we were kids. We played peewee football together.<eos> He went pro. I didn't.<eos> - So you guys are tight.<eos> - Well, yeah, he's my boy.<eos> How were things between Russell and Avery?<eos> I've seen a lot of girlfriends come and go, but when Russell met Avery, it was game over.<eos> Did Avery feel the same way about Russell?<eos> Yeah, I think so, but at the end of the day, who knows what women think.<eos> I mean, you must have some idea, though, right?<eos> You live here.
Input?<eos> I mean, she was basically Russell's business manager.<eos> - In a good way.<eos> - Was that a problem for you?<eos> Me? Hell, no.<eos> You know what they say... You get a girlfriend, you gotta drop two friends.<eos> You know it.<eos> Sounds like things got pretty dull around here, huh?<eos> Well, we all got to grow up sometime.<eos> - So how did you make the cut?
Blackmailed?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Nobody else knew.<eos> Well, there's 20,000 missing from the charity, another 20 from a credit card.<eos> - What is she doing with 40 grand cash?<eos> - Maybe she lent the money to someone.<eos> Someone she met at the Crestwood Hotel?<eos> - She would never be unfaithful.<eos> - You know what I think?<eos> I think that you know who did it, and I think that you're protecting them.
When you said the name "Theodore" and "Stark..."<eos> there were two kids on our peewee team Gary hated because they always got more game time.<eos> Theodore and Stark. Okay.<eos> What did you do when you left here?<eos> I went for a drive.<eos> I needed to cool down.<eos> I knew if I went home, I'd hurt him.<eos> Damn it, Russell, would you stop talking?<eos> - Did he kill Avery?<eos> - Well, you're his alibi.
Um, something caused her blood sugar levels to crash, and she went into a diabetic coma.<eos> We now have her on a dextrose I.V. trying to get her blood sugar back up.<eos> Usually, comas like this just last a few days until things normalize, but, uh, you just never know.<eos> I'm so sorry, I wasn't paying attention.<eos> Can you repeat that?<eos> Sure.<eos> Um, your mother was living as an undiagnosed diabetic,<eos> - and she was maintaining...<eos> - So it's basically bad news?<eos> Well, the good news is that you called 911.
Sorry.<eos> Um, anyway...<eos> Um, yeah, okay, but I have to let you know I cannot chip in any money for gas.<eos> - That's totally okay.<eos> - Awesome.<eos> - So, you ready?<eos> - Okay, wait.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> Who are you?
Bournemouth 2353.<eos> Yes, Gerald Durrell is my son.<eos> Gerry?<eos> Mrs Durrell...<eos> You have just caned my son!
We are not going anywhere.<eos> We can't just run away from our problems.<eos> Good afternoon, Mrs Durrell. Oh!<eos> Louisa, please.<eos> Indeed.<eos> We widowed folk must stick together.<eos> You should come and have that sherry.<eos> Yes, I should.<eos> Since I've retired, I've played a lot of bowls.<eos> Do you play?
Louisa, please.<eos> Indeed.<eos> We widowed folk must stick together.<eos> You should come and have that sherry.<eos> Yes, I should.<eos> Since I've retired, I've played a lot of bowls.<eos> Do you play?<eos> If only I had the time... and the bowls.<eos> Let me speak plainly?<eos> You are an attractive lady and I am an attractive man.
There's so much to see.<eos> Eat, then leave.<eos> I'm sorry if I've disappointed you.<eos> I've spent too much time in the company of uncouth men.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well... thank you. I'm sorry, I...<eos> Get out!<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll just finish my lunch.<eos> Now, you leave... or I'll shoot you.
- Can I have one? - Yes, soon.<eos> Need Mummy now.<eos> I love him.<eos> Him?<eos> Hello, I'm Louisa Durrell.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> I'm afraid my husband is out on a call.<eos> - No, I don't need a doctor.<eos> - Oh, right. What do you need?<eos> I was told you're English.
I'm afraid my husband is out on a call.<eos> - No, I don't need a doctor.<eos> - Oh, right. What do you need?<eos> I was told you're English.<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - So am I!<eos> Lucky us!<eos> I mean, not lucky, lucky us. I mean...<eos> Well...<eos> Er... I was hoping you might have some advice on how to survive here.
- I gave her my advice.<eos> She didn't like it.<eos> You know my advice?<eos> Get fatter.<eos> Men don't like skinny girls.<eos> I don't know why I'm getting upset.<eos> He's really annoying.<eos> It's every parent's biggest fear.<eos> Your child being in pain.<eos> You don't have children?
- Spiros is having one.<eos> - No. I'm in charge of my house.<eos> Animals are for the farm only.<eos> And the dinner table.<eos> Not dogs. We don't eat dogs.<eos> Except hot-dogs!<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> I sent Larry off with a gun and a hangover.<eos> When will I learn just to enjoy their company?<eos> Mrs Durrells, you are the perfect mother.
Gerry!<eos> - And are you local?<eos> Where did you get that nose?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> My parents?<eos> You are... a bad boy.<eos> - That sounds suspiciously like...<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hello. Leslie Durrell.<eos> I don't care, but who are you?
Well, I'm drinking to forget.<eos> - And eating to forget.<eos> - Right.<eos> Go, go!<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> (Gerry.)<eos> To the police station.<eos> There's been a misunderstanding here.<eos> He was stealing from the Countess Mavrodaki.<eos> You ... leave.
Is it a pack of lies?<eos> Of course it is.<eos> But he has to appear in court next week.<eos> I need you two to be our lawyers.<eos> Is that wise?<eos> We are respectively a biologist and a taxi-driver.<eos> Yes, but between you, you know everything and everyone.<eos> I couldn't find or afford anybody else.<eos> I'm disappointed with you, Margo.<eos> But you seemed so easy-going.
Well, it's good you don't want to talk about him.<eos> In fact, if you could get Sven to come to the harbour when I'm leaving, I'll get hold of a stunning dress for the occasion.<eos> And I can watch his face as I step off that yacht.<eos> Was that the flicker of interest from him?<eos> Or were they really totally severely in love?<eos> Mrs Durrell to see you, madam.<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> Margo left home with a sniffle and I wanted to check she's well.<eos> Oh, by the way, I loved the dress you gave Margo.<eos> You have exquisite taste.
Since I retired... it... it haunts me.<eos> Take me back to shore.<eos> - Right now!<eos> I know some sea shanties ...<eos> You... give me that.<eos> Give me that tiller right now!<eos> Oh, do you know how to sail?<eos> No.<eos> No, I can't sail!<eos> But I'm a helluva lot more competent than you are at this moment!
Not so innocent.<eos> Before, he was in my police cell after a drunken brawl!<eos> - Well, who among us has not been arrested for drunken brawling?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> He always carries a gun with him!<eos> Mr Durrell, is it true you carry guns?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the world is a dangerous place, Judge.<eos> Do you not make it more dangerous?
Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the world is a dangerous place, Judge.<eos> Do you not make it more dangerous?<eos> In English, please.<eos> The defendant ...<eos> Leslie is far more likely to shoot the turkeys on his own.<eos> Paradoxically, he loathes dogs.<eos> So he wouldn't go killing turkeys with Gerry's dog. No.<eos> If my client killed your turkeys, as you say, where are the carcasses?
I have no doubt you'd prefer the company of a friend, but I wish to see everyone gathered here this evening.<eos> Mother?<eos> This is Mrs Vadrukakis.<eos> Oh, hello!<eos> Hello.<eos> Erm, I'm keen to start a version of the RSPCA.<eos> Animals are often treated so badly here.<eos> - Gerry, would you help?<eos> - I'd love to.<eos> And perhaps you and your family would help as well?
- Nice cup of Rosie.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So, er...<eos> I hear you and Larry are thinking about - finding a place of your own?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Now, it's not because ...<eos> - Look, I completely understand.<eos> My concerns are broader.<eos> I suppose I'm thinking, does Nancy, a bright young thing, really want to bury herself away on a ...<eos> Well, you have.
You can call me Sidney.<eos> These things, all these possessions, they yours?<eos> Some of 'em from before I arrived.<eos> Most of 'em since.<eos> You find your passions here.<eos> You, uh... Have you found things to engage you?<eos> I have a job.<eos> Oh.<eos> Of course.<eos> I suppose you're here about the Barnes boy.
Let's have everything: black pudding, both sweet and sour, chorizo, barbecue sausages.<eos> There's the provolone cheeses as well.<eos> You can have it sliced, diced, with oregano, as you wish.<eos> Let's see.<eos> If you are having a barbecue and want it to be excellent, what do you include?<eos> Personally, I prefer less variety.<eos> Otherwise people overeat the appetizers, and then don't have the meat.<eos> And also, offal is not cheap.<eos> You needn't worry about that.<eos> Let's do what you say, and add the best cuts to it.
Otherwise people overeat the appetizers, and then don't have the meat.<eos> And also, offal is not cheap.<eos> You needn't worry about that.<eos> Let's do what you say, and add the best cuts to it.<eos> I think the best is a good rump steak, some pork flank steak, that's the best choice.<eos> Not expensive.<eos> And there's less offal, so anxious people...<eos> Fine, but add the tender cuts.<eos> Georgie, listen:<eos> You do it as you wish, but not worrying about prices being high.
Can I come in?<eos> I wanted to ask you about the Power of Attorney.<eos> You're all in there, right?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> I'm not sure...<eos> Come in, Seba!<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> And you are...?
Fine...<eos> You took the password and changed it.<eos> Ask them.<eos> Precisely.<eos> The first thing we want... is the new password.<eos> I have nothing to do with it.<eos> She has nothing to do with it.<eos> We didn't do anything illegal, right?<eos> Martín.<eos> You're a lawyer.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I know it's late.<eos> I need to go in and see AC-12 and I'm going to need your solicitor.<eos> Stand away from the door.<eos> Ms Denton, you remain under oath.<eos> Thank you, milady.<eos> Ms Denton... In your examination-in-chief, by your own counsel, you made a number of references to an undercover operation conducted by a Detective Sergeant Arnott of Anti-Corruption Unit 12.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Did any of these operations involve Detective Sergeant Arnott being present at your home?<eos> Some did.<eos> You were alone with Detective Sergeant Arnott?
In the bedroom.<eos> And how was the bedroom accessed?<eos> Via the stairs.<eos> And how far do the stairs lie from the front door?<eos> I don't know, three or four metres from the front door.<eos> From the plans of your home obtained by the prosecution, the distance is... 2.7 metres.<eos> If you say so.<eos> I don't "say so", it's a fact.<eos> And if I'm inaccurate, I'll be corrected.<eos> There are written statements by all the officers stationed outside the door in early October, and not one recalls hearing you and Detective Sergeant Arnott go upstairs together.

Hmm.<eos> You've told the jury that this intimacy with Detective Sergeant Arnott won your trust and, therefore, you permitted him unsupervised access to your home.

Did you lie about having prior knowledge of Hunter? No.<eos> You lied about having prior knowledge of Hunter, didn't you?<eos> No. You told the investigators lie after lie to confound them, and to pervert the course of justice, didn't you?<eos> It wasn't like that.<eos> It was like that.<eos> You wove a web of deceit to confound the investigators and to protect yourself, and you have the effrontery to attempt to deceive this jury. No!<eos> Did you fabricate the improper relations between you and Detective Sergeant Arnott?<eos> No.<eos> Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you?<eos> No. Lindsay Denton, aren't you an artful, devious person, who has betrayed the trust placed in her as a police officer...
So, you're saying Danny tried to kill 54?<eos> I'm saying that's only what 54 told us.<eos> He said that Danny turned the gun on him.<eos> 54 made a grab for the firearm to stop Danny from shooting him.<eos> There was a struggle for the gun, Rod and I joined in that struggle.<eos> The gun went off and killed Danny.<eos> Hold on a second, Constable, this is going way beyond clarifying a statement.<eos> I mean, you are changing your story all over again, here.<eos> This is the truth, sir.<eos> Well, you need to take a deep breath and we need to caution you.
Yes, sir.<eos> We were all really scared of Danny.<eos> There was a part of him that was capable of doing anything.<eos> So, you killed him?<eos> No!<eos> It seemed like an accident.<eos> 54 convinced me and Rod that if we said that we'd killed Danny in self-defence, that the least we'd be looking at would be manslaughter.<eos> He told us to claim that we were trying to save Danny and that way, nobody could blame us for his death.<eos> Yes, but instead of telling the truth, the three of you went off and concocted a whole new version of events.<eos> And then, you decided to blame Rod Kennedy for Danny's death.
Sorry?<eos> 'Cause the farmers around this area don't like no English.<eos> Most of them turn into Cong at night.<eos> - Sir, he seems to think...<eos> - I know what he thinks. Is there an older gentleman here?<eos> A security guard?<eos> You got a stink about you.<eos> What kind of stink?<eos> Booze and broads at the Continental Bar in Saigon while we catch shit in country.<eos> What are you?
What if they don't?<eos> Just go and tell sarah.<eos> Go.<eos> Now.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> So here's your tactical report.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Get down!<eos> Aah! You got our drugs, but we got your toughie little blonde.<eos> Now, we want the drugs, But you love the little blonde.
Swallow it, baby.<eos> If he could just focus.<eos> Swallow it, honey.<eos> He knows things.<eos> Swallow that.<eos> And I know things,<eos> And maybe we could figure this out.<eos> You hear that, honey?<eos> You're gonna figure it out.<eos> You know things.
Fine!<eos> Actually, one more thing. When you get down there, can you...<eos> Bree?<eos> Bree, are you okay?<eos> What the fu...<eos> You got blood in your mouth.<eos> Never you mind.<eos> Just let my daughters go. I don't care what you do to me.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> What are you gonna do to me?
Absolutely, we'll take care of him. Don't you worry.<eos> That's my sister.<eos> I will kill this man right now. You know that.<eos> She gave that life for us. Let's not forget it.<eos> - Where's my daughter?<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - The bodies on the ground?<eos> - They got what they needed.<eos> Brianna!<eos> So Harry owns this bar and makes ethanol, which you buy with gold bars and use to make tetra?
- Of course.<eos> So you could stop the volcano?<eos> Presumably.<eos> Right.<eos> So you just want us to walk up an erupting volcano.<eos> - Do you really believe this?<eos> - I'm in the business of belief.<eos> So, if you could, say, do that, why don't you just do it yourself?<eos> Because I'm not the one who needs to be saved.<eos> I can surf the wave, vessel to vessel, but... you can't.
Shut up about that!<eos> You can join us or not.<eos> The shelter is a mistake.<eos> - Let's go. Come on, that's it.<eos> - You got to keep driving.<eos> Start walking, pal.<eos> Okay, okay, yes, we'll take the ride, right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> So you met a monk, and he said there was a way to stop Rainier from erupting? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - And you believe him?
- Oh, you got that backwards.<eos> We're here with soldiers.<eos> Better trained than you.<eos> We don't meet them in 15 minutes, they're gonna blow your heads off.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> They're Army Rangers. They're trained to track.<eos> You're wearing their favorite color.<eos> I'm your only way out.<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> You take us to the truck.
No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, well, we'll manage, we'll manage.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's fine.<eos> If you excuse me, I have to leave now.<eos> - I'm gonna watch a show. - Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna see a show.<eos> A bubble show.<eos> You can't leave us here.<eos> You have your mission, I have mine.
Like this?<eos> Melody.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Melody, that--<eos> That's impressive, yes, exactly.<eos> That's even beyond what I imagined.<eos> Which one is the music?<eos> Okay.<eos> Melody, the bubble can hold us both.<eos> Maybe you can rehearse during the day.
- No, he doesn't play anything.<eos> Hello!<eos> Who wants to play a game?<eos> Me!<eos> Come gather round in a circle, come on.<eos> Good, great.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Okay. Who's got a heart?<eos> Everybody?<eos> You also have a heart?
I'll just order her to.<eos> I mean, my future improvement is a kind of personal protection.<eos> It's not hard to forget he's an alien, is it?<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> Is he... all human?<eos> You know, like... down there?<eos> ok, well, I'll see you later.<eos> So, I just know that you'll all have done your reading.<eos> Context for discussion of today's topic is the mindset of a soldier.<eos> 338,000 men evacuated, 100,000 of them straight from the beach, and you are one of them.
He didn't kill me because there's a little bit of their soul inside my legs, isn't there?<eos> And there's more than a bit of them inside of you.<eos> Why would you think that I would know the answer to these questions?<eos> You know a lot of things you shouldn't.<eos> Let's be very clear, Charlie. I do not take orders from...<eos> People are dead.<eos> More will die. Here's your chance not to be one of them.<eos> What happened to our pacifist Pole who didn't like guns?<eos> We will speak of this after, but that is OUR business.<eos> You're not coming in here.
Every day, every day I think of you.<eos> I think, "Please don't go where I can't follow."<eos> We have a problem.<eos> This is the traditional end to a Quill life. Did you know that?<eos> Here we die, and our offspring consume us.<eos> They take our strength as their first gift and our last legacy.<eos> But that's not what you humans do, is it?<eos> You give your strength every day.<eos> You give your legacy as you live.<eos> And that's because you can shape it, rather than it shaping you.
So take what you've been given, take it, and give it back to those who hurt you.<eos> 'Cause that's what I'm gonna do.<eos> Wait!<eos> Show me how to fight.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> The library. We've learned the Shadow Kin were just there.<eos> Did you find out how they're coming back?<eos> They found infinitesimal tears in space/time, too small for anything but a shadow to pass through.<eos> Were those here before?<eos> It's something you did, isn't it?
Excuse me, Meredith, but aren't you forgetting something?<eos> Martha's on camera interview.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - My goodness, I had completely forgotten all about it!<eos> Make sure my chyron reads "Mayor Martha Tinsdale."<eos> Bottom third of the screen; no scrolling.<eos> Now, why don't I just hold on to that, shall I?<eos> After all, I will be doing most of the talking.<eos> What a night!<eos> I thought you two were never going to come home.
I hope you like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, 'cause this van's about to swing.<eos> Uh... I'm pretty sure a mixtape isn't just the same song over and over again.<eos> No, no, dude, they're different live versions.<eos> You can tell because some are longer.<eos> Hey, you want a hit off my vape pen?<eos> It tastes like passionfruit and people think you're a smoker.<eos> Why would I want that?<eos> Don't worry,<eos> Marge isn't here.<eos> Oh, speaking of which, where is the craziest place you two have ever done it?
I rather wish you'd-a hadn't-a done that.<eos> You idiot, now you're trapped here with us.<eos> Idiot.<eos> Ow! Sorry.<eos> I should have used a coaster.<eos> You know we're only 13, right?<eos> Come with me.<eos> I didn't know the pool table could do that.<eos> Halloween show money.<eos> Yeah, you see, kid, it turns out the guys you thought were wasting' time in this bar were actually covert agents helpin' to save the world.
To be honest, it's not what I would have chosen for tonight.<eos> It's not really representative of my recent work.<eos> Hey, does anyone feel like joining me for a little...<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I just took a cat valium.<eos> Kids?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> I will.<eos> Excuse us gals while we go powder our noses.<eos> I just think you two would really hit it off if you had a chance to get to know each other.
- For the "Feast" preview?<eos> No way, they're definitely gonna be there.<eos> Forget it. GIGI: You're not going because of them?<eos> You have to go.<eos> Noah said he's too nervous to go.<eos> I promised Bam and Re the three of us would go and give notes.<eos> Honey, no, I don't want to lose my cool.<eos> Right now, I'm your cool, rockin' daddy, remember?<eos> We're going, with or without you.<eos> What are you... What are you guys up to now?
Oh, that's because I shave.<eos> Glasses?<eos> The servants haven't arrived yet with our tea.<eos> Can you fetch us some?<eos> Tea, Glasses.<eos> And give us an hour or so.<eos> This here is the jasmine garden.<eos> Daddy had it planted the day I was born.<eos> It's been blooming ever since.<eos> You must be Franklin.
You, Burgess?<eos> I'm focusing on myself right now, so...<eos> Because, come here...<eos> Come here.<eos> I can name at least two detectives, both married, and a stable's worth of patrolmen who have confided in me their desire to take you to the futon, hard.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have a good night, Sergeant.<eos> Oh, oh, you're not going anywhere.<eos> You two are officially in overtime.
Contagious!<eos> Contagious!<eos> Everyone, hold your breath!<eos> - Infected patient...<eos> - No! Please step behind the partition.<eos> No, no, if I'm going to be infected, it would be from a rich person's disease.<eos> Like gold poisoning or a governor's rash, not... not typhoid.<eos> Contagious.<eos> Contagious.<eos> So, what I'm dying to know is how did you two meet?
It's like cigarette milk!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Good morrow servants and servant ladies, we are the Gentlemen Callers and we are here to entertain and delight you as you push off across the River Styx.<eos> Oh, Lillian.<eos> - You're here?<eos> - Hard cheese indeed.<eos> Awkward. Awkward moments.<eos> Well, so, the short version, every barber shop organization has a front man. And despite the harmony in our voices, there's actually discord as to who among us should be that front man.<eos> So we shall audition for you and you shall cast your vote.<eos> You the work-a-day, lack-witted, unwashed and currently dying.
- No, no, no.<eos> I feel like it's only fair that the baritone go first. - Excuse me?<eos> - What is it, child?<eos> Maybe I could sing, sirs?<eos> Oh, sorry, I know you're all having a moment.<eos> Here's my thing.<eos> For me, I wanted to hear the music, but all I heard was you trying so hard.<eos> - These are actually... I ha... I actually have tears of hatred.<eos> Bad. Bad news all around.<eos> With all due respect, I think that's perhaps why we are talented musicians and you are dying of typhoid.
Why don't you ask the other gals on the corner of Unwed Road and Whore Boulevard?<eos> I'm a whore because I want to have sex?<eos> Don't you want to have sex?<eos> Of course I want to have sex. I love sex.<eos> It feels so good on my penis.<eos> So unless you'd like to go around back and get bent over a pallet of Gold Medal flour or get arrested, I suggest you leave.<eos> Bent over?<eos> I don't even like that position.<eos> I'm more of a "lay there and take it" kind of gal. Oh.<eos> Now, I know how I came to this theory, but how did you think of it?
We're going another way.<eos> If you want to say she's only getting her shot because she's a woman, go ahead, but let's be real.<eos> If you're saying that, you're a man.<eos> You're a backwards-thinking, backwards-cap-wearing, male-pattern-baldness-hiding man.<eos> So, bitch and moan all you want, gentlemen, but tonight, a girl's gonna be the lead sports story in the world.<eos> And if that upsets you, well, maybe you're just getting your period.<eos> Go get 'em, Ginny!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Go, girl!<eos> Well, unless you've been under a rock for the past 48 hours, you know that the San Diego Padres have called up Ginny Baker to start today against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Pi Young Gook.<eos> I know what the problem was, but I can't answer.<eos> Seriously, you people.<eos> Now, you're going to create a culture of protecting one another like this?<eos> How many times did I tell you not to use medical terms when talking to patients?<eos> That is the policy while I am Section Chief of the Neurosurgery department at Gookil. That's what I taught all of you.<eos> But you openly defy me?<eos> Don't use terms only you understand and think you're more special than the patient.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You are all specialty doctors.
What proof do you have that I wasn't the victim back then?<eos> Let's talk somewhere else. Talk here.<eos> Don't worry about her.<eos> She's seen me act ridiculous already.<eos> That's true.<eos> You don't know what you've done wrong?<eos> I'm sorry. Happy now?<eos> Only if you take out the "Happy now?".<eos> Yes, it's not an apology if you add a "Happy now?" at the end.<eos> Goodness, you two are quite the pair.
Where are you going?<eos> We're in the middle of something.<eos> - I need to take this.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> Sheriff!<eos> Hello?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Can't believe this.<eos> Who is Eddie Harp, and why didn't you tell us how dangerous he is?<eos> - Well, you didn't think to ask.
How do you know that?<eos> Are you investigating me?<eos> What was it you needed to tell me?<eos> I'm not sure what it means, but I woke up in the middle of the night two nights ago, and Jim wasn't in the tent.<eos> - Where was he?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Gone.<eos> And then I asked him about it the next morning, and he acted like I was crazy.<eos> He said I was dreaming, but I wasn't.<eos> You two have been traveling together for a long time.
Where's Dennis staying, Ferg?<eos> Peaksman Motel in Sheridan.<eos> I'm heading to Sheridan.<eos> I don't think that's a very good idea.<eos> I have to.<eos> If he's come from Boston and he's who I think he is, he clearly didn't get my message the first time.<eos> And you're clearly not getting his.<eos> Oh, I'm getting his message.<eos> I just don't care for it.<eos> You two head home.
What is Deeks doing, having a staring contest?<eos> She hasn't been the most forthcoming.<eos> I'm not saying another word without my lawyer present.<eos> Okay, well, not to be a stickler for detail, but that's, uh, actually nine words.<eos> So... she lawyered up.<eos> That's no fun.<eos> Well, I guess we call her lawyer. In the meantime, finish executing the search warrant on the storage unit and the vehicle, see if you can find anything that helps us.<eos> All right.<eos> Will do.<eos> You must be the intimidators.
Want me to get him back in here?<eos> Samantha Rogers.<eos> Her card is in my purse, the one you confiscated.<eos> She's already been called.<eos> Course, this would be a whole lot easier if you just talked to us.<eos> Do people really fall for that?<eos> We're just trying to help you.<eos> Then let me go.<eos> Now, you know we can't do that.<eos> And you know you need to get me a lawyer.
!<eos> I spent the day with my mind in your body.<eos> [ Gasps ] Unh!<eos> Aah!<eos> Whoa.<eos> Where's your chill?<eos> Buck is no longer pleased.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He wasn't like this this morning.<eos> I was acting weird all day and you all just liked it?
Screen, screen, screen.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> You, you, you!<eos> Watch screen, screen!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Shoot it!<eos> Yes!<eos> I win!<eos> What an invigorating hand sport.<eos> How often do you, uh, you fellows play?
And we've been dreaming about it even longer.<eos> We're ready to give everything for thismission you know, all of us are.<eos> We are coming to you from the International Mars Science Foundation headquarters, in Vienna, Austria. With live coverage from the Mars Mission Corporation's mission control center in London, and an optical feed from the Daedalus itself, at a 10 minute, 20 second delay.<eos> We had survived a 209-day journey through deep space.<eos> But landing a 14-story ship safely, upright, and on target on the surface of Mars?<eos> That was a whole different kind of challenge.<eos> Um, by the time this message reaches you, whatever is about to happen already has.<eos> If all went as planned then we are touched down at the base camp, we are docked and we're ready to begin the most exciting phase of scientific exploration in human history.<eos> And if we haven't,<eos> we went into the darkness so that you could find the light.
Mark.<eos> EDL sequence engaged.<eos> You ready for this?<eos> Are you?<eos> Put your helmets on and seal your kits.<eos> Daedalus descent to the surface has been initiated at 425 kilometers altitude.<eos> By the time this message reaches you, whatever is about to happen already has.<eos> If all went as planned, we are touched down at the base camp, we are docked and we're ready to begin the most exciting phase of scientific exploration in human history.<eos> And if we haven't... 9 minutes 30 seconds till landing.<eos> ... know that we went into the darkness so that you could find the light.
The hybrids, how are they coming along?<eos> They're trying.<eos> They're really trying.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know it's hard especially now, but maybe the best thing is to take a little time away from the work and refill the well.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I couldn't save them.<eos> They weren't strong enough.<eos> They died so that you could live.
No concern of yours.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> The environment is all of our concern.<eos> Your father's project, Atlantropa, it is being peddled as an economic miracle, but it is an abomination.<eos> How could stemming the Mediterranean be good for the Reich?<eos> I don't know, Hans.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> It will have catastrophic effects on the earth.<eos> Our planet will pay a heavy price.<eos> And so will you two if we have to hear a political lecture.
I'm asking if you've seen the movie "A Few Good Men."<eos> - Donna, what're you doing here? - Waiting for you.<eos> Because I've been calling you and texting you and you obviously haven't checked your phone.<eos> I haven't checked my phone because I've been going to every client we have reassuring them that Sutter's gonna recant his bullshit and Jim Reynolds isn't going anywhere.<eos> Yeah, well, if you don't do something soon, you're gonna have to recant that.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Jim Reynolds called.<eos> They moved his board meeting to tomorrow.<eos> - We need to talk. - I don't believe this.<eos> I'm about to give the most important cross examination in my life and you're showing up now?
For me, it's personal. - Robert...<eos> - Jessica, you got to knock down the mountain.<eos> Without help, you're not gonna be able get back up.<eos> Please, take my hand.<eos> I appreciate your offer more than you know, Robert.<eos> But I've had my name first for too long. I can't go back to having it last.<eos> Jessica, if you don't do this, you're not gonna have it anywhere.<eos> Then so be it.<eos> Besides, we both know lawyers are nothing but power-hungry bottom-feeders, anyway.<eos> You two don't look like Jessica Pearson.
Everybody here is nice and supportive.<eos> Why do good people always have to happen to me?<eos> Where the crazy ladies at?<eos> Nothing like the smell of hairspray, tanning lotion, and baby tears.<eos> I'm home!<eos> Lucy Carmichael, pageant coach to the stars.<eos> Lose that bow, kid.<eos> Red is so over.<eos> You!<eos> You two look like you could use my help.
She thinks if I can find my way back to normal, maybe she can.<eos> Whatever normal is.<eos> Who are we to judge?<eos> Watch yourself with that.<eos> It's not like the old shit.<eos> Just hold on.<eos> Hold up.<eos> Hello.<eos> This has gotta be the guy.<eos> You must be the insurance men?
You know, if a man can't let himself go during a zombie apocalypse, then what's the point of having one?<eos> One word. Enders.<eos> One day you stop doing your eyebrows. The next, you're just hair and lice.<eos> And you're held together by a loincloth.<eos> Thanks for the visual. Hi-ya.<eos> It's Kaya in the Sky-a.<eos> Spinning hits from the 2000s, 1990s, 1890s.<eos> Basically whatever I want.<eos> Here's another one for Operation Bite Mark.<eos> Wherever you are.
No, we're headed to Wall Drug.<eos> Heard some folks up there are making a go of it.<eos> They got supplies and water.<eos> How coincidental.<eos> That's where we're headed.<eos> Thanks, darlin'.<eos> Looks like we're ready to go.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Hey, hey. Hold on now. Look.<eos> You two have been drinking.
Thanks, Howell.<eos> You're welcome!<eos> Debate's over!<eos> Time to vote!<eos> Hello?<eos> GOD FORGIVE ME!<eos> And in conclusion, a vote for me is a vote for the wall. And a death knell to the zombie menace!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do we want another four years like the last four years?<eos> I don't, and I don't think you do either.
But... We... have a plan.<eos> We're working very hard.<eos> It's-it's-it's complex. But I'm not giving up.<eos> I'm gonna try, Mrs. Gardner.<eos> I'm gonna give it... everything that I've got.<eos> I've had such a wonderful life.<eos> I just didn't know I was done teaching.<eos> Hello, Doctor.<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> You don't use paper or books or office supplies, but this is how I work.
I think that one of the most brilliant tactics of the civil rights movement was its transformation of the notion of criminality.<eos> Because for the first time, being arrested was a noble thing.<eos> Being arrested by white people was your worst nightmare.<eos> Still is, uh, for many African Americans.<eos> So what'd they do?<eos> They voluntarily defined a movement around getting arrested.<eos> They turned it on its head.<eos> [Cobb] If you looked at the history of black people's various struggles in this country, the connecting theme is the attempt to be understood as full, complicated human beings.<eos> We are something other than this, uh, visceral image of criminality and menace and threat to which people associate with us.<eos> We're willing to be beaten for democracy, and you misuse democracy in the street.
-"Super predators," end quote. That's the word they used to describe this generation, and it was very, very effective.<eos> Experts call them super predators.<eos> They are not just gangs of kids anymore.<eos> They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.<eos> No conscience, no empathy.<eos> [reporter 2] A group of kids growing up essentially fatherless, godless and jobless.<eos> For me, what's disturbing is the degree to which black people bought into that.<eos> Animals, beasts that needed to be controlled.<eos> When those grandmothers say, "But he's a good boy.<eos> He never did anything," don't you believe it.
[Garner] I can't breathe.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> I can't breathe. I can't breathe.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> I can't breathe. I can't breathe.<eos> [Turner] Everyone pointed out that he was saying,<eos> "I can't breathe. I can't breathe."<eos> But the sentences before that were,<eos> "Why are you always stopping me?<eos> Why is it, day in and day out, week in and week out, you're stopping me?"
I don't believe it.<eos> You convinced my aunt I didn't kill those people?<eos> - No, Leonard, I didn't. - I don't understand.<eos> You said that she had to agree to be there for me.<eos> She agreed to sign the papers.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Leonard, don't take your eye off the ball.<eos> This was about buying us time.<eos> Take my eye off the ball?<eos> Do you even give a shit about me?
We're gonna need to get this in writing.<eos> You can do it from your house.<eos> - Officer?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> The guy left her purse, didn't take her watch.<eos> I got Sergeant Hayes from Violent Crimes running all recent parolees with robbery backgrounds, convicted felons who live in this sector.<eos> I don't know, what do you think?<eos> He only took her gun.<eos> I need all you to report for canvassing to Detective Dawson up on Webster Street.
What are you drawing now?<eos> Huh.<eos> They look kind of like you.<eos> Was that your crew?<eos> Awhk!<eos> You were a captain?<eos> That's so cool!<eos> I'm sorry, that's so cool, sir!<eos> Oh, yeah, you guys don't salute like that.<eos> You go like...
What we had wasn't healthy.<eos> I never want to feel like I felt with you... never again!<eos> So just go.<eos> Lapis!<eos> She said, "No"!<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> This is your fault.<eos> I'll shatter you!<eos> Lapis, you did it!<eos> Are you two okay?
Well, that's not true.<eos> Connie defeated those gem experiments at the hospital.<eos> But...<eos> And look!<eos> I brought these walkie-talkies so we can talk to each other in case something happens!<eos> But...<eos> And I've read this book front to back, at least 20 times!<eos> Well, all right.<eos> But as soon as you find the monster, contact me immediately.<eos> I don't want you fighting this thing alone.
When civilization collapses and this world ends, I need to be ready to build the new one.<eos> Yeah, I guess if homeworld invades Earth, things could get pretty crazy for humanity.<eos> Forget gems.<eos> Humans are already starting their own demise!<eos> Peak oil, Steven!<eos> How do we handle terminal decline without alternate energy sources?<eos> !<eos> How are you two doing?<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Remember, you humans need to eat!
I'll be right there, Connie!<eos> Who's that?<eos> ! B-B-B-B-B-B-Bubble!<eos> Jasper.<eos> Those footprints.<eos> The monsters were running from her.<eos> Connie, where's the...<eos> Jasper!<eos> Hey, Rose, look what I got.<eos> Are you two okay?
Metcalf says that you knew his real name, that you had sex with him three or four times.<eos> That's a lie!<eos> We had sex once, at the hotel, and that is it, and I never...<eos> I never knew his real name until that night.<eos> Why would I put myself through all this if I knew who this pig really was?<eos> My son can barely look at me!<eos> My husband is going to file for divorce.<eos> We believe you.<eos> Now, do you remember seeing this man?<eos> Gary Bell, he was the doorman at the building where you two had drinks one night.
Well, it's easier to narrow once more bodies drop, but the point's to prevent that from happening.<eos> We slim it, predict it...<eos> who, where, when.<eos> Okay.<eos> - A list? - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Your son's been identified by the CPD as a potential suspect in future gang violence.<eos> You saying he's done something? No, not yet.<eos> 'Cause it sounds like you're accusing him.<eos> We believe he's likely to commit or have violence committed against him in the very near future.<eos> We got boys dying on these streets, and you all here, asking me questions?
You leaving anything out, Freddy? No.<eos> No, I'm just saying.<eos> I mean, we can count on you, right?<eos> Keep your phone on.<eos> Kim Burgess and Mike Sorensen, you two met?<eos> Great.<eos> I need you to get over to Manny's Deli.<eos> Call just came in, woman tried to swipe a brisket sandwich.<eos> We caught a high-profile murder last night and now you have us chasing stolen sandwiches?<eos> You didn't "catch" anything.
Okay, so we move on him first.<eos> Call Crowley. Tell her to go ahead with the press conference.<eos> And today, two Chicago police officers were targeted and murdered. For one reason only: Because they were police officers.<eos> Those officers... Will never return home.<eos> Every day, you risk your lives for this city.<eos> For the people you love.<eos> For your families, your friends. And for strangers. And for those who resent you.<eos> Your job is to still protect them.<eos> No threat changes that.<eos> You serve. You protect.
And it keeps going!<eos> Carl, we can get you help.<eos> - We can move past all of this.<eos> - You're supposed to call in support!<eos> I need the dozen cars, the command post, the hostage negotiator.<eos> He's got the whole place rigged with explosives.<eos> He's trying to get as many cops here as he can.<eos> All right, Carl.<eos> Let's talk about your father.<eos> You killed him!
Look that... that can cast a big shadow, believe me.<eos> But... what I've done as a cop, and as a man... Is to try to make him proud.<eos> You can do that right now, Carl. It is not too late.<eos> Just put the gun down and walk out that door.<eos> Your dad will be proud of you.<eos> Carl.<eos> No.<eos> - Carl.<eos> - No.<eos> You're gonna kill all of them.
And I don't know what the ghosts have here but the people hunting us had AK-47s and RPGs.<eos> The Polks have cars and weapons. And they're much closer.<eos> If we can get there and get a vehicle, we can get out of here in half the time.<eos> Plus...<eos> Monet is still out there.<eos> - The woman who played Lee?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The Polks have her. The ones who did all this to me.<eos> "Never leave a man behind"...<eos> Okay, you two stay here.
You're both looking very healthy, very... very good and healthy and...<eos> Did you talk to Dr Samuels about your...?<eos> Yes.<eos> And they're happy, getting along all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Good.<eos> Excellent.<eos> You are my daughters.
Yeah, I only said that so you'd help with the digging. span style="col<eos> Alison, you love a quiz, don't you?<eos> I'll have to hurry you.<eos> Don't know.<eos> Is it any good? Yes.<eos> Come on, Kent, back me up<eos> So, it's betrayal.<eos> You're just a bunch of Lando Calrissians. Oh, easy, mate.<eos> I'm going to start walking to the pub.<eos> And you've got a choice - you can follow me or stay here on a fool's errand, digging up defunct bangers from the '90s.
I can't even be the one thing I'm supposed to be, ya know?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I'm not rose quartz.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, Steven.<eos> Why do you think I've been working so hard?<eos> Well, it's paying off.<eos> I sure hope so!<eos> Thanks, Steven.<eos> Aah! What did you two do?
This whole town's haunted.<eos> It's 'cause of the witch burnings.<eos> Of course, they weren't really witches.<eos> Yeah, I've heard that, uh, that story.<eos> Why are they haunting us?<eos> I mean, what do they want?<eos> I think they want all the constables dead.<eos> And they got them all, too, except for Sheriff Miller.<eos> That's 'cause the Lady Who Knows was protecting him.<eos> But now she's gone and you two are still alive, for now.
I-I don't understand.<eos> Croatoan was a message left at Roanoke for the others so they could find the lost colony.<eos> It is actually a word of dark power and blood magic.<eos> You're the professor on the tape.<eos> Used to live in this house.<eos> Well, technically, I only stayed here for six months, but I've been the owner for years.<eos> No one who knew the history of this place would touch it.<eos> You can search the title, and within months of taking possession, everyone who ever owned it was either dead or had gone missing.<eos> I became its guardian.<eos> I couldn't live in the house, but I kept it so others wouldn't make the same mistake, and then a slight reversal of fortune made me a little short when property tax time came around and you two were unlucky enough to buy it at auction.
They were immigrants and nobody told them the history of the house.<eos> They didn't have a clue what hit them.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> So, the Chens fought back the only way they knew how.<eos> They prayed to their ancestors and they made offerings to protect them from evil.<eos> But their ancestors were no match for what was already here.<eos> I guess they never had a chance.<eos> But you do.
No.<eos> Which one?<eos> Which one of you destroyed my Peale?<eos> !<eos> Speak up!<eos> Goddamn you! Speak up!<eos> Speak up!<eos> Speak up!<eos> Mr. Mott!<eos> I swear... I saw a big white woman and a young man in the yard by the woods a few minutes before you screamed.
Do not judge me.<eos> Need I remind you that you are a servant as well?<eos> Do not think your velvet tongue and purple cockhead are enough to make you any more than that.<eos> Do not find yourself in my sight for the rest of the night!<eos> Or blood will spill!<eos> What we know of the rest of that night, and the apparent end of Edward Mott, was told by Guiness.<eos> Unhand me, you fools!<eos> Who are you?<eos> ! This is my land! Mine!<eos> You are trespassing!
It was... surreal.<eos> This wasn't just weird sounds in the woods or knives left in the ceiling.<eos> This was a mob, and they were coming for us.<eos> It didn't matter if they were alive or dead, or what they were, I just knew that we had to get out of there.<eos> Usurpers!<eos> Your time is nigh.<eos> The Blood Moon is upon us.<eos> We must honor our covenant with the ancient gods and consecrate this land once again.<eos> You were given opportunity to cede this territory.<eos> As you did not, your end shall be a merciless reckoning.
I built them.<eos> You're not...<eos> You're not alive.<eos> No, The Butcher killed me.<eos> I will keep her from killing you.<eos> No more, no less.<eos> Is that why you appeared?<eos> To save us?<eos> No.<eos> You're my bane.
So, we are gonna be filming everything.<eos> People want the reality.<eos> They're interested in the process.<eos> We have over three million followers on Twitter;<eos> almost five million likes on Facebook for the finale;<eos> multiple covers of Entertainment Weekly;<eos> hundreds of fan sites online;<eos> cons across the country.<eos> The appetite for this show hasn't even reached its peak!<eos> We have millions of eyeballs waiting to see the next iteration and you have a chance to buy it now.
And it'll all be filmed, 24 hours a day.<eos> Okay, I-I don't understand.<eos> Um, you expect-- excuse me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You want to capture actual spirits on film?<eos> Like... ghosts?<eos> Well, I expect to capture real reactions to what they'll believe are spirits.<eos> So, it's... fake.<eos> Reality is what we make of it.<eos> You of all people should know that.
What are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about the real people.<eos> We're just actors.<eos> They are the ones who had your babies taken from you, not us.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's them.<eos> It's them you want, not us.<eos> They're at the house right now.<eos> We can take you.<eos> We can go in.<eos> We can leave the door unlocked, and you can go in and drag 'em out!
- ‭What?<eos> My boys need teeth.<eos> You can open your mouth, or I can open it for you.<eos> I paid good money for these teeth.<eos> Still got some fire in you....<eos> It's good. Keep you alive longer.<eos> Oh, burn in hell!<eos> You should be thanking me that this is your end else you'd be strung up like that boy in the tree.<eos> You did that!<eos> Did you do that? !
No.<eos> That's his cousin, Farah.<eos> Turns out his name is Pitopang. He speaks Mamuju.<eos> Came here from West Sulawesi a month ago to work in his uncle's restaurant.<eos> Always wanted to ride a roller coaster. Wow.<eos> Nice, April.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hi, I'm Doctor Manning.<eos> Your cousin has the measles, but he should make a full recovery.<eos> My cousin said thank you, and he thinks you two make a great couple.
Seen a bunch of cases at the VA.<eos> I'm guessing he picked it up in Vietnam.<eos> But that was over 40 years ago.<eos> The worms embed themselves in the intestinal wall and can remain dormant for decades.<eos> The steroids he was on to treat his colitis must have suppressed his immune system, allowing the larvae to proliferate.<eos> So we put him on an anti-parasitic.<eos> That should clear him up, right?<eos> The worms have reached the surface of his skin. I'd say he's in a hyperinfective state.<eos> Ms. Goodwin, I'm sorry, but most patients don't survive this.<eos> I don't want you two throwing in the towel before we've even started.
Uh, you know, Mommy's gonna have to call you back, sweetheart.<eos> Claire Miller, what the hell were you up to?<eos> And one and two and...<eos> Did, uh... did you ever see your mother with this book?<eos> - Yeah, all the time.<eos> - down and...<eos> Really?<eos> How come I didn't?<eos> 'Cause you were never home, and when you were, you just sat in your chair and you didn't pay no attention.<eos> Of course I don't pay no attention, you two sitting around all day, chirping away like two birds fighting over an onion ring.
You know what that feels like, don't you?<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. is here to help you move on, James.<eos> You can take a stand with me.<eos> Fight back.<eos> That's how you move on.<eos> Take control of your life again.<eos> I've got some stuff to finish up, but, um... meet me after closing at the public-storage place next door.<eos> Pod 212, second floor.<eos> I got something that might help.<eos> Damn, you two must be straight loco letting me out of my cage like that.
Are you gonna... say anything else?<eos> Nothing else to say.<eos> I'm just glad you're safe.<eos> - The Watchdogs are...<eos> - The Watchdogs took a hit.<eos> They continue to be a threat, but we have to put them on the back burner for now.<eos> They're not gonna stop just because we...<eos> We have a more pressing threat on our hands.<eos> Sorry, but for me, nothing is more pressing than...<eos> Look, I know you two like to work alone, settling the scores that are personal to you, but that's not how we work here at S.H.I.E.L.D.
You know someone that worked at that Momentum facility?<eos> - My uncle.<eos> - Doing time at South Ridge Penitentiary?<eos> He always said the guy he beat up was the real criminal. - Who is she?<eos> - Dr. Lucy Bauer.<eos> Joseph's wife.<eos> They were the project leaders at this privately funded think tank.<eos> - What is she after? - She's gonna go after the book.<eos> It's called the Darkhold.<eos> Look, I know you two like to work alone.
That's an outmoded way of thinking.<eos> The world has moved past that sort of thing.<eos> So I have decided to give you a new mission.<eos> Thomas.<eos> First,<eos> I need to know that I can trust you.<eos> I got a couple questions.<eos> And if I don't like the answers,<eos> Ma here is gonna shoot you.<eos> We may seem like simple country folk and you think you can fancy talk your way out of this.
Which we will have to insist upon if any deal is to go through.<eos> The United States is prepared to lift the arms embargo entirely.<eos> What's the matter, catfish got your tongue?<eos> We were prepared for a much bigger fight over much less.<eos> Well, here's the catch you were waiting for.<eos> There are certain human rights and civil society benchmarks that Vietnam will have to meet in order to get the bigger ticket military items.<eos> Dissidents for destroyers....<eos> Of course, the timing of all this makes me wonder if this sudden windfall has something to do with the activists<eos> China recently detained.<eos> Let's just say that we value your sovereignty in the South China Sea as much as you do.
Oh, no.<eos> He looks tough!<eos> What is this thing?<eos> This black orb is... Gantz.<eos> Gantz?<eos> I don't know why, but that's what everyone calls it.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Are these toy guns?<eos> "Kato-cha, LOL." Is this mine?<eos> You two first-timers had better get dressed now.
I'm talking to you, punk!<eos> -Nishi!<eos> -Don't!<eos> I told you.<eos> Nishi!<eos> He would have only dragged us down.<eos> This guy looks useless, too.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Put on the gear, Kato!<eos> Who are you?
This guy looks useless, too.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Put on the gear, Kato!<eos> Who are you?<eos> We're stuck playing an endless survival game.<eos> A survival game?<eos> You must have seen it on the news.<eos> You know the monster in Shibuya...?<eos> We fight the monsters.<eos> You mean, you're the ones in the black suits?
Kato!<eos> I'm okay?<eos> The suit protected you.<eos> Come on!<eos> Who did it?<eos> -He's lying!<eos> -Are you?<eos> Who are they?<eos> You have a Tokyo accent.<eos> Are you the Osaka team?
How about that tough guy who's called Kuro or something?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> It's Reika!<eos> Man! Look at the jugs on her!<eos> Shit!<eos> Hey, the Tokyo team's not bad.<eos> More of them!<eos> Here we go!<eos> You just sit and watch, wimps.
I'm sorry, but have we met?<eos> No.<eos> I'm here on behalf of a mutual friend...<eos> Dr. Jekyll.<eos> I'm Mr. Hyde.<eos> Hyde?<eos> I don't believe Henry's ever mentioned you.<eos> Hasn't he?<eos> He's certainly mentioned you, and for good reason.<eos> You must be Mary.
Now... one success proves nothing.<eos> Two?<eos> Well, then we'd know you really had something.<eos> So, what do you say, Dr. Jekyll?<eos> Ready to let Mr. Hyde back out to play?<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> They came for the serum, smashed everything.<eos> Can't say I'm surprised that your, uh, stronger half got the better of you once again.<eos> Pretty much how it goes with you two.<eos> You didn't care about me or my work, did you?
Is she someone you loved?<eos> With all my heart... until Hyde destroyed that love.<eos> Mary?<eos> Mr. Hyde?<eos> Apologies.<eos> I-I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> Hyde, what are you doing here?<eos> Might I talk with you for a bit?<eos> You may.<eos> I must confess, you... left me quite curious the other night.
But I didn't come here to go on about myself.<eos> Actually, I'm here on Jekyll's behalf.<eos> The doctor has great feelings for you.<eos> I care very much for Henry.<eos> But I don't think I could ever... be with him in that way.<eos> Why not?<eos> Look at his work.<eos> Things like... passion and desire are little more than... contaminants to be eliminated.<eos> I need someone who wants to bathe in their passion and give in to desire.<eos> I have a feeling you understand me, don't you, Mr. Hyde?
And it's such an advantage to be slut-shamed for six years because I accidentally sucked Brian Dunkleman's dick 'cause I thought he was Chris Hardwick.<eos> Look, can we at least agree that the true enemy here is the white male? Whoa!<eos> Not me.<eos> I'm an immigrant.<eos> Our story is so tragic.<eos> Do you know how many of us drown every day trying to get over here?<eos> And the true villain is the white American male.<eos> Bad things happen to white American men, too.<eos> Real bad things.<eos> You know, why don't I let you white people tell me how bad you all have it.
- She's a foreigner.<eos> - Oh, how exotic.<eos> This is the United States of America.<eos> We don't have any rulers here.<eos> We're free.<eos> But who makes the rules?<eos> We make our own rules...<eos> through the radical process of voting.<eos> Just trying to wrap my head around this.<eos> You mean you vote if you can do something or not?
Father Marcus, what can you tell me about demonic possession?<eos> Go home, Father Tomas.<eos> Live a long and happy life. You're way out of your depth.<eos> Katherine?<eos> Casey?<eos> Father?<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> You have no family.<eos> No future to speak of.<eos> The world don't know who you are and doesn't care.
It's was a... present for her.<eos> A present?<eos> Yes.<eos> For her years of service.<eos> She's been quite good to us.<eos> It's a very expensive present, ma'am.<eos> You have to provide your maid with a signed authorization for things like this.<eos> I-I really don't have the time for this.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't you keep it?
Congresswoman, will you excuse us, please?<eos> Perhaps it's about that problem you're not having.<eos> - You wanted to see us?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The NSA and Homeland Security just finished their analysis on the hack.<eos> All of our data, files, codes... Everything's intact.<eos> What, so you're saying they didn't take anything?<eos> They left something behind.<eos> I am Majid Nassar.<eos> At your Capitol building, my Al-Sakar Martyrs Brigade annihilated your government, so you, too, can experience the same terror and death that you have visited upon our lands.
Jacott. That's it.<eos> That's Eddie's kid from the school... Oliver Jacott.<eos> Made a fortune in the life-insurance game.<eos> Lives in a giant spread out in the Hamptons.<eos> All these checks are written for charitable donations to the gym for new equipment, upgrades.<eos> I didn't see a punching bag hanging in there that was less than 30 years old.<eos> Then what did they use the money for?<eos> Hey, Bennie, what are you doing here?<eos> I sleep here.<eos> You broke in. You need to go.
What grounds?<eos> Evidence has gone missing, ma'am.<eos> What evidence?<eos> Photographs from the surveillance file on Eagle Repairs.<eos> I'm looking for a man in an A3 convertible, am I? Mm-hm.<eos> Something like that?<eos> No, I checked the file yesterday. They weren't there.<eos> Is this your only evidence that someone on the team might be bent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jesus, you NCD people never use the front door, do you?
Frank steals it, won't give it up, gets shot.<eos> Two weeks later, after meeting Elliot, Kettler's dead.<eos> That leaves Elliot the last man standing, looking for his goldmine on that truck.<eos> Ma'am, you asked me to find a link between Elliot and the missing driver, Stefan Milner.<eos> Apparently before he joined Le Saux's he did a stint of work as a mechanic... at Duncan Elliot's.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All roads lead to Duncan Elliot.<eos> Let's try Delia Bradley again.<eos> She was the one who gave us Elliot's name.<eos> She was the one who gave us Gunner, Nancy, you know her.
Is that a Morse Code thing?<eos> It's more of a...<eos> I'm pregnant with your child thing.<eos> That's...<eos> That's amazing!<eos> Don't worry, baby.<eos> The planet's gonna have to take care of itself.<eos> The last of the surviving Red Hands have been vaccinated.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I need you two to keep this community safe in my absence.
I'm sorry about...<eos> Keep going, Dylan.<eos> I'm thinking of a torture room where people actually get waterboarded for a couple of seconds.<eos> I saw how to do it on "Locked Up Abroad."<eos> It's safe.<eos> This is amazing!<eos> You're exactly what this committee's been missing.<eos> You like that stuff?<eos> 'Cause we both came up with it together.<eos> Why don't you design the room?
I was stressed. I was scared.<eos> It was after long hours. It was in the middle of the night.<eos> I was innocent, and they were telling me that I was guilty.<eos> I told him it was because they had said that I had met him.<eos> They had shown me his text message and said that I had met him, and that I must have not remembered it because it was so traumatizing.<eos> In that moment, I thought it could have been true.<eos> He just kept asking the question again.<eos> Again and again and again.<eos> "No, why did you... Why did you say, 'Patrick Lumumba'?"<eos> You made me believe I met Patrick Lumumba.
We had a fucking deal, George. Oh.<eos> Like the one where you're going to tell us anything you had on the Smiths?<eos> Yeah, that one.<eos> I did that.<eos> What about your little chat you just had with Thomas?<eos> I warned you.<eos> Your building is wired.<eos> Who do you think installed the lines?<eos> It's perfect.<eos> You're spying on me.
A little busy, Willis. What you got?<eos> I've got a kid here with blunt abdomen trauma and a retroperitoneal bleed.<eos> - No pulse.<eos> - Uh, how far out are you?<eos> That's why I'm calling. We're trapped.<eos> I'm gonna need you to send out a R.E.B.O.A. Kit to be ready as soon as they get us out.<eos> I was paged.<eos> Is this the guy waiting for bypass surgery?<eos> - 84-year-old male in v-fib. - Clear.<eos> You guys are the ones who invented R.E.B.O.A., so you know how delicate it is.
- Give me a second to get my bearings, okay?<eos> Don't you think I want to know what happened - just as much as you do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do you?<eos> Zach, may I speak with you for a second?<eos> Kind of in the middle of losing game of Clue here, Lin.<eos> I think I might be able to help with that.<eos> Look what you did to me, freak.<eos> Whoa, wait.<eos> You two know each other?
Cocaine?<eos> No. Not coke. Try keratin.<eos> Human-nails keratin.<eos> Danny's nails weren't manicured.<eos> The killer filed them down before leaving.<eos> Danny must have scratched him fighting for his life.<eos> So, the killer didn't want anyone to find the tissue or DNA.<eos> Yeah, well, too bad he didn't think to clean up the nail residue, because in it, I found high-density polyethylene and two sets of DNA.<eos> Okay, Danny and who else's?<eos> That's what I need you to find out.
So I can stop them!<eos> You don't know who you'd be going up against.<eos> She has powerful friends.<eos> So do I.<eos> They're using you.<eos> Watching you fight like an animal.<eos> No, I don't fight for them.<eos> I fight for myself.<eos> This is the reality that we live in.<eos> This is the world you've created.
And that's after I published the piece about Cadmus and these other terrorist groups exploiting social media.<eos> Yeah, Snapper wants me to write an objective piece about it.<eos> I don't know how I'm supposed to be objective when I know what they're actually up to.<eos> Have you seen Mon-El?<eos> I mean, Mike?<eos> I asked him to take this down to marketing like two hours ago.<eos> Mike, do you have protection?<eos> You mean, like a sword?<eos> Oh, God, get it out of my ears!<eos> What are you two doing?
Okay, I'm trying very hard to be Mike, okay?<eos> But it is not as easy as you make it sound, Kara.<eos> I'm used to doing my own thing.<eos> Well, you don't do your own thing here.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> And if I don't want to do your thing?<eos> Then find another mentor.<eos> ...you will beg us to save you.<eos> We are Cadmus.<eos> You are lame.
- Tell who what?<eos> Alex...<eos> Um, okay, so we thought about what you said...<eos> About Kara.<eos> Right, about not keeping secrets from her.<eos> We talked about it and, um... I'm gonna be the one that tells her I'm the Guardian.<eos> - No, no, no, no, you're not.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, because I have something to say, something very important.<eos> And I'm not going to have you two hijacking the night with your vigilante hijinks.
It's a rocket launcher.<eos> And it's yours.<eos> Take it.<eos> Prove you're with me.<eos> Unleash Medusa and end Earth's alien menace once and for all.<eos> - Don't do it, Lena.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I'm a Luthor.<eos> Go, I've got this.<eos> You two are finished.
And now would you show this lovely couple to table number seven, please?<eos> Right this way.<eos> Whoa, whoo, this place is packed.<eos> Did somebody see the face of Jesus on a quesadilla?<eos> My friend Balthazar tweeted a glowing review of his epicurean experience, and it reverberated through the gastronomic blog-o-sphere like wildfire!<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> Believe it?<eos> I'm living my dream, Oscar.<eos> I'm living my dream!<eos> You're not us.
Cider?<eos> What are we on, a freaking hay ride?<eos> And where's the hockey game?<eos> Why are all the TVs off?<eos> Oh, Felix thinks they're a distraction.<eos> He wants the customers to talk to each other.<eos> Ugh...<eos> Why would he?<eos> That's crazy!<eos> You're complaining?
Oh, Felix thinks they're a distraction.<eos> He wants the customers to talk to each other.<eos> Ugh...<eos> Why would he?<eos> That's crazy!<eos> You're complaining?<eos> Felix has been running me ragged.<eos> I haven't had a break in four hours.<eos> Unless you count weeping out by the dumpster.<eos> French fries, you'll never let me down.
This is gonna be fun.<eos> - We may want our meal to go.<eos> So, how long you two been a couple?<eos> Oh, no, no. We're not a couple.<eos> No, not... I didn't even know that Amelia was gonna be here tonight when Ginny invited me, no.<eos> No, it was a total surprise.<eos> Right, and since he barely knows me,<eos> - it was just such a boring surprise.<eos> - Right, exactly.<eos> How long have you two been together?
- It's a basic human need.<eos> - Of yours. You know what?<eos> I don't care how you feel about my need to be liked, and I realize that's kind of a contradiction, - but one day...<eos> - Chh! Calm down! - Chh!<eos> - Stop doing that.<eos> There it is.<eos> Whoever finds the thumb, pick up the intercom and say... I don't know, "strawberry jam."<eos> Ooh, but what if something actually happens with strawberry jam?<eos> I am willing to take that chance.<eos> Do you think I'm a memorable person?
Hey, Mr. Booth.<eos> Wife's been asking when we're gonna be seeing you on stage again.<eos> Soon.<eos> My friend's drunk.<eos> Unhand me!<eos> Grant's gonna be in there too.<eos> You're gonna need more than one bullet. Take it!<eos> I set this course nigh on four years ago and do not now submit my destiny for your approval, nor...<eos> Actors.<eos> Now, some other gals and their mothers would go away when they found that out, but you value fortune, Ms. Gusty.
I only have two weeks, Monroe.<eos> Then I fly back.<eos> Hi, Wylie.<eos> Darling.<eos> See that she does fly back, Wylie.<eos> Or I'll break your neck.<eos> Good morning, Birdy.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Stahr.<eos> Ask someone to travel this far, Pat, you ought to provide cab fare.<eos> I thought you Israelites were used to crossing the desert.
Earlier it was snowing.<eos> Now it's raining.<eos> Too bad!<eos> Snow is so much nicer than rain, isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> But if it's raining, that can only mean you've been bad children.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Because raindrops are the tears of Christ.<eos> And if Jesus is crying, that can only mean you've made him angry.
He said: "There are only two reasons a human being would get down on his knees."<eos> And one is to pray, and the other is to know himself.<eos> I was only twelve years old, Holy Father.<eos> I was twelve years old!<eos> You need to continue, Archbishop.<eos> Your story isn't finished yet.<eos> What... What else do you want to know?<eos> What happened afterward?<eos> You want to know whether I, as an adult, became like Jack Walser.<eos> Certainly, that's all you care about.

- Adrian.<eos> - Oh, again with him?<eos> Look, I'm just glad there's another respectable person at the EMPD.<eos> An M.E. who seems to really have a good head on his shoulders.<eos> Oh, not that you're being even the least bit sincere.<eos> [Whispers] Stop it!<eos> [Normal voice] He really does.<eos> Big step up from what we had.<eos> And that's exactly my point.<eos> I'm just saying, genetically speaking, you two are a very nice match.
The test is never over.<eos> Oh, hang on. We're not gonna be wearing these fascist little flibberty-bits for the next five months, are we?<eos> Just this afternoon... at Langley.<eos> Wait.<eos> Langley?<eos> Does that mean we can get dressed up?<eos> Because I'm tired of pants.<eos> Well, we want you looking your best as you rub elbows with some of the most accomplished former and current case officers at the CIA.<eos> They like to meet the new kids, kick the tires, find the lemons.<eos> And I take their feedback very seriously, and so should you.
Look, just because our marriage has ended, doesn't mean that we regret that it happened.<eos> If we could do it all over again, we would.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - In heartbeat.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes.<eos> Swear on this.<eos> I swear on...<eos> "Chicken Soup for the Scrapbooker's Soul."<eos> You three kids are the best thing that ever happened to us.
He wouldn't betray me like that. He's like a son to me!<eos> I was the son to someone else once, too.<eos> Liam.<eos> Don't do this, mate.<eos> So, it's true?<eos> I know how you feel, but killing this man won't quench that fire inside of you!<eos> You once told me how you hunted the men down who murdered your family, how you butchered every single one of them!<eos> But that doesn't mean that you have to do the same.<eos> Oh, that's easy for you to say.<eos> You got your revenge.
I'm a stay-at-home grandpa.<eos> Show me the skrank!<eos> That's the word I made up for street cacao.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Had to kill a hooker to get it.<eos> I wish.<eos> My daughter-in-law works for Nestle.<eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Earl, what're you doing out here?<eos> Just to be clear, I'm out here with Han for business, nothing romantic.<eos> What are you doing out here with my Canadian Viagra connection?
I accidentally butt-dialed my wife during a major Pepcid AC drop.<eos> She took the minivan.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> No, it's not Suzanne Somers.<eos> It's me, Sophie!<eos> Wow, Sophie got her sexy back.<eos> Yeah, and front and under.<eos> Sophie, you deserve a flan-tini.<eos> And so do I.<eos> Oh, you know what, I did what you told me to do and I dropped baby Barbara off at the trainer/babysitter, and I had a bunch of Korean ladies go to town on me.
Later, nerd losers.<eos> Look at them with their nerd thermoses. Like they're nerd construction workers.<eos> Excuse me. What did you just say about those nerd losers?<eos> Uh, that they should drink out of their nerd thermoses?<eos> Glascott's office now!<eos> So, what kind of punishment are we talking about here?<eos> Suspension, expulsion, solitary confinement?<eos> Do we do that?<eos> 'Cause that's what I want.<eos> Yeah. You two can go back to class, and try not to be so accurate with your nerd insults next time.
Yes, it does.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> I don't know what I believe... any more.<eos> Take the picture.<eos> If only they could speak what stories they might tell.<eos> What a neck.<eos> Imagine finding the right dress for her.<eos> This one reminds me of someone we both know.<eos> Did I mention I saw Madame Fortier at the theatre?<eos> I didn't realise you two had such a long history.
Hey, call me if you change your mind.<eos> Ooh, sweet ride.<eos> Did you buy it with your bonus?<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> - That was stupid.<eos> No, there are dealers out there that will let you lease this for a dollar a month, just so that people can see you driving their car, but... but then again, you're a rookie.<eos> Nice road trip.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You think you're ready to catch for us full time?<eos> - Only if you're ready to win full time.
What happened to the rest of the guys?<eos> I walked out on a date.<eos> A date, huh?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> But in my defense, you said that you were going out with your brother.<eos> So, out of curiosity, why did you say you were going out with your brother?<eos> In case you were going out with the guys.<eos> I, um... I wanted to go out, too. I didn't want you to feel bad interrupting a date.
Looks like he's developing a cataract in his left eye.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> So I'd prescribe an eye patch for him to offset it so it doesn't get full-blown.<eos> Yeah, an eye patch will fix him up real nice.<eos> Rosie, are you trying to build a pirate?<eos> I'm not building one.<eos> He is one. He's a treasure hunter.<eos> - Yeah, that's what pirates do, Villa.<eos> - No. Bree told us that you used to dive for treasure with her father.<eos> She said you two had a falling out.
It's her.<eos> Magnetic north changes, all right, but True North is always the same.<eos> And for your father, that was you, okay?<eos> Every parent wants to leave something behind for their kids.<eos> Now, if he had found a treasure, he would leave some type of way for you to find where he was diving.<eos> I told you already.<eos> I don't... I don't know what it means.<eos> Okay, think of... Think of numbers.<eos> Think of places, things.<eos> Anything just you two would know.
You think?<eos> Is this your place?<eos> Oh, I wish.<eos> Have you seen the view?<eos> Five beds, six baths, Sub-Zero and Wolf appliances throughout.<eos> And zoned for Webster Elementary.<eos> Are you two interested in leasing or buying?<eos> Oh, actually, could I get your numbers first?<eos> I'm Diane.<eos> And you are?
Fine!<eos> For an hour, okay?<eos> Until I can stop the waterworks.<eos> Drink it. Drink that water. Oh, God.<eos> You are thirsty, aren't ya?<eos> Aunt Jodi.<eos> Whatcha doing?<eos> Staring at Dwayne.<eos> Why didn't it work out with you guys?<eos> I get why it didn't work out with Mom and Dad, but you two clearly have chemistry.
It's pretty late.<eos> You think I've got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?<eos> Sure, I'm still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.<eos> Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day's thoughts.
Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.<eos> That's me, I'm her.<eos> You know, he didn't trick me. He just wore me down.<eos> It makes sense you two are friends.<eos> I mean, hot girls always stick together.<eos> And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.<eos> You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.<eos> Well, it's not exactly like it.<eos> We're all extremely smart.<eos> Wow... you popular girls are mean.
Oh, this is gonna be such fun.<eos> The clothes, the violence... fantastic.<eos> I can't believe you're this into it.<eos> And yet you do believe.<eos> That's how good I am.<eos> Right, kids, DiMeo's the name, murder's the game.<eos> Big American gun party.<eos> No mercy, right?<eos> Play commences in three, two...<eos> You three go on ahead.
I'm really not feeling it.<eos> I mean, so they'll be ruled by guilt.<eos> Maya, we paid $3 for this.<eos> You're doing it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Fake it till you make it.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Your mom can have fun.<eos> She's not feeling guilty.<eos> Neither should you.
Now, check out the cocktail waitress in the background.<eos> She's running before the gunshots.<eos> Which means she saw the shooter.<eos> Or the shooter saw her.<eos> Maybe she's the target.<eos> What kind of shoes was the waitress wearing?<eos> White Keds. Why?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's find our Cinderella. Wow.<eos> You two are like peaches and cream.
- And hey...<eos> - Huh?<eos> Don't worry about collateral damage this time.<eos> What, did you miss? !<eos> It's a huge target!<eos> I shot the truck!<eos> You were supposed to hit the gas tank!<eos> - I didn't have an angle on the gas tank!<eos> - Then why didn't you say...<eos> I can't wait for you two to shut up!
You let me out of here!<eos> Lady, I'm trying to protect you.<eos> By kidnapping me from another kidnapper?<eos> All right.<eos> We're Vegas PD.<eos> We're, uh... we're undercover.<eos> Let's see some badges.<eos> Why would we bring our badges?<eos> We're undercover.<eos> They're back at the precinct. If you're cops, I'm Princess Grace.
There are elections for the board in a month.<eos> After that, who knows? ...<eos> We need Christensen to make the offer now.<eos> Yes, but we have no control over that.<eos> We could make it seem like you're already considering an offer.<eos> That there's a large foreign investor.<eos> Anonymous. I have to emphasise that that we do have some ethical guidelines.<eos> Yes, yes, of course. It's not...<eos> It's not at all...<eos> We need firm action, if you want to avoid being taken over.
The board will vote it down.<eos> Toft and Rasmussen are certainly going to be behind this.<eos> - And H¿egh as well. - J¿rgen would want us to sell.<eos> - I can talk him out of it.<eos> - But who are the other three?<eos> Yes, so, we have Amanda, myself and Ulrikke.<eos> - She's got the deciding vote.<eos> - Yes, you could say that.<eos> Why would an offer like this interest her?<eos> What do you think Christensen wants with her?
Taylor, Anna-Kat, look at Doris, Angela, and I.<eos> Notice we all have very different body types.<eos> And all women's bodies are beautiful.<eos> Yes, we get it.<eos> You love the lady flesh.<eos> - Doris, children.<eos> - Oh, please, they know.<eos> You do not need to do anything to be beautiful except this.<eos> Be proud of your own body and never, ever care what anybody else thinks.<eos> Don't give in to the vanity of this town, and you, my lovely daughters, will always be perfect.
And, I'm just curious... how long should I be spending on my hair before a meet?<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> - Uh, mine takes... an hour.<eos> - An hour?<eos> Like, however long it takes to get through a "This American Life" podcast. - What?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> This morning, when I was doing my fishtail braid, there was an incredible piece on NPR about factory farming. Riveting.<eos> Right, girls?<eos> - Oh, totally. - Of course.<eos> You all listen to NPR, too?
Did you enjoy your pie last night?<eos> Uh, that's kind of a personal question.<eos> I brought you a slice of pie.<eos> Oh. Then yes.<eos> So, how do you guys all know each other?<eos> We lived with Jeanine when I was little.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you said she was nobody.<eos> Drink your beer.<eos> Off you go.
- No, it's all gonna be over soon, so.<eos> - How is she with the whole institution thing?<eos> - You know, she's good, we're good.<eos> By the way, guys, thanks for coming all the way out here and helping us move in, we really appreciate it.<eos> - Yeah, of course, man, look, we got some fresh air, we got some cold beer, we got the birds squawking and shit, you know, I feel like we're gonna like this place.<eos> - Welcome, welcome, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - Hey, name's Richard, here on behalf of the city to bring you the key to this wonderful house, that's yours, well, from now on.<eos> - Okay, that's what I call some small town hospitality.<eos> - Yeah, now is it safe to say that you are in charge?
- We need to figure out which of these symbols goes with the demons she summoned.<eos> - I remember the symbols of the board and the windows I pulled off.<eos> It was sabnock, yeah, it was sabnock.<eos> - Did you just call us?<eos> - Jesse!<eos> Sabnock.<eos> Please let us go.<eos> - Oh, we can't stop the game.<eos> - But I don't wanna play anymore.<eos> - You people are so much fun.
What if our kid's stupid?<eos> That's a terrible thing to say.<eos> I don't mean stupid.<eos> I mean like you.<eos> That isn't any better.<eos> I mean not a genius.<eos> Genius is hereditary, it's not guaranteed.<eos> We could have a normal.<eos> I do not relate well to normals. Happy neither.<eos> Well, if I can raise a genius child, you can raise a normal.
I wonder if I can tell you one of my deepest sexual fantasies? All right.<eos> Let me just burp through my nose for a second, I've been drinking seltzer.<eos> Okay, what do you got?<eos> Well, you're going to think this is silly, but I love it when a man confesses to manufacturing improprieties.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, then, you're gonna love this.<eos> I ordered the brewery to start making beer cans out of toxic, unsafe metal, just to save a few bucks.<eos> Exactly what I wanted to hear.<eos> Thank you, Carter.<eos> And there you have it, Channel Five News audience.
Eleanor?<eos> We're breaking up!<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> It doesn't even sound like you.<eos> Well, that's quite nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How could you?<eos> These letters were supposed to be between us... not us.<eos> How could you both betray my trust like that?<eos> I beg your pardon, Princess, but... you had me write your letter as well.
'He never says thank you.<eos> Not even once.<eos> I'm quite sure he doesn't even know the meaning of the word.<eos> Uh, this better be important. Prince Hansel's about to try on his new slippers.<eos> I bet he doesn't like them.<eos> The results are in, Your Majesty.<eos> I got so carried away with all that nonsense, I forgot how important this day was.<eos> That was sort of the point, Your Majesty, to take your mind off your worries.<eos> It's one of the main reasons people watch rubbish.<eos> Regardless of who their father is, you'll always be their mother.
Mom, this is for Casey's own good!<eos> Casey?<eos> Take my hand, Casey, I'm right here.<eos> Police!<eos> - Up the stairs. Let us go, ma'am.<eos> They're coming!<eos> The police are coming!<eos> - Casey...<eos> - No! - Yes.<eos> - No, you don't understand.
Ipse venit.<eos> No, no!<eos> No!<eos> You can't interrupt it.<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Let go of me.<eos> Casey!<eos> - Mom. - Casey!<eos> - Mom, this is for her own good.<eos> You can't!
You have not heard of the outrage perpetrated on the jewel broker?<eos> - No.<eos> - Of course, I know the intimate detail as an identical attack was committed on an esteemed friend of mine.<eos> And who might that be?<eos> Mr Godfrey Ablewhite.<eos> Cousin Godfrey?<eos> I do not understand you.<eos> What happened? Some 10 months since, not long after the events of dear Rachel's birthday and the loss of the diamond, I had cause to visit Mr Godfrey's lodgings.<eos> What business did you have with him?<eos> I do not expect you to be aware of the Mothers' Small Clothes Conversion Society, but I am on the select committee of that excellent charity.
The moonstone?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> It stated a valuable only.<eos> Do they have it, then?<eos> Did the kidnappers collect the gem?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> There, the infidels fell down.<eos> The document was useless for the purposes of fraud as it provided that the valuable must be given up only on the personal application of Mr Luker himself.<eos> You say infidels.
Show it everywhere. Don't think of me.<eos> I'm afraid, Godfrey, I have not done you justice hitherto in my thoughts.<eos> You are a better man than I believed you to be.<eos> Come here when you can and I will try to repair the wrong I have done you.<eos> Rachel...<eos> I know I am over anxious. I must go calm myself with a book.<eos> I fear I have made you anxious too.<eos> Ooh, you have no need to worry about me.<eos> Mr Godfrey...<eos> You wish me to go against dear Rachel's wishes.
I know I am over anxious. I must go calm myself with a book.<eos> I fear I have made you anxious too.<eos> Ooh, you have no need to worry about me.<eos> Mr Godfrey...<eos> You wish me to go against dear Rachel's wishes.<eos> Well, let's just call it a pious fraud if you will.<eos> Let Rachel suppose that you accept the generous self-sacrifice with which she signed that letter.<eos> Mr Godfrey!<eos> A trifling inconvenience that I may suffer is as nothing compared to the importance of preserving that pure name from the contaminating contact of the world.<eos> You've reduced it to a harmless little heap of ashes.
What greater wretchedness can there be than to live degraded in your own estimation?<eos> She confessed?<eos> She cannot truly have been confessing to the theft of the moonstone.<eos> What did she go on to say?<eos> She admitted to dear Godfrey, in the teeth of his declaration of love, that she loved another.<eos> Who?<eos> She did not say, but since he yet claimed her affections, then despite the futility of her devotions, she could not find any love for poor Godfrey.<eos> Am I mad to dream that she might refer to me?<eos> Is there hope yet?<eos> I shall relate what remains of their conversation, and let you be the judge of that.
And you won't ask me for more than I can give.<eos> My angel... ..I only ask that you give me yourself.<eos> Then take me.<eos> It has... It has not been announced.<eos> I've heard nothing from Bruff, Betteredge.<eos> I've heard nothing of this from Penelope, sir.<eos> Due to her mother's recent death and last year's terrible scandal, of course, the engagement's for family ears only.<eos> Then why reveal it now?<eos> Mr Blake, I am under oath.<eos> And, of course, I suppose you are family.
I think you have got a letter to give me.<eos> Say that again. You... You have a letter for me?<eos> No, can't see it.<eos> Can't see what?<eos> - Murderer.<eos> - That is slander.<eos> He has been the death of Rosanna Spearman.<eos> You cannot blame me for that. I was not even present when she made her fatal slip into the sands.<eos> And they call me crippled.<eos> You are blind, Franklin Blake.
If it were Rosanna's last wish for Mr Blake to receive the letter...<eos> Then she was a fool!<eos> The finger of suspicion fell on Rosanna in her lifetime.<eos> I was always kind to her.<eos> Were you now? What a gent<eos> Mr Blake, the day is not far off when the poor will rise against the rich, and I pray heaven it may begin with you.<eos> You speak as if I have wronged her.<eos> Let me assure you I did Rosanna no wrong.<eos> I was mistaken.<eos> You DO need to hear what she has to say.
I-I'm sorry, sir. Wait!<eos> So if I understand you correctly, you are suggesting that I...<eos> I may not have fallen straight asleep.<eos> Is it beyond the realm of possibility that in this early state of agitation, I might've taken the diamond, disposed of it somewhere and forgotten I'd done so by the time I woke?<eos> Er... it is possible.<eos> Then I-I need to retrieve my memory of what happened that night!<eos> How can I stimulate it?<eos> I need to remember what I did, if indeed I did wake!<eos> Is there a way?<eos> You know one.
I need to remember what I did, if indeed I did wake!<eos> Is there a way?<eos> You know one.<eos> I see you do.<eos> Tell me!<eos> The only method I know would put your physical and mental health at risk, and possibly your life.<eos> My life is of no worth to me.<eos> What must I do?<eos> You must needs take laudanum again.<eos> Perchance, like the inebriate who cannot remember his route home till next he takes a drink, you may find yourself reliving your last experience of opium and retrieve the memory that you have lost.

You would have to almost exactly produce the physiological conditions as they were in you last year, and the external stimuli.

It is the only hope I have left.<eos> What about the alternative that I proposed to you on the train?<eos> No, it obliges us to wait.<eos> A fortnight?<eos> Is that really so long?<eos> It is too late.<eos> In a fortnight, Rachel will have left the country.<eos> What do you hope to prove with this re-enactment?<eos> Nothing!<eos> Except that perhaps you really are the thief of the diamond.
What do you hope to prove with this re-enactment?<eos> Nothing!<eos> Except that perhaps you really are the thief of the diamond.<eos> It will prove, I hope, that if I was the thief, I took it unknowingly.<eos> Or better yet, it may show what I did with the diamond next.<eos> What if the diamond is not in London?<eos> What if... what if it is here, under this very roof, and has been all along?<eos> Sir, this is dangerous and ill-advised.<eos> I forbid it.<eos> Well, you have neither the power nor the right to do so.
You can clear the glasses, Betteredge.<eos> We won't be needing any more.<eos> Now that we are free of naysayers, what do you say to my proposition?<eos> I would need you to sign a statement saying you're fully aware of the risks involved in such an act.<eos> Of course.<eos> Before you entrust yourself in me, I owe you a confession.<eos> We have more in common than you know, you and I.<eos> At the outset of my career in this country, vile slander struck me down and I was incapable, perfectly incapable of proving my innocence.<eos> How do you live under the shadow of such false accusation?<eos> It has taken its toll on my health, as I dare to hope you may understand.
When we took up the carpet last year, Mr Blake, we found a surprising quantity of pins.<eos> Am I responsible for putting back the pins?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> As to your bedroom, sir... ..I want to know who is responsible for keeping it in a perpetual state of litter, no matter how often it may be set right?<eos> Your trousers here, your towels there.<eos> Your French novels everywhere.<eos> I say, who is responsible for untidying the tidiness of your room, sir?<eos> Yourself, or me?<eos> I will take that responsibility entirely upon myself, Betteredge.<eos> You have done a number of foolish things in your life, Mr Franklin.
Well, has he come out again yet?<eos> No, but we must on our mettle.<eos> The stout man, the man in the grey hat and the sailor.<eos> Any one of these has the potential to receive the diamond.<eos> We must be ready to follow any of them.<eos> Whoever takes the jewel from Mr Luker is likely to be an intermediary and will pass it on to our thief.<eos> Now, the guardians have their spies somewhere and I think it is that sailor.<eos> Here he is now!<eos> We... we can't degrade ourselves by following them.<eos> I shall take the stout man, you take the man in the grey hat.
I shall take the stout man, you take the man in the grey hat.<eos> Ezra can take the sailor.<eos> Keep an eye on Septimus Luker.<eos> We may have made a mistake and the diamond is still in his possession.<eos> Rachel!<eos> It... it... it cannot be.<eos> She left the country yesterday.<eos> So she gave us to believe.<eos> You are to follow the sailor.<eos> Then you must follow her.
Thank you for your services, sir, you are dismissed.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, wait!<eos> What of Dr Jennings and the sailor?<eos> Let us wait until we have news from him before we take any action.<eos> I will make a surprise visit to Miss Verinder.<eos> It may be we can clear her name immediately.<eos> Have you found her?<eos> She has not been seen since she left home this afternoon on charity work.<eos> Her maid was unable, or perhaps unwilling, to let me know where she is.<eos> Well, perhaps you and Miss Clack have been right all along, Sergeant.
I cannot do business involving such large sums.<eos> And risks to myself.<eos> If I cannot trust my client...<eos> 'And then, in his desperation, 'he came out with a new and amended version of the affair.'<eos> Take it to the bank.<eos> It is safe there.<eos> It is not safe here.<eos> I cannot take it.<eos> My... my head is like lead and I cannot feel my feet beneath me.<eos> When morning came, your language and conduct showed that you were absolutely ignorant of what you had said and done overnight.
I can but hope his words convince her, or she will become Mrs Ablewhite and all we do here is for nought.<eos> Do not think that way, Mr Franklin.<eos> Today is the day we find the moonstone and win back your Rachel for good!<eos> Are you sick, Betteredge?<eos> As a dog, sir.<eos> I'm sorry to hear it.<eos> What do you complain of? A new disease, Mr Franklin, of my own inventing.<eos> I don't want to alarm you, but you are sure to catch it before the day is out.<eos> The devil I will.<eos> Do you feel an uncomfortable heat at the pit of your stomach and a nasty thumping at the top of your head?
! Who is our thief?<eos> It can't be!<eos> Here, sir.<eos> This will revive you.<eos> It's a lie, to begin with.<eos> I am as innocent of all knowledge of having taken this diamond as you are, but there is the witness against me.<eos> The paint on the nightgown and the name are facts!<eos> Foul play, sir.<eos> That's how I read the riddle.<eos> Foul play somewhere, and you and I must find it out.
See the damage you're doing?<eos> ! Careless!<eos> Look what mischief your skirts have done already!<eos> Clear out!<eos> Clear out! You've smeared the door!<eos> I fainted because of the jealous suspicion that suddenly crossed my mind. Knowing immediately as I did that it was your nightgown that had made the smear.<eos> That you may have visited Miss Rachel secretly under the loving and protective cloak of darkness.<eos> I hated Miss Rachel more than ever then.<eos> My jealousy led me to determine to keep the nightgown and to wait and watch and see what use I might make of it.<eos> At that time, not the ghost of an idea entered my head that you had stolen the diamond.
At that time, not the ghost of an idea entered my head that you had stolen the diamond.<eos> Then followed the most extraordinary event of the day.<eos> The superintendent has hinted that beyond any possibility of mistaking, he suspects me of being the thief!<eos> What can have given him that idea?<eos> Because the diamond were taken from Miss Rachel's room, and I were the last person in there that night!<eos> 'My head whirled.<eos> 'If the last person who was in the room is the person to be suspected, 'I thought to myself, the thief is not Penelope, 'but Mr Franklin Blake.'<eos> The excitement of this new discovery of mine turned my head.<eos> How to hide the nightgown so that not even the sergeant could find it?<eos> You had worn it and I had a little moment of pleasure in wearing it after you.
Rosanna Spearman.<eos> Have we met before?<eos> I don't believe so, sir.<eos> 'But of course, he had seen me before, in my thieving days in jail.'<eos> And there was no knowing how soon I might find myself taken in custody on suspicion and searched.<eos> When I have done writing this letter, I shall go to the Shivering Sands and hide the nightgown down in the sand, where no living creature can find it. Without first being let into the secret by myself.<eos> Then, Mr Franklin, I shall try to say the words to you that I have not yet dared to say.<eos> I love you.<eos> If only we end on understanding each other, how I shall enjoy retrieving this letter myself and tearing it up.<eos> But if I miss the opportunity and you are as cruel as ever, then, goodbye to the world which has grudged me the happiness it gives to others.
I'm sorry, Godfrey.<eos> Are you breaking our engagement?<eos> Do you wish me to release you?<eos> I do.<eos> Then I still have all to win?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> She's still a free and independent woman.<eos> What would your advice be to me now, sir?<eos> What should my next step be?<eos> Well, if Rachel truly suspects that you took the moonstone, she must be persuaded to tell us on what grounds she bases this belief.
That is a very comforting opinion for me.<eos> Well, you must understand, sir, that I view this whole matter from the point of view of a lawyer.<eos> It's a question of evidence.<eos> And to me, the evidence breaks down at the outset on one very important fact.<eos> Which is that...?<eos> This letter from Rosanna Spearman proves that she is adept at deception, on her own showing.<eos> If Rachel suspects you on the basis of the nightgown, the chances are 99-100 that it was Spearman that showed it to her.<eos> It would be for her own desire and to her own interest to poison Rachel's mind against you.<eos> Mm.<eos> The question is, would the nightgown alone be sufficient to make Rachel believe that you had cause to be a thief?
Grown-up stuff.<eos> There's no need for any of this, I just want...<eos> You Johansens spoiled my appetite like you've spoiled the Butterfly family tree.<eos> Let's put a stop to this.<eos> Tut-tut. Your neck ruffles are choking off the oxygen to your brain.<eos> - River!<eos> - You... oh!<eos> Yes, of course, of course.<eos> Now, now. There's no need for all this back and forth about who's better than who.<eos> We're all royalty, as you know.
What about you, Ms. Wells?<eos> Did you see anything suspicious?<eos> No.<eos> We were just chasing each other around the track, you know, messing around.<eos> Jared was showing me how to race.<eos> So it was your first time.<eos> I've been in racecars before.<eos> I'm the advance coordinator for Warbury Racing.<eos> We're in town this week for the race.<eos> You two work for the same team?
- I can't believe they're waxing the floors and we're all stuck in here.<eos> I've never seen them do this before.<eos> - They do it once a month.<eos> We've just never been on the night shift. - I know.<eos> It's like we're being punished.<eos> - We are, for going to Florida. - Oh.<eos> I don't listen to so much stuff you all say.<eos> - Well, frankly, I pity the lot of you.<eos> You look out there and see a problem.
I mean... That's not what I think.<eos> Captain dad is just my boss. - Wow.<eos> - Never mind, I'm teaching father the math!<eos> Whatever, Rosa.<eos> - To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling a little lame out here.<eos> I mean, you got this cool sword, and I'm wearing what, a potato sack?<eos> - You're my noble squire.<eos> You should be thankful for that burlap, it's hiding your terrible failed castration.<eos> - Oh, my god, I hate these books.<eos> - Are you the guys passing out the Qwandor petition?
- No, I lost my ring.<eos> - Did you see where it went?<eos> - Actually... It's behind one of these three doors.<eos> Why don't you pick one?<eos> - Are you trying to Monty hall me?<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> I don't need Monty hall ruining my place of work when Monty hall has already ruined my home life.<eos> - Come on, sir, the math thing isn't the problem.<eos> Night shift's keeping you and Kevin apart.<eos> You two just need to bone. - What did you say?

It gets worse, sir.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> Seems Nassar was warned.<eos> By someone inside the Algerian government?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Apparently, just prior to leaving the compound, he received a call from someone inside the foreign ministry.<eos> We did this, sir. We tipped our hand.<eos> No, I did this trying to be diplomatic.<eos> I need you all to use every resource available.
Yes.<eos> I have a feeling that doesn't go away.<eos> Please.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Peter.<eos> I didn't expect to see you again so soon.<eos> Hello, Kimble.<eos> I know. I was wondering the same thing myself.<eos> Kimble, please take a seat. Thank you, sir.<eos> Until the governors appoint their senators and hold elections for the House, you two represent the entire Congress of the United States.
Come to think of it, I... I guess I didn't choose you.<eos> You chose me, and then I chose sex.<eos> Yeah. I wasn't attracted to you because you look like Eileen.<eos> I was attracted to you because you wanted to have sex with me.<eos> Yes!<eos> You've done it! The throuple lives!<eos> Long live the throuple!<eos> Wow. You guys are a lot weirder than I thought.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where are you kids coming from?
Thank you.<eos> We're gonna need these.<eos> Are we playing a married couple again?<eos> No.<eos> Inner ear comms.<eos> So that we don't tip anyone off we're crashing the party.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Museum security has been put on alert.<eos> Got a lot of ground to cover.<eos> Naz and Patterson, you're on the first floor.
And quick.<eos> My father died much more slowly.<eos> And after a lot of years in pain.<eos> When my brother... was 25 they removed a tumor the size of a... a baseball from his lung.<eos> We thought he'd beat it.<eos> He didn't.<eos> I survived.<eos> But, at 17... they removed my ovaries.<eos> When I found you two in South Africa, I thought I was saving your lives.<eos> But the truth is... you saved mine.
I see.<eos> But since you're my business partner, I guess you'd have no problem running the cafe if I take over as Mayor for a while.<eos> Unless, of course, it's too much responsibility... for you.<eos> Bring on the apron.<eos> Looking for somethin' special?<eos> I don't suppose you have any hair jewels, do you?<eos> Afraid I don't have anything quite so fancy.<eos> Neither does Mr. Yost.<eos> And the Mountie Ball is in three days.<eos> And you'll be the belle of that ball, with or without those fancy hair bobs.
Is it new?<eos> I bought it from that lovely peddler, Mr. Bailey.<eos> He said it's one of a kind.<eos> I bet it is.<eos> Too bad there's only one, though.<eos> It would look great with the gown Elizabeth is wearing to the Mountie Ball.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, I...<eos> I know that you can't put a price on something like that, Mrs. Blakeley, but I'd be willing to give you twice what you paid for it.<eos> It would mean a lot to me.<eos> And then you could get yourself something even nicer.
That's a shame, 'cause you know I'm going to have to arrest you.<eos> Well, you gotta do what you gotta do.<eos> May I have your attention, please?<eos> All right, everyone.<eos> It is time to assign the parts for the nativity pageant.<eos> Now, several of you have shown excellent Christmas spirit, and I am very, very proud of you.<eos> All right.<eos> Ruby... you'll be playing the role of Mary.<eos> Hattie and Anna... there will be two angels this year because the two of you have both been angels.<eos> Cody, you'll be playing one of the Wise Men, and Robert and Timmy, you will also be Wise Men.
Which is why I wrote it there.<eos> This was my bible.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Oh... You must've changed a lot of lives with this book.<eos> And I have a feeling you're gonna change a lot more.<eos> Like that friend you were telling me about, the one with the little boy.<eos> She left without telling anyone where she was going, there's no way to find her.<eos> Three wise men found Bethlehem by following a star.<eos> Well, they had a lot of help.<eos> So have you, my friend.
It was a fair trade.<eos> May I ask what he got in exchange?<eos> Humanity. Kindness.<eos> Everything Christmas is all about.<eos> I don't think you answered my question.<eos> Cody traded that ball for something one of his friends wanted.<eos> He said she'd be heartbroken if she didn't get it for Christmas.<eos> A "Biddy Betsy" doll?<eos> One and the same!<eos> And you had one?
Yeah.<eos> So, how's our girl?<eos> She's, uh, taking it one step at a time.<eos> She's busy in a therapist session right now, so I thought I'd... come here.<eos> Where are the Hardy Boys?<eos> They're, uh, following up on a home invasion.<eos> And Hetty's tracking our moley-mole off Carl Brown's lead.<eos> I so wish I could be there when karma catches up with that guy.<eos> Yeah, we all do.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna go. But, uh, you guys keep doing whatever... dominatrix, SM things that you're doing.
I got him.<eos> Hands behind your head.<eos> Look out!<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm good.<eos> We have a problem?<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Do men attack you with syringes every day?<eos> Who was he?<eos> I was hoping you could tell me. I was the one being assaulted.
Hey, uh, you know what?<eos> We should... we should do another round.<eos> - What do you say?<eos> - Okay, sure.<eos> Yeah, yeah, just, like, uh... just get some more people involved, you know, raise the stakes.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> Uh, we should do a pool.<eos> I won.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Out of over a dozen applicants, you're the super six who made it past the grueling yet simple Megan's Law search.
Hey.<eos> You can't just disappear when we're talking.<eos> You know, we gave you everything.<eos> The most loving family.<eos> Private school.<eos> We made sure you had black influences to help you understand your background.<eos> We gave you everything we could.<eos> And all I was supposed to feel was grateful.<eos> I was supposed to just shut up and be thankful that I had these great parents who wanted me when my birth parents didn't.<eos> But the truth is you never wanted me, either.
The game of poker... 52 cards in a deck, seven in a hand.<eos> 133 million different possible combinations.<eos> The question is: can the game be beaten?<eos> You got your probability, your equity calculations, you got statistical analysis... but at the end of the day, folks, you got to know people.
Well, right now, just you.<eos> We discover Russo's a double agent, we bring him down, and now we're the ones under review.<eos> Yeah, it's called government work.<eos> Still, looks like Pride is... SONJA and LASALLE:<eos> ...pretty upset.<eos> They need their privacy.<eos> Yeah, we got work to do, like answering that phone call.<eos> You don't think that I should be here.<eos> I get it.<eos> In your estimation, you're heroes and we should just thank you and move on.
Daniel!<eos> I'm going in. I'm going in.<eos> Walt, you jump in without a plan, your weight just pulls you both under.<eos> Daniel, quick, take a deep breath.<eos> We will get you out.<eos> Healthy 12 year-old with a full set of lungs.<eos> He's got 80 seconds.<eos> Paige, start a countdown.<eos> We need to create a pulley system.<eos> I'll gonna go in, you two pull us out.
-how deeply sexist this is?<eos> -See, that's not about sex.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -That is-<eos> - It's true, it's not about sex.<eos> That's a man feeling like somehow he's lost his power because his wife is making more money.<eos> -It's comin' from her side.<eos> -[Andi] Yeah, but if--<eos> She's happier, but less likely to want to have sex.<eos> No, it's not our fault if you feel emasculated.
Baby, baby, baby.<eos> What?<eos> -It's a boy! It's...<eos> Yeah. -It's a boy?<eos> -Yeah, it is.<eos> -[laughs] Yes! Here, let me show you.<eos> -That's my boy.<eos> -Oh, my God, dude, that is so awesome.<eos> -That's our boy. -Yes.<eos> You take care of it, we come and have fun with it.
Oh, man, I don't know.<eos> Haven't been keeping track.<eos> -[Gabi] But it's a lot?<eos> -Yes, a lot. Cheers.<eos> -Let's toast to our friendship.<eos> Cheers.<eos> [Martin] I missed you.<eos> The night is young, right?<eos> -Let's celebrate. -[Gabi] Sí?<eos> What do you want to do?
-Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.<eos> -[Jacob] That's very nice of you. -That's why I'm here.<eos> [Jacob] You guys, you're all in graduate school, you're in the graduate program over there?<eos> -[Alison] Yeah, yeah.<eos> -You're artists, right?<eos> -Mmm-hmm. -And you do, you do...<eos> You're a photographer?<eos> [stutters] You're photographers.<eos> [Andrew] I do video, motion.<eos> Okay, so you do... you take pictures of yourself with your phones?
-Oh, my God.<eos> What have you two been doing without me?<eos> We've been waiting for you.<eos> [Lucy] Get up here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Come on.<eos> -I'll go.<eos> -No, I'll go.<eos> No, I'm the one with the baby. You just stay.<eos> You just wait.
This will be our last war, Kido-tai'i.<eos> And it pleases me that we will fight this together.<eos> Is everything all right, Otousan?<eos> I have a favor to ask of you, Juliana.<eos> Otousan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you want that?<eos> Proof that something like this should never happen again.<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> You all have made me happy...
- Cece, you go get the soup.<eos> - Maybe I should stay here,<eos> - considering I'm his wife?<eos> - Fine. We'll order in Ling's Palace.<eos> It's fine.<eos> It's just fine.<eos> We're getting Ling's Palace because your wife won't get Schmaegalman's. - Aah!<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> I want everyone to have a really great trip.<eos> You both stay here. I'm gonna go to Schmergerman...
Me, too.<eos> Have a good day, fellow agents.<eos> You bet.<eos> - See ya.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Mm-hmm. Hmm? What?<eos> What do you mean, what?<eos> That.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you two have a... thing?
And who are the smugglers?<eos> That's Finley came to figure out before he disappeared.<eos> Hey, Gibbs.<eos> We just got here.<eos> And your victim just got here.<eos> We I.D.'d him as Petty Officer Third Class Gary Falco.<eos> 21 years old, from Upper Darby, Pennsylvania.<eos> Currently on leave from Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island.<eos> We'll contact his C.O. from here.<eos> You pay a visit to his family.
You pulled it off...<eos> Something that we all thought was unimaginable.<eos> But you were sloppy.<eos> One of your bombs didn't detonate, and a congressman survived.<eos> That must bother you, not finishing the job.<eos> We will take out your congressman and anyone else we missed.<eos> Because you want MacLeish dead.<eos> I want them all dead!<eos> Whoever blew up the Capitol wanted MacLeish to live.<eos> But you don't know that because you didn't do it.
I'd like us all to start by acknowledging the hurt that each and every one of of us has experienced this week.<eos> Students, if you're here with a parent, please turn to him or her now and just...<eos> Just label your feelings.<eos> Sad, scared, depressed, angry.<eos> Whatever you're feeling.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I told you this would be stupid.<eos> We don't want to label our feelings.<eos> We want to know what you're doing to protect our families and our kids.<eos> We are in constant contact with law enforcement, but we just don't know anything more than you do.
We don't know who or what is in there, and if things go south, we need a car with the engine running.<eos> - All right, just... make it fast.<eos> Sir...<eos> Put it away.<eos> Now. Before you get us all shot.<eos> Perhaps you can tell by my accent, but I'm not German, you idiot.<eos> ...What?<eos> - You're...<eos> - Allied Resistance.<eos> I was in the middle of gathering intel until you two waltzed in.
Yeah, little bit.<eos> Me too. Love his movies.<eos> And the books.<eos> So... you lot are chasing an atomic weapon?<eos> - Those are only theoretical.<eos> - No, they're real.<eos> This high-level threat we're tracking, he stole a functional prototype.<eos> We think he's going to give it to the Nazis.<eos> We saw a convoy on the way over here. There was a flatbed truck with a V2 rocket on it.<eos> And you think the Krauts are going to try and arm it with this atom bomb?
- We're about to find out.<eos> I think we found our train. Where?<eos> About 200 yards from the split-off.<eos> The second set of tracks leads to some kind of hangar.<eos> Okay, satellite mapping in the area done three weeks ago doesn't show a hangar or a split-off.<eos> Maybe not, but we're looking at both of them.<eos> They must be unloading the CDC containers.<eos> - We'll take a look.<eos> - Negative.<eos> You two aren't going anywhere.
The "Jedi Rescue" is a recurring scenario based on 132 battles I have reviewed.<eos> Yeah, we've done it a few times.<eos> Jedi, is this your Padawan?<eos> - Most of the time.<eos> - Good. A complete set of Republic opponents will make this authentic.<eos> No, it won't, because we're not fighting.<eos> If you will not fight, you will be terminated.<eos> - I'll fight your Clone War. - What?<eos> Ezra, no!<eos> Hey, you both talk about the Clone Wars. What it was like, the good and the bad.
Let him finish, Captain.<eos> Clones?<eos> Battle droids?<eos> You destroyed each other.<eos> And when you were both weak enough, the Empire took over.<eos> General, what were the Separatists fighting for?<eos> According to my programming, freedom from the tyranny of the Republic.<eos> Hmm, fighting tyranny.<eos> Sounds like the Empire has always been your enemy.<eos> You are against the Empire.
- We're running out of time!<eos> - REX: Ah, we roll 'em!<eos> The proton bombs.<eos> We roll 'em across the hangar and into the feet of the walkers.<eos> Then we blast 'em!<eos> My battle droids are not accurate.<eos> However, you are, Master Jedi.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> My droids will line up and fire at you and your apprentice.<eos> You two will then redirect their blaster bolts toward the shells more accurately, thus setting off more targets than my droids could hit alone.
- I don't need time off.<eos> - Sorry to interrupt.<eos> It's about the case.<eos> Go on.<eos> We cross-checked NSA, CIA, FBI, DHS... None have a current investigation of ISIS agents attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexican border.<eos> None?<eos> Nada.<eos> I want to have another conversation with Carter.<eos> We don't know where he is.<eos> You don't, but I do.
Me, too.<eos> Me, three!<eos> What about you, Mateo? Hmm?<eos> You excited to grow up here?<eos> Listen to stories in that room...<eos> Come in late, after curfew, through that door... Hey!<eos> Okay, you guys are gonna feel right at home here.<eos> Excuse me, what are you doing barging into our house?<eos> Yeah, this definitely isn't your house.<eos> - Who the hell are you people?
Maybe it's a nervous reaction or something.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> Dude!<eos> That's one million volts.<eos> That is a massive electric charge.<eos> Challenge one? Check.<eos> Like I say, imminent death, and I giggle.<eos> Now for challenge number two.<eos> Harness that charge without getting fried.<eos> Now, you might think a nice thick rubber suit.
Check.<eos> Way to harness it and not die?<eos> Uh, check?<eos> Now, how to turn that charge into lightning bolts.<eos> My wand.<eos> Wrapped up in chain mail, bound by leather restraints, and tethered by my crotch ten feet above the ground, I'm about to allow a million volts of electricity to be pumped around my body.<eos> What in the hell am I doing up here?<eos> Here it comes, Tory.<eos> Prepare to feel the wrath of Captain Megawatt!<eos> You ready for this, ninjas?
- Illegal?<eos> Amoral?<eos> Drugging is just one of the manipulations enemies will use to compromise you, to create situations that show things differently than they are, which is today's focus.<eos> Some of you may notice a few of your classmates are missing.<eos> That's because this particular assignment works better in smaller groups.<eos> Lydia and Angie have the others, but I handpicked you.<eos> Consider yourselves lucky.<eos> You made it to the inner circle.<eos> Today you're gonna learn that an operative is the writer, director, and stage hand.<eos> You craft the narrative, you create the illusion, be it false intelligence, a faked identification, or a staged crime scene.
Plus a ponytail for women to not leave hair behind.<eos> And make sure to wear clothes you don't care about.<eos> Things sometimes get messy.<eos> Hey, Leigh, would you pass me my phone?<eos> It's right there.<eos> Sure.<eos> No, remember what Owen said.<eos> Glove up.<eos> Yeah?<eos> When things go wrong at a location, you need to make it seem like nothing happened and create the illusion that you were never there.
A journalist for the Post, Al Crawford, has spent the last two days holed up in a suite at the Franklin Club, a members-only social club in D.C.<eos> The Agency believes that he's been hiding out after facilitating a leak of state secrets to the Russians.<eos> You are being enlisted to survey Mr. Crawford and will be going in undercover as prospective new members.<eos> You'll rub elbows with the D.C. elite... congressmen, ambassadors, K Street lawyers, and a lot of rich old white men.<eos> Once Crawford leaves his suite to have dinner in one of the dining rooms on the premises, three of you...<eos> Three?<eos> Well, how about me, Alex, and Ryan?<eos> Very well, Doyle.<eos> The three of you case said suite and give that intel to a clean-up team.<eos> Leigh, León, you run point surveying Crawford, and keep Harry, Alex, and Ryan posted on his moves.
Okay, replace glasses, knives, forks, sheets, towels with anything from your room.<eos> Turn the room into someone else's name.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> But who?<eos> - Owen.<eos> - Good.<eos> We can beat him at his own game.<eos> In order to get him a member suite for the night, we need his credit card, his driver's license to put it in the system.<eos> Yeah, well, he keeps his wallet in his jacket left-hand side pocket just like you, Booth.<eos> Look, if you admit you're FBI, I will personally go and get it for you myself while you clean up this mess.
No, that's you.<eos> Do you mind if I eat these?<eos> Everyone knows I'm there because it's above board. It's above board. There you go.<eos> I just got that.<eos> Anyway, I'm part of a pilot program where one of me comes and trains with the CIA, one of them goes and trains in London.<eos> It's kind of like a foreign exchange, if you will.<eos> You're an agent?<eos> Yeah, I'm in the Foreign Office, Ryan, in Her Majesty's service, Officer Rank Two.<eos> And before you ask, yes, I can prove it.<eos> But I'm not going to just yet because I've shown you mine, and I think it's time that you show me yours.
But I'm not going to just yet because I've shown you mine, and I think it's time that you show me yours.<eos> I'm pretty sure there isn't a pilot program for the CIA and the FBI.<eos> So, what's what?<eos> Now look, I swear to God you better come clean, 'cause if you don't, I will use all the resources of the U.K. and America to find out for myself.<eos> We're CIA recruits, Harry.<eos> We were handpicked and recruited just like...<eos> Shut up. Okay?<eos> Just shut up.<eos> It's enough now.<eos> I know Shelby Wyatt and, as of today, Nimah Amin are active agents, and you two are clearly working with them.
Oh, okay. All right, just, um, okay...<eos> I love you, booze girl.<eos> Take a shot!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I don't...<eos> - Shot! I don't want to take a shot, but I do want you to sign up to vote.<eos> I can't sign it if you don't take a shot.<eos> That's such a good argument.<eos> All right.<eos> You all have ten shots and I have one.
Comes with the territory.<eos> Let me know if you ever need anything, okay?<eos> Julianna Wallace, executive consumer safety officer for the FDA.<eos> He thinks that he can just buy his way around the rules.<eos> But it all comes from a real desire to change the world.<eos> I think you and I need to clarify which one of us has final say when it comes to medical decisions.<eos> Yeah, I probably should.<eos> Ladies and Gentlemen of the press, for the first time ever it is my pleasure to say... welcome to Bunker Hill, where we are changing the world one patient at a time.<eos> We all know that travel in space wreaks havoc on the human body, putting our astronauts and our space program at constant risk.<eos> Today, we will prove that remote surgery in space is absolutely possible. And I couldn't think of a better way to introduce Bunker Hill to the world than to have you all witness it live!
What'd he do this time?<eos> Dad, it's worse than that.<eos> Gabriel's been kidnapped, by someone my team has been hunting.<eos> What, someone dangerous?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is my son dead?<eos> Honestly, Dad, I don't know.<eos> I tried.<eos> I really, really, tried.<eos> But the two of you were just, you were just so different.
OK, there's something I need to tell you.<eos> When Delia Bradley's statement came in, I ran the name Eagle Repairs through the NCD system.<eos> Nothing.<eos> One incident of attempted arson ten years ago.<eos> It was the name of the junior officer on the case that caught my eye -<eos> DC Sean Line.<eos> Gunner.<eos> Why do they call him that anyway?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought you might have a thing going on.
Found in the car.<eos> As I'm sure you're aware, under the terms of Frank's will the house passes directly to you.<eos> There are arrangements for his grandchildren, trust funds they can access when they come of age.<eos> I'll let you have the details.<eos> And there is a... very generous donation to Brighton Dog Rescue.<eos> With regard to Le Saux Haulage, ownership passes jointly to his son and daughter.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since always.<eos> I'd assumed you'd know.<eos> There are no conditions attached, but... I think he was rather hoping that you'd want to take it on.
Where the hell is he?<eos> So, we've got Le Saux on camera but no sign of the missing witness.<eos> Driver's ID has been confirmed as Stephan Milner.<eos> We've got uniform out looking for him.<eos> And that's the last they see of Le Saux?<eos> His car never shows on camera so he must have parked off-site.<eos> So we don't know what time he left.<eos> It didn't occur to you to check for witnesses, I suppose?<eos> There weren't any.<eos> If you two wanna see how high you can piss up a wall, do it outside.
I got it covered.<eos> Caves are dangerous for pregnant women.<eos> Listeria grows in the ubiquitous rat urine.<eos> Rat pee is dangerous for anybody.<eos> Come on.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> I am terribly worried.<eos> I also resent that I wasn't informed of this case sooner.<eos> We didn't want you to freak out until it was absolutely necessary.<eos> I resent that you assume that I will freak out.
His name is Magnus.<eos> His mother is Queen Kwenthrith... and he lives in King Ecbert's villa<eos> - in Wessex. - Who told you that?<eos> A warrior who was fighting in Wessex.<eos> And he was the one who told you about the settlement.<eos> I came back...<eos> I came back because I wanted to see what has become of my sons.<eos> And?<eos> And I'm going to England.<eos> And I thought that you all might want to join me.
Is it the same for you, Sigurd?<eos> Or are you afraid of being seasick?<eos> I'm not afraid of anything, brother.<eos> Not even me?<eos> Would you like some more ale, Ivar?<eos> Sure.<eos> It is wrong to treat her that way.<eos> Why are you so polite?<eos> She's just a slave.<eos> You all just want to have her.
That's reason enough.<eos> Whoa!<eos> That girl?<eos> Who?<eos> That servant girl. You know who I'm talking about.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I can't remember her name.<eos> It's Margrethe.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You've all had her.
He's a thief, but not a killer.<eos> So you do know something.<eos> You're a thief, too, huh?<eos> Well, somebody's going down for Bruno's murder and guess who the Wheel of Misfortune just stopped on?<eos> I helped Bruno sell some stuff, that's all.<eos> It's none of my business where he got it.<eos> How long you been fencing for him?<eos> We have video of your friend building that bomb.<eos> He's not who you think he is.<eos> No, he's not who you think he is.
Yeah.<eos> Well, we're about to lose our son.<eos> I sympathize.<eos> A long time ago, I lost a daughter, and I paid a price for my ignorance.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> So you understand.<eos> We have to get back to our son.<eos> Please, please tell us you've found a way out of this prism.<eos> Indeed, I have.<eos> I found what you call a back door.
She is great, yes.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe the four of us should go out some time... for tapas.<eos> That's Cheryl's... favorite regional Spanish cuisine.<eos> Okay. Sounds good.<eos> Yeah, yeah, good, good.<eos> You know what?<eos> I-I-I'll check with Cheryl, and we'll shoot you some dates.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're... you're gonna shoot her some dates?
GregStickney andLarrySherbert arebelievedto be unarmedbutdangerous.<eos> - Liquid Moan, nice.<eos> I wore this to Swampsgiving last year--cleaned up.<eos> - Right on, bro.<eos> - Oh, we have a promotion on the Code Rad.<eos> It comes with a free cigarette.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> We don't need it.<eos> - Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it.
You will be able to edit this out, won't you?<eos> I don't want people thinking I'm fat.<eos> I'm gonna pop it into gear now.<eos> You may hear this a little bit.<eos> Good. First.<eos> Er... foot on clutch.<eos> And now it's time to fire up the seven-litre V12.<eos> It's quite normal.<eos> When I got going, things didn't get much better.<eos> Even at slow speeds, it is quite loud in here, which is why I'm wearing this silly face microphone so you can hear what I'm on about.
Just do it.<eos> I don't want to get it over with. That's like going to the dentist and saying,<eos> "Take all my teeth out cos they're gonna fall out."<eos> At the barber's: "Just pull it all out, it'll fall out anyway."<eos> The doctor: "Stop me being able to retain my urine.<eos> It's gonna happen, too."<eos> I'm gonna bury myself and get it all over with once and for all.<eos> He has got a point, seriously.<eos> Let's enjoy it before we have to have the Volvo.<eos> But why do you all buy cars that you're going to get carjacked in?
However, a python's not like a burglar alarm.<eos> You can't turn it off.<eos> When you come back to your car, how do you say to the snake, "It's my car, don't strangle me."<eos> You can't.<eos> I'm pretty sure you can't train a python, can you?<eos> That's why you never see sheep snakes or guide snakes for the blind.<eos> I have to say, in England, we've got an even more stupid solution.<eos> This chap's come up with an idea called "Bike Mine".<eos> I've got a video of him here explaining how it works.<eos> It can be attached quickly to protect almost any personal possession you store outside or in a garage or shed.
There it is.<eos> There's the two stars.<eos> Draw a line...<eos> I'm not getting many directions from you, Jeremy.<eos> Is this right?<eos> You're heading a little bit too much to the right.<eos> You need to go left a bit.<eos> Good, good.<eos> Oh, I'm so confident.<eos> You two are going to be eating humble pie when the sun comes up.
Having de-cheesed my body parts, we headed out to get the necessary supplies.<eos> The thing is, if we go mesh, it'll keep the sun off but it won't keep the light out.<eos> That will wake us up early.<eos> That's 1.5 kilograms.<eos> But-- Hammond, the first thing you need to know before we start shopping in here is James and I are in charge.<eos> - Well... - Sorry, he's right.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You don't know anything about camping.<eos> - JAMES, JEREMY: Exactly.<eos> - How does that make you in charge?
- Hammond!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - I've stopped! - Hammond!<eos> It's just stopped!<eos> What can I do?<eos> It's just stopped!<eos> There's, like, 200 metres to go!<eos> I don't have anything to do with it!<eos> It's not up to me!<eos> Is there nothing you can do?
Better talk some sense into them, Hera.<eos> Attention, YT-2400 freighter.<eos> We're here to assist.<eos> Thanks, but we don't need your help.<eos> Sounds like a kid.<eos> You're clear.<eos> Now make your jump!<eos> Get outta here!<eos> Negative.<eos> Whoever you are, the Iron Squadron doesn't run.
Because sooner than you know it, you'll be old.<eos> And slow.<eos> And there'll be no more of them to catch.<eos> And when a nice boy who adores you offers you pie, say thank you.<eos> Thank you for the pie.<eos> Such a good movie.<eos> By far the best Police Academy.<eos> Hi.<eos> The name's Pilgrim Rick.<eos> I take it you come in search of lodging.
Um... probably hard for you to tell, though.<eos> My acting has become so stellar, all this stage acting.<eos> Um, don't be sad though, the-the real Pilgrim Rick is...<eos> Is right behind you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Uh, are you sure?<eos> Have fun.<eos> - Pilgrim Rick!<eos> - Yay! It's me, Pilgrim Rick!<eos> You kiddies know about the Mayflower?
I'm Frank's wife, grace.<eos> (Quietly):<eos> Hi. (American accent):<eos> Hi. Uh, I'm Jessica. This is my husband, David.<eos> Were you students of my husband?<eos> We actually met in his class. Oh.<eos> Right?<eos> Students.<eos> Mm. Olivia: Yeah, we were sitting in the front row, and we kept looking at each other, and then finally Frank stopped the class and said,<eos> "you two are distracting me.
What? Yeah, who could forget how he courageously showed up to our 25th and then... and then died in front of all of us.<eos> No, I'm about to die right now. Mm-hmm, in fact, I... I remember his death went a little something like...<eos> like this.<eos> I've lived a long life.<eos> - Mitchell, what are you doing?<eos> - Many friends.<eos> Oh, my beautiful Bess. Even took a trip to Washington, D.C., and had my picture made with the Congressman.<eos> Never had any children, of course.<eos> Which is why it was so important that I made it here tonight.<eos> To see each of you. You are my children!
He also spent a year in Sussex Correctional Institution and is still on probation.<eos> Certainly sounds like a guy who could and would alter security video.<eos> Boss?<eos> Yeah, McGee.<eos> What do you got?<eos> We checked out Abell's apartment and the rest of the building-- he's not here.<eos> Attendants say that's pretty unusual.<eos> I think he's on the run.<eos> We'll put out a BOLO from here.<eos> You two stay there.
Our expectation has been that the AIC would move with precision and economy when choosing its players, but after six weeks, we're no further along than we were when we first started, and we have no leads.<eos> You're a third of the way through your training, and not only have you failed to get tapped, you more than likely missed who did get tapped right in front of you.<eos> Our only choice now is to reach the source.<eos> Owen Hall?<eos> If you think the AIC's impenetrable, he's Fort Knox.<eos> Then you have to break in.<eos> A gift from Langley, and a private contractor The Farm hired to freshen up the houses last year.<eos> A false wall.<eos> In a private home on a government military reservation in the most secure neighborhood in the country.<eos> Whatever's behind that wall is very important to Owen. And you have to find out what it is.
Only a crumpled piece of paper in the trash.<eos> - Was anything written on it?<eos> - Nothing written.<eos> It just had a weird symbol.<eos> A fist with what looked like horns.<eos> Did you recognize it?<eos> Never saw it before in my life.<eos> Did it look like this? Yes.<eos> How did...<eos> Who the hell are you people?
Because Rufus is gonna be spying on Rittenhouse for us.<eos> Whatever you find out about them, you're gonna tell me.<eos> We're gonna figure out what the hell's going on here.<eos> You got it? Like a double agent.<eos> I can barely single agent.<eos> Yeah, well, congrats on the undeserved promotion.<eos> I guess you're gonna learn on the job.<eos> - And you... you're no better.<eos> - Wyatt...<eos> In a fight like this, you are only as good as the guy next to you, and you both lied to me.
This is just an elective for me.<eos> Uh, not only is that a no, Nip-Tuck, but I'm gonna stay right here and make sure you soak it all in.<eos> Okay. If that goes well, I might invite you over later.<eos> Just leave the gun.<eos> Makes you look scary.<eos> Not in a good way.<eos> Before she ends you, focus.<eos> We need everyone... because our hope is that one of you sees something that we didn't.<eos> And together, we can catch a killer.<eos> Unless your vision is impaired, how can we see something you didn't?
Okay, now we're competing.<eos> And we have a new person of interest...<eos> The baby daddy.<eos> Elena was dating a jock...<eos> Vaz Dera.<eos> If she was being blackmailed, she'd want to put a stop to it.<eos> And the fastest way to do that would be...<eos> Come clean about the baby.<eos> And what if Vaz didn't want that?<eos> I assume you two have spoken with Vaz already.
I hereby sentence you to two years at Murdock Juvenile Detention Center.<eos> Buddy!<eos> Come with me.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Okay, Barlow, or whatever your real name is.<eos> I'm Federal Agent Landecker.<eos> 'Sup?<eos> I'm the Director of the Pacific Northwest Division, and we don't have any record of an agent working undercover in Ladner.<eos> Which is a real compliment to you.<eos> When you national boys go U.C., you go deep.
We need to intubate, protect her airway.<eos> I got it.<eos> Do what you gotta do.<eos> 10 of etomidate and a 75 of sux.<eos> Yup.<eos> Nine percent.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Let's get a head CT and belly, hyperventilate and get labs now with an acetaminophen level.<eos> - Got it. - Call 'em and tell 'em we're on our way up, we don't have time.<eos> You can come with us.
Kid played at an elite level. Trained to be the best of the best. Got derailed, though.<eos> Something I should know about, Christopher?<eos> Nah, I'll take care of it, King.<eos> Nothing in Marchand's history gets him killed.<eos> Need to know where he went after he left base.<eos> Yeah, we're pulling his credit card statement of the last two days.<eos> Good.<eos> Loretta finished her autopsy.<eos> I'll go see her.<eos> You two follow that credit card trial.
Obviously, we need to do a better job at figuring out who is setting off our singing wall fishes.<eos> Tap shoes?<eos> And there's whistles in there, too.<eos> So, I propose that when we walk around, we wear these tappers and we blow these whistles.<eos> That way, when we hear our singing wall fish, but we don't hear this... we'll know it's someone that needs to be terminated.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'm with you in theory.<eos> But I guess my only problem is that I'm not gonna wear those frigging things, and y'all can suck it.<eos> So, a maybe from Gail.<eos> Okay, now, before you leave, FYI,
Married.<eos> Newlywed of two months going strong.<eos> Super strong.<eos> Can Webber really rehire her?<eos> I mean, I am on the board.<eos> What is the problem?<eos> We needed a new resident, and she's a good one.<eos> Robbins slept with her.<eos> So did Alex.<eos> If you go there, be careful.
- You mean like us?<eos> León hasn't slept at the house the last few nights.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, where do you think you're going?<eos> I should've left hours ago.<eos> You always leave.<eos> Okay, so text me later when you're free, and maybe I'll come back.<eos> So, we have a lot of suspects doing a whole lot of nothing.<eos> We also have someone riding our ass that could blow our entire op any time he wants,<eos> - so what are we doing about that?<eos> - What are you doing about that?

You seem to have made a unanimous decision to strike.<eos> Well, I have no doubt you all feel incredibly confident in your answers, but... what happens away from the desks?<eos> You go home. You turn on the news, and you see what your report has wrought.<eos> Why feel guilty if the target was guilty?<eos> Sometimes you make a mistake.<eos> Sometimes the powers that be slant intel to justify their intentions, but, you know, you're using the wrong tense.<eos> Question should be, is the target guilty?<eos> We never got Nasser in 2011.<eos> He went underground.<eos> And after the bombings in the Philippines last year, we found him again, so... leaving immediately, we'll be going to the Drone Command Center at Langley, where you will be making the actual decision to strike.
Do they have to do with León Velez?<eos> Because his cellphone number is saved under Caleb's name in your phone.<eos> I'm a snoop.<eos> I told you.<eos> I watched you key in your code, and I looked at your phone when you went to the restroom.<eos> I have only four yes votes. I need a consensus, and I need it now.<eos> Request permission to sparkle once we get PID of the truck.<eos> I see the vehicle.<eos> Permission to sparkle affirmative.<eos> We are live and ready. Are you?
There was no doubt.<eos> Then why tell us you weren't sure?<eos> It's easy to live with a righteous kill.<eos> But making that same decision with uncertainty is what makes you worthy of the CIA.<eos> We killed a man today.<eos> - Yeah, a man who deserved it.<eos> - That was this time.<eos> - But next time?<eos> - I've had to do worse.<eos> So will you if you stay here.
Are you ready?<eos> What is this ceremony called?<eos> An unveiling.<eos> A year to the day of death in the Jewish faith, the tombstone is inscribed.<eos> And what are those?<eos> It's tradition to place a rock on a headstone.<eos> It's a symbol of the lasting presence of the deceased's life and memory.<eos> Tradition also states that those closest should recite the Mourner's Kaddish.<eos> But we don't have 10 people for a minyan.<eos> I won't tell if you don't.
There's our tight-ass fucking neighbor right on fucking schedule.<eos> Guys, please keep your voices down.<eos> I thought we were going to a fucking party, not an asshat convention.<eos> - I need to talk to your husband!<eos> - It's not a good time.<eos> - We're entertaining right now. - No, no!<eos> Listen!<eos> The music is not even on!<eos> Not about the music!<eos> You people bring drugs into the building! - What?
FYI, I managed a pretty successful jerk shack for years.<eos> Ew, Oleg.<eos> What?<eos> Get your mind out of the gutter. We sold Jamaican-style chicken.<eos> As a front for full-release massages.<eos> Y'all, what was my first dog's name again?<eos> - Earl.<eos> I guess my only options here are Oleg and Earl.<eos> Woof, real Murderers' Row.<eos> Who are you gonna have waitress?
I've been getting the machine all day, and I gotta make sure Oleg isn't shooting a porno there.<eos> Oh, he didn't get the funding.<eos> His Kinkstarter campaign fizzled out.<eos> There, the phone is unplugged.<eos> Good luck calling the police now, table two.<eos> Wow, you unplugged that phone faster than we unplugged my Aunt Esther.<eos> She was a mean lady.<eos> Sophie, ready to re-enter the workforce?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> The question is, are you ready?
That's all right, you already spilled most of it on me.<eos> I bet that's why they call him sloppy.<eos> Nope, my landings are a mess.<eos> Caroline, look at the bright side.<eos> How? None of the lights work.<eos> We're on our way to L.A., and sloppy took Randy's voucher as payment.<eos> And then rolled a nice, fat joint with it.<eos> You bet I did.<eos> - Ride the lightning! Yee-haw!<eos> Let me hear you say, "Yee-haw!"
Let me hear you say, "Yee-haw!"<eos> I'm just glad you found me.<eos> I was about to build a hut for the night.<eos> I thought you said you didn't pick up strange men. I didn't.<eos> Until a new friend convinced me I gotta take a chance.<eos> How fast can this old rig go?<eos> This old rig can go all night, baby.<eos> Doesn't answer my question at all, but let's do the damn thing.<eos> This flight's a lot bumpier than I thought it was gonna be.<eos> Speaking of bumps, y'all don't have any blow, do you?
What am I supposed to do? Pants him?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Can't chase us with his pants down.<eos> Come on, sailor.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on.<eos> Doc.<eos> We have work to do.<eos> I'll put it in neutral. You two push.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Can't chase us with his pants down.<eos> Come on, sailor.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on.<eos> Doc.<eos> We have work to do.<eos> I'll put it in neutral. You two push.<eos> Uh-uh, baby. You're pushing. I'm driving.
So, I saw you working on that seaplane.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Lost a half a tank of fuel.<eos> Oh shit. I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, only fuel for a one way trip.<eos> Nowhere to go anyway.<eos> What's this?<eos> Dinner.<eos> You need your strength.<eos> Yeah, but aren't you all eating?
Hello?<eos> Is someone out there?<eos> Please, I...<eos> I need help!<eos> Hello?<eos> I...<eos> Hello?<eos> You're a... a fairy.<eos> I'm Blue.<eos> And by the looks of things, you're another soul held captive by the Dark One.
What happened?<eos> No one knows exactly.<eos> Just that her heart blackened and she stopped defending the children that she was meant to protect.<eos> She started stealing them instead.<eos> Which means that that child is in grave danger.<eos> Rumple is trying to use it to lure her.<eos> But why?<eos> What could possibly be so important that he'd want from her?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> But, right now, we just need to get you free so that you can save that child.
Nasty stuff.<eos> Rumplestiltskin.<eos> So you know who I am.<eos> Oh, who hasn't heard of the Dark One?<eos> And if you've heard of me, you know that squid ink won't hold me long.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> That's why... I have this.<eos> And how exactly do you plan on using that?<eos> Well, that all depends on how you answer one simple question.<eos> You steal babies.
You steal babies.<eos> Steal them from their mothers' arms.<eos> So, why, of all the babies, in all of the realms, why did you abandon the one child who was actually yours?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> It can't be.<eos> Oh, I'm afraid it can be... Mother.<eos> That's right.<eos> Rumplestiltskin is your son.<eos> Of course, you would know that... Had you bothered to even give me a name.
The trigger always has the rabbit in their sights because they're inside the box with the rabbit, following the most closely without getting spotted.<eos> Start again!<eos> When the rabbit moves, the trigger signals for the eyes to move with them.<eos> Which means, if you're the rabbit, you better find your trigger and your eyes.<eos> If you're the eyes, don't lose the rabbit or get spotted.<eos> Any and every agent meeting, dead drop, or intelligence gathering, you have to assume you're not alone.<eos> Find your path, know it backwards and forwards.<eos> That's how you survive.<eos> I once ran a live SDR for 38 straight hours.<eos> And you probably will, too, one day.
Find your path, know it backwards and forwards.<eos> That's how you survive.<eos> I once ran a live SDR for 38 straight hours.<eos> And you probably will, too, one day.<eos> This wouldn't be spy school without a little homework.<eos> Get to know our neighboring town of Williamsburg.<eos> It's where you'll practice your SDRs.<eos> However, after many years, the residents have gotten hip to our training.<eos> So we let them play "Spot the spy."<eos> If they clock you, you got no business here. You're out, understood?
Well, she's our resident here.<eos> This is an excellent teaching case, and she'd benefit if you'd elaborate.<eos> It's fine, really.<eos> Richard, please...<eos> Now, look, you and Dr. Hunt are Chiefs of General and Trauma Surgery.<eos> Yeah, and if we don't make a decision, we're gonna be here all night.<eos> I'm going to repair the kidney.<eos> Suture.<eos> - Hunt!<eos> - All right, now, look, you two should want this resident to learn from this patient.
And, yeah, does it serve the president?<eos> You bet your ass it does, but it also serves your country.<eos> You, of all people, should get this.<eos> The fear mongers won't be any more convinced whether I say something or not.<eos> Well, then, make a statement, man.<eos> If not for them, for you, for your people.<eos> For the sanity of this country.<eos> Nadine, help me out here.<eos> Mr. Mahoney has a point.<eos> Do you two... comprehend the mountains I have to move between now and November?
Early this morning, Navy Machinist Mate First Class Brandon Noah was shot to death on this roof downtown.<eos> Noah's division has a high security clearance.<eos> They've been working on a classified drone project for the Los Angeles Air Force Base at El Segundo.<eos> Do we have any footage of the shooting?<eos> It's an old building used for weekly rentals, so no cameras.<eos> Two people witnessed the shooting from another building.<eos> They were too far away to see the shooter's face, but they could tell it was a man.<eos> And what do we know about the victim?<eos> Brandon has no family in town, but he does live with a roommate-- a Reggie Tiller, in West L.A.<eos> You two head downtown to the crime scene.
Oh, don't make one of your dumb-ass speeches, Tandy.<eos> Oh, hell, I have heard them so many times, I know them by heart.<eos> "We can't just go off into the night.<eos> "We have to go on into the day.<eos> Boom.<eos> "We got to stick together.<eos> "Together? I hardly knew 'er.<eos> Boom.<eos> "We're Noah's ark. Look at us.<eos> "I'm Noah, and you're all the animals."
Look, we've established, firmly, that I cannot be around this ring without completely spoiling it, okay?<eos> So, until I propose, will you hang on to it for me?<eos> For six months?<eos> Out of sight, out of mind.<eos> Delilah won't find it, I won't be thinking about it.<eos> But I'm having lunch with her tomorrow.<eos> It's already gonna be hard enough not to say anything.<eos> No, it's gonna be fine.<eos> What about Torres?<eos> Oh, I'm-I'm touched, but you two clearly have this nerd thing going on.
She knew Merrick was denied visitation rights last year, was gonna report him.<eos> She was killed trying to do the right thing.<eos> That sounds like Vee.<eos> Sorry, we were just, um...<eos> We were close.<eos> Yes.<eos> Much closer than you're telling us.<eos> Huh?<eos> We know.<eos> You two weren't cousins.
She was killed trying to do the right thing.<eos> That sounds like Vee.<eos> Sorry, we were just, um...<eos> We were close.<eos> Yes.<eos> Much closer than you're telling us.<eos> Huh?<eos> We know.<eos> You two weren't cousins.<eos> You were dating.
Well, we found those tranquilizer darts.<eos> They could have been dosed and dragged back to the house.<eos> They couldn't be too far from where P.K.'s bag was.<eos> The boys were looking for adventure.<eos> My gut tells me they'll keep the unsubs talking so they can work on a plan to escape.<eos> That isn't what worries me.<eos> We don't know if the Hensons would want to hurt them, but if they've been isolated and tortured this whole time, who knows what they'll do.<eos> Ah, man, we gotta get out of here. Do you have a plan?<eos> If we fake sickness and tell them we need help.<eos> You two can take them.
Let's get you out of here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Watch it.<eos> You ok?<eos> I'm just glad we found those kids.<eos> Oh, yeah, me, too.<eos> But, uh, I was talking about that other thing.<eos> I haven't had a chance to talk to you guys. What do you think?<eos> I think we've been through a lot of changes and we always figure it out, you know?
Something wrong?<eos> You headed out?<eos> Cousin up in Rockford got an extra bed.<eos> I need a change of scenery.<eos> We know, Darin.<eos> If we looked at your phone we'd find an app that could activate this outlet from anywhere in the world, am I right?<eos> Look, I'm...<eos> We already contacted home gate to confirm your usage.<eos> It's time stamped.<eos> It's not what you think.
- What's up, Herrmann?<eos> - I need a favor.<eos> Yeah, anything.<eos> I like to hear you say that.<eos> Okay, so I signed us up as sponsors for the mud-hundred, all right?<eos> And I need you guys to cover the event.<eos> - The what now?<eos> - It's some kind of thing where you... you run through the mud in the woods or something, and we're gonna be handing out Molly's t-shirts 'cause we need as much, you know, publicity as we can get these days.<eos> Why aren't you covering it?<eos> 'Cause I'm the brains of the operation, and you are the brawn, okay?
Because she called, I called back, she didn't answer.<eos> Seemed upset.<eos> She's always like that in the run up to this thing.<eos> At the 30 year, I came early to drop off flowers and she was... She was vacuuming the floor herself.<eos> - Take your seat everyone! - Hey, let's go sit down.<eos> - Take your seat.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, settle in.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, what we have here tonight is 40 years with the love of my life, and we're so grateful that you are here to celebrate with us.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.<eos> Well, if that be the case, it would be my pleasure to make this official.<eos> Finally.<eos> Do you have any witnesses?<eos> We just kinda went on a spur of the moment.<eos> Did you think you could do this without your firehouse family?<eos> Nice try.<eos> Welcome to the family, warts and all.<eos> Thanks, bud.<eos> You two are the ones who can make this work. I have no doubt.
Well, it's a little like.<eos> New Year's Eve and The Hunger Games rolled into one.<eos> Traditionally, we veterans gather at the Brickmore to cope with the agony and the ecstasy of watching the returns.<eos> Why don't you come with me?<eos> - I'd love to.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, good morning, fellow citizens. Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> We're going to the Brickmore this evening to watch the returns come in.<eos> Would you gentlemen care to join us?
I mean, was it the best sex ever?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Was that enough?<eos> What do you think?<eos> "Shall I part my hair behind?<eos> Do I dare to eat a peach."<eos> I don't think anyone ever got laid quoting Prufrock.<eos> What up, nerds?<eos> Matt, you know Win.<eos> I believe you two are what the kids call. "Eskimo Brothers"
I don't know why you guys are telling me this.<eos> You should tell the guy you chose to live with.<eos> What?<eos> I'm just saying, you're only gonna see me on weekends and every other Christmas, so you better get used to it.<eos> Oh, my God. Is she really still talking about this hypothetical divorce?<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> I was really hurt.<eos> You know, when your kids are teenagers, everyone says, "Oh, don't worry.<eos> When they get older, they will appreciate you and be thankful for everything that you do for them."<eos> Well, you are older.
Yes, yes!<eos> There will be a grace period, and grace will be bestowed upon me.<eos> See, you know this because you're the dad and you know about grace periods and you can make it right.<eos> Thank you, Daddy!<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh. Hey, Axl.<eos> Uh, Kenny and I were just doing a little safety check - on the 'Bago.<eos> - Safety check?<eos> Weren't you the guy who said, "Brakes are for sissies"?
I guess you do like stuff.<eos> I'm... sorry.<eos> No, no, no, I get it, I get it.<eos> It can be hard to break through people's preconceptions of me.<eos> That's why I don't have many friends.<eos> I haven't even been to a movie marathon before.<eos> Hey, where did you pick up your sweet ride?<eos> At a funeral home?<eos> Are you gonna go pick up someone's dead grandpa and hold a respectful service for him?<eos> You think you guys are fast?
Yeah, well, what's the point of having a time machine if you can't fix your regrets?<eos> Yep.<eos> The chief must be coming.<eos> The chief is a woman.<eos> Don't look so surprised.<eos> - You speak English.<eos> - Missionaries.<eos> The language stayed. Their faith did not.<eos> My name is Nonhelema.<eos> You're Nonhelema?
Well, as you can see, it needs to be improved.<eos> Well, the thing I'm hearing again and again is that it's just great.<eos> Where are you hearing that?<eos> Well, from Lex and Harley and Carol.<eos> Carol just can't shut up about it.<eos> Well, see, the nurses don't agree with that.<eos> And you've got studies?<eos> There are several studies.<eos> We actually cite some in our...<eos> Oh, so you get to use studies but I don't!
Oh, no.<eos> Let's face it.<eos> Our fate was sealed long ago.<eos> Grandchild of divorce.<eos> Okay, hang on.<eos> Emily, why don't you join Dave on the couch?<eos> Are your grandparents still together?<eos> Both sets?<eos> So, her stellar marital pedigree cancels out your tarnished one.<eos> You two have nothing to worry about.
- One more step... - Daniel:<eos> It's going inside. That means your aura is negative. - Wow.<eos> - Dr. Magan:<eos> This is what our science is.<eos> I'm sorry if I'm offending you.<eos> Dr. Magan: I'm taking the negativity out from the chakras.<eos> From health, wealth, happiness, and success... All the negativity should be gone. Yeah.<eos> Daniel: So, you've had people come here that say, "Hey, I'm...<eos> I'm just struggling with my sexuality,"<eos> or, "I have gay tendencies." You do the healing, and they've come to you and told you that they feel better, or... - Yes, yes!
See, we're looking for two people, Mr. Kasdan.<eos> A murderer and an attempted murderer.<eos> You say you can prove you were in Ottawa the other night, fine.<eos> Doesn't mean you couldn't have cut the cord to Bennett's pilot chute.<eos> I did it.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I did it.<eos> I... sabotaged Bennett's chute.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, it's like you said, I... I was getting cut out.
Why are you showing us these?<eos> We found them on the ground where Bennett Nealy fell.<eos> In Afghanistan, young lovers give each other tasbihs as a sign of affection, yes?<eos> He just asked you if you think that they're hers, and you said, "I hope not."<eos> I'm assuming by "hers," you meant your daughter, Zohala.<eos> You speak Pashto? Not fluently.<eos> Are these your daughter's prayer beads?<eos> Bennett Nealy had a lover.<eos> He called her Jaan.<eos> "Jaan," as you're well aware, is the Pashto for "beloved."
Anthony, the youngest brother, shared an apartment with Leo.<eos> He testified Leo was asleep when the fire started.<eos> Unfortunately, when your alibi's provided by an adoring brother...<eos> You have no alibi.<eos> I'm sorry. Was I blocking the board the whole time?<eos> You want me to start again?<eos> That'd be great. Thanks.<eos> Also, the judge tied the defense's hands by refusing to let them argue diminished capacity.<eos> Can you explain to us the meaning of that term?<eos> We know what it means, you know what it means.
He signed it over to Powell Associates.<eos> I called to ask about the transaction, but as soon as I said I was CIU...<eos> They hung up on you?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Their business is money laundering.<eos> They hire Ivy League attorneys to hide money for superrich corporate titans.<eos> They recruited heavily from my law school.<eos> Vince was definitely not super-rich.<eos> I'll take care of Powell.<eos> You keep digging on Vince.
That insurance payout saved his life.<eos> _<eos> You didn't tell us the whole story, Mr. Scarlata.<eos> What story's that?<eos> We know about your secret.<eos> I assume you're talking about his gambling debt.<eos> That hasn't been a secret for a long time.<eos> That still doesn't mean you didn't burn the restaurant down.<eos> Wait.<eos> You think I set the fire?
It's none of our business.<eos> They can answer for themselves.<eos> I'm... we're just not ready.<eos> But when will you be ready?<eos> Well... I don't know...<eos> It's such a big decision...<eos> Like if we want to go away for a while.<eos> Where were you planning to go?<eos> Such complicated questions...<eos> Do you have children?
I do make it a challenge.<eos> I need to secure my office.<eos> We can't afford for it to be breached.<eos> Take Jane, all right?<eos> For backup.<eos> He's not all bad, you know, Roman.<eos> I'm just saying, there's... there's good in him, I've seen it.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're turning him into an asset... in your mind, how do you imagine that working?<eos> I'd bring him in, you give him the same deal you gave to me.
Your voice makes me want to shit!<eos> That's right, Constable.<eos> All Whitechapel stands agog, much like Scotland Yard sends a battalion to free their chief.<eos> Be calm, lad.<eos> You be calm.<eos> I seen Gustas kill him.<eos> You witnessed Sargent Thatcher's shot.<eos> Mr. Drummond, I believe him.<eos> And who is he that we should give his word credence?<eos> Who are you at all, Miss Harper?
The boy must be found on the man, or the man on the boy.<eos> Augustus.<eos> They found a man, a madman known to the police as such.<eos> There was an attack on another rabbi, see?<eos> And so, that was Mr. Isaac Bloom.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I hear them say how they would take my axe and they would hand them to him.<eos> Captain, whatever it is you hunt for, please find it.<eos> He will find nothing, because there's nothing to find, save the wreckage of your life along with his.<eos> My, sir, you are flush.
Send him home where he belongs.<eos> Besides, it is not the fate of evil pair brings me to you now, but your own.<eos> And that too is decided, I imagine.<eos> A little further yet.<eos> That is right, my friend.<eos> Think of what you and I once found in a tenement room off that courtyard beyond, the cut and strewn remains of the Ripper's last victim.<eos> 10 years ago, Edmund, 10 years.<eos> That barbarism then, that which these Dove brothers have only now enacted.<eos> They were forged from the same furnace, a furnace which requires permanent vigilance, Edmund, a watchman, set for the night when that fire finds another crack in the world and sets its creatures free once more.<eos> Bennet Drake was a fine man, but he... that pale-faced Drummond, they do no see, not in the way you see.
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, bringing where collections of bygone happy days.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Shh. You cannot!<eos> It was her song! It was her song!<eos> Stop this!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop this!<eos> It was her song!<eos> - Mr. Reid.<eos> You cannot.
Marie, it doesn't sound like you're talking about what you're supposed to be talking about.<eos> Excuse, Mrs. Rodriguez.<eos> I think you're bullying my good friend.<eos> So I will stand up... talk... and depart.<eos> That's right...<eos> I just gave you an STD.<eos> - Andi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What a heart-stopping surprise.<eos> What are you two unlikely buddies up to?
N-No, no.<eos> I mean like that.<eos> Whoa, where did that come from?<eos> You know, I-I think that's always been there.<eos> Maybe we have a mouse.<eos> Um... can I see you in the kitchen?<eos> No!<eos> I'm getting to the bottom of this.<eos> Are you?<eos> Okay, you three stay put.
Kate, what's happening?<eos> I think he's gonna take it away.<eos> Oh, no, no, no. Much worse.<eos> I'm gonna take it away from two of you.<eos> Mom, you're letting him do this?<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> Whoever tells us about the hole gets it all.<eos> Every single<eos> - piece.<eos> Okay, so you three have a decision to make.
Now, then, I believe we have some celebrating to do.<eos> Come.<eos> The party's only just begun.<eos> Of course, Daddy.<eos> Henry, put that thing away.<eos> This family is done fighting.<eos> - Where did she go?<eos> - We have no idea, Henry.<eos> But we're trying to figure that out, right?<eos> Because I didn't stay behind for you to screw things up.
Move! Move!<eos> We must warn them!<eos> The war is not over!<eos> Run!<eos> No!<eos> Seriously?<eos> Emma?<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> You...<eos> You're the Evil Queen.
Is... is Mother Superior there?<eos> Something happened.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> We defeated the Evil Queen once.<eos> We'll do it again.<eos> Let's just focus on Henry's big day.<eos> I don't know what I'd do without you two.<eos> Presenting his Royal Highness, Prince Henry!<eos> Look at him. He looks so grown-up.<eos> Do you, Prince Henry, undertake to accept the accolade of knighthood?
Well, then I'll get straight to the point.<eos> I would like to propose a deal.<eos> I would like to propose a deal.<eos> A deal?<eos> A deal?<eos> In exchange for Mr. Weston?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And what is this?<eos> We are willing to return four Saudi nationals who were arrested by the FBI for committing industrial espionage against a Texas oil company.<eos> Or so you claim.
These are very unusual times.<eos> So, we get our citizens back.<eos> And we get our comrade home.<eos> And an American hero gets to return home to a grateful nation.<eos> Mr. Ambassador... do we have an agreement?<eos> A transnational three-way spy trade.<eos> - Well done, sir.<eos> - Nothing's done yet.<eos> And it's not gonna take much for it to all fall apart.<eos> So I need you both to stay on top of it.
Hannah!<eos> Now that the House Judiciary Committee has given the nominee the green light, the full House will convene for a late-night vote that many expect will make Peter MacLeish the next Vice President of the United States.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Ooh.<eos> To Peter MacLeish.<eos> - To the new Vice President.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> What's up, Spring Break?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You know, if you had 60 news-hungry journalists clamoring for information about Nassar's murder, you'd be thirsty, too.
This Process ensures that only the best of us will enjoy life on the Offshore.<eos> But not everyone understands this.<eos> As you know, envy and resentment have fueled groups, who in the name of a false and hypocritical equality and with populist ideas, aim to destroy everything we have achieved.<eos> But they have always failed and will continue to fail.<eos> And so, welcome, everyone.<eos> Welcome, Michele.<eos> I hope that you will do your very best, Joana.<eos> And that you will trust the Process, Alex.<eos> Because all these years of sacrifice, Fernando, could be rewarded right here.<eos> Remember, you each create your own merit.
-How are we doing?<eos> -Good.<eos> Six hours in.<eos> It looks like Marco figured out the panel.<eos> -[Álvaro] Confirming expectations.<eos> -Really? Interesting.<eos> Are we really supposed to just wait around?<eos> -And for how long?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> Being stuck here as a couple like you two can't be that bad.
I think it's time we open the gate.<eos> How many candidates have been eliminated?<eos> None.<eos> Marco brought them together, they were organized until the end.<eos> Everyone did their part with very little conflict.<eos> In my opinion, Ezequiel, everyone passed.<eos> No. [sighs]<eos> Otávio? Let's make a few changes.<eos> Did the food drop?<eos> Do you think it broke?
-It's probably night already.<eos> -But the lights are still on.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> There are no windows.<eos> Lights on or off, I wanna sleep.<eos> -Yeah, let's go.<eos> -Let's get some rest.<eos> -We'll see if it's working later.<eos> -Yeah, let's rest.<eos> No, you don't understand.
I'm hungry.<eos> -My food is gone too.<eos> -You ate all your food.<eos> For real?<eos> Yes, for real.<eos> Working hard makes you hungry.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> So, let's go get some more.<eos> What's up?<eos> We're working on the gate and you're doing nothing.
-Close it!<eos> [Michele] Open up, quick!<eos> -Hold on! Easy!<eos> -Come on, come on!<eos> Motherfuckers! You're gonna die!<eos> You're not going to do anything?<eos> Can't you stop the test?<eos> -I can't.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Because you are the ones who did this, Joana.
[Michele] Open up, quick!<eos> -Hold on! Easy!<eos> -Come on, come on!<eos> Motherfuckers! You're gonna die!<eos> You're not going to do anything?<eos> Can't you stop the test?<eos> -I can't.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Because you are the ones who did this, Joana.<eos> You let it come to this.
Because you deserve it.<eos> "Everything will work out.<eos> Because you deserve it."<eos> Never forget that.<eos> Whoever said we couldn't have a sink in here...<eos> It's perfect.<eos> A respectable Process Leader deserves a respectable room.<eos> Will you help me with this?<eos> Only three percent of you will have the honor of going to the Offshore.<eos> Remember... you create your own merit.
Tell me.<eos> I taste... Brazilian grapes?<eos> And what else?<eos> Black pepper.<eos> It looks like the Process Leader has just chosen the wine that we will drink to celebrate the end of every year.<eos> You're always teaching me.<eos> This is my second year as Process Leader... 1 YEAR LATER 100TH PROCESS ...and I am very happy to welcome you.<eos> I imagine that you are all terribly nervous.<eos> But if I may offer some advice:<eos> Remember... you each create your own merit.
You're not going with her?<eos> Do you think she'll be all right?<eos> Of course.<eos> She'll be taken care of by the best professionals in the field.<eos> RECOVERY TREATMENT CENTER THE OFFSHORE<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Only nine percent of you... make it...<eos> Only nine percent of you make it-- have made it up here.<eos> Consider yourselves privileged just... for experiencing all of this.<eos> And remember... you create your own merit.
You should see how proud your brothers are.<eos> Especially your little brother, Rafael.<eos> Mom, I'm not going back.<eos> I'm staying in the Process.<eos> Let's talk about this.<eos> -Stop being so stubborn.<eos> -I didn't come for the money.<eos> But that's why you're gonna quit. It's for your family.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> You don't need money.
I'm glad you reconsidered, son.<eos> If you turn me in, I'll say it was your idea.<eos> That you knew, the whole family knew.<eos> Your children would all be banned from the Process.<eos> -You wouldn't do that to your own mother.<eos> -Not to a good mother.<eos> But to you, I'd do it in a heartbeat.<eos> Mom, what are you doing?<eos> Take a close look at Rafael!<eos> He is not who you think he is!
None of us.<eos> No way.<eos> There are no kids on the Offshore?<eos> We don't have kids on the Offshore precisely because heredity... was the biggest injustice that sustained the outrageous world we lived in.<eos> That was the Founding Couple's biggest accomplishment.<eos> Their greatest lesson.<eos> They were the first to not bear children.<eos> And they taught us... that the true path to building a superior society... is merit.<eos> And the only way to evaluate true merit... is through the Process.<eos> Because you will know for certain that you've earned these privileges.

While looking into the companies involved in that, a familiar name kept recurring.<eos> Prior to your current job with Ms. Salazar, you were a lobbyist with deep ties to those companies.<eos> We believe it was in that capacity that you first met Mr. Cole.<eos> He conducted an analysis of one of your clients.<eos> His calendar showed a number of dinner dates between the two of you.<eos> You also helped get legislation passed giving those companies the right to mine asteroids.<eos> And based on your social media photos, you spend way too much money for a public servant.<eos> Which indicates that your former employers are paying you to make sure that government decisions go their way.<eos> And most recently, that included you killing Russell Cole.<eos> You people are crazy.
There's been reports of an insurgent hiding in the area.<eos> My husband and I spend all day cleaning up the mess you're making of this country.<eos> You can bloody well stay out of our house.<eos> - You work at the hospital, correct?<eos> - Yes, Doctors Without Borders. All right.<eos> We need to see your passports.<eos> Have you seen this woman, ma'am?<eos> She's an American.<eos> She may be posing as U.S. military.<eos> How do we know you're not posing as U.S. military? Chris.
We learned plenty today.<eos> All right.<eos> Merry Christmas, kids!<eos> Grandma loves you!<eos> Grandma?<eos> Don't spend all that money in one place!<eos> You took money from her?<eos> Is it our fault she thought we were her grandkids and gave us money?<eos> Yes!<eos> I brought you here to learn a lesson, and you conned an old lady?
We need something for ballast while we bolt down the engineering.<eos> How 'bout an inner tube?<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Nice, Tim.<eos> Sounds like you boys are getting on like gangbusters.<eos> We're fine.<eos> Happy?<eos> Now you need a valve to modulate the amount of carbon dioxide saturated water you pull to the surface.<eos> Too little, and the lake will still erupt.<eos> Too much, and you'll cause an eruption.
Well, I am running for the 16th District alderman of West Altadenia in the local upcoming election.<eos> I hope I can count on your vote.<eos> That was my old commander.<eos> He needs a new head of security. In Amman.<eos> Jordan?<eos> That's... way out of town.<eos> I think it's about time I have a talk with Cabe about making my position here permanent.<eos> That's great news.<eos> Conning Paige may have been an efficient way to impress her, but it's not the honest way.<eos> Well, for the record, this makes me want you to end up with her even more.
It kind of felt like a dig at me.<eos> Well, it's the only desk in... the garage.<eos> If you want... a different one,<eos> I would be happy to order you a new one when we get back.<eos> No problem at all.<eos> Yeah, I mean, listen, Tim, we've had our challenges, but you-you and I are good now.<eos> Yeah, good.<eos> I thought so, too... I just want it to stay that way.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Come on, I'm not who you think I am.
You're lying.<eos> He's not.<eos> We were all in New Year's Eve.<eos> Ask your boys, if you don't believe me.<eos> Your boss needs a lie down, Detective.<eos> He's not looking very well.<eos> Get statements.<eos> Aye, come a way in.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> Where were you?
I'm still investigating that.<eos> Also investigating who blew up the Niners' bike shop.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Well, I hope that's true.<eos> 'Cause a lot of people got hurt.<eos> All I know so far is that, uh, demolition explosives were used over there.<eos> Oh, jumping to conclusions again, huh?<eos> Par the course for you people.<eos> Just gathering evidence.<eos> But I got to tell you, if you or your boys didn't do it, somebody's working awful hard to make it look like you did.
Well, you're more than that. What do you mean?<eos> We went through your social media accounts.<eos> Three Saturdays ago, you posted a photo of a sunset.<eos> The caption read: "Beautiful night with friends."<eos> So?<eos> So, the photo was taken from the porch of Tate's summer home in Vermont.<eos> We matched the photos to his accounts. You weren't with friends, you were with Tate.<eos> You were having an affair.<eos> We spoke to Mr. Orvis's housekeeper.<eos> She said last week you two had a fight.
As I happened to pass it on my travels, I detected an Imperial freighter adrift in the upper atmosphere.<eos> Escape pods jettisoned, completely abandoned.<eos> Huh. Must've flown too close.<eos> It's stuck in one of those atmospheric storms.<eos> It's slowly being pulled in.<eos> And its cargo will soon be lost.<eos> I have the manifest right here.<eos> Its hold is loaded with a large supply of proton bombs.<eos> So what's in it for you two?<eos> Well, there is also some cargo you would not be interested in.
Well, there is also some cargo you would not be interested in.<eos> Uh, you know, there is, um, precious metals, rare artifacts, riches untold.<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> All probably stolen, huh, Hondo?<eos> From the worlds the Empire took over.<eos> So, we'll split the treasure?<eos> (LAUGHING)<eos> "Split the treasure." Oh, that's a classic.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, my big, purple friend.<eos> You get the bombs.

Oh, that's a classic.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, my big, purple friend.<eos> You get the bombs.<eos> And you get the treasure.<eos> So what do you need us for?<eos> Why not use your own crew?<eos> Now trust me, that is a long, boring story.<eos> No, no, no, my friends, you are the guys for this job.
Sorry it didn't work out, Hondo.<eos> Work out?<eos> Oh, no. This is better, yes, because, uh...<eos> Friendship is the greatest treasure.<eos> Do you really mean that?<eos> Mostly.<eos> (WHEEZING) See?<eos> He's always laughing.<eos> Always having a good time, this Melch.<eos> I look forward to you gentlemen continuing this conversation on your own ship.
And they love her.<eos> Thank you for finding her, Merle.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Tornado warning.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> All right, everybody, we got to get downstairs.<eos> Who's left that thinks they can be impartial?<eos> All right, Debbie,<eos> Len, Kelly-Anne,<eos> Doug... you're all in.
She knows not to make Windemere - look like a Yankee.<eos> - Jeans are a nice touch.<eos> Give me your notebook.<eos> I've never seen you take notes.<eos> Wasn't asking a question.<eos> Ready to make my client an offer?<eos> How about surrender?<eos> We'd accept.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Bruce, Mitch, Tonya, all y'all in the back row, what are you doing?
The more you're aware, The more it stays with you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> I saw something in my dream.<eos> What'd you see?<eos> A matchbook from a restaurant.<eos> I'll wake Sabine and go with you.<eos> No, let her sleep; she's happy.<eos> Besides, you two need time to work things out.
Don't worry you will be able to get out.<eos> You will have to pay to get out of the wall at the end of the show.<eos> And as an added gesture we have placed any person that was Muslim or Muslim looking in their own section here in the back.<eos> Are the Muslims up there?<eos> Here we go Muslims!<eos> (cheering)<eos> There they are. Muslims, Muslim-Americans.<eos> Right, let's hear it for them.<eos> They're Americans.<eos> But just so, just so that the Trump people aren't too nervous about you being in here, we are going to fly a drone above them right within the theater here.
I want her to, I want them not to like her up on Capitol Hill.<eos> I want the people she's negotiating with not to like her.<eos> You don't want somebody all likable. "Sure, whatever you say."<eos> "Okay, I'll sign here."<eos> (audience laughs) What else, what are the other knocks on Hillary?<eos> Not trustworthy, right?<eos> We hear that a lot, she's not trustworthy.<eos> How did she prove her distrust-worthiness to you?<eos> Did she, did she promise to water the plants for you while you were gone, and then didn't?<eos> Now we're talking about differences, you say well she flip-flops or whatever, well everybody changes, everybody evolves,
- Tell her.<eos> Have a good time.<eos> - [Reporter] Bye.<eos> - Well, I just left Michael and he's a good man.<eos> He's a good man, he's done a good job.<eos> - [Reporter] Yeah, okay, thanks.<eos> - 'Kay, have a good time.<eos> (audience laughs and claps) - See?<eos> See, he said something nice about Hillary, and me.<eos> Right, so if he can do it, you can do it.
She has killed 46 people.<eos> 46 people.<eos> With her own bare hands.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, this is who I want for commander-in-chief.<eos> Somebody who's not afraid to kill somebody!<eos> We haven't had somebody in the Oval Office who has killed somebody since Ulysses S. Grant.<eos> ISIS is going to shit if she's president.<eos> And you know what the jihadist rule is, it's not martyrdom if you're killed by a woman.<eos> If a girl kills you, you don't go to paradise, you don't get the 72 virgins, it's like you're in a permanent high school cafeteria table all alone with the rest of the cafeteria mocking you cause a girl killed you.<eos> Listen you don't want the 70-year old out of shape guy who's had nannies and servants his whole life.
And I think that she's been biding her time.<eos> My hope, my optimism for this,<eos> Hillary, if you're watching this right now, I have a feeling somebody is going to slip you a tape of this.<eos> I just want to tell you something.<eos> I know you've been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting.<eos> But you're not alone.<eos> A whole bunch of the rest of us have been waiting for that glorious moment when the other gender, the majority gender, has a chance to run this world, to have real power, and kick some righteous ass.<eos> (audience cheers and applauds)<eos> And we are counting on you to do this, right?<eos> I wanna see what that world looks like, don't you?
(audience cheers) Where she's just gonna go in there and says,<eos> "Enough of the bullshit."<eos> Inauguration Day, after all the inaugural balls, they pull up to the White House, her and Bill to go in.<eos> She says, "No Bill, no, no, no, no.<eos> "You're staying at Blair House.<eos> "I'm gonna go in here and run the country "the way it should've been run."<eos> And then she goes in there and she just starts signing one Executive Order after another.<eos> Her first 100 days, right?<eos> Like FDR, like doesn't need Congress, just start signing Executive Orders.<eos> Immigrants, you stay.
Incredibly painful.<eos> I-I really think that your bed would be the best place for me.<eos> You're on the couch.<eos> It's a fold-out, and there's Aspirin in the bathroom.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Just to be clear, I haven't forgiven you for arresting Jake on my show.<eos> If this is how you hold a grudge, I'll take it.<eos> So, how are you holding up?<eos> I know how...<eos> How close you two are.
If it's that important to you, just give it to me.<eos> I'll wait outside.<eos> I thought seeing him would be good from me.<eos> I thought it would bring me some closure, but it's just brought back every bad feeling that I've had for the last five years.<eos> He's dying, Ruth.<eos> He made his bed.<eos> I don't believe you feel that way.<eos> - You don't know me anymore, Rollie.<eos> - I know who you were.<eos> I know who you both were.
Better question is, are they ready to bear witness to the power and glory that is real magic?<eos> They're gonna do a biopsy.<eos> You are determined to be a knife in life's balloon, aren't you?<eos> What about you?<eos> You think that mass is benign?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Little bit of hope, little bit of faith.<eos> That's all I need.<eos> We should get going.<eos> You two are perfect for each other.
Oh, like Susie Penta's kid.<eos> What?<eos> Susan Penta's kid was selling crystal meth?<eos> That actually happens here?<eos> I was just saying stuff.<eos> Oh, I'd love it if my kid became a meth dealer... do anything besides play "Minecraft."<eos> Get off the couch, go outside, and sell meth.<eos> It's a beautiful day.<eos> Look, if you want to know what your kids are up to, start running their texts through your phone.<eos> - You both read your kids' texts?
What's going on?<eos> He's detailing a laundry list of violations, Threatening prison on the Siberian tundra.<eos> Let's all put aside our Fifth Amendment heebie-jeebies and get this done.<eos> She's demanding to know what they're doing in Russia.<eos> What was that?<eos> Such a bald-faced, childish lie. It's not worthy of repeating.<eos> Tell them that they were seen outside of Vasily Heavy Industries.<eos> Ask them why they were there.<eos> He says that they got lost.<eos> You notice the same two guys keep talking? Yeah.
Okay, now tell him his friends are in separate rooms and only the first one of them to confess the truth gets to go home.<eos> They were at Vasily Heavy Industries to inspect nuclear technology.<eos> The tech was then purchased by the Razmian Bank<eos> - and sent back to Iran.<eos> - Who did they send it to?<eos> Hossein Pakvar.<eos> Pakvar, works for this guy,<eos> Mohammed Abedini.<eos> Abedini's a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts. The ones in charge of choosing the supreme leader, monitoring his activities.<eos> This feels like disturbing news, but you two look oddly pleased.
It's family.<eos> It matters.<eos> What in the world is more important?<eos> Hey, thank you, TV, for answering that question.<eos> We're gonna bail and come buy this.<eos> - Yes! - Yes!<eos> Kenneth!<eos> Jimmy and I were just talking. We've decided to stay home for Thanksgiving.<eos> As you're part of the family now, we'd love for you to join.<eos> And since it's tomorrow, you get to act generous knowing I already have plans and won't come.
Meh, meh. Witty wisecrack.<eos> Meh, meh, meh. No, no, it's good, it's good, it's good.<eos> Get it out, get it out, whether it's accurate or not.<eos> Oh, and don't forget about JJ.<eos> He's got that sick "Harold and Maude" thing going on with Joan.<eos> "I do.<eos> Sorry, society."<eos> But you guys can mock us all you want because you've got problems.<eos> No, no, no, you're right.<eos> We... We're so focused on the fact that you don't understand our problems.
Meh, meh, meh. No, no, it's good, it's good, it's good.<eos> Get it out, get it out, whether it's accurate or not.<eos> Oh, and don't forget about JJ.<eos> He's got that sick "Harold and Maude" thing going on with Joan.<eos> "I do.<eos> Sorry, society."<eos> But you guys can mock us all you want because you've got problems.<eos> No, no, no, you're right.<eos> We... We're so focused on the fact that you don't understand our problems.<eos> We didn't even consider that you might actually have problems of your own.

We're so focused on the fact that you don't understand our problems.<eos> We didn't even consider that you might actually have problems of your own.<eos> This is good, you know, 'cause we're actually talking about something.<eos> Yeah, like a family.<eos> You annoy us, we annoy you.
- Yeah, DEA.<eos> And you're interfering with my investigation.<eos> - Okay, well, that's my suspect. - Right.<eos> And you're gonna let him go, Detective.<eos> I lost him in the crowd.<eos> - Who's she? - Oh, this?<eos> Just the worst driver in the DEA.<eos> DEA.<eos> So, there were drugs in the bunnies.<eos> You two have no idea what you've gotten yourselves into, do you?
- I thought I was. Let's get out of here before my cuff explodes.<eos> Yeah, he already ruined my family. I don't want him to ruin my Thanksgiving too.<eos> No.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> It's time someone stood up to the weasels who sweep into our lives, break up our families, and take our loved ones to Cabo.<eos> I feel like you're making this about you, but you're right.<eos> Do you know when my high blood pressure started?<eos> When I met that guy.<eos> Is this when someone's supposed to say, "Get him!"<eos> - No. - You hold him down. I'm gonna beat him with this orthopedic shoe.
- Oh.<eos> - Hey. I just saw we were running out of pumpkin dip, and I know it's your favorite, so I brought you some.<eos> What's your game?<eos> - Yeah, show us your underwear.<eos> - What? Why are we so understanding about Fizbo, huh?<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> - Hiding? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Shame on you. It's Thanksgiving.<eos> I want to celebrate with my husband, my daughter, my lovely family, Jerry.<eos> I think it's sad that you two look at life as some sort of game where everyone's trying to get away with something.
I kinda wish something weirder would've happened, but uh nah, I guess you guys are weird enough for me anyway.<eos> What's next?<eos> It's almost here.<eos> Emma, you really didn't hear that scream?<eos> I heard it.<eos> It was Emma.<eos> Emma, this isn't funny.<eos> Uhm, is she drunk?<eos> Emma's dead.<eos> You'll all be dead too.
- You're so early, right?<eos> - Not really.<eos> There is that smile that I love.<eos> - Why don't you take me to lunch?<eos> - Okay. What happened here, anyway?<eos> You get into Joe's scented markers again?<eos> So now, I have scary Russian squatters who won't leave.<eos> We'll have a small window when Mitchell goes to the gym.<eos> He usually stretches, takes a lap around the locker room, and then gets a smoothie.<eos> You two deal with the Russians, and I'll keep Mitch distracted.
Really sweet kid.<eos> No!<eos> Hey! Hey, hey, look.<eos> - Easy.<eos> - That's Willow and Preston. They're the other roommates.<eos> They're all really close, been living here for about a year.<eos> Oh, I can't believe this is happening.<eos> I'm sorry, Ms. Hartman, could you, uh... - Could you give us a minute?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> So, what are you two doing here?
I am. I'm going to give him mannitol, and start a nicardipine drip to lower his I.C.P, buy some time for the specialist to arrive.<eos> If that doesn't work, then and only then will we take extreme measures.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, can you check the water seal on the chest tube on bed 3?<eos> - Yes, Doctor.<eos> - Dr. Leighton, dislocated shoulder.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's, uh... let's park him right here and, uh, give him 5 of morphine.<eos> Okay.<eos> You Angels doctors sure are making yourselves at home, huh?
Advance!<eos> Oh, my God, they're bringing in the Tacoma branch.<eos> You think this is gonna make a difference?<eos> You call in 100 more protestors, I will call in 200 more scabs!<eos> Then we'll just call in the Olympia branch.<eos> - Then I'll call in your...<eos> - Everyone stop! The reason we can't find a common ground is because nobody has bothered to think about what it's like to be the other guy.<eos> Deirdre!<eos> You have no idea what it's like to work in the warehouse.<eos> And you guys, you don't know how it feels to keep this place afloat, even for a day.
Jen and I come back from a night out with a little buzz. Things start getting a little hot, and then...<eos> Start picturing your mom and it's over.<eos> What? No.<eos> Jen starts talking to our babysitter.<eos> Next thing I know, it's two hours later. They've opened up a bottle of wine, started chatting, and I'm sitting there in my silk pajamas for nothing.<eos> You know, and those things got to get dry cleaned.<eos> Your sex window closed.<eos> Sex window?<eos> Yeah, you know, when you start having kids, you got a very small amount of time to have sex.<eos> It's usually right after the kids go to sleep and before you're so exhausted that you fall asleep. Yes!
We don't have all day.<eos> Back in line.<eos> Something's wrong. It's overheating.<eos> Gonna have to shut it down.<eos> No.<eos> The demonstration is not yet over.<eos> SUMAR: I can't stop it!<eos> No!<eos> Now that I have your attention, know this.<eos> Whatever you build here you will test personally.
I couldn't even describe it if I wanted to.<eos> And that is why you need to come with me, so I can retrieve the answers which are just out of reach.<eos> So you get your answers, but what do we get out of it?<eos> I will keep your rebel base secret.<eos> No deal.<eos> You're not walking off this rock in one piece.<eos> (CHUCKLING) I have planted a beacon nearby.<eos> Strike me down, and it will activate, revealing your presence to the Empire.<eos> You have knowledge that is rightfully mine.<eos> I have knowledge that you want.
Not a man.<eos> So this is profile number nine.<eos> Raphael Arnold, aka Damien Novak.<eos> He whipped up Raphael a couple months ago, made him a CPA based out of Queens.<eos> You said he was using this profile to hunt a woman?<eos> "Hunt" may be too strong a word, but it definitely looks like he was targeting her.<eos> He poked her a few times, tried to start up a conversation, but she never took the bait.<eos> While men don't hold a monopoly on sexual predation,<eos> Raphael is clearly of age, so he wouldn't attract our kind of predator.<eos> The woman he reached out to didn't look like a pervert, but you be the judge.
Drug laws in that part of the world... quite severe.<eos> He'll be spending the rest of his life in an Indonesian prison.<eos> I typically don't like such measures, but there's ample evidence that Fitzhugh's a threat to young women wherever he resides.<eos> If you feel I'm acting rashly...<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> You couldn't find a better hiding place for this thing?<eos> Hey, if I can find it, so can your parole officer.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Heard about your new friend, Ms. Watson.<eos> I understand you two been spending a lot of time together.
not that. Terry, you're on hair and makeup.<eos> I've seen your little girls' pigtails, so I know you can do it.<eos> They actually prefer my hair work to their mommy's.<eos> I love their little heads.<eos> Terry, what's going on, man?<eos> It's just a matter of time before I'm doing their hair at their weddings.<eos> It goes so fast.<eos> They're still babies!<eos> Pull it together, Jeffords!<eos> Scully and Hitchcock, you're in charge of seating.
- Enough!<eos> I'm so sick of this garbage, all right?<eos> The two of you need to stop looking for signs everywhere...<eos> oh, my God, a sign. Whoo!<eos> He can fly!<eos> Prop planes!<eos> You can fly, you can fly!<eos> I'm a vessel for the universe.<eos> Wow. The chairs look amazing.<eos> I can't believe you two aren't my biggest problem today.
The defense contractor, right?<eos> They helped build the lunar module.<eos> They're going to help build a lot more than that. I mean, spy satellites, fighter jets, drones, pretty much our entire national defense.<eos> Maybe this is about more than tanking the moonshot.<eos> Maybe this is about tanking Lockman too somehow.<eos> You think this Maria Thompkins is somehow tied into this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm gonna find out, though.<eos> Here.<eos> You two just make sure those astronauts get off the Moon.
I got Nick.<eos> Reagan's flying out from Seattle.<eos> And we're double-teaming him.<eos> Okay, listen to me very carefully, okay?<eos> You mean "tag-teaming."<eos> This is the exact same thing that happened when you handed that checkout guy coupons, and said that we'd been scissoring all day. Oh.<eos> He helped us with our bags.<eos> He was such a gentleman.<eos> No, he was not.<eos> Hey, what are you two doing here?
Let me go grab my calculator.<eos> We have a lot of work to do.<eos> One, two, three, four...<eos> - Whoa! Whoa.<eos> - Excuse me, uh,<eos> Deb, we need to check your trunk... we're looking for a package.<eos> It is addressed to Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo.<eos> What a stupid name.<eos> Tell it to your stupid wife, man... it's one of our inside jokes.<eos> You two don't have inside jokes.
"Gonna be a while."<eos> "Very emotional day."<eos> Ooh, I got dibs on the mini quiche!<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm worried about Oscar.<eos> He's putting on his brave face, but I can tell he's avoiding his pain... both dental and mental.<eos> I think he's coping pretty well.<eos> Yeah, he's holding up better than I would be.<eos> I cry when my phone dies.<eos> You can't see it, but as his dearest friend, I can tell you he is crying out for help.
You know something about secretly recording people.<eos> I didn't know you were married.<eos> Jessica died.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> Apparently I'm engaged.<eos> I've never met him before.<eos> I'm... I'm gonna go stay with my mom for a few days... or weeks.<eos> If you need to spend some time, figure things out first, do it.<eos> You've read the story of Jesse James and how he lived and died.<eos> If you're still in need of something to read, here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde.
It was part of a larger... And bolder strategy.<eos> Where's our mother?<eos> She's dead, ubbe.<eos> I killed her.<eos> Why?<eos> She took kattegat away from me.<eos> I wanted it back.<eos> Why didn't you also have us killed?<eos> This was nothing to do with you.<eos> You are ragnar's sons.
Well, I have to decide your fate. Yes.<eos> You sound like one of our gods.<eos> Well, I'm not a god.<eos> God forbid.<eos> The seer told me that I am fated to die the day the blind man sees me.<eos> But you...<eos> You have to kill me.<eos> Must we talk of death?<eos> Death has been uppermost on my mind for a long time.<eos> You vikings are incorrigible.
The gun?<eos> Please?<eos> You really want to risk killing George Washington?<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> - When he comes in, just nod and follow my lead.<eos> Or else I'll have Washington hang you for treason.<eos> Come on!<eos> Wyatt.<eos> Well...<eos> Are you who this man says you are?
We're gonna stop them before they ever get started.<eos> - We can't talk about this. - You're gonna hunt these people down,<eos> - and you want us to help you?<eos> - We can't talk about this.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of your secret little recorder?<eos> What?<eos> You don't think I know?<eos> Okay, I'll make this easy.<eos> You help me here, now, and I'll hand over the keys to the Mothership, all yours.
Here.<eos> Your journal.<eos> Show of faith.<eos> See for yourself how bad Rittenhouse really is.<eos> See in your own words.<eos> You're so full of crap, it's coming out of your ears.<eos> We're not gonna help you, not after everything we've been through.<eos> I figured you'd say that.<eos> So I'm sweetening the pot.<eos> You help me, and I'll tell you what happened on Portero Road, mile marker 47.
So I'm sweetening the pot.<eos> You help me, and I'll tell you what happened on Portero Road, mile marker 47.<eos> That's right, I'll give you the name of your wife's killer.<eos> You have no idea who could have done that.<eos> I'm not some local cop, Wyatt.<eos> I've still got some friends in the right places.<eos> There was blood on the scene, right, that wasn't Jessica's?<eos> That they never matched?<eos> Well, I know whose it was.<eos> So you help me get Benedict Arnold, no more Rittenhouse.
These are loyalists to the cause.<eos> Madam.<eos> They've come bearing gifts.<eos> So what's Washington's plan for his troops?<eos> Could we speak in private, sir?<eos> These are trustworthy men.<eos> Say what you've come to say.<eos> We've defected because of your example, General.<eos> We'd prefer to speak only with you.<eos> Well, Madam, I'm not sure you're in any place to make that decision.
- Son?<eos> - Yes, Father?<eos> Watch.<eos> It's important that you see this.<eos> No!<eos> Please don't hurt them in front of me.<eos> Now, John, what have I said about seeing the world as it really is?<eos> Yes, Father.<eos> You two are sentenced to death.<eos> But you... are to be brought to my bedchamber.
That was awesome.<eos> I mean, that was like... that looked like a cop-show entrance.<eos> Very Farrah Fawcett in Charlie's Angels.<eos> I approve.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hey, Elle.<eos> George, you just missed it.<eos> Sis, go back out, do it again.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> What-what are you three doing here?
At this hour? Mm-hmm.<eos> Job is 24/7.<eos> We will talk later.<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> So much easier when we could just read her diary.<eos> All right, so we have your numbers.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, glad you two could make it.
Oh, the masonry force is strong within you, Gibbs.<eos> Yeah, so I found residue of the clay on the gas pedal.<eos> Someone used this brick to depress the gas pedal and send the commander crashing through the guard rail and into that boulder.<eos> This was not an accident.<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, can we help you guys?<eos> We're waiting for Agent Bishop.<eos> Yeah, uh, NCIS Special Agent Eleanor Bishop.<eos> How cool does that sound, right?<eos> Oh. And who are you people?
Bishop's talked so much about you.<eos> It's good to put faces to the names.<eos> Hmm. So, uh, work with our sister?<eos> I do.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> It's, uh, been just over four years now, actually.<eos> I can't imagine this place without her, you know.<eos> Ah. You guys hear that?<eos> Sure did.<eos> Sounds like you two are pretty close.
- Oh, thank God.<eos> Even though I hate having to say nice things about that clown, the speech reads great.<eos> I just got a couple of tweaks. Hit me.<eos> You see here, when we say,<eos> "Rich Eisen is a good man who does good things"?<eos> Could we lose both of the "goods"?<eos> You want it to read, "Rich Eisen is a man who has done things"?<eos> Yeah, that's better.<eos> Two questions:<eos> What time is the banquet tomorrow, and was it just me, or did you get the sense that Emily wants me back?
We thought you were coming back to the tent.<eos> I don't want to be anywhere near that tent.<eos> Or that camp. Or them. Or this ridiculous, endless war.<eos> What did they say?<eos> It's what they didn't say.<eos> "Yes, Emperor. "Excellent point, Emperor.<eos> They don't care what I think.<eos> You see, I'm not my father, so I don't exist.<eos> They'll just keep doing what they want to do and... and they'll never respect me.<eos> You're the Emperor of Rome. They don't have to respect you.
Perhaps I put too much on myself.<eos> But everything I've done, I've done for you.<eos> My loyalty cannot be questioned.<eos> With your permission, Emperor. I have someone, I believe, who can speak to Cleander's loyalty.<eos> You and I both know Dio cannot be trusted.<eos> Remember the lands with the military?<eos> He's betrayed us before, he's only trying--<eos> Tell him.<eos> I, uh...<eos> You understand, Emperor, the awkward situation--
An excellent idea, Emperor.<eos> I'm sure I speak for all the Senate when I say I cannot wait to watch these games by your side.<eos> No, Dio.<eos> My place will not be in the Imperial box, but on the battleground.<eos> The greatest games in our history will have its greatest gladiator as well, the Emperor himself.<eos> Emperor, gladiators are slaves.<eos> The Emperor cannot be--<eos> I'm not asking for your permission, Dio.<eos> The Senate will be in attendance.<eos> You and all of Rome will bear witness to my triumph.
So this morning, I actually removed a sign from this courtroom.<eos> It was big, and it was noticeable, and it's been on that wall for the entire length of this trial.<eos> So, can anyone tell me what it said?<eos> Nobody?<eos> How can you be sure they won't remember?<eos> Okay, right.<eos> I should have learned to trust you and your witchcraft by now.<eos> It's not witchcraft.<eos> It's science.<eos> John read that road sign the way you all read that courtroom sign, but he dismissed it, just like you did, because it wasn't relevant.
We lost the caroling competition.<eos> And now we hate singing.<eos> Almost as much as we hate the MTA.<eos> Yeah, so we should prank call their tip line with a series of well-crafted insults.<eos> We should toilet paper their houses.<eos> - With rocks.<eos> - Come on, guys.<eos> Getting back at people isn't what Christmas is all about.<eos> It's about being together, as a family.<eos> So you can plot your petty revenge, but I, for one, am gonna carol my heart out.
Jeep has no plates.<eos> We put a BOLO out anyway.<eos> Mysterious white Jeep.<eos> Heather Cobb's beaten to death, her house ransacked, her nephew traumatized.<eos> - Why? - Well, we're still not sure, 'cause Heather was a straight arrow.<eos> Masters from Berklee College of Music, played trumpet in the Navy Jazz Band, and in her free time, she taught the kids at Crescent City Music Academy.<eos> Yeah, basically, she was Mary Poppins.<eos> Well, someone wanted her dead.<eos> Let's dig into her life.<eos> You two talk to the Navy Band, I'll hit the music academy.
I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren't naturally warm.<eos> I didn't know her five minutes and she asked,<eos> (like Mrs. Wolowitz): "Are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?"<eos> Thank God you answered right, we wouldn't be here today.<eos> It's hard to believe Howard's having a kid.<eos> Penny, you're the one who introduced him to Bernie.<eos> How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?<eos> It's not just Howard and Bernadette.<eos> I mean, look how far we've all come. Hmm. Hmm.<eos> You two got married.
- Aww. Well, you were a teenager, and teenagers do dumb things.<eos> Yeah, well, even people over 21 do dumb things.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Like the time I bought the glue-on nails at the gas station.<eos> Luckily, the numbness stopped at the elbows.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Hey, Sue, come on!<eos> Look at the tree!<eos> Oh, it's amazing!<eos> You two must be really proud of everything you've accomplished what with all the other things that need to get done around here.
Look at the tree!<eos> Oh, it's amazing!<eos> You two must be really proud of everything you've accomplished what with all the other things that need to get done around here.<eos> Well, you've got to come around and look at the whole thing.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I-I can picture it.<eos> I am just glad everyone is having a very merry Christmas.<eos> Nobody's having heartburn, no random vomiting or twisting your hair till it falls right out of your head.<eos> That is awesome!<eos> I am thrilled that you two are free to enjoy the wonders of the season.
I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren't naturally warm.<eos> I didn't know her five minutes and she asked,<eos> "Are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?"<eos> Thank God you answered right, we wouldn't be here today.<eos> It's hard to believe Howard's having a kid.

Hmm.<eos> You two got married.
I'm a milkshake.<eos> Well, that's the dream.<eos> Enjoy your coats!<eos> While my dad was cutting out on his party,<eos> I was cutting together some b-ball greatness.<eos> ("Sweet Georgia Brown" plays)<eos> And that, my friends, is what we call the magic of editing.<eos> You made it look like we totally crushed them.<eos> We... suck!<eos> You... dominate... at sports.
(ALTRU PANTING) GAMORA: I have a visual on the fugitive.<eos> Closing in now.<eos> Nowhere to run, Altru.<eos> (GRUNTS) Ah. And that, folks, is why they call Gamora the most dangerous turnstile in the galaxy.<eos> I was tracking bounties for Thanos while you two were still lab experiments.
Say what now?<eos> Just do as I request.<eos> NEEZA: Bring it here, precious.<eos> In such matters one can never be too careful.<eos> Listen.<eos> The very air hums with evil spirits that would beggar me if they could.<eos> This keeps them at bay.<eos> To the dungeon with that one.<eos> Oh, please, sir, mercy.<eos> Now I suppose you bounty hunters wish to claim your reward.
(SCREAMS) All right!<eos> All right!<eos> Hmm. That's it.<eos> (POWERING UP) Meet my spirit blaster.<eos> ROCKET: I'm starting to see why you hate this holiday, Quill.<eos> Eat plasmacid, inferna<eos> Dude! Hey, remember us?<eos> Not ghosts.<eos> (GASPS) You!<eos> You're worse than ghosts.
There's no fishing. You can't fish.<eos> Tourists have also disappeared and there is no development.<eos> The village people are divided and argue every day.<eos> All because of that thing!<eos> But still, thanks to it, we have a life now.<eos> My mom is also grateful to that thing.<eos> Without it, would we die of hunger?<eos> Not really, but still...<eos> This is the problem. This.<eos> Are you all happy living like this?
No more sad, fake tree.<eos> A real one, to cherish and, after a month, drag to the sidewalk and dump, where it will mock us for weeks while we shout, "Who was supposed to pick this up?<eos> Is there a number we can call?"<eos> D-Does Rockefeller Center know it's missing?<eos> This beautiful tree is a symbol of what our Christmas will be like this year...<eos> Big, big, big, and sappy!<eos> "Why?" Because, for the first time ever, I am full of Christmas spirit.<eos> I believe in the goodness of my fellow man.<eos> I mean, it's been a fantastic year.<eos> You kids are in a great new school.
I know I set the parking brake.<eos> Someone must have broken in and undone it.<eos> Very sad.<eos> At Christmas.<eos> "Do we have to retu..."<eos> We have to return the new van.<eos> A least we have our gifts now.<eos> Some gifts are so big that they can't even fit in the van.<eos> Welcome to dance-team tryouts.<eos> I'll demonstrate, and you can come up and try.
[Guynes] It's a wonder that the riot didn't kick off way before it did.<eos> It was just like one of them times where the guys just say, "We're gonna show you."<eos> [Snodgrass] I really had a lot of aggression and a lot of hatred for the system.<eos> They took me away from my family and sent me to prison when I was 17 years old.<eos> You've gotta understand, I was forced to fight every day in order to survive.<eos> You're either gonna become a solid dude, or you're gonna be a little bitch.<eos> I learned the best thing to do is stand up for yourself at all times.<eos> Okay, I'm locked in here, but still, I'm a human being.<eos> Still I'm a man.<eos> Still I want that respect that you want.
So I'm trying to pull... everything from the reserve tank. [chuckles]<eos> I said, "Look, assaulting L-Block right now is only gonna cause a lot more bloodshed, and we don't need that."<eos> Well, it worked.<eos> After that little speech, I went back into a restroom.<eos> I totally lost it.<eos> So... I got it...<eos> I pulled it together and things started happening pretty quickly then.<eos> I know in my heart that tonight's the night.<eos> I know that.<eos> I know that if we don't go out there and do something, as you've got it set up, and you're blowing and coming in here.
So in the book, they were basically saying you need to wear them down.<eos> You need to wear down their psyche, their mentality... And that's what they were doing, day after day.<eos> They were slowly trying to wear us down.<eos> We just had to incorporate what they had in the manual. We just had to use reverse psychology on them.<eos> We had to do to them what they were doing to us, basically.<eos> Jason, Jason, Jason...<eos> Now we can play these games.<eos> This "Jason, Jason, Jason" shit. Okay?<eos> Now, we're not going to play games.<eos> The cards are in our hands, and you understand that.

I've given you national media.<eos> Oh, but you got two officers.
[Schwartz] The first thing I said to them when I sat down, I said,<eos> "I'm not always gonna be able to tell you what you wanna hear... but I'm not gonna give you any bullshit."<eos> [Robb] I'm pretty good at reading people, and he was sincere.<eos> [Hasan] To me, he was a man that believed in standing up for truth, justice and equality, no matter who he was for or against.<eos> You have to trust somebody like that.<eos> They were bright. They were articulate. They seemed to have leadership skills, and I think if life had dealt them different cards at an earlier stage, they could have been responsible members of society.<eos> I handed them a two-page document that had 21 points, a response to the inmates' 21 demands.<eos> Their first concern was, "Is this legally binding?"<eos> And I said, "No way.<eos> You're holding hostages. They're free to repudiate this agreement as soon as they get the hostages back.
Yeah, well, it's a pretty fair thing to think, isn't it?<eos> Did Hamish ever tell you where he met me? Uh, nope.<eos> Never came up in the nine years we weren't speaking.<eos> We met in a support group for people with terminally ill loved ones.<eos> It was the absolute worst year of our lives.<eos> We'd go to those meetings and drink the cheap tea and listen to sad sacks as miserable as we were.<eos> But it was a way to avoid going home.<eos> I needed him at home.<eos> I know.<eos> And that's for you two to work out.

What was going to happen to us?<eos> [gun fires] [man on TV] Any rescue effort would be risky.<eos> In April, a French military operation to free a yacht hijacked by Somali pirates resulted in the death of one of the hostages.<eos> [Walker] It took seven hours of trying to make contact, but we managed to get through to the Chandlers and made sure that Rachel had a chance to speak to her brother.<eos> We think of you all the time.<eos> [Rachel] I'm sure you do.<eos> Please, try not to worry about us.<eos> We're working to persuade the people that are releasing you.<eos> We're appealing to their compassionate nature.<eos> We know and you know that you're blameless tourists, and, you know, you have nothing of value to them.
[Collett] Yes.<eos> Yes. We cannot negotiate in millions.<eos> We must negotiate in thousands, because there is no insurance, there is no government.<eos> Just me and the money that I can get for you.<eos> [Collett] Some of the family strongly felt that a ransom shouldn't be paid.<eos> Then others wanted to pay a ransom as quick as we could to get it all over.<eos> I had fairly recently sold a farm.<eos> And I said to my wife, "We will use this money as we need."<eos> I would be the negotiator as long as I was working with my money and my money alone.<eos> [on recording] You do not agree with our small amount of 20,000, and we do not agree with your big amount of two million.
No one was really looking for them.<eos> The only leverage you had was time.<eos> [man] There are no certainties and, you know, some kidnappings don't end well.<eos> It's important for the family to understand who it is they're negotiating with.<eos> They're not negotiating with people with morals.<eos> They're negotiating with extortionists, people who kidnap, who mistreat, who sometimes torture people.<eos> Scumbags.<eos> [Paul] Buggas came and said,<eos> "Stephen no speak, no money.<eos> No money, you dead."
It's a village... a humble village.<eos> And yet skyscrapers in London, Washington, everywhere... they seek Bethlehem's blessing.<eos> [Lotan] Salah Tamari was very impressive.<eos> No doubt it is by his personality, his appearance...<eos> I was very confident that he was pragmatic enough and... he's not seeking for using this siege or this theater for other cause than to solve it peacefully.<eos> We met him downstairs to express our honor and our basic approach to him.<eos> He was very committed to his people and to his position as their leader.<eos> I just wanted to free... the Bethlehem area... from the horrors of the church siege.<eos> [Lotan] The basic trade was,<eos> "We will let you evacuate the two bodies, if you will let nine youngsters to go out.
And their advice was,<eos> "Call the embassies of all these people who've been kidnapped.<eos> Call them, now."<eos> [Dan O'Shea] The report came in that there'd been a major kidnapping, and it involved an American, a Brit, two Canadians.<eos> So it obviously became our number one priority case.<eos> [Stewart Henderson] I got word two Canadians had been kidnapped.<eos> And the British ambassador had said,<eos> "We are putting together a task force.<eos> We have people coming from London.<eos> I assume that you will be having people coming from Ottawa."
They wanted to dishevel my hair so that I looked more desperate than I was and I said,<eos> "No, I've got my dignity.<eos> You jolly well leave my hair alone", which they did.<eos> I'm a friend of Iraq.<eos> I have been opposed to this war, Mr. Blair's war, since the very beginning.<eos> But I ask him now and the British government to work for my release and the release of the Iraqi people from oppression.<eos> I plead for my release from captivity, and I also plead for release from captivity of all the people of Iraq.<eos> [Black] We saw the British and American hostage actually in chains, and certainly that sent us a clear message.<eos> Al-Qaeda and other groups would put American and Western, British hostages, in orange jumpsuits before they beheaded them and basically would say,<eos> "You have hostages. We have hostages.

But if you don't mind, maybe you can explain one thing to me.<eos> Why is it even news?<eos> Who gives a fuck who I fuck?<eos> This is the 21st century, people.<eos> Get over it!<eos> This is insane.<eos> You can't go out there.<eos> Fuck these pirañas!<eos> Come to my house.<eos> You took me in.
But there are others, collaborators, networks of recruiters working for BPO.<eos> I keep having visions... of Angelica.<eos> I keep seeing her in a... in a cabin.<eos> The cabin.<eos> First place I ever considered a home.<eos> But I've never been there.<eos> How can I see that?<eos> A genetic birth transfers genes.<eos> A sensate birth transfers sense experience and memory.<eos> You are Angelica's children, so parts of her consciousness still echo in you.
We did it your way.<eos> Now we're gonna do it my way.<eos> And how do you suggest we do that?<eos> I know where to find a manager on a Saturday night in Atlanta.<eos> He's throwing dollar bills at some poor girl's ass.<eos> No.<eos> We cannot go-go in Atlanta.<eos> Girl, the important men ain't at no go-go bars anyway.<eos> I'm confused about where you just came from.<eos> And I know you ain't think that y'all was about to win at that dump.
Who's stopping you?<eos> You always talk to me like this, even if you're saying something good!<eos> Wait.<eos> Oh, hello, Ji Soo's mother!<eos> Oh, yes, yes!<eos> Oh, it's nothing.<eos> Dear you, who was just caught in the rain:<eos> what was the thing that became your umbrella?<eos> A voice that answers when you call?<eos> A memory of you two having shared the same view?
I'm not paying for him.<eos> What's gotten into you?<eos> I thought you hated fruits.<eos> What about you?<eos> Are you killing someone in the area?<eos> I'm a regular here.<eos> Is it me?<eos> Am I dying here today?<eos> Did I... get lured in by meat... and then get caught in the trap with this juice?<eos> Are you two really a team?
He isn't the type of guy to drink and drive.<eos> I can't understand it either.<eos> Since that day was my second son's last day of vacation from the military service,<eos> We decided to eat altogether.<eos> But, why?<eos> Why did he drink and go all the way there?<eos> It seems like an intentional accident.<eos> How could it be?<eos> The police says it's a driving under the influence case.<eos> It will just make things harder for you to think that way.
- ...made me feel like I was...<eos> - ...braver than I was.<eos> - Funnier.<eos> - Smarter.<eos> They made me feel that I could do things that I...<eos> - ...made me believe I could do things...<eos> I didn't think think I could do.<eos> But that boy who watched TV with his mama mama, and grandma, and aunties and aunties, is not the man who became an actor.<eos> ...not the man who became a driver.<eos> That driver is not the same person you see standing here.
- Where I'm from?<eos> - What I do?<eos> What I've done?<eos> - What I do?<eos> - What I dream?<eos> - What I dream?<eos> What I do?<eos> What I've done?<eos> - What I do?<eos> - What I've done? Do you mean... what you see?
- What I've lost?<eos> - Do you mean what I've lost?<eos> Do you mean what I've lost?<eos> Who am I?<eos> - Who am I?<eos> - Who am I?<eos> - Who am I?<eos> - Who am I?<eos> - I guess who I am is...<eos> - ...exactly the same as who you are.
Hello?<eos> Guardian?<eos> Have a good look around?<eos> Get some ideas what you're going to do with the place once it's yours?<eos> Guardian, I renounced my vow.<eos> I didn't want to come here.<eos> I swear, Guardian!<eos> I urged them to find you.<eos> I told them.<eos> You should be the one to explain.
For the Horde!<eos> For the Horde!<eos> Stop!<eos> You dare interrupt this judgment?<eos> We fought hard.<eos> Their warlock used your Fel against us.<eos> Only I can control the Fel!<eos> I see you and your men have survived.<eos> Perhaps Blackhand kept you safely away from the battlefield?<eos> Maybe he knows you're weak, too.
All I need is a name.<eos> His Serene Highness, King Leopold of Belgium, has extended an invitation to Lord Greystoke to take a royal tour of the Congo Free State to visit the schools and churches he's built to acknowledge the success of his anti-slavery initiatives<eos> and to open trade discussions.<eos> Lord Greystoke, let me explain the Africa situation.<eos> King Leopold controls the Congo.<eos> He's defaulting on his loans, and needs a business partner to fill the gap.<eos> Your invitation is a perfect opportunity for Her Majesty's government to get involved.<eos> Consider the jobs we would create for the poor natives of the Congo.<eos> And I thought the Civil War was long.<eos> Dr. Williams, you are a guest here.

And what exactly do you want, Dr. Williams?<eos> Leopold spent the last seven years getting control of the Congo.<eos> He used up his entire fortune building that railroad of his, then shut off access to 99% of the country.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he wants to be the first monarch in history who doesn't want people to see his good deeds?<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> T ell me this, Lord Clayton. How does a bankrupt king keep the whole of the Congo working?<eos> Slavery?<eos> I hope I'm wrong, but I need to know.<eos> And for the sake of your friends back home, you do, too.

I manipulated my firm to keep this deal alive.<eos> You agreed because you'll get stinking rich, so don't get trutty.<eos> Now, you must buy us more time.<eos> I already bought all the time...<eos> Look, it's really very easy.<eos> You sail out to the arriving fleet and tell them payment must be made in Boma for security reasons.<eos> Opar had better not be a myth.<eos> Bring me the rest, and you'll have your mercenaries.<eos> But if you fail to make good this time, my firm will go to the Belgian parliament for compensation.<eos> Your king will lose this land, and who do you think he will blame?
I spent over half my life in the wilds.<eos> Besides, nobody here is better than me with a rifle.<eos> That one right there, he'd still be choked out redder than a cardinal's ass if it weren't for me. And that's...<eos> You think I care about my life?<eos> Get your mitts off me!<eos> - If you had just...<eos> - If I'd just what?<eos> Left you in England in your castle?<eos> They have my wife and their families.<eos> Whoever you are, we're here by royal invitation.
You do know that the right side of your mustache is just a little lower than the left?<eos> Different kind of wilds.<eos> How are we supposed to catch a train going 40 miles an hour?<eos> Gravity.<eos> Shit!<eos> Climb on my back.<eos> Right. Legs, too.<eos> Don't think for a second you're saving my life.<eos> Give me the keys to the chains.<eos> Are you the commander?
Please!<eos> Shut it, clucker!<eos> Now, if you do anything unladylike in there, he drowns.<eos> Enjoying your peep show?<eos> Of course I know you can see me, Lady Clayton.<eos> Are you a religious man, Mr. Rom?<eos> Oh.<eos> No. Madagascar spider silk.<eos> My priest purchased it for me in Jerusalem when I was nine.<eos> Sounds like you and your priest were awfully close.
! - It won't happen again.<eos> - Get him a haircut and some proper clothes.<eos> - According to insider reports Coach Feola is struggling with his new recruits during their first month of practices.<eos> But since fans called for replacing virtually the entire team after the disaster of 1950 and the disgrace of '54 the coach was left with few options outside of inexperienced and unconventional players.<eos> The bulky midfielder, Zito bent-legged striker, Mane Garrincha. And the youngster, Dico Nascimento who made headlines last month for his outburst at the inaugural banquet much to the chagrin of Coach Feola.<eos> Teaching Brazilians to play the same disciplined formations of the European teams seems challenging enough. But the coaching staff appears to also be encouraging a more refined presentation off the field.<eos> - Why all the fuss?<eos> - It's about changing that image.<eos> We don't want to arrive in Sweden and have the world say, "Oh, there's Brazil."<eos> - Yes. But you are Brazilian, aren't you?
But if you look very closely... and examine the children, they have... all been killed in a similar manner.<eos> So what you're saying is somebody is responsible for this?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And this somebody is still out there.<eos> Yes.<eos> A murderer.<eos> - You're saying there's a murderer?<eos> - Without doubt.<eos> You do realize there are no murderers in paradise?<eos> So you two are working together now?
- I can't bring your parents back.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> It's not possible.<eos> I would like to.<eos> Of course, I would.<eos> But I can't.<eos> And I am sorry.<eos> I am truly very sorry.<eos> We won't take you, if you don't want to come with us.
Of course, I would.<eos> But I can't.<eos> And I am sorry.<eos> I am truly very sorry.<eos> We won't take you, if you don't want to come with us.<eos> - We can find you another family.<eos> - Yes.<eos> We promise you.<eos> We won't leave you here.<eos> Now we will go out for a walk and you can think about it.
No more phones, honey.<eos> This isn't a luxury item, Dad.<eos> It's a necessity.<eos> What if you need to reach me in an emergency?<eos> We can't afford it, honey.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> What are you being so selfish about?<eos> That's bullshit!<eos> If you want a new phone, you could get a part-time job.<eos> I'll get a job when you get a job.
Watch out.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Your dad... he's been out of work a while, right?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Nobody's perfect.<eos> I was just thinking about it. If he really wanted to make some money quick... a poltergeist abduction isn't a bad idea.<eos> Even if it turned out to be a fake.<eos> You go public with it, you do some TV appearances.<eos> - You get your own reality show.
Mom!<eos> - Hold on!<eos> - Mom! Mom!<eos> Come on, baby. Come on.<eos> Mommy!<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Pull!<eos> Pull!<eos> Release your hold on this family... as you yourselves wish to be released...
You're not real, slappy.<eos> I created you.<eos> I can write you out.<eos> I've been saving this monster just for you.<eos> Say hello to my gelatinous friend.<eos> It's the blob that ate everyone.<eos> Don't let it touch you.<eos> We need to get to higher ground.<eos> The Ferris wheel.<eos> Zach, you go on ahead.
What happened?<eos> Are my parents all right?<eos> - Your parents?<eos> Is everyone all right?<eos> - Yes, everyone is fine.<eos> - We're surprising you.<eos> - We're taking you out to lunch.<eos> Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> Today I'm hosting, and I'd love if you ordered the most expensive items on the menu.
It's important.<eos> I, um...<eos> I didn't think you were coming in today, they said you weren't...<eos> I am so sorry, Davis.<eos> Thank you, Amy.<eos> When you get a minute, can I get the revenue numbers on Alderman International?<eos> And can you push my lunch with Bob Rice?<eos> I got a lot of catching up to do.<eos> Yeah...<eos> I handed you people a billion dollars' worth of committed capital and all you can give me is 150 million dollars' worth of companies to buy.
What are you guys eating?<eos> Noodles?<eos> Ugh, big mistake.<eos> Noodles have got, like, no energy in them.<eos> I mean, like, zero.<eos> I'm Mary Ellen.<eos> Is that your tent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, big mistake.<eos> They must have seen you coming at the camping store.
Yes!<eos> Your majesty...<eos> Your humble servant.<eos> Magnus, I take umbrage at your splendid attire.<eos> If Your Majesty wishes, I shall take everything off.<eos> And I should take umbrage all the more.<eos> May I introduce you to Monsieur Pierre Chanut, France's distinguished ambassador to our country. Your Majesty.<eos> Monsieur.<eos> Despite our religious differences, Sweden accepts France, the eldest daughter of the Church of Rome, as our greatest ally.<eos> We are stealing souls from the Holy German Empire, while you are stealing their provinces.
I want to make my country the most sophisticated country in Europe.<eos> Let us become curious and make Stockholm the new Athens!<eos> To achieve this dream... We must tackle the greatest challenge in the history of this country...<eos> Peace!<eos> Peace?<eos> We must bring an end to these years of war with the Holy Roman Empire.<eos> With the Catholics? !<eos> Nothing is more difficult than peace.<eos> Thirty years of war... Thousands and thousands of deaths to ensure that Luther's faith, prevails over the North of this continent.<eos> And you would like us to abandon these goals? !
This is her majesty, Queen Kristina of Sweden!<eos> And when the queen speaks, she commands!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait...<eos> I shall protect you.<eos> I shall love you, day and night.<eos> Marry me!<eos> What?<eos> Make me your king!<eos> I have just introduced myself and presented my plans to the world and you are talking to me about marriage.
Marry me!<eos> What?<eos> Make me your king!<eos> I have just introduced myself and presented my plans to the world and you are talking to me about marriage.<eos> The moon has barely risen on the first day of my reign, and I've already received countless proposals.<eos> The Great Elector of Brandenburg, the King of Hungary.<eos> Even Philip of Spain!<eos> An incurable syphilitic!<eos> Am I just a pawn for the taking?<eos> You don't need those kings, you have me!
But beware of facial expressions.<eos> They do not always reveal the truth since, we can willfully control our facial expressions.<eos> To hide one passion, we can imagine another, quite the opposite.<eos> But, for the time being, you should love.<eos> You can reason afterwards.<eos> These are for me?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> It's a present from Johan.<eos> - Is he serious?<eos> Perhaps you... neglected these things for too long...
There is no better position than that of a lady-in-waiting.<eos> None sire, none.<eos> There is only one way for you to remain in her service.<eos> That is against God's will!<eos> Is fornicating outside of wedlock, a Christian act?<eos> But I love him...<eos> Of course...<eos> Of course you do...<eos> I will see that they deal with this thing in your belly.<eos> And you can be helpful to me, Countess Erksein.
I had to flee France because I questioned, the real presence of Christ in the communion host.<eos> I had to flee Holland, because I glimpsed;<eos> It is the earth, that gravitates around the sun.<eos> I'm convinced we can determine our destiny.<eos> But I am free, Your Majesty.<eos> I do not have a kingdom to govern.<eos> Twenty-five states and principalities... have signed, the Westphalia treaty!<eos> Glory to you, your Majesty!<eos> From now on, every monarch can choose the religion in his state.<eos> May you use this disposition wisely.
Kristina?<eos> - Kristina!<eos> - It's the Devil!<eos> Every blow... every blade that wounded... every charge on horseback...<eos> Every move I made bore your name!<eos> I brought you the treasure.<eos> I brought you the devil!<eos> Let go of her!<eos> You're going to marry me!<eos> - You're going to marry me! - Let go of her!
It would be inappropriate for the goddess of peace not to bless their union.<eos> I wish you all the happiness in the world.<eos> Will your generosity extend to attend our wedding?<eos> This excursion has exhausted me!<eos> The queen blessed our union!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Please open the door!<eos> Let me explain!<eos> They made me understand.<eos> You are the shepherd of our nation!
This excursion has exhausted me!<eos> The queen blessed our union!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Please open the door!<eos> Let me explain!<eos> They made me understand.<eos> You are the shepherd of our nation!<eos> It wasn't right.<eos> It was all wrong, very wrong.<eos> You are my sovereign, I had to love you...
It was all wrong, very wrong.<eos> You are my sovereign, I had to love you...<eos> She doesn't want to see you.<eos> His blood is yellow...<eos> This is not a case of pneumonia, it's arsenic.<eos> Any other diagnosis would be harmful to both my church and yours.<eos> Petite, petite...<eos> Oh my friend...<eos> Madam...<eos> Count Jakob Kazimir de la Gardie, do you take, Countess Ebba Sparre, to be your lawfully wedded wife?
- You knew I'd come back?<eos> - I had high hopes.<eos> You remember Agent Cowles?<eos> I should say "Dr." Cowles, - with a doctorate in...?<eos> - Psychopathology.<eos> She was to become a professor before the bureau snagged her.<eos> - You gave up academia for this madhouse?<eos> - They let me carry a gun.<eos> So sexy.<eos> You two will make a good team.
I will tell you in two words who I am, what I do, and how I live."<eos> What about that riddle?<eos> - It's not a riddle. - What is it?<eos> "Le diro con due parole, chi son, e che faccio, come vivo."<eos> - So the killer is an opera nut.<eos> That really helps with the profile. - Thank you, Clancy.<eos> - No. I'm the nut. I'm the opera nut.<eos> I happened to be listening to those lines, the very moment I read your case files.<eos> - I... I don't get it.<eos> - He knew I'd be listening to that music. He knew that you would ask me to help. He knew we would arrive at the apartment at exactly 4:16 am.
Genisys is an operating system?<eos> What does it do?<eos> Genisys does everything.<eos> My phone will link to my tablet will link to my computer will link to my car...<eos> Everything in my life uploaded and online 24/7.<eos> Totally connected.<eos> Connected to what?<eos> Doctors!<eos> Excuse us, please.<eos> You two have a lotto explain.
You can't hold us here.<eos> You had enough weapons to invade the Sudan.<eos> We call that probable cause.<eos> What are these for?<eos> I use them to find my keys.<eos> No one likes a smart-ass, son.<eos> Didn't your mother teach you that?<eos> My mom was Irish, so she encouraged my smart-assed-ness.<eos> I've never seen him before.<eos> How about you folks? You know this man?
Mankind pays lip service to peace.<eos> But it's a lie.<eos> So your final solution is to kill us all?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> The countdown jumped again.<eos> We're down to eight minutes.<eos> I won't allow this.<eos> And what are you gonna do, talk us to death?<eos> You don't even have a body.<eos> And you only have one detonator.
Sarah!<eos> The detonators destroyed.<eos> There's got to be another way.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, Pops!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Pops, no!<eos> I understand how to control this place.<eos> I understand a lot of things now.<eos> You need to understand. You've lost.
There's a lot I can tell you. I need guarantees first.<eos> Fuck you. You don't get no guarantees.<eos> You talk or you walk.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whitey Bulger planned to murder Roger Wheeler, that jai alai dude from Tulsa. It's been on the news and everything.<eos> - Tulsa? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> So, what does some random jai alai guy in Tulsa have to do with Whitey Bulger?<eos> Whitey was pulling down some serious coin in jai alai until Wheeler bought the fucking thing, and he didn't want to cut Whitey in for a piece.<eos> So...<eos> You two know anything about this?
Let's go.<eos> Tripod.<eos> - Tripod. - Yes, sir.<eos> Assemble the COs and the troops and bivouac outside of town.<eos> I'm taking Two-I-C and the boys to all celebrate tonight.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> You will see.<eos> You will like it.<eos> And if you and Strika are my bodyguards, and I am going, then you are also going.
"How does a man come to know the unknowable?<eos> "Sincerely, Herman Melville."<eos> We're closed.<eos> No boarders after 8:00.<eos> You came.<eos> Someone here for you, my love.<eos> Tom Nickerson?<eos> Herman Melville.<eos> We received your letter.<eos> You're either a desperate man or a fool to come all the way to Nantucket.
There are rumblings.<eos> Rumors that the Essex was...<eos> What do you want?<eos> What story do you expect to hear?<eos> That of the whale.<eos> The Essex ran aground.<eos> There was a full inquiry.<eos> I believe the inquiry was less than truthful.<eos> Get out.<eos> You are the last survivor of the Essex, sir.

You listen well.<eos> Who holds this place together while you drink yourself to death?<eos> You will talk with this man as much as is necessary to keep the money.<eos> You know our circumstances, Thomas.<eos> Only as much as is necessary.<eos> I'll get whiskey.<eos> I neglected to mention it in my letter, but I was a whaler once.<eos> One trip, I mean.<eos> Green hand.<eos> So, you've seen it all.
A new record.<eos> £50 sterling for head matter on the London market.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Chase.<eos> - Mr. Mason.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> My partner, Benjamin Fuller.<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> Do sit down.<eos> Mr. Chase. I do hope you realize how satisfied we are with the work you've done for us over the years.
Good morning, sir.<eos> Do sit down.<eos> Mr. Chase. I do hope you realize how satisfied we are with the work you've done for us over the years.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Now, one of our ships, the Essex, has just been refitted at great expense and is to go to sea.<eos> Now, having made such an investment in her, we want to be sure she's in the best possible hands.<eos> So, it gives us great pleasure to offer you a position aboard her.<eos> As first mate.<eos> As first mate?<eos> Mr. Mason, you promised me command of a ship after my last voyage when I brought you back 1,500 barrels.
Nantucket now dominates the world market.<eos> That must not change.<eos> This is no time for experimentation.<eos> The Essex will be captained by George Pollard, scion of a great whaling family.<eos> His father also happens to be ourpatron.<eos> Blood, Mr. Chase.<eos> You can have all the voyages under your belt you want, but blood will always win out.<eos> Yes, well, blood is not gonna fill a ship with oil, Mr. Mason.<eos> To successfully command, a captain needs respect. Now, what if the men don't respect him?<eos> You will make sure that they do.
- No, sir.<eos> Like I said, sometimes the fewer questions one asks, the better.<eos> Serve that food up.<eos> Getting this slop on the first day?<eos> Cheap bastards. Where's the meat?<eos> That's a gorgeous girl, Mr. Chappel.<eos> A vision of beauty, that. Carved on a varnished whale bone.<eos> - Let me have a touch.<eos> - Don't touch.<eos> I thought you were married, anyway.
I thought you were married, anyway.<eos> I am, and there she is.<eos> Well, that's her nose, anyway.<eos> Congratulations, ladies.<eos> That was a fine job trimming sails today.<eos> A sorrier pack of deck wallopers I don't think I've ever seen.<eos> Mr. Chappel.<eos> - Sir!<eos> - You're Captain's harpooner.<eos> Mr. Lawrence, you'll be mine.
The men needed testing.<eos> So you send them into a storm?<eos> That was unlucky.<eos> No, it was bad seamanship.<eos> And blaming misfortune is just plain weakness.<eos> Damn your impertinence!<eos> Do you know who you're speaking to?<eos> My name is Captain George Pollard.<eos> Pollard!<eos> And you, Mr. Chase, no matter how many whale pins you may have on your lapel, are nothing more than the son of a farmer who's managed to bully his way into an officer's tunic.
Now get out.<eos> To return to port without a single barrel of oil would be a mistake, sir.<eos> And not behoove a man whose name is Pollard.<eos> Or Chase, for that matter.<eos> And the best thing for both of us would be to work all hours God sends us, fill this ship with oil and be home inside a year and rid of one another as quickly as possible.<eos> Trust me, I am every bit as desirous of that as you.<eos> Of course, that is a captain's decision.<eos> They were like an ill-married couple.<eos> An ill-married couple will tolerate each other, Mr. Melville. But an ill-married couple can also bring down a ship.<eos> Are you married, Mr. Melville?
Why waste water?<eos> Why waste?<eos> Why waste water on a dead man?<eos> Mr. Nickerson?<eos> - Why waste water...<eos> - You all right, sir?<eos> - I cannot.<eos> - Cannot what?<eos> No, you...<eos> You have enough.
No ship is going to come.<eos> If we stay, we die.<eos> How long do you think it'll take the tropic birds to stop coming here once they see their eggs eaten?<eos> It's a privilege to know the moment of one's death in advance, be able to prepare for it.<eos> Curse to be so far from home without a chance to say goodbyes, without a chance to make peace, without a chance to settle the scores.<eos> Then let us at least settle those between us, Captain.<eos> Captain of what?<eos> The Essex was lost through no fault of yours.<eos> I was as much to blame for...<eos> You are not the captain.
You judge me.<eos> No.<eos> There.<eos> There.<eos> It is done.<eos> It is out.<eos> And you've never told anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Not even your wife?<eos> Do you think she could ever love me if she knew the abominations I had committed?
And if you had told me the story when we met, I would still wear your ring today.<eos> The strength of that boy still lives in you.<eos> I see that.<eos> Even if you don't.<eos> You can finish your story now, my love.<eos> Hey, sit up.<eos> Listen, put your head back.<eos> Look, we still got a few drops of water left.<eos> Don't you quit on me. We're going home.<eos> Do you have a family back home, Mr. Chase?
Do you have a family back home, Mr. Chase?<eos> Yeah, I have a wife.<eos> Yes, and a son or a daughter.<eos> Very well.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - We will draw again.<eos> We will do no such thing.<eos> We'll draw again.<eos> Mr. Ramsdell, you will assume command of this vessel.<eos> Cousin, will you?
Believe me,<eos> I shall not be resting for some time.<eos> Why?<eos> You got your story.<eos> You know, your plot.<eos> It's all there.<eos> Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.<eos> No.<eos> What, then?<eos> - Something else you've given me tonight. - And what's that?
Sing!<eos> don't they know they're shooting at us?<eos> Gun fever!<eos> I never thought I'd do something as shine as that.<eos> How are the engines?<eos> Very hot and real thirsty.<eos> Hey.<eos> You need to take the war rig half a click down the track.<eos> What if you're not back by the time the engines have cooled?<eos> Well, you keep moving.
You having a baby?<eos> Warlord Jr.<eos> Gonna be so ugly.<eos> It could be a girl.<eos> You kill people with that, do ya?<eos> Killed everyone I ever met out here.<eos> Headshots, all of 'em.<eos> Snap.<eos> Right in the medulla.<eos> Thought somehow you girls were above all that.
A lot.<eos> So. I thought there were going to be four of you.<eos> Oh, there is.<eos> Labs are upstairs, engineering's on the south side and and assembly's downstairs.<eos> We've been operating out of here for over 12 years now.<eos> Well, officially, that is.<eos> But you still won't find our name on any government books.<eos> Most people just refer to this as...<eos> Central City.<eos> But call it whatever you want.
Pass it down.<eos> Cheers.<eos> All right, cool, just don't drop it.<eos> All right. My babies.<eos> If we win, you have to jump in the pool naked.<eos> You know I like being naked.<eos> I'm not worried about that.<eos> I was talking to Danielle, but if you...<eos> I'll make that bet for both of us.<eos> You have to sing karaoke.
Well, the ammonia pills, okay?<eos> The level's gonna be way too high.<eos> I know, all right?<eos> We'll test her before we go, if it doesn't test out, we won't bring her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I'm trusting you guys with everything my dad left me.<eos> This is all her stuff, we wouldn't be able to do any of this without her.<eos> Look, you guys have your reasons, all right?<eos> And I have mine, and I need to do this.<eos> I just... I don't want to be here if you really don't want me here.
This time we're gonna do a whole lot more than look.<eos> JAMES:<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> DEBBIE:<eos> Sweet.<eos> [CHUCKLES]<eos> Hi, folks!<eos> Hi!<eos> All right, let's see, who do we got here?<eos> You must be the Fung family.
Been doing this about three and a half years. Know the river inside and out.<eos> Got my guide certificate from a Cracker Jack box.<eos> Guys, it's a joke.<eos> See the little kid's face?<eos> He's all:<eos> "A Cracker Jack box?<eos> A what?<eos> !"<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> All you gotta do is follow my instructions and we got a 50-50 chance of coming back alive.
Wow, it's down! It's down three points since last year.<eos> That's weird. I haven't heard a peep about that.<eos> What was this guy's name?<eos> Jared Vennett. Vennett.<eos> That's right. These lucky sons of bitches caught wind of one of the best trades in Wall Street history from a wrong number.<eos> They should have paid 10% to my fuckstick assistant.<eos> His name was Jared Vennett. Vennett.<eos> Jared Vennett from Deutsche. Sounded very sketchy.<eos> Sounds like a douchebag.<eos> Do you smell that?
We make this trade, those problems aren't so big anymore.<eos> And sure, swaps are a dark market, so I set the price.<eos> Whatever price I want.<eos> And when you come for the payday, I'm gonna rip your eyes out, I'm gonna make a fortune.<eos> But the good news is, Vinnie, you're not gonna care because you're gonna make so much fucking money.<eos> That's what I get out of it.<eos> Want to know what you get out of it?<eos> You get the ice cream, the hot fudge, the banana, and the nuts.<eos> Right now, I get the sprinkles, and, yeah, if this goes through, I get the cherry.<eos> But you get the sundae, Vinnie.
I'm gonna get to everybody.<eos> Sergeant, do you Want to say something, please?<eos> - Just Sarge.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sarge.<eos> The team has just arrived at a small farm.<eos> Whafs the plan, Tom?<eos> Re-Ans inside.<eos> Search and destroy.<eos> - You two stand back.
- What? Why would they keep Re-Ans in a cage?<eos> - Call it.<eos> - On three.<eos> One, two-<eos> Wait!<eos> Sarge?<eos> Sarge, What are you doing?<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Just food for whatever they got inside.<eos> All right, you camera boys want to know why we're here'?
What keeps you going?<eos> I mean, why you do this?<eos> I do this so no other parent...<eos> has to do What I did.<eos> Do you ever think about dying?<eos> When my day comes... I finally get to go home.<eos> Some religious scholars believe that purgatory is a place... for souls that are equally balanced between good and evil... and that your actions, they determine... whether or not you will go to heaven... or hell.<eos> The jury's out for you all.<eos> 'Cause you are corrupt... by doing What you do with that lens.<eos> But then you know that.
What does that have to do with what happened?<eos> Okay.<eos> When I was in the Legion, they gave me Protocols for this.<eos> It can be difficult for Terrsies, or people from underdeveloped worlds to hear that their planet is not the only inhabited planet in the Verse.<eos> Has to be the anesthesia.<eos> I mean, it's gotta be a dream.<eos> The Protocol actually says that most Terrsies will say that this has to be a dream.<eos> Yeah, because a dream is the only way any of this makes sense.<eos> Compared to what?<eos> The idea that you're the only intelligent species on the only inhabitable planet in a universe so full of planets you don't have a number to describe how many there are?
It will be easier to show you.<eos> Could this get any weirder?<eos> Imagine it for me.<eos> Meeting your mother long after she's passed away.<eos> But I'm not your mother.<eos> Your planet is just now entering its Genetic Age.<eos> You understand very little about something which is a vital part of our reality.<eos> In our world genes have an almost spiritual significance.<eos> They are the seeds of our immortality.<eos> When the exact same genes reappear in the exact same order it is for us what you would call reincarnation.
- Dolan!<eos> -The Queen!<eos> Heavenly Father, protect us from these demons.<eos> Stay in formation, men!<eos> Father!<eos> Father!<eos> Father, I missed you.<eos> You're not real.<eos> You can't be.<eos> You breed like rats.
Heavenly Father, protect us from these demons.<eos> Stay in formation, men!<eos> Father!<eos> Father!<eos> Father, I missed you.<eos> You're not real.<eos> You can't be.<eos> You breed like rats.<eos> You put stone on top of stone and then live in your own filth.<eos> You are trespassers on our world.
Be glad you didn't get them wet.<eos> I've been looking for these for a while.<eos> These are ancient runes.<eos> They can manipulate weather.<eos> Rain, wind, cold, heat...<eos> And you just jammed them together in your bag?<eos> You know what you get when you mix a thunderstorm with cool, moist air at 40,000 feet?<eos> It's simple science.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> You witches have no idea the power you've got.
Only I can show the future.<eos> You will fail, and humanity will fall.<eos> I've taken this world back.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Can you feel it?<eos> Your mortality?<eos> Your life ebbing away?<eos> Father!<eos> Kaulder.<eos> You are trespassers on our world.
But...you're not getting any younger.<eos> What if you moved to Arizona and something happened to you?<eos> What if you got sick?<eos> Then, I would hope, that you'd come and take care of me.<eos> What if I'm too late? No, no!<eos> We cannot do this.<eos> Not on your birthday.<eos> It's a holiday!<eos> Finally I fell off my feet!<eos> What are you two cloaking about?
I mean, I can do the renovation, I can paint and dry wall.<eos> - You can dry wall?<eos> - Hell yeah.<eos> That's sexy.<eos> - So, we have a house?<eos> - Yeah, we have a house!<eos> You're... the shit at that.<eos> - Thanks, Mom.<eos> - Of course.<eos> You two are a long way from home.
Dane Wells is a fag.<eos> Why don't you just back off?<eos> Why don't you just let me know when you're gonna come out of the closet, Julio?<eos> Dane!<eos> I just wanted to say that I think you're doing the right thing.<eos> Show up for Laurel.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We never had this conversation.<eos> You have the power!

You're so professional.<eos> - I try.<eos> - No, it's good. You do good.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I know I'm the type of guy who scares you.<eos> I'm a big, loud, gay Jew.<eos> You don't scare me.<eos> Laurel Hester gave the citizens of Ocean County justice for 23 years, and now she's asking you to give her justice in return!<eos> - You have the power!
- Yeah.<eos> I know I'm the type of guy who scares you.<eos> I'm a big, loud, gay Jew.<eos> You don't scare me.<eos> Laurel Hester gave the citizens of Ocean County justice for 23 years, and now she's asking you to give her justice in return!<eos> - You have the power!<eos> - We don't have that option.<eos> You do!<eos> The Domestic Partnership Act gives you the option to grant benefits!<eos> You have the power!
- But he said plenty about compassion!<eos> - He didn't say anything!<eos> Please.<eos> Well, father, there are definitely old testament verses that talk...<eos> - You want to get sued here?<eos> - Don't cut me off. Ladies and gentlemen, I understand this issue, my uncle died of lung cancer, it's terrible.<eos> And I have always tried to do the right thing, but we need to look at the total picture.<eos> Please, please, please, I am begging you, I am begging you, do this for Laurel!<eos> - You can do this!<eos> - You have the power.

What's going on out there?<eos> You know, the freeholder meeting about that lesbian's pension.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Going down to that freeholder meeting.<eos> I'm gonna show my support for another gay cop.<eos> Does anybody have anything they want to say about that?<eos> How about you, Toohey?<eos> I'm going in my office and I'm closing the door, and if anybody wants to duck out, for any reason,<eos> I won't notice.<eos> You have the power!
Easy!<eos> Easy, boy!<eos> Come on, boy, slow down!<eos> Miss!<eos> Miss! Are you all right?<eos> Hold on!<eos> I'm all right, thank you!<eos> That's fine.<eos> - Are you all right? - I'm all right,<eos> But you've nearly frightened the life out of him.
No more surprises.<eos> Is that you?<eos> I hate myself in paintings.<eos> Don't you?<eos> No one's ever painted my portrait.<eos> No?<eos> Well, they should.<eos> Who is she?<eos> She gave no name, Your Grace.<eos> You didn't ask?
Agreed!<eos> Then let us be certain.<eos> I am king.<eos> I say we shall seek out the mystery princess, even if she does not want to be found.<eos> I have to see her again.<eos> But if she's not found, then for the good of the kingdom, you must marry the Princess Chelina.<eos> For the good of the kingdom.<eos> Very well, agreed.<eos> But Your Highness...<eos> But you will spare no effort.
When I am king dilly, dilly<eos> You shall be queen<eos> Lavender's green dilly, dilly<eos> Lavender's blue<eos> If you love me Dilly, dilly<eos> I will love you<eos> Let the birds sing dilly, dilly<eos> And the lambs play<eos> We shall be safe dilly, dilly...<eos> Do you hear that, Your Grace?
I will love you<eos> There!<eos> You see?<eos> I told you it was no one of any importance.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Miss.<eos> You are requested and required to present yourself to your king.<eos> I forbid you to do this!<eos> And I forbid you to forbid her!<eos> Who are you to stop an officer of the king?
I said no horses.<eos> We'll take these three horses.<eos> I'm not going to say it again.<eos> They aren't part of the deal.<eos> Now tell your man to step away.<eos> We had an agreement, you have to honor it.<eos> in French You stand there and talk to me about honor?<eos> I told you he speaks French.<eos> Those pelts are stolen.<eos> You all have stolen everything from us.
Okay, now you went too far.<eos> You had me and then you lost me.<eos> Oh, no, she's right, B. You are by far the smartest one of the three of us.<eos> And we can't be Bianca, Jess and Casey without Bianca.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, you know what? Tonight how about we ditch our dates and have a girls' night?<eos> - Done. - What?<eos> No, no way.<eos> Guys, it's homecoming.<eos> You're definitely going.
It's not one of my collars.<eos> What're you. some kind of psychic?<eos> Let's check the signals.<eos> - Beckett, check the fuckin' signals.<eos> - Yeah, I'll check.<eos> I'll check 'em.<eos> - Alright, that's our current position, right now.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - And... yeah, there's one bear.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. Sheriff, it looks like you want me to go huntin' now, huh?<eos> You got the money, I got the time.
And now I teach comparative religion.<eos> - This is a Roman Catholic country.<eos> How come you are allowed to talk about other religions?<eos> Roman Catholicism of México is generous and all-embracing. Pantheistic.<eos> A bit of everything.<eos> old and new. They just take what they need.<eos> So much so we should call it. Mexican Catholicism.<eos> They customized it.<eos> We have pre-Columbian equivalents for everything the Roman Catholics dreamed up.<eos> Certainly, we invented blood sacrifices before you did.
Eisenstein will die... like Leonardo.<eos> I'm not so sure that filmmakers will be remembered.<eos> - We have made a procession of the mighty dead.<eos> Aren't you surprised that we spend so much time making people die in films?<eos> - All actors, sooner or later, and sooner rather than later. . in theaters and cinemas around the world are asked to fuck or die.<eos> HamIet. Othello. Macbeth.<eos> Juliet, Madame Butterfly,Joan of Arc, Yevgeniy Onegin,<eos> CIeopatra, JuIlius Caesar,Savonarola, Helen of Troy, Ivan the Terrible...<eos> - We give you license to show us people fucking and dying, and we know they are not.<eos> And you know they are not.
I'm out<eos> - Three<eos> - I'm out<eos> I'll go for diamonds if you don't mind<eos> - Heil Hitler, everyone<eos> - Heil Hitler<eos> Hi<eos> Ah, I see, voluntary disbanding<eos> Very sensible<eos> But if you think that the strike fund will disappear with you, you've got another thing coming
You left Mathilde with your child<eos> Is that the done thing?<eos> I don't care what the done thing is<eos> If two people aren't right together, it's misery<eos> Just look at you and father<eos> You'll see what this leads to, always doing exactly the opposite of God's plan<eos> Where else could they be?<eos> We'll find them, don't you worry<eos> - Halt!<eos> Gruppenfuhrer, you'll go there!
Hold your horses.<eos> Let's go look for a well.<eos> No.<eos> Listen.<eos> I made a big mistake the other day.<eos> You can't come over here any more.<eos> - This will be the last time.<eos> - What?<eos> Let's get that plane running!<eos> If you managed to find a well in the middle of the desert, then we can go and find the Little Prince.
- I know.<eos> You can go in there, it doesn't work.<eos> Wait a second, do you really think we haven't looked into every school there is?<eos> - Not this one.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Well, you know, you can't afford it.<eos> Steven, would you mind your own fucking business, please! I'm sorry, excuse me.<eos> You mean that we have an interview, as our family, today, in two hours at the New Compass School?<eos> People wait two years for such an interview.<eos> Two years. You have it in two hours.
- Not this one.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Well, you know, you can't afford it.<eos> Steven, would you mind your own fucking business, please! I'm sorry, excuse me.<eos> You mean that we have an interview, as our family, today, in two hours at the New Compass School?<eos> People wait two years for such an interview.<eos> Two years. You have it in two hours.<eos> Just give me a day to do something good for you.<eos> And then, you know, I'm gone, forever.<eos> And you still go to heaven because you're so damn tolerant.
- No, this is it, kiddo.<eos> I like to travel light. You know what I mean?<eos> Well, that's convenient.<eos> - Where are you from?<eos> - Austin, Texas.<eos> Expats?<eos> Who do you work for'?<eos> - Cardiff.<eos> I'm one of the engineers they brought in to revamp the waterworks.<eos> You Cardiff boys, you go everywhere, don't you?
- Let's go. - Here we go.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Come on. - Here we go. I've got the birds.<eos> Hey, Kenny Rogers, you mind keeping your eye on the road a little bit?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - This one's on us, okay? -Okay. Thank you.<eos> - All right.<eos> Be safe.<eos> - All right.<eos> You go.
Open up.<eos> We're Americans, open up.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Here.<eos> - You okay'? - Are you all right? Good.<eos> Good!<eos> You girls are very good.<eos> - Let me just see what's going on. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - You know what's happening?
No, I don'! want to pretend this isn't happening'<eos> We're gonna stick together, and you just listen to what your mom says, and you watch out for your little sister.<eos> - Why are people trying to kill us?<eos> - I don't know, they just are.<eos> You need to keep an eye out on Beeze, because shes your little sister and she needs your help all right?<eos> We just wait here and then help is gonna come.<eos> Can you hear the helicopter?<eos> Jack, do you hear that?<eos> Is that a helicopter'?<eos> - Okay, here, you hear that? {HELICOPTER WHIRRING]
They were mine.<eos> You know? You got your soul in those gloves.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, - They gave me a home. - Hector, chill out.<eos> I met my boys. That whole table,<eos> - I would stay away from 'em if I was you. - Billy! Behave yourself... there are a lot of rich people here.<eos> Um... when I was... when I was... when I was 12 years old, there was this little girl. She was skinny.<eos> She had been through it. She stuck with me when I was, uh, um... was incarcerated.<eos> And I knew she was there.<eos> I wouldn't be here without my wife Maureen.<eos> Now, you, with your fancy cars and... or your fancy dresses and your-your fancy suits and your beautiful hair, take some of that money and... and give it, give it... give us that shit.
Okay, I see about 50 liars out there.<eos> They write books about us. They make movies about us.<eos> They dress up like us at Halloween.<eos> They're all wampires.<eos> - Just vampire wannabes.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> They could do without this planet, God damn it.<eos> They don't need to breathe the air or drink the water.<eos> We're the ones that need to defend this planet!<eos> I read that they are putting garlic in our blood and you doubt that they're working with the aliens?
What the shit? What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - "Sorry"? You ate the Millers.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> They were just standing there.<eos> We were like, "Should we?"<eos> Dag, don't be ridiculous.<eos> I'm not being ridiculous.<eos> You're being ridiculous.
Why you do this?<eos> It sounds funny.<eos> Please, Chappie doesn't like it...<eos> Chappie! No, no!<eos> Please!<eos> Chappie...<eos> Chappie doesn't...<eos> like... - Check this out, man.<eos> - Pussy!<eos> Please, may you not.
It sounds funny.<eos> Please, Chappie doesn't like it...<eos> Chappie! No, no!<eos> Please!<eos> Chappie...<eos> Chappie doesn't...<eos> like... - Check this out, man.<eos> - Pussy!<eos> Please, may you not.<eos> - Please, may you not.
Roll him over, roll him over.<eos> Please, Chappie has fears.<eos> This way, this way, this way.<eos> We need access to his brain.<eos> - No!<eos> Please, don't!<eos> - Hey!<eos> Damn you!<eos> Just get him down!<eos> Please, may you not! Please, may you not!
- No, Chappie!<eos> Chappie, stop it!<eos> - Leave me, Amerika! - Aw...<eos> You lied to me! - Chappie!<eos> - Chappie, no!<eos> - No, Chappie! No! -<eos> - You lie, you lie, you lie. daddy!<eos> You were gonna let me die, daddy!<eos> You were gonna let me die!<eos> Why you humans do this?
I've loved her like she was my own, but she's not her anymore.<eos> - Wade, please.<eos> - Don't.<eos> I'm chewing so loud.<eos> She was afraid of me, wasn't she?<eos> When did she leave?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> I don't feel well.<eos> You got enough firewood there?<eos> Well, if you'd get the power turned back on again, I wouldn't have to do this everyday.
The last few prisoners have just been attached and although the wounds are still fresh you get the idea!<eos> Perfect!<eos> What?<eos> Sir, Governor Hughes is on his way.<eos> Perfect!<eos> We are ready for the cunt!<eos> Dwight!<eos> I repeat you are really the cunt!<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> Why do you two assholes..
- We've got two stories here.<eos> We got a story about degenerate clergy. And we got a story about a bunch of lawyers turning child abuse into a cottage industry.<eos> Now, which story do you want us to write?<eos> Cause we're writing one of them.<eos> I already sent you a list of names.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The Globe, years ago.<eos> After the Porter case, I got plenty of calls.<eos> I had 20 priests in Boston alone.<eos> But I couldn't go after them without the press. So I sent you guys a list of names and you buried it.
He's possessed.<eos> Are you seriously that fucking stupid, man.<eos> You didn't see his face.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> There's no such thing as possession. Okay.<eos> That's just something that Catholics made up to keep you guys going back for waffles<eos> This whole religion is one big fuck up costume party.<eos> There's no God.<eos> There's no Devil.<eos> It's just idiots like you believe everything the...
Are you serious?<eos> Why not?<eos> I found a do-it-yourself site.<eos> - There you have it. [DIY EXORCISM - TEN EASY STEPS]<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> Do you know how insane that is?<eos> Do you have a better idea.<eos> Guys, this could work!<eos> Hey, get matches and bibles, okay.<eos> You get crucifixes.
- Hold your fire!<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Hold your fire!<eos> - He needs help! Hold your fire!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Give me one reason I shouldn't shoot you.<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> I can't.<eos> I guess that's the problem, isn't it?<eos> We blew up your mine. You burned my district to the ground.
That was a short honeymoon.<eos> Yeah, well,<eos> I guess we're gonna have to have one in The Capitol.<eos> - After we take it. - Gather 'round.<eos> Squad 451, you're my unit.<eos> Lieutenant Jackson is my second-in-command.<eos> Each one of you is elite in some form of combat.<eos> But we are a non-combat unit.<eos> So we'll be following days behind the front-line troops.<eos> You're to be the onscreen faces of the invasion.
I'm not in control.<eos> I need a nightlock pill, so I can die when I need to.<eos> If it gets to that point, I'll kill you myself.<eos> I don't think I ever really understood The Capitol until now.<eos> You eat like this, you'll believe anything.<eos> So Katniss Everdeen, a poor unstable girl with nothing but a small talent with a bow and arrow, is dead.<eos> Not a thinker, not a leader.<eos> Simply a face plucked from the masses.<eos> Was she valuable?<eos> She was extremely valuable to your rebellion because you have no vision, no true leader among you.
When?<eos> This is 58 days from now.<eos> 58 days?<eos> But whatever caused this could happen any time after the static starts.<eos> It could be a month.<eos> It could be sooner.<eos> Still looking for your flicker, Frank?<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> So why aren't you telling anyone?<eos> The whole planet is gonna die and you're just sitting here?
They didn't fear their demise, they repackaged it.<eos> It can be enjoyed as video games, as TV shows, books, movies.<eos> The entire world wholeheartedly embraced the apocalypse and sprinted towards it with gleeful abandon.<eos> Meanwhile, your Earth was crumbling all around you.<eos> You've got simultaneous epidemics of obesity and starvation.<eos> Explain that one.<eos> Bees and butterflies start to disappear.<eos> The glaciers melt.<eos> Algae blooms all around you.<eos> The coal mine canaries are dropping dead, and you won't take the hint!
The glaciers melt.<eos> Algae blooms all around you.<eos> The coal mine canaries are dropping dead, and you won't take the hint!<eos> In every moment, there is the possibility of a better future.<eos> But you people won't believe it.<eos> And because you won't believe it, you won't do what is necessary to make it a reality.<eos> So you dwell on this terrible future, and you resign yourselves to it.<eos> For one reason, because that future doesn't ask anything of you today.<eos> So, yes, we saw the iceberg, we warned the Titanic.<eos> But you all just steered for it anyway, full steam ahead.
The search parameters you've given us, while mathematically sound, are a bit undefined.<eos> Could you be more specific, please?<eos> Well, Miss Newton, you wanna tell our new recruiters what they're looking for?<eos> Dreamers.<eos> We are looking for dreamers.<eos> Anyone who will feed the right wolf.<eos> So, I once told your predecessor that she was nothing, but a combination of ones and zeroes.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> She was much more than that.<eos> You are much more than that, too.
- Victor!<eos> Victor!<eos> - Igor, what have you done to him? - Let go!<eos> Help me, not him!<eos> Victor, we have to kill it!<eos> Do it, Victor!<eos> It was out of control! - We made progress today!<eos> - It was homicidal!<eos> No, no, no, I had no way of knowing that Gordon was...<eos> Am I to understand that you built that?
I misjudged you.<eos> Your flaws, though they're... glaring and massive, are merely social... not intellectual.<eos> I find your work astonishing... and to be perfectly frank... brilliant.<eos> Brilliant!<eos> Quite beyond my own ability to comprehend.<eos> - Could you create another one?<eos> - I could, and a whole lot more beside.<eos> But that would take considerable resource.<eos> As you are aware, I do come from the third richest family in England.<eos> As a result, I can provide you with whatever it is you so require.

"more"?
"By God," you say?<eos> Inspector, I have to inform you that you are currently in the home of rational, free-thinking men.<eos> To violate it or my research would require a proper legal warrant.<eos> - And God has no authority here.<eos> - Tread lightly, sir.<eos> You may insult me, but you impugn the Lord at your peril.<eos> I should remind you that life is a sacred creation.<eos> Are you a police officer or a theologian?<eos> Let me tell you something for nothing. I'll say this very slowly... is merely the application and outcome of applied chemistry.<eos> And did you or did you not apply such chemistry at the Royal College of Medicine two days ago?
"He that covereth his sin shall not prosper." I'll ask you again.<eos> And I will ask you again, sir:<eos> Why are you so interested, nay, infatuated with this case?<eos> Surely there are more interesting mysteries to be solved in London.<eos> Or is it precisely because this experiment, which you imagine took place may very well discredit your own primitive belief system?<eos> Yes, uncover what you will about me, Inspector.<eos> Men like you have always stood in the way of progress and they have invariably been left in its wake.<eos> My creation...<eos> Be careful, Mr. Frankenstein.<eos> You toy with wrathful forces.
Really?<eos> I do.<eos> I lost my wife... to a malign growth.<eos> And in my suffering I know about death.<eos> That it's an abyss from which no man nor woman can be returned.<eos> Would you not rather have her by your side?<eos> Would you not have her live again?<eos> She is alive. In God's house.<eos> And when I, too, fall into that abyss... I shall be by her side.<eos> Don't you see? You trust in a fiction!
Frankenstein! Igor!<eos> What an unexpected surprise.<eos> The police have raided my home in search of Igor Straussman.<eos> We managed to avoid incarceration, but it's just possible we might have gravely wounded a police officer.<eos> I suppose now you'll have no choice but to leave London. - Posthaste.<eos> - Very good.<eos> My family has an estate.<eos> The Castle Erskine in Scotland.<eos> It's quite... rural and secluded.<eos> Ideally situated, you might say, for... both your needs as scientists and, um... - well, fugitives.
- Maniac!<eos> - Funky!<eos> - Violet.<eos> - Spike!<eos> - Lunatic.<eos> Spot!<eos> Come here, Spot.<eos> Come here.<eos> He is named.<eos> You clearly are connected.
What terms?<eos> You wouldn't get it.<eos> We change the grid. We give back.<eos> The second that kid got killed on your line, you quit life.<eos> You turned away because of something someone else did.<eos> You were selling sports drinks? Fine.<eos> That's not for me to judge.<eos> But you let someone else determine the direction your life took.<eos> That I judge.<eos> So, you got all your shit figured out, and screw everyone else for trying, huh?
Mikasa!<eos> Hold him!<eos> Mikasa!<eos> Mikasa?<eos> Help!<eos> 2 years later price for the year of peace<eos> Must be paid by the tragedy<eos> Beyond the wall in Monzen District It has been destroyed by Titan The greater than ever<eos> With hordes of refugees And the loss of agricultural land, our food reserves dwindling To reclaim Our agricultural land,<eos> This is a very proud mission And you all gone finish your training
- I forget what it is.<eos> It's an optical anomaly.<eos> To the human eye, a perfect cube doesn't look like a cube, so we made it roughly a millimeter shorter than a foot on two sides.<eos> What's an anomaly?<eos> You've asked me that before too.<eos> I don't know why you keep doing that.<eos> It's an exception.<eos> Something that doesn't fit a pattern.<eos> You have to go to school.<eos> I think you two have met.
I brought you all the way here to kill him!<eos> And you tell me that you're not killing anymore?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I'm sorry, man. I don't mean to let you down.<eos> I have no desire to kill you or your brother.<eos> I'm just here to pick up my girlfriend.<eos> What the fuck, clevon?<eos> Shut the fuck up, Richie!<eos> You're letting me down in a big way!<eos> I think you two have some issues to talk about.
Her teacher hasn't even seen Riley all day.<eos> - What? - What was she wearing last?<eos> - Do you even remember what...<eos> Riley, there you are!<eos> Thank goodness! We were worried sick!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> It's so late!<eos> Oh, honey! What happened? Are you all right?<eos> We asked the neighbors, I called the school, we talked to your teacher.<eos> I know you don't want me to but... I miss home.
Atta boy, Johnny.<eos> Jose, good.<eos> Come on, Danny.<eos> - Come on, Sean.<eos> - Come on, Danny!<eos> That's what I have.<eos> Well, it was close, boys.<eos> Like I said...<eos> They're a great team.<eos> But you're better.
You are a good man and so I helping you.<eos> Okay, now go shower.<eos> Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken!<eos> And how many tickets did you say your mama sold?<eos> You better hope only half of them show up.<eos> Well, let's get our buckets, guys.<eos> - Hey, Cheryl! Hi, honey.<eos> - Lupe!<eos> How you been?<eos> I'm so good. How are you?
How's that?<eos> Please rise for the singing of the national anthem.<eos> Up.<eos> Coaches, you have three minutes.<eos> All right, everybody, gather around.<eos> Come on.<eos> I want you to look around.<eos> Best in the state, right?<eos> Every team that's here deserves to be, including you.<eos> But they haven't got what you got.
Come on.<eos> I want you to look around.<eos> Best in the state, right?<eos> Every team that's here deserves to be, including you.<eos> But they haven't got what you got.<eos> All right?<eos> They don't get up at dawn like you and go to work in the fields.<eos> Right?<eos> They don't go to school all day and then go back to those same fields.<eos> That's what you do.
They can't even imagine it.<eos> When I went out in the field that day with you Diaz kids, I'll be honest with you, it was a... It was the worst day's work I ever had to do in my life.<eos> And I said to myself, "Whatever kind of crappy job I end up in,<eos> "it'll never be as tough as that."<eos> You kids do it every day.<eos> And your parents hope they can do it every day, and they'll do it for a lifetime if it means a better life for you.<eos> You guys are super-human.<eos> What you endure just to be here, to get a shot at this, the kind of privilege that someone like me takes for granted?<eos> There's nothing you can't do with that kind of strength, with that kind of heart.<eos> You kids have the biggest hearts I've ever seen.
I'm sorry, you suck.<eos> No, he's right.<eos> You guys are awful.<eos> - She knows what she's talking about.<eos> - You should learn how to play your instruments, not just hold them and pound them.<eos> - Kids, keep playing. - We can't afford lessons.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings?<eos> 'Cause I wanna kill myself.<eos> It's that bad.<eos> You're probably killing your dog with your music.
And you've handed out all these free sandwiches for counterfeit coupons?<eos> You're a fool, and your people are fools.<eos> Sir, please just take your free sandwich and step out of line.<eos> I wouldn't eat that shit sandwich if you paid me.<eos> Okay, sir, I will call the police.<eos> You have the tiniest responsibility.<eos> You just have to do your job. I do the rest.<eos> All you have to do is let the thing happen.<eos> What is wrong with people these days?<eos> I do the work, you get to witness the beauty.

I stopped when I met Daddy.<eos> - So he doesn't know about these?<eos> - Oh, good God, no.<eos> If he ever found out that I'd started painting again, I'd be such a betrayal.<eos> Why is this door locked?<eos> - We're, uh, we're talking.<eos> - About what?<eos> Our feelings.<eos> Ugh, meet me in the car.<eos> I want you to have these.
Did you say four in the last nine months?<eos> And this would be the fifth or the fourth?<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> - It's fake.<eos> Fake blood.<eos> - Can I see it?<eos> - This is what they... this is what they use in a lot of their performances.<eos> The lab will let us know if that is the case.<eos> You think they're dead, right?
Uh... what are your influences?<eos> Um, we like speed metal, I guess, but we're not good enough to play it.<eos> We listen to some rap.<eos> Great.<eos> And, uh... tell me about the song "KP."<eos> Um, what do you wanna know?<eos> What made you write it?<eos> We just thought people should kill their parents if they wanna do anything good with their lives.<eos> It's a stupid song, really.<eos> - You didn't write the song, Lucas.
Um, he and Bonnie were to live as husband and wife in appearance only.<eos> And that worked for a couple years, but things happen.<eos> You're adults, you know that.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> You're actually the father of those boys?<eos> Every piece has its... its own complications. And for what it's worth, the boys did help the cover story.<eos> Wow.<eos> You actually replaced us.<eos> - No one replaced anyone.<eos> - You didn't wanna work with us.
Everything we've ever done is for the art.<eos> No, it wasn't just the art, Caleb, you know that.<eos> Everything I do is out of love for you.<eos> And I... See, I made him a promise after you were born.<eos> He wanted to leave. And I swore to him that if he figured out a way to be happy and still stay, then I'd always do the same for him.<eos> - Even sacrifice your own children.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> Come on, when push came to shove, every time, you chose him over us.<eos> For God sake, you talk like I'm a monster.<eos> We had a good life, you were happy children.
Fine.<eos> Now, I am here to complete your knowledge of our great and generous species.<eos> Are you the guy that talks nice before they kill us?<eos> Eh, we'll come back to that.<eos> As young thinglings, we are schooled in the wisdom of the universe.<eos> Physics, mathematics, FORTRAN... the greatest of the programming languages!<eos> And now the part that is difficult to tell you.<eos> At the end of a life well-lived, there is one final ritual.<eos> We must eat one of you.<eos> But we'll let you have the fun of picking which one.
I'm gonna need it if I'm stuck here for the summer instead of souping up this bitching firebird I found in...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, great.<eos> Where do they keep the chainsaws here?<eos> What?<eos> We might want to find out, right?<eos> Where they keep them?<eos> Because you never know when you might need a chainsaw.<eos> Why do we need a chainsaw for a slumber party?<eos> I know what's going to go down at this camp, and it's not pretty.<eos> Uh, so, where's that other guy you came with?
I'm such a bad person.<eos> You're not. It's okay.<eos> If it makes you feel better, last summer, I'm the one who spread the rumor that said you had a weird disease where you're always on your period. Wow.<eos> That's evil.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Max, if I'm going to die tonight, then I don't want to die without telling you that when your mom died, you shut down completely.<eos> And just cut me out of your life.<eos> And I missed you.<eos> I missed our friendship.<eos> And then you two became best friends and, I don't know, I got jealous.
The government?<eos> 'Cause I'm this close to figuring out the secret of the Bermuda Triangle.<eos> Wow, you don't have any friends, do you?<eos> Just my grandma.<eos> Well, Wonder Kid, you can hang out with us.<eos> Really?<eos> What's up, geeks and goobers?<eos> They call me the Fire Blaster!<eos> 'Cause my hands are blazing fast, and also I will blast and burn all my competitors' weak-ass moves.<eos> You must be the local talent.
What am I lookin' at right now?<eos> Are you guys soldiers?<eos> Or the cast of Magic Mike?<eos> You gonna fight?<eos> Or dance naked?<eos> From now on, you maggots, you little girl maggots...<eos> Whatever the hell the female form of maggot is.<eos> Magina?<eos> You magina!<eos> When you magina poop your pants, you're gonna be thinking of me!
We're on our own, guys.<eos> This feels like my planet.<eos> No fun.<eos> No laughter.<eos> Only war.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Q*bert is from there. He knows all their secrets.<eos> We were once a happy planet.<eos> Before you threatened us.
So this Daniel guy's taking Blake now?<eos> I would have just called in sick.<eos> It's why I'm the boss and you're not.<eos> Pretty sure we can manage a few days without ya.<eos> Shoe's untied.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Blake.<eos> I want you to know that I respect what you and your dad have.<eos> And I know that your mom moving in has to feel like a pretty big step.<eos> But I'm never gonna try to change what you have with him or take his place.
- At Coit Tower?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - That tall cement nozzle thing on the hill.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Don't stop anywhere. Go there. That's where we'll meet.<eos> Stay strong, honey.<eos> - We're coming to get you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Wait, Mom. How are you and Dad together?
Maybe there'll be another contest, though.<eos> Smile!<eos> No. It's about the lighthouses, not me, Charles.<eos> Ready for your close-up? No.<eos> Heh heh.<eos> Remember that summer, Vicki?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That was fun.<eos> Sure was.<eos> You girls were such a handful.
Beautiful as she is, she must turn heads.<eos> No way!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She's still a baby.<eos> They used to be married by that age.<eos> And there, that's Marie. - Her friend.<eos> - Hello.<eos> She's the daughter of my friend Laurent.<eos> Hello, how are you?<eos> You don't have a wife to sweep?
Yes, well...<eos> My wife and I, right now, things are cold.<eos> All married guys say that.<eos> For me, it's true.<eos> Would you want your wife to be in a cafe kissing someone else?<eos> She wouldn't do that, my wife.<eos> You think your women aren't like you.<eos> I know my wife.<eos> They're good, your women.<eos> Wisely waiting at home, while you dredge the cafe terrace.
- He was hiding in the accounts department yesterday.<eos> - Idiot!<eos> "How to seduce the man of your dreams.<eos> Ten steps to success.<eos> Step 1.<eos> Pay attention to your appearance.<eos> A hungry cat won't chase a dull mouse. "<eos> Need to boost your confidence?<eos> Want to seduce your dream prince?<eos> You want the Luxury Diamond Collection!
They found him in the meter cupboard once.<eos> He's haunting the accounts department.<eos> Lt all began in the ladies' toilets.<eos> Still nothing.<eos> Then you fixed a broken window blind... and saw that the nurse had mended your sock.<eos> You can lead a horse to water but you know fucking hell!<eos> This investigation is bullshit!<eos> You found one clue: her telephone.<eos> I'll ask for a list of her calls.<eos> If she used her phone on the day of the dinner, you'll arrest her, Sergeant!
Comprehensive pamphlet.<eos> Comprehensive pamphlet.<eos> They are lucky the Boov have come.<eos> All right, Boov. Invade on three.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Rejoice, humanspeople!<eos> The Boov are arrived!<eos> Now we are turning off your gravity temporarily... so as to make your mandatory relocation easier. And more fun!<eos> So, what is up?<eos> You are!
Don't distract the driver!<eos> Aha!<eos> Busta Lime.<eos> "Busta Lime."<eos> Owpain!<eos> Owpain.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pee break.<eos> I, too, has to break pee.<eos> Or, as you calls it, the "number one."
- I end at 16:00.<eos> Can we meet there around 16:15.<eos> If I'm gone, I find out anything.<eos> If you'll be there, we'll talk.<eos> - Hello, Nick.<eos> - Millicent...<eos> Bad that prevailed English blood in you.<eos> If I was black, I would have immediately made the party.<eos> You can always pretend.<eos> Do not think it's racist, I do not think that you're English clean.
The best there is.<eos> The number one, a real credit to the human race.<eos> You're fake, do not believe you, but I'll give you one last chance , Then continues.<eos> He talks to me.<eos> You may know what the hell are you thinking ?<eos> !<eos> At Corsica.<eos> But now I stopped.<eos> Tiel, Kinlaw, do disappear from my sight this jerk.<eos> Think you to let him know that I am a gentleman.
Surprise!<eos> Happy Birthday.<eos> There was this King, King George, and he liked things big and he liked things round.<eos> Just so you know, I had no knowledge of this party.<eos> Kit did it all on his own.<eos> Which is very nice but...<eos> Don't be mad at me because I didn't know anything.<eos> I've got some good ones. I've got some good ones.<eos> This is when they went to Ibiza and you...<eos> well, you both went missing for two weeks.
Why won't you go back to school?<eos> Why should they go back?<eos> I wouldn't!<eos> Oh, aye?<eos> And where do you wander off to every night, hm?<eos> ♪ Whose mother's a daftie?<eos> ♪ Daftie<eos> Daftie, they say.<eos> Well, that's all past now.<eos> You're to come and live at Auchterless with your uncle and me.
Where?<eos> "On the back."<eos> Is it bad?<eos> Does he bleed?<eos> "Sometimes."<eos> And it's his master who's doing this?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Tell him I'm from The New York Times.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> But I can't help you unless you help me.
Mine, too.<eos> No, this doesn't seem right.<eos> Should we call Bubbles?<eos> Let's give him a minute.<eos> He's been holding it for 10,000 years.<eos> I'm pretty sure that wasn't supposed to happen.<eos> Come on, Plankton, we got to clean this up before Bubbles gets back!<eos> Much better.<eos> Yes.<eos> You two are free to go.
Nadine kept talking about you, I thought she was making it up.<eos> I'm real instead.<eos> Want some wine?<eos> Have you found a job?<eos> Nothing serious yet.<eos> Come on, it's all set up.<eos> Let's go outside, it's a surprise.<eos> That's Sandro, he's totally crazy.<eos> Watch out, it's only 2 meters deep!<eos> You know nothing about Alaska, look at this...
You backstabbing little traitors!<eos> Using Herb's inventions to steal my crown!<eos> I feel used not going to lie.<eos> You stole my dream.<eos> I was going to conquer England some day.<eos> There was going to be a coronation. And I was going to be made queen,<eos> Every moment was planned.<eos> I would wear a dress so sparkly and glowed. And everyone whoever doubted me Would be watching and they would be crying.<eos> I was going to be the picture of elegance and class!<eos> And you pinheads screwed it up!
Because whenever he's in the society pages, he's never been photographed with a woman - So, naturally...<eos> Well, maybe he just wants to keep his private life private, Kate.<eos> And now you're defending him.<eos> I'm terminating this conversation.<eos> Too bad we don't have some original stills of your hot, clean 27-year-old billionaire.<eos> The camera loves him almost as much as you do.<eos> Okay, I wasn't hungry, but now I am.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love you.<eos> "I declared I could not change, "yet you tell me to my face
They've asked me to head the new committee.<eos> Yes?<eos> And?<eos> And I should tell you I've spoken with the Home Secretary.<eos> And in light of the new information I've given him, he's decided to close down the double-0 program with immediate effect.<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> It's not personal.<eos> It's the future.<eos> And...<eos> You're not.
Move.<eos> Move!<eos> Go back and find M, now!<eos> We need them both.<eos> Not a good feeling being watched, is it?<eos> Don't tell me you're responsible for this.<eos> No, but my Quartermaster is.<eos> And he's extremely talented.<eos> Well, bravo.<eos> But in case you hadn't realized it, you two are out of a job.
Umm, Patty and I aren't going this week.<eos> We're going to see a movie instead.<eos> Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.<eos> I would, very much.<eos> There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.<eos> Yes, surprising, isn't it?<eos> You'd think it would be the other way around.<eos> Of course, you'd be welcome to join us, Dolores.<eos> So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.<eos> So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?
I'm the closest!<eos> I know my leches too.<eos> Money, money, money.<eos> NICKY:<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I want justice. I want my money back. Make another bet.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I want my change.<eos> Okay. Which team draws the next penalty?<eos> I don't know football. You boys play.
You bet your ass.<eos> - Steve, he said a bad language word.<eos> - Did you tell everyone about that?<eos> The handle's imprinted, right?<eos> Like a security code.<eos> "Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's a very, very interesting theory.<eos> I have a simpler one.<eos> You're all not worthy.

I don't want to kill Ultron.<eos> He's unique and he's in pain.<eos> But that pain will roll over the Earth.<eos> So, he must be destroyed.<eos> Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net.<eos> We have to act now.<eos> And not one of us can do it without the others.<eos> Maybe I am a monster.<eos> I don't think I'd know if I were one.<eos> I'm not what you are, and not what you intended.
My Vision.<eos> They really did take everything from me.<eos> You set the terms.<eos> You can change them.<eos> All right.<eos> Friday, the Vision?<eos> Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net.<eos> You shut me out.<eos> You think I care?<eos> You take away my world,
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.<eos> Go.<eos> Boss, power levels are way below...<eos> Reroute everything. We get one shot at this.<eos> I know what I need to do.<eos> The dining room.<eos> If I knock out that east wall, it'd make a nice workspace for Laura, huh?<eos> Put up some baffling.<eos> She can't hear the kids running around.<eos> What do you think?
Finally, by accepting the invitation... And looking only ahead, destroying that horrible part of me that made that moment possible... I'm cured.<eos> And I miss her.<eos> Not a day goes by i don't think of her.<eos> But I don't grieve, and I don't feel guilty anymore. I've chosen to let that go.<eos> Those emotions are useless, because I'm gonna be seeing her again in a better place than this.<eos> That's what we believe.<eos> That's what most people have believed for centuries.<eos> I, for one, can't wait to get there.<eos> But forgiveness doesn't have to wait.<eos> I'm free to forgive myself, and so are you.
Yeah, why is everyone acting so fucking polite?<eos> Where's choi?<eos> Hey, Eden, what's going on?<eos> I have not seen choi tonight, Gina, I swear.<eos> Something isn't right here.<eos> There is something very strange going on here, and no one is saying anything.<eos> What do you think is happening, will?<eos> Hey, who are you?<eos> Hmm?<eos> See, see, I don't get why you two are here.
I need tears to tear me in two and let this nightmare escape, but...<eos> Anyway, yes, don't forget to smile.<eos> It makes a person's day.<eos> And what does it cost you?<eos> A smile is free.<eos> This is not working.<eos> This is not working. This is not working.<eos> The world is falling apart.<eos> The president is a war criminal.<eos> America is going down the tubes and you're talking about goddamn intelligent design.
- We were just chatting.<eos> Name's Tucker.<eos> Therese Belivet, Carol Aird.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Mr. Tucker sells notions.<eos> I see.<eos> I don't know what notions are, exactly, but they do instruct us to use the word. Says it appeals to women.<eos> Do you have any lipsticks?<eos> But I do have a sewing kit.<eos> You don't need a sewing kit. I can tell.
Your aunt's request needs to be respected.<eos> It's not a legally binding will.<eos> Do you imagine my aunt would have written those words if she knew what was to come?<eos> Do you?<eos> The looting of her home, the murder of her people.<eos> Our decision is nonnegotiable.<eos> If you don't agree with it, your only option is to pursue the case in court.<eos> Come on, Randy, let's go.<eos> Dr. Dreimann, you speak as if you knew my aunt, but you did not know her, and I can tell you right now, that what you have decided today would make her ashamed to call herself an Austrian.<eos> And you should be ashamed, too.
We can't stop now.<eos> There is one more thing we could try.<eos> As a gesture of reconciliation, I am willing to allow the paintings to remain in the Belvedere.<eos> All you have to do is to admit that you took them illegally.<eos> Yes, and then, of course, come to some agreement on the question of compensation.<eos> I'm afraid we are not budging, and that is final.<eos> Can you help me understand the inflexible position that you're taking?<eos> We will not be paying for something we believe is ours, and we will fight you till the end before we concede on this.<eos> Arbitration in Vienna.<eos> - We choose... one of the arbitrators, you choose the other, the third is neutral.
Oh, my dear boy, have I... Have I not impressed upon you the opportunities that could await you in the Americas?<eos> And think of it, that vast hinterland and those 13 squabbling colonies, all ripe for the picking.<eos> - Have I not done all that you've asked?<eos> - You have.<eos> - All that was required. - All.<eos> I've made my fortune...<eos> And you have made your fortune doing exactly what I asked you to do.<eos> And you are the man that I need there in the Americas.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I'm ready to put this behind me, as you did.
Who else would be my walking companion?<eos> So, you saved me from drowning to be your walking companion?<eos> Why else?<eos> Because you're kind.<eos> - You're compassionate, you're virtuous...<eos> - Stop.<eos> Please, I do not deserve such talk.<eos> Charlotte, I feel as if I...<eos> I have a new life here.<eos> It's a life you made possible.
Before I came to Adlesbury...<eos> I was not trained as a vicar.<eos> The quality of your training has been a question.<eos> What I mean to say, though, is... I'm not worthy of you.<eos> I know of no man who is.<eos> Certainly, you deserve better than anything that I can...<eos> I'm not a good man.<eos> But I decided to be.<eos> The thought of losing you, it's more than I can bear.<eos> You embody God's mercy for me.
Welcome, indeed.<eos> - Welcome.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - What goes on here?<eos> - All in good time, sir.<eos> Gentlemen... my men and I are loyal servants of the King.<eos> We fear the consequences that may come to these 13 colonies... should these rascals succeed in unifying their Continental Congress.<eos> But, gentlemen, I have a plan.<eos> When they speak with their treacherous tongues, we shall reply with loyal fists.<eos> You will have to recruit or to destroy those around you.
We had a family staying' here, and Ted, he got a puppy-dog crush on one of their girls.<eos> He was following her around everywhere.<eos> Yeah, that poor kid, he had his heart broken when they finally checked out.<eos> He climbed in the back of their station wagon when no one was looking.<eos> And that family, they drove for about an hour before, uh-- before they realized they had themselves a little stowaway.<eos> Dad turned his car around. Had to drive all the way back, drop Ted off.<eos> Sobbed the whole way home.<eos> I'll make sure to double-check my trunk before I leave.<eos> Boy can't help it.<eos> What would make my life a lot easier... is if you kept some distance.
I have been mopping for most of my life, every single day.<eos> Phones are ringing!<eos> I cannot tell you how much this mop has changed my life.<eos> -Phones are ringing!<eos> Phones are ringing! -The phones are ringing.<eos> The phones are ringing. Go.<eos> This is gonna be the greatest mop to have around Christmas time when you have family over<eos> I am a mother of two.<eos> There is just spill after spill.<eos> Family comes to town. You can mop your entire kitchen with one wring!
I mean, I don't know.<eos> I'm just trying to get back to my son.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> You miss him.<eos> I don't see... what the point of all this is.<eos> Well, because this is mandatory, until my local clock strikes seven, you're expected to remain, so we might as well make the most of it.<eos> You got all the power, sir.<eos> But if you'd prefer, we need not talk about your son.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> You motherfuckers think y'all Marines?

Last year, 1996, the turnover of the British music industry passed the billion pound mark for the first time.<eos> Acid. Boom times.<eos> But there's always competition.<eos> Imagine you're standing on wafer- thin ice.<eos> Beneath your feet, you can see sharks circling, terrible sharks with hypodermic syringes for teeth.<eos> At some point in the coming year, one of us will probably be fired.<eos> I have no intention of it being me.<eos> Whoo!<eos> I'm a bear! I'm a dancing bear!<eos> Hey, bear, bear. Eat CDs. What you got, bear?
Now!<eos> -Nice one, Burro. -Wow!<eos> - There they are!<eos> - We better make tracks.<eos> Can I come with?<eos> I got a wagon.<eos> All right, that ain't a bad idea, let's go.<eos> Vámonos.<eos> Come on!<eos> So, if you guys are my brothers, you must got three nipples, too.
So we're going to steal the money.<eos> No, we're only stealing the money from folks what are bad.<eos> So do you know of any place where we could steal a lot of money from some bad folks?<eos> He's got something.<eos> The Gold Nugget Saloon, huh?<eos> I reckon you're coming with us?<eos> Smoking Fox so worried about White Knife.<eos> We must get her to eat something.<eos> Oh, we having a little picnic here, huh?<eos> You have no right to be here!
Welcome to the Gold Nugget, gentlemen.<eos> Mr. Harris, it's quite a nice spread you got here.<eos> So what brings you gentlemen to town?<eos> Actually, we wanted to ask you about something, Mr. Harris.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I am conversing with these gentlemen, sir.<eos> I shall be with you in a moment.<eos> I need to talk to you about Frank Stockburn.<eos> I haven't heard that name in many a year.<eos> You know him.
So that, technically, makes me half-black.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Well, I didn't wanna hide that from you in case you guys slipped up and made some racial slurs -not knowing I wasn't 100% white.<eos> I mean, I knew she must've been really muscular, but I had no idea she was black.<eos> Yeah, I mean, I guess, now that you mention it, I see it a little bit.<eos> My mother's Swedish.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I reckon she's Mexican.<eos> Lying bitch!<eos> So do you new brothers have any special skills that could help us out here tonight?
-And I'm Lil Pete.<eos> Let's get that nugget then.<eos> You've got some pair of huevos coming into my place, son.<eos> I sure am sorry about what happened, Mr. Harris.<eos> In fact, I'd like to buy you a drink... of the good stuff, if that's okay?<eos> Barkeep, you got any scotch, real scotch, from scotch-land?<eos> We keep the imported stuff in the back.<eos> I'll go and fetch it for you.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> Now, I didn't hear that, did you?
What, you mean... my little horseshoe?<eos> That's always brought me luck.<eos> Especially when I was shooting somebody.<eos> Well, killer, your luck just ran out.<eos> Your hand touch that knife, boy, it'll be the last thing you ever touch.<eos> Oh, I ain't using these knives.<eos> Not for my mama.<eos> I saved a special one just for you.<eos> Now you die, Injun-lover.<eos> He dies, you die.
So that business can wait up north, can't it... best man?<eos> Well, now that you mention it, maybe I should change my plans.<eos> Hey!<eos> What are they doing back?<eos> What is this?<eos> I guess it's time you kids learned the truth about your dear old dad, huh?<eos> I'm just too famous.<eos> I can't walk into any town west of the Rockies without someone calling the law.<eos> So, I came up with a way we could make 50 grand without lifting a finger.<eos> And you rascals brought us double!
And you rascals brought us double!<eos> Are these my kids or what?<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> If our two gangs joined forces, there's not a lawman in the West that would stand up against us.<eos> What makes you think we'd turn to a life of crime?<eos> 'Cause it's in your blood.<eos> Answer me something.<eos> Were you ever great at anything in your life besides stealing?<eos> You apples didn't fall far from this tree.<eos> Don't deny who you are.

No, come over there!<eos> You could have had everything, son.<eos> But you had to do the right thing.<eos> Let me leave you with a bit of fatherly advice.<eos> - Never bring a knife to a gunfight.<eos> One day, there will be too many, my love.<eos> But not today.<eos> That was some mystical shit.<eos> Tommy.<eos> You knew Cicero killed my mother.
I have no heir.<eos> I will be the tenth and last generation buried here.<eos> 30 years ago this month, and against all counsel, it was idealism that led me to invite you into my home.<eos> A young man with an empty soul, muddied by drink, and as dark as the graves of those who crossed his path.<eos> But it was idealism that saw through all of that to the man I see before me.<eos> Now you give me better advice than I give myself.<eos> When I have departed this world, these lands will be in your care.<eos> -My name will be yours to uphold.<eos> But your sword is to be passed to an heir. I am merely your retainer.<eos> You are the heir to my spirit.
Here, dog, a silk for your filth!<eos> Where are we expected?<eos> There is something I wish to show you.<eos> Such a fine sword.<eos> May I?<eos> This is a nobleman's blade.<eos> Where did you come by it?<eos> It was a gift... from my master.<eos> I have never heard of such generosity from lord to retainer.<eos> It seems you have won.
We can play this game as long as you like, but you'll receive no bribe from me.<eos> Is that what this is to you?<eos> A game? How do you think the Emperor would respond to his command being thought of as a game?<eos> Since you're only threat seems to be running to the Emperor like a pouting child, you should ask him -as soon as possible.<eos> -I need not ask. You were ordered to this review by the Emperor, and yet you reject his word.<eos> I reject any attempt by you to exert some delusional power over me.<eos> It is you who live under illusion, not me.<eos> I offer you no threat but a promise.<eos> I will not only take your property and standing, but I will turn everything connected to the Bartok name into dust.<eos> And when I'm done, it will be as if neither you nor any generation before had ever existed.
-Yes, Master.<eos> Until then.<eos> Shall I see to the eviction and the subsequent dispensing of the Bartok lands?<eos> The lands should be divided equally so as not to favor one nobleman over another.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I will not bother our master with the details at this time.<eos> I will attend to it myself.<eos> I'm certain you will.<eos> You must keep aware of the Minister, My Lord.<eos> I know you do not approve of Gezza Mott, but his ambition and greed serve my interests well.
Thank you.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Did I do well?<eos> You fought well. You fought well.<eos> We have come for Gezza Mott.<eos> I can no more back down than you.<eos> You think you're a hero?<eos> You will be remembered only as a traitor and a disgrace.<eos> Only time will tell how we are remembered.<eos> Something you... no longer have.
Trust me. It'll scare the fangs right out.<eos> Right, Drac?<eos> Seriously, guys, if I'm late for the book fair, I'll miss the street fair.<eos> That's your guy.<eos> Possessed?<eos> But Dennis will be so upset.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> This is our ticket.<eos> If it works for Denisovich, boom! He's a vampire.<eos> And you all get to stay here. All right.
We wanna go, but you won't let us!<eos> - Look, Marta...<eos> You think we're no good?<eos> - No, that's not it...<eos> Why then?<eos> - It's not that you're not good.<eos> You are good.<eos> But it will be tough out there.<eos> And we've only been practicing for a very short time.<eos> And you're not quite ready yet for...
I like a calm working environment.<eos> Every barber has his quirk... well, except me.<eos> I've not got any.<eos> Don't see the point. Really.<eos> Head down... get on with it.<eos> That's me.<eos> I prefer it when they don't speak.<eos> I cannae be bothered speaking to them either.<eos> I like the quiet.<eos> So what makes a legend. Do you think?
I'm gonna have to fish it outwith a spoon.<eos> No, what're we gonnae do now'?<eos> How should I know?<eos> Well, don't you be bringing anybody up here now.<eos> Do you think I'm fucking stupid or something?<eos> Eh'?<eos> So, the first one's Mrs. Stuart, and, uh, then We'll go to Mrs. McQueen.<eos> When did you last see Stuart, Sheena?<eos> Tuesday. 8:00.<eos> Now, I wasn't sure about declaring him missing, at first, you know, he's not been away that long, then I thought, well, you lot, you've got nothing better to do.
Ladies and gentlemen, please make some space.<eos> The baronet would like to demonstrate for us the waltz.<eos> European style.<eos> Mrs. McMichael, I wanted to apologize.<eos> Edith, we weren't expecting you.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm sure there's no place for me...<eos> Don't worry, my child.<eos> Everybody has their place.<eos> I'll make sure you find yours.
I'll be there shortly.<eos> Miss Cushing.<eos> Edith.<eos> I really have no right to ask this, but...<eos> Sir Thomas.<eos> May I speak with you in my study, please?<eos> You and your sister, if you would be so kind as to fetch her.<eos> Child, please tell our guests that we will join them presently.<eos> Now, Lady Lucille.<eos> Sir Thomas, the first time we met I imagine it was hard for you to realize that I didn't like you.
That document there gave me my answer.<eos> That's the first honest reaction I've seen from you.<eos> Does she know?<eos> No.<eos> But I will tell her, if that's what it takes to send you on your way.<eos> Sir, I know you will find this hard to believe...<eos> You love her.<eos> I know.<eos> You're repeating yourself.<eos> Now, you, you seem to be the more collected one, dear.
But I will tell her, if that's what it takes to send you on your way.<eos> Sir, I know you will find this hard to believe...<eos> You love her.<eos> I know.<eos> You're repeating yourself.<eos> Now, you, you seem to be the more collected one, dear.<eos> It's overly generous, I know.<eos> But if you want that check to clear, there are two conditions.<eos> There's a train for New York City leaving first thing tomorrow morning.<eos> You and your brother better be on it.
A wounded bird you can nourish?<eos> Perfection.<eos> Perfection has no place in love, Edith.<eos> I advise you to return to your ghosts and fancies.<eos> The sooner, the better.<eos> You know precious little of the human heart, or love, or the pain that comes with it.<eos> You're nothing but a spoiled child!<eos> How's the water today, Benton?<eos> Piping hot.<eos> Just the way you like it, sir.
Yes. Get her out of here.<eos> Once she signs the final papers, I want this over with.<eos> This is a valve controller I had fabricated in Glasgow.<eos> This could make all the difference.<eos> Think lucky thoughts, Edith.<eos> The Sharpe mines might reopen if this thing cooperates.<eos> Mr. Sharpe?<eos> Ah, excellent.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're Lady Sharpe, then?
Look, I could talk and talk but all that counts in the end is this one had an idea.<eos> I know, I know, but it works.<eos> The proof of our success is we are victims of it.<eos> The Marigold Hotel is full up.<eos> With nobody checking out.<eos> Until the ultimate check-out.<eos> So we have to expand.<eos> - There's a local place we've got our eye on.<eos> - The Supreme Quality Hotel.<eos> You put up the notes, we buy it.
She's always sat behind the till at the supermarket well, stood.<eos> I always wanted to be Madonna.<eos> Still do.<eos> You don't always get to choose.<eos> What weather it will be, what men you fall for... getting hit by a car and ending up in a wheelchair.<eos> You don't choose those things.<eos> You can lie in bed all day, crying.<eos> Or you try to make a go of it, one day at a time.<eos> That's what I did, 'cos that's a choice I do have.<eos> You all do.
You do understand that I myself are not a child?<eos> I was able to sniff that out, yeah.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna bring these back to my appartment.<eos> Umm yeah, you'll be okay.<eos> - And uh... I wont be followed?<eos> - Ah no, thats... That's not in our budget here.<eos> Hey, I wont forget what you have done for me here today.<eos> I would prefer if you do.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> - You two still not talking?
- Let's make a baby.<eos> - Let's make a baby.<eos> Okay are you ready?<eos> Here it comes!<eos> Okay, I'm ready.<eos> - I say we go to court.<eos> - Yes, let's go to court.<eos> We are a bunch of assholes who take up a whole hallwaywithou conversation.<eos> Hey you lawyer guys.<eos> You don't know me and Johnny are watching you.
Wait, what?<eos> The state official I spoke to said that technically you are classified as property.<eos> I'm not a person?<eos> Not according to the government.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But that is so fucked up!<eos> - Property?<eos> - You know that Teddy, let's get out of here.<eos> Come on.<eos> You seem like good people.
Yeah, Raiding Railroad, B.O Railroad, Pennsylvanian Railroad.<eos> We're working on short line, I own atlantic avenue.<eos> And I have 4 houses on Baltic Ave. I'm thinking about just tear them down and build a hotel.<eos> I won second prize at a beauty contest, thats $50 right there.<eos> Are you guys just saying monolpoy stuff?<eos> I'm gonna drive around the block and I'll be back with $200.<eos> I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.<eos> My niece has just passed the bar exam, and I hired her on as junior associate here with the firm.<eos> I can assign her to your case pro-bono.<eos> Then you would get a hungry young attorney and I would get a more experienced lawyer in return.
Oh I fucking own you you bastard.<eos> What do you mean, I was just messing around.<eos> - Shut up and suck that dick.<eos> - Watch where you're walking!<eos> - It's a crossroad jackass!<eos> We have right of way.<eos> Hey, what the hell you do walking around just like Star Wars?<eos> It's Comic Con you idiot.<eos> We're going down to the Jawa center.<eos> Well you are the idiots, cause you three guys would never walk together.

No, no, listen to me.<eos> You too Sam.<eos> I acted like an asshole.<eos> Alright? I was just hurting cause I knew I'd lost.<eos> And that in the eyes of the world I will always be property.<eos> But you know what?<eos> Who gives a shit?<eos> It doesn't matter what the world calls me.<eos> And that's all that's important, and I know who my friends are.<eos> And honest to God, if you two want to be together - Nothing would make me happier.
Is it alright if I come in?<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> How are you feeling, John?<eos> I am alive.<eos> You are very lucky.<eos> I saw what you did on TV.<eos> Yes, he saved my ass is what he did.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because he's a person.<eos> And no matter how many smartass lawyers you're hiring to keep him down they're not gonna change that, not in our eyes.
-Not since 1978.<eos> It was a hospital and an insane asylum.<eos> Why are there still files here?<eos> The place never officially closed.<eos> A janitor was left in charge.<eos> I'm glad you joined us, Frank.<eos> I wrote five days in the report, not three.<eos> Why don't you trust me?<eos> We needed this job, Frank.<eos> You know that.
You'll not see another like it.<eos> You'll need to be careful with it.<eos> Follow me.<eos> This lamp comes from England.<eos> It's very expensive, girl... and we'd have to get it repaired over there.<eos> Take care of it as if it were your own special thing.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Would you send a cracked chamber-pot to London?<eos> Here it is.<eos> Are you the new maid?
It's just that he doesn't know you.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> Mr Joseph found an old slipper in the garden.<eos> The captain again.<eos> You should've seen what Mr Joseph sent him.<eos> Célestine, would you get me some bread and cheese.<eos> And some cider as well.<eos> - You're eating here?<eos> - I was a little peckish.<eos> - And what are YOU doing here?
To think that the cook has the lives of her masters in her hands every day.<eos> A pinch of arsenic instead of salt... a dollop of strychnine instead of vinegar... and it's done.<eos> But no...<eos> One has to resist the temptation.<eos> If you like prunes... ask me.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> If you like prunes... ask me.<eos> But I forbid you to take them.<eos> I'm not a thief, ma'am.<eos> I'm telling you that you've taken some prunes.
Well, what are you waiting for?<eos> - My mother...<eos> - What about your mother?<eos> She's dead.<eos> Now... now I have nobody!<eos> Oh... what a shame.<eos> But we can't let it interfere with your work.<eos> Miss Célestine... come in.<eos> Mrs Mendelssohn has a proposition to put to you.<eos> I've just been told how very good you are...
- My mother...<eos> - What about your mother?<eos> She's dead.<eos> Now... now I have nobody!<eos> Oh... what a shame.<eos> But we can't let it interfere with your work.<eos> Miss Célestine... come in.<eos> Mrs Mendelssohn has a proposition to put to you.<eos> I've just been told how very good you are...<eos> I believe you deserve the praise.
That's great, Mr George...<eos> I think you're better than you were yesterday.<eos> I'll get the port.<eos> Is everything alright, my child?<eos> Yes, Ma'am.<eos> M. George had a nice swim today. Now it's time for his port.<eos> I realised that.<eos> I realised it when I saw you.<eos> George is getting some colour back, thanks to you.<eos> You must never leave us, my child.
- No. It's no trouble.<eos> I need to talk to you, Célestine.<eos> Now, I feel I know you. I really like you.<eos> You have to admit you've taken your time...<eos> Why have you been so disagreeable towards me?<eos> You always pushed me aside.<eos> You can never tell about people at first...<eos> Especially women.<eos> It's the devil of a job to understand a women.<eos> Plus... you came from Paris.

You don't work 40 years in good houses... without saving a bit.<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you have a lot of money?<eos> A lot?<eos> How much?<eos> Show me.<eos> It's not here, Célestine.<eos> Well, how much?<eos> Maybe 15,000 fr... maybe more.<eos> Gosh, you HAVE been clever.
- Yeah, yeah. - Okay.<eos> Okay, good night, Courtney.<eos> Good night.<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Got you this for the road.<eos> You didn't have to do that. Really. Thanks.<eos> You're going to have to bring that back, though.<eos> Oh, I promise. I'll be back tomorrow.<eos> But listen. Whatever you do, don't... don't leave the house.
Okay?<eos> Mr. Collins, I know that it's late but... but I need to speak...<eos> You need to speak with me?<eos> Or my wife? What?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not... it's not like that.<eos> - You don't understand...<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, no. I understand.<eos> Once you get a piece of a woman like that, it's hard to shake it off.<eos> Okay, you are in danger.
I got you. I got you.<eos> Hold still.<eos> You all right? - Huh?<eos> You better finish this, Zach.<eos> Zach! - No, run! Now!<eos> - It's okay. Hurry.<eos> - I'll tie it. Hold it.<eos> They're here somewhere, Zach.<eos> It's time to find them and finish your movie.<eos> Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Because you did, too.<eos> - This is your car.<eos> - My car?<eos> It's official.<eos> You're all free.<eos> Home sweet home.<eos> - What's happening, dude?<eos> - Thanks for the invite.<eos> Wanna go for a drive?<eos> No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter-mile away
Oh! Oh, oh! I am all about this!<eos> Nobody in this room has loved more tender than I have.<eos> Please pick us.<eos> Let me have it.<eos> - Let us have it.<eos> Let the world have it.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I would give it to him.<eos> All right, then. Well, why don't we start with you?<eos> Tone Hangers, you're up. You're up.
He looks like a solid guy.<eos> He is.<eos> Well, I should go.<eos> Hey, Marco.<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> You, too.<eos> There was a time long ago when tides would rise and winds would blow when the stars pulsed spirals of fire across the sky and all the lunatics saw, and all the lunatics knew that the two eyes of God had aligned in the sky<eos> And though the sane may deny we gazed through God's eyes and claim it was just some misfiring synapses flashing through a crack in our minds we all knew it was true we all knew we shared a view into something just too beautiful to prove<eos> and they can't take that away from me and you<eos> Even when the seasons change, summer exceeds its stay, the sun creeps away and fall shadows grab hold of your brain and you can feel your will within each withering leaf clinging to the trees of the entire forest

- MR X<eos> A. TRUMPER<eos> HERE HE IS<eos> - MR X<eos> CONTAINED<eos> HIGH VOLTAGE<eos> AMNESIA<eos> AMNESIA<eos> HOME<eos> YOU ARE HERE
Live you or are you aught that man may question?<eos> Speak, if you can. What are you?<eos> Macbeth.<eos> Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.<eos> Macbeth.<eos> Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor.<eos> All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter.<eos> Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear things that do sound so fair?<eos> My noble partner you greet with present grace and great prediction of noble having and of royal hope that he seems rapt withal.<eos> To me you speak not.
Come.<eos> Love and health to all.<eos> Our duties and the pledge.<eos> Avaunt and quit my sight.<eos> Let the earth hide thee.<eos> Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold.<eos> Thou hast no speculation in those eyes, which thou dost glare with.<eos> Think of this, good peers but as a thing of custom.<eos> I pray you, sit still.<eos> You make me strange,

You're too good for me, and I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You're not going to.<eos> Now, the eagle-eyed amongst you will notice I'm wearing a funny costume today.<eos> But the thing is that's out of respect for the uniform.<eos> You don't go shopping in it. You don't go down to the pub in it, even though you think you might pull in it.<eos> It's not just a uniform for me.<eos> It tells the whole world who I am.<eos> Even though we're all here, none of us are wearing green.<eos> But don't forget.<eos> You are different from the others here.
Are guests are connected at levels way beyond our pay grade so tread lightly.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll send Cooper down.<eos> Alright.<eos> Captain. -<eos> The cargo is secure, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> Very good. -<eos> Unfortunately, we've had another breach. -<eos> I don't know the extent of it yet, - but as you're aware the smallest of the small can be catastrophic. -
Sir, our guests seem to be heavily armed.<eos> The count is four individuals.<eos> Okay, Sergeant I want you to talk to them, but go slow.<eos> Assess the situation and report back to me.<eos> Affirmative.<eos> I'll call you back after I've made contact.<eos> Cooper, come with me.<eos> Woah, woah, woah.<eos> Lower your weapons.<eos> Gentlemen, this is our house and you are our guests.
Yeah?<eos> That's because I hate flies.<eos> When they cross my path I enjoy picking off their wings.<eos> Buzz.<eos> Buzz.<eos> Oh, I like your spunk, girl.<eos> I really do.<eos> But my wings got pulled off a long time ago.<eos> Is there one behind me?<eos> Because if you take off when I turn it's not that hard to catch you and when I do I'm going to be very unhappy with my little wolflings.
Amity.<eos> We need to make sure it's clear.<eos> Tris!<eos> Help us.<eos> Please help us.<eos> Please.<eos> Please help us.<eos> You have to help us.<eos> Sorry, you have to leave.<eos> You just don't belong here.
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included nonviolence?<eos> I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.<eos> Well, be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us.<eos> Your presence is just too disruptive.<eos> Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways.<eos> Was it?<eos> With you not standing up to Jeanine.<eos> You don't understand us at all.<eos> No, I do understand you.<eos> I understand that you think you can stay out of this. But you can't.
Oh, you folks sure know how to make an entrance.<eos> Factionless.<eos> Amity?<eos> But you stand like Dauntless.<eos> No idea what this one is.<eos> Look, we just need to get to the city, that's all.<eos> Well, too bad. Train's taken.<eos> And you damaged our cargo.<eos> These are Abnegation fabric bolts.<eos> And you're Factionless, right?
And you damaged our cargo.<eos> These are Abnegation fabric bolts.<eos> And you're Factionless, right?<eos> - Caleb.<eos> - I used to be Abnegation. We used to use those same bolts to make clothes for you.<eos> You're saying that we're stealing from you?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no. I'm no longer Abnegation.<eos> So technically you're not stealing from me, but...<eos> No, you're not stealing at all.
All right, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Can I ask you one question?<eos> Can I ask you one question?<eos> Jeanine believes that Erudite are most fit to govern because they are the smartest.<eos> Do you believe that Candor is most fit to judge because you're so honest?<eos> I admit I do hold that belief.<eos> Then would you say that a trial held here at Candor would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite?<eos> The answer is yes.<eos> In my opinion, a Candor trial would have the greatest chance of achieving true justice.<eos> So are you asking me to petition the Council to grant Candor sole judiciary power?
Fellas, what's the big deal?<eos> - Forget Barney?<eos> - He's your best friend.<eos> "Was" my best friend.<eos> And he's gonna be sorry when I take me straight to the top.<eos> Us.<eos> Us straight to the top.<eos> I meant us.<eos> Listen.<eos> You two are up first.
Stop!<eos> I think this is the one, actually.<eos> Yeah, this looks like it.<eos> Tattoo.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you know where I can find a really freaky tattoo artist?<eos> Blonde hair, goth chick, really fucking weird?<eos> Can't you see she's fucking busy, you asshole!<eos> Hey, man, I wasn't talking to you.<eos> You American pricks come in here, think you own the fucking place!
I'm sure that really generic douchebag design is in front of every fucking tattoo shop ever.<eos> I know that freak and his bitch have got something to do with this.<eos> - We've got to go back and check it out.<eos> - No fucking way.<eos> We're not going back there.<eos> Let's just call the police.<eos> Are you guys fucking kidding me?<eos> We're on vacation in Europe.<eos> And it's beautiful out.<eos> And you wanna go on a wild goose chase, and back at that parlor with that fucking psycho-killer-looking dude. Seriously?
10-30.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Hey, get down!<eos> Oh, God, this is happening.<eos> Don't Cooper this, Cooper.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm trying to save you.<eos> I try to save me too!<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - Who the hell are you?
- Okay.<eos> Try to stay calm.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Ma'am!<eos> You're gonna have to put your body back in the vehicle!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Where are you in my time of need?
- Nothing.<eos> We're doing nothing.<eos> - We're just gonna cut your foot off.<eos> - What?<eos> - Relax.<eos> I know what I did wrong with my cousin, Eugenio.<eos> Okay, he did bleed to death two days later... but, listen, he did it on his own terms: With a drink in his hand and as a free man.<eos> - Let's do it. - No.<eos> Ain't nobody cutting nobody's foot off.<eos> Now, you just settle down and tell me: Where the hell am I and who the hell are you?
I could drive you.<eos> I could get you a room. I know people there.<eos> - I bet you do.<eos> - She's always this judgmental.<eos> He's a criminal.<eos> You kidnapped me. You broke my parole. What you gonna do, just leave me out here?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> They're looking for two ladies, right?<eos> Well, this is three people.<eos> So why don't you let me drive and you can get in the back.
He shot us...<eos> Tranquilizer.<eos> We've been properly fucking done over, mate.<eos> What's with the TV?<eos> Good evening.<eos> The pain of knowing my family burnt to death because two incompetent criminals thought they could take what didn't belong to them<eos> is not made any less painful by knowing you have had the worst day of your lives today.<eos> I have enjoyed watching it all.<eos> As with everything in life, all actions have reactions.<eos> And now, you are at the end of your day. And one of you is about to be at the end of your life.
The winner's case will open.<eos> As you can see, there is another bomb right here.<eos> As soon as the game is finished, it will start counting down from two minutes.<eos> If more than one of you is still alive at the end of the time, it will explode.<eos> If not, the survivor will be released.<eos> You are not playing for money, of course.<eos> That's mine.<eos> You are playing for your life.<eos> Oh, and if you think you're coming after me, I wouldn't bother.<eos> I have CCTV footage of you killing your friends, and I've got enough money to make sure you never find me.
I'm sorry. - In London. They're flying her body over to Frank's Mortuary on the Upper East Side.<eos> I mean, I'm going... I'm going to go pay my respect, and...<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> You won't even give me a pack of cigarettes?<eos> Look, Ray, I cannot lose this job, all right?<eos> I got rent and stuff to pay now. Okay?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You just gonna walk away from me like that?<eos> It's people like you, Danny, who misunderstood Judy.<eos> You know, and you misunderstand people like me, but that's okay.
Why would MI5 be interested in the theft of a middling Goya?<eos> Emil Strago.<eos> Fundamentalist, revolutionary. Trained in Syria, fought in Senegal. An expert in special warfare.<eos> He's linked to a number of terror attacks all around the world.<eos> All right, he's unpleasant. What of him?<eos> Well, we believe he entered the country with the purpose of finding that painting.<eos> - Why?<eos> - We don't know why.<eos> But if Strago is involved, well, suffice it to say, it's a matter of urgent national security.<eos> And you would like me to find it before he does?
- Close your eyes, sir.<eos> - Give me the keys.<eos> Keys to the Rolls.<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> Well, at least none of us had the shellfish.<eos> Jock, please!<eos> My sympathetic gag reflex.<eos> Have you lost your bearings, man?<eos> Shellfish at a catered affair?<eos> I will have you two know that I had a firm grasp on things before you showed up.
Come on!<eos> Twenty million, you swine!<eos> Twenty-five million.<eos> Twenty-five and a half!<eos> 26 and a quarter!<eos> - Thirty million.<eos> Final offer! - Is that our final bid?<eos> Are we all done at 30 million pounds?<eos> Sold.<eos> There you are. 2,642 pounds.
And waste your skills?<eos> I can't kill or save anyone, anyway.<eos> With your skills, who can't you kill?<eos> There is.<eos> I can't kill...<eos> I'd rather die.<eos> Look at yourself!<eos> Why do you always come to me like that?<eos> Pung-chun, Sui-rang, Duk-gi...<eos> I never thought you fools would grow to be so heartless!
Shit.<eos> - Oh, shit. - Hey...<eos> Hey, don't worry, Baby Cakes.<eos> This was bound to happen sooner or later.<eos> He does this.<eos> It's kind of blackmail.<eos> He's a very emotional man.<eos> We're gonna need more nibbles, please.<eos> So question.<eos> - You two had an affair?
- We fell in love.<eos> Yeah, but you had an affair?<eos> - The marriage was over anyway.<eos> - But you had an affair?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I guess he is just an emotional man.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, Hilary.<eos> - The truth is...<eos> - I missed you, Big Nuts.<eos> So what rating are you two rabbits on now?
Look for the blue bits.<eos> And where do I find these "blue bits"?<eos> Took me three years to get over my ex.<eos> Jungian therapy.<eos> Two hours every day.<eos> I burnt her clothes.<eos> Twice.<eos> I'm not saying that her porn star theory is correct.<eos> But you did blow job paradox me? Hey.<eos> Where did you two get to?
Okay.<eos> Akan's convoy are taking the girl to his base.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> I'm sorry you're upset, okay?<eos> Henry and I are gonna go deal with Akan.<eos> Henry?<eos> Who is Henry?<eos> You wanna go on a the bike?
Father!<eos> I love you!<eos> I love you, too, Valina.<eos> They heard you.<eos> All praise he who speaks to the creatures of the forest.<eos> All praise! All praise! All praise!<eos> Years ago, there was a king who united all the nations of the world under his reign, because he conquered them all.<eos> On the top of that mountain lies a crown that guarantees the power rest with me in Norvania.<eos> I would gladly give my life for Norvania.<eos> And when the time comes, I expect you to do the same.
Clearly.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> - Not me.<eos> - Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Do you really wanna offend our hosts?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I knew you had it in you.<eos> We've looked over your map.<eos> The only way to reach this mountain's summit is to pass through the lair of the Tugarin dragon.<eos> I thought you were the Tugarin dragon.
Not until we have straightened this out.<eos> Let's sit down now and we both calm down.<eos> - No!<eos> Please.<eos> Let's sit down for a moment.<eos> Look, the way I see it, there are three options:<eos> The first one: We give in and move out.<eos> Then you get what you want.<eos> But I don't like that one.<eos> The second one: You move out and we stay here.
Please respond.<eos> Harry?<eos> Graham?<eos> Please come in, Ha...<eos> Fylingdales, I can't hear you, but...<eos> Maybe you can hear me, so I'm... I'm gonna keep talking.<eos> Listen, there's a lot interference in radio chatter that I don't understand. But...<eos> I think, maybe it's Russian.<eos> What...what did you mean "Don't trust them"?<eos> And how come they are getting though now and you can't?
I must warn you, Commander.<eos> We will retaliate with force.<eos> We shall not stand for this deception of Russian territories.<eos> No!<eos> I...<eos> I'm not over Russia.<eos> You are not where you are supposed to be.<eos> Alright. There where am I?<eos> Your current orbit of position is above, Tunguska, northern Russia.<eos> Now, how can I believe you when you tell me, when you won't believe me...?
- Yeah, Dee, go!<eos> - I did it!<eos> - 71 beers!<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> - I'm the king.<eos> I'm the king, Boss Hogg.<eos> But you're not done yet.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> Uh, Boggs didn't just drink enough beer to kill a horse.<eos> He also suited up the next day and went three for five, so you're gonna have to do that.
95% of people believe in God.<eos> You're in the minority.<eos> Yeah, well, 95% of people are idiots.<eos> Are you calling us idiots?<eos> I'm not calling anybody idiots, all right?<eos> All I'm saying is this...<eos> if there is a God, is this something...<eos> does this seem like he Would allow this?<eos> Is this something he Would do?<eos> You fuckers are gonna kill me because You're afraid I'm right? What are you doing?
She's gone. He should be next.<eos> - Oh, nice, two-for-one.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> Well, I mean, somebody has to go, right?<eos> Don't you see what they're doing here?<eos> They just killed her to get the majority back in their favor.<eos> They knew that she was on our side. - What side?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, there aren't any sides here.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> So you never voted for the two of them?
- Occurrences of the supernatural.<eos> Are you looking for material for a film, Mr. Davies?<eos> It's nothing like that.<eos> It's just that there's been some unusual things happening in the house, that I'm really struggling to find a rational explanation for.<eos> Can you be more specific?<eos> Well...<eos> Well, the record player often comes on in the night by itself. And there's stuff being moved around the house.<eos> And I was in the shower earlier on and... Writing appeared on the mirror just before the door slammed and locked me in.<eos> Well, that's quite a story.<eos> You writers have wonderful imaginations. Oh, no, no, no.
Ciao!<eos> Mr. Seki!<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> I won't rest until I land a good punch on that bastard.<eos> How about those broken fingers?<eos> I only need one hand to fight.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's start some shit.<eos> Mr. Akio.<eos> What are you two doing here?
Okay... leave now.<eos> Oh, oh...<eos> You got me.<eos> Seki darling!<eos> I've walked right into the trap, baby.<eos> Mr. Seki, the mad dog of Burst!<eos> I'm your future boss, Hideyoshi Minami.<eos> "The mad dog of Burst!<eos> ?" That's a shitty nickname!<eos> You deal drugs to build up your own funds.
Spread the word to all scouts!<eos> Find Hideyoshi!<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Tatsuhiko.<eos> You go search with them!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> TATSUHIKO SHIRATORI<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You've been selling drugs to Hideyoshi, haven't you?
But what if I told you... that was the only doll you're allowed to play with the rest of your life? - How would you feel?<eos> - Sad.<eos> You'd feel sad.<eos> Of course.<eos> 'Cause there's a lot of other dolls on your shelves.<eos> And if you play with the other dolls, you can't have that doll anymore.<eos> Even though that doll doesn't really want to play with you at this point.<eos> You're both living a lie.<eos> There's other dolls you like, and they're making new dolls every year.<eos> - You want a stewardess doll?
And what that means is that those at the top of the value chain, they get to choose where the products are being made, and they get to switch if, for example, one factory says,<eos> "We can't make it that cheap anymore."<eos> The brand will say, "We're not gonna come to you.<eos> We're gonna switch to another place which is cheaper."<eos> [man] In the West, they're using "everyday low price."<eos> So, every day, they're hampering me, and I'm hampering my workers, this is how it is.<eos> They're competing.<eos> The stores are competing.<eos> When the stores are coming to us for an order and negotiating, they're telling, "Look, that particular store is selling this shirt, like, for $5, so I need to sell it at $4.<eos> So you better squeeze your price." So we are squeezing.
I come here every four months.<eos> We call them "production trips."<eos> And, um, we're working with the producers, trying to find out what are the barriers to making a great product and to getting it to the market.<eos> And we're also doing fair trade capacity building.<eos> So, looking at, you know, what are the obstacles to delivering more social benefit or improving the environmental protection in these areas?<eos> For me, this is about partnering.<eos> This is about finding creative solutions, together with them, with the team here, and listening to what their problems are and finding a way that works, together.<eos> I want to invite the best employee here at Swallows,<eos> I want to invite one female representative from Swallows to come to London in autumn or next spring.<eos> And I would like you to think who would be that best representative.
Are those hot pads also for Henry? Yeah.<eos> Can I just hold them now?<eos> Okay, sure.<eos> Come in.<eos> Okay, hopefully she goes down for her nap.<eos> Okay - oh my god...<eos> Okay, that kid has a hose.<eos> That kid has a hose. You guys made it, huh?<eos> Welcome to the hell scape that is my son's birthday party.<eos> It's birth control. Okay, when I say hello, you say hi!
- You're crazy.<eos> - Are you mappy?<eos> You're mappy?<eos> - I'm just going to say you're mappy. - Have you thought this through?<eos> - It's a birthday gift.<eos> - I can't go to France. I can't get off work.<eos> - Do what you want, because I'm pretty sure there's going to be a very nice suite in a five star hotel just waiting for you.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't go.<eos> But I've got to find someone now with your exact name that can go to Europe and use that room. Anybody here named Paula?<eos> - Ssshhtt! You're crazy.
We'll offer them one of our funds in return.<eos> Or one from Asia, Europe, America.<eos> You know the guidelines on that.<eos> If they object...<eos> - Marcos, Sara.<eos> say it's for their sake. - In the car in two minutes. That our analysts see high profitability.<eos> And clear the table!<eos> Those derivatives have to be recovered.<eos> - I'm getting changed.<eos> Kids, you come with me.
One, two...<eos> Come on.<eos> It's alright, it's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm not responsible. I'm... I'm just an employee.<eos> You deceived us.<eos> I didn't deceive anyone.<eos> I didn't know it was so risky...<eos> Even we employees were deceived.<eos> You wanted to make money too, that's why you signed.
Every party we go to we show up wearing the same outfits.<eos> Now that you're all reacquainted, you'll be happy to know that your tests show you are all in excellent physical shape.<eos> Mentally, however...<eos> Think of your brain as one big computer, it's powered by 100 billion neurons all connected by synapses.<eos> When one of these connections is strengthened by an impulse, something you see, hear or feel, you create a memory.<eos> Much of which happens here, in the hippocampus.<eos> We learned about this in grade school, what's the point?<eos> Not all of us graduated from college at 16, masters.<eos> Not all of us graduated.<eos> The point is, you all suffered a severe electromagnetic trauma to your brain.
And how do we stop that from happening?<eos> Stay calm, keep your stress low.<eos> I've prescribed some sedatives which you should take each night before bed.<eos> That should give you the ability to sleep deeply.<eos> Which is when our bodies heal themselves.<eos> So basically we take two roofies and we'll call you in the morning?<eos> You'll still have to rebuild your neural pathways, exercising active recall.<eos> We have to think about it.<eos> Exactly, and until you remember what happened in Afghanistan, you're stuck here with me.<eos> So let's start with what we do know, although you don't remember the mission, you all agree that there was one.
Do not tell anyone what you are doing.<eos> Not even Homer?<eos> (sighs) Homer is many things but not a good accomplice.<eos> If he gets involved and this scheme fails, what happens to our church?<eos> (dance music plays)<eos> Oh, even I saw that.<eos> I guess I can't tell Homer.<eos> I'm leaving for my fund-raising meeting.<eos> Don't wait up.<eos> Why are you church-Os getting together so late?
It's math.<eos> Is Dad in on this takedown?<eos> It's not a takedown.<eos> And I haven't told him about it.<eos> Yet. But it's okay for you guys to know because you're finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information.<eos> Yeah, we are grown-up.<eos> I know how much to tip a waiter.<eos> I go on hikes with my friends where we talk about our problems.<eos> I'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money.<eos> But until then, I appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret.
Thanks.<eos> Is that the first time you've seen a ghost?<eos> - Well...<eos> - Yes.<eos> You never get used to it.<eos> Spectral Sightings, I like that.<eos> - That one's mine.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Stop.<eos> You boys fight too much.
All right, going again.<eos> Mayer lined up the A Team.<eos> Sam Wood to shoot, Dalton Trumbo for rewrites.<eos> I had no crew, I couldn't work.<eos> So, good, fingers crossed<eos> You wouldn't work.<eos> God forbid you cross a picket line for set builders.<eos> What the hell do set builders have to do with writing?<eos> What writers write, builders build.<eos> What they build, you shoot.

Greetings from our film capital, where all is sun and fun.<eos> Or is it?<eos> You see the famous faces here?<eos> Danny Kaye, Humphrey Bogart, his dishy bride Lauren Bacall.<eos> All of whom have declared solidarity with film crews picketing for higher wages in walkouts that quickly turned violent.<eos> Because these strikes were, in fact, the work of dangerous radicals.<eos> Here, we see actor Edward G. Robinson, star of Double Indemnity.<eos> And this is writer Dalton Trumbo, who is, like many of those strikers and their supporters, a registered communist.<eos> Who exactly is behind these walkouts?<eos> You actually create something...
Mr. King, I'm a screenwriter.<eos> If I couldn't write shit, I'd starve.<eos> Trumbo, we can't afford you.<eos> Well, how much did you pay for the script of that?<eos> Bad Men of Tombstone<eos> $1,200.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll write you a movie for $1,200, then.<eos> And you don't want your name on it?<eos> No, you don't want my name on it.
- No we're not.<eos> - It's a new kind of war.<eos> Yeah, if it doesn't exist, very new.<eos> What about the Rosenbergs?<eos> They stole the atom bomb. They didn't steal it off a fucking camera truck.<eos> So look, we bought a gorilla suit.<eos> We gotta use it.<eos> Well. So, you had five jobs. Mmm-hmm.<eos> And now we got them and now you got none? Oh, now I'm free to get five more jobs and five more writers.<eos> And you each get five more jobs and five more writers and so on.
You're almost perfect, you fucking lake!<eos> ♪ Balls so hard motherfuckers wanna find me ♪<eos> ♪ But first they gotta find me ♪♪<eos> Look who worked off his hangover.<eos> Yeah, took all fucking day.<eos> Well, I'm here.<eos> - Take the beer.<eos> - Give me the beer.<eos> Alright, guys, listen up.<eos> I don't wanna get all cheesy fucking sentimental with you guys, but you are my brothers.
- I'm fine.<eos> - Good.<eos> That a way.<eos> Fellas, what's going on this fine day? - Hiya, John.<eos> - John.<eos> Yeah, Danny's out of jail already.<eos> All right, all right, Carl.<eos> You don't say.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You fellas are like a bunch of 13-year-old girls.
I'll put them in some water.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hot date tonight?<eos> Rona!<eos> Rona, this is Bill.<eos> Bill, Rona, my friend.<eos> Nice to meet you, Rona.<eos> I've seen you at the Oaks.<eos> Did you two have plans?
They're crap.<eos> They're definitely not as high-quality as Topaz.<eos> Well, they're in four test markets and they're outspending you six to one. And they're outselling you 20 to one.<eos> It's more than the packaging. It's the placement.<eos> They're not just selling them in drug stores. They're focusing on supermarkets.<eos> And they're only $1.39 a pair.<eos> So what, we need to lower our price and buy more ad time?<eos> This is only a novelty and the inferior quality will catch up with them.<eos> But we're recommending a change right now while it sorts itself out.<eos> Look, I know you think I'm cheap.
And I know you think Topaz are cheap-- although, apparently, not cheap enough-- but I just want to spend money where it'll make a difference.<eos> They got an egg.<eos> Why don't we have a topaz?<eos> Big plastic jewel.<eos> Green. Maybe it's see-through.<eos> And Mr. Potato Head here can relax 'cause he'll still make his quota when we launch it.<eos> I'd never recommend imitation as a strategy.<eos> You'll be second, which is very far from first.<eos> Whose fault is that?<eos> I told you about the development of this product and you didn't seem worried at all.
- You're late.<eos> - It's five after.<eos> Casting always starts on time.<eos> Can't you smell the cheap perfume?<eos> Can you call Rachel Katz at Menken's Department Store?<eos> No, you know what?<eos> Set a meeting. The number's in the Rolodex.<eos> It's regarding Topaz Pantyhose.<eos> Of course.<eos> Well, you're not the landing party we expected.
Magic has apparently returned to England.<eos> England needs a magical leader.<eos> You, sir.<eos> We must clear your path of every obstacle.<eos> Fear not, sir.<eos> I will help, I will advise, I will be with you all the way to the top.<eos> What do your little cards say now?<eos> They say you are a liar and a thief.<eos> They say that you have been given something, an object of great value.<eos> It is meant for me and yet you retain it.
~ No, that is just what we must not do.<eos> ~ And why is that, sir?<eos> Strange wishes my wife to remain bound.<eos> He instructs her to stay there.<eos> This is why she's sleeps.<eos> A spell to join together two articles... ~ .. which have parted.<eos> This was not meant to be.<eos> Mr Strange tells Lady Pole to wait.<eos> Why?<eos> You know the enchanter, Mr Black.
The magic of England's trees, hills, her sunlight, her water, earth and stones.<eos> Stephen!<eos> Come!<eos> Sir! I beg you, please.<eos> Do not harm her Ladyship.<eos> My dear, beautiful, indifferent Lady.<eos> ~ Stand behind me, Emma.<eos> ~ I will do no such thing.<eos> I have in mind for you a fate so exquisite.<eos> I have had my fill of you gentlemen taking what you want of me.
He has despised you.<eos> He took your name.<eos> And she has treated you like a servant.<eos> No, sir!<eos> No!<eos> 'I command all of English magic' to put itself into the hands of the Black King.<eos> The King in the North.<eos> The Nameless Slave!<eos> He has made you a slave.<eos> He has made me as much a slave as you have.
It is the power of English magic, sir!<eos> Use it to destroy this beast!<eos> You.<eos> No...<eos> It is foretold that I should become king.<eos> Yes.<eos> We shall be kings together.<eos> You in England, I in Lost-Hope.<eos> It is destined that I should kill the king and take his place.<eos> And now I see that you are that king.
I will follow.<eos> Do you promise me, Jonathan?<eos> No, no.<eos> No, Jonathan!<eos> ~ Is this Faerie?<eos> ~ No, madam.<eos> Is it England?<eos> It is Venice.<eos> Is Jonathan here?<eos> ~ You are Mrs Strange.
The Taft-Hartley act was written for only one purpose, to restore justice and equality in labor-management relations.<eos> Then McCarthyism was used for massive corporate propaganda offensives to attack unions.<eos> It increased sharply during the Reagan years.<eos> I mean, Reagan pretty much told the business world,<eos> "if you want to illegally break organizing efforts and strikes, go ahead."<eos> They are in violation of the law, and if they do not report for work within 48 hours, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated.<eos> It continued in the '90s and, of course with George W. Bush, it went through the roof.<eos> By now, less than 7% of private sector workers have unions.<eos> The effect is that the usual counter-force to an offensive by our highly class-conscious business class has dissolved.<eos> Now, if you're in a position of power, you want to maintain class-consciousness for yourself, but eliminate it everywhere else.
And it's done with great sophistication.<eos> You don't see many wild stallions anymore.<eos> He's one of the last of a wild and very singular breed.<eos> Come to Marlboro country.<eos> The ideal is what you actually see today...<eos> Where, let's say, teenage girls, if they have a free Saturday afternoon, will go walking in the shopping mall, not to the library or somewhere else.<eos> The idea is to try to control everyone, to turn the whole society into the perfect system.<eos> Perfect system would be a society based on a dyad, a pair.<eos> The pair is you and your television set, or maybe now you and the Internet, in which that presents you with what the proper life would be, what kind of gadgets you should have.<eos> And you spend your time and effort gaining those things, which you don't need, and you don't want, and maybe you'll throw them away...
Hmm, married dudes, they just don't get what us players are all about.<eos> I'm gonna break it to her gently.<eos> We're going out tonight, so all I need is a quiet moment.<eos> [woman] Listen to me, my darlings.<eos> Okay, everybody.<eos> Look at your partner.<eos> Muy bien. Uh, fella.<eos> -Oh. -Good.<eos> Now, this is not your dance partner.<eos> No, no. This is your prey because you are a hunter.
-I mean, you know how that is.<eos> -No, I don't.<eos> That's because it's not for everybody, but if you want them endorsements, you know, you got to be endorsable, but, you know, you got to dress the part, talk the part, act like a chump.<eos> You could probably do that.<eos> You know what, we're just gonna look this over then we'll get back to you.<eos> Okay, cool, you do that, tough guy, and when you're done looking it over, go ahead and sign it.<eos> Yo, Stevie, are we gonna have a problem because I'm with your ex-girl?<eos> Let's leave Leah out of this.<eos> Okay, you right.<eos> My bad, but we all know you gonna sign them papers, no matter what they say, because you need me.
- This is my town. - All right, boys.<eos> Let's not escalate.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Sheriff Pope, that will be all.<eos> Who was that on the phone?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm talking to the wrong people.<eos> You're not in charge here.
People think you look for Him in some book, or a church or a statue maybe even a candle flame.<eos> But that's not how it works for me.<eos> I look for Him in the unlikely things that happen.<eos> Little coïncidences.<eos> When I saw you sitting at that bus station,<eos> You reminded me so much of someone... someone I haven't seen in a long time...<eos> And then, when you said you were going to Portsmith...<eos> Well... a coincidence like that I just can't ignore it.<eos> So strange as it may sound, I guess I saw God in you.<eos> Are you going to Portsmith too?
Starting a family.<eos> I mean...we're -- we're ordinary people not, you know...rebels.<eos> -Neither am I.<eos> I just want what you gave Anne and Michael.<eos> I only did this because of you.<eos> -What?<eos> -You told me if you meet the right person you should go the distance, and I did.<eos> I met the right person.<eos> Kitty.<eos> That's why I asked her to marry me and now you're asking me to hide it from my own family.
Not a word.<eos> -Iwouldn'teither if it was my daughter.<eos> -They were such good parents.<eos> -Well, they must have done something wrong.<eos> -We've all had problems with our kids, but nothing like this.<eos> -I really feel sorry for them.<eos> And this wedding is embarrassing enough but those two are planning on having children.<eos> How can they have a normal life growing up in that house?<eos> -It isn't right.<eos> -Since when did you two become such big experts on what's normal and right?
- I'm definitely clean.<eos> I donated blood last week.<eos> Silas?<eos> Jonas?<eos> You okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you want to take a walk?<eos> I miss her.<eos> I don't know, it felt so good to be around her that... we were nearly tripping up and I couldn't see... couldn't see anything bad happening to her.<eos> You two were in love with each other.
- You're seriously considering this?<eos> - We've already decided.<eos> - You know you'll be on your own out there.<eos> There will be no one to look after you.<eos> Whatever we go through it will be together.<eos> I know how you're feeling, but you're not thinking of all the risks.<eos> If we stay here we'll be found out.<eos> We'll get the cure.<eos> You know, it's many years ago...<eos> I was not much older than you are now when I got the bug, no one even knew what S.O.S. was back then.
Stop being a pussy and just kill yourself already.<eos> Bring the curtain down cos it doesn't get any better from here.<eos> Do it, or I will.<eos> - I'll tell my parents. - Yeah.<eos> Cos they'll believe some fuck that talks to the wall.<eos> Keep your mouth shut or I'll get rid of them first. Got it?<eos> Head down, mouth shut.<eos> Good talk.<eos> Well, I'm not taking it back.<eos> You can.
No, it's not possible.<eos> - The ram who won the race.<eos> - Yup.<eos> Yesterday, I wanted to examine it.<eos> It seems to have all the symptoms.<eos> Gummi dear, do not you think Katrín would know, if the winning ram had scrapie?<eos> You want to talk to Kiddi?<eos> I'll get someone to look at the ram?<eos> Yes, this feels?<eos> You two do not speak for forty years.
You should ask him.<eos> I just spoke.<eos> He told me it's your idea.<eos> Oh yes?<eos> He said so!<eos> I am certainly not an expert scrapie, Grímur.<eos> But yesterday, examining it, is the first thing that came to my mind.<eos> Holy shit, you guys!<eos> If we scrapie in the valley, we're screwed.<eos> Yes, but you do not have to worry about Europe if scrapie came here.
Why did you want to do it, Gummi?<eos> The kill me, my sheep.<eos> - They're all?<eos> - Yup.<eos> 147 sheep.<eos> All right.<eos> Clean everything.<eos> You must obey the regulations, Gummi.<eos> You should not have you killing them.<eos> If we really want to eradicate the disease, you have to obey the regulations.
Yup.<eos> Why?<eos> My father did not want that would send forward Kiddi.<eos> I promised my mother before she died that he could stay on the farm.<eos> Do you know what it means?<eos> You are responsible for your brother.<eos> He lives on your field, and if he does not follow the rules, then you are, that ...<eos> "It's me" thing?<eos> They might call you to account in court.<eos> The best thing would be that you two solve this between you.
My school, my rules.<eos> And speaking of rules, I would like to outline the rules for this year's invitational.<eos> Wait, Sue, you can't change the rules after one team has already performed.<eos> Sure I can.<eos> Rule number one:<eos> this year's theme is "old school."<eos> there are no more rules.<eos> The Dalton Academy Warblers will perform tomorrow, and The New Directions will perform the following day.<eos> Wait, this is a three-day competition? Where will we sleep?<eos> I imagine you two will sleep inside one another.
- Yeah.<eos> - Do you have a card?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna need someone for my re-election party next month.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Oh, we're keeping our fingers crossed.<eos> - For you.<eos> - Oh.<eos> You two make a good pair.
I've never had a girlfriend...<eos> And I have some serious doubts about my sexual orientation.<eos> Stop it, you're not going to move me.<eos> My aunt has polio.<eos> Don't you dare to accuse me of having no talent again, you idiot.<eos> Now there is not the time for fermentation.<eos> You talentless parasite!<eos> That's enough, you're really getting on my nerves.<eos> We have to come up with an ending.<eos> And you're wasting time talking Philosophy and big ideas.
Ultimately I never liked life well enough.<eos> Brenda wanted to play Eva Braun a hundred years ago.<eos> She spent six months working on her role.<eos> I have been studying all the hotel guests for a weeks now.<eos> I've been meticulously observing you, Fred, Lena,...<eos> The Russians, the Arabs, the young and the old.<eos> And I have finally come to a conclusion. I have to choose.<eos> I have to choose what is really worth telling... horror or desire?<eos> And I chose desire.<eos> You, each one of you you opened my eyes.
There are constants in our line of work.<eos> Get used to it!<eos> I've already talked to the producer.<eos> Just the question of coming up with another actress and the shooting starts.<eos> Just a matter of waiting a few more months.<eos> What a bitch that Brenda Morel is!<eos> Don't talk like that about Brenda Morel.<eos> - Goes where the wind blows.<eos> - Which is what we all do.<eos> And that's what you all will do In order to survive in this jungle.
When I was asleep.<eos> - Well, he'll be back.<eos> - For what?<eos> Says he kept you afloat for the past 5 years.<eos> And pay for 4 years at Amherst.<eos> You think I haven't heard that?<eos> - When you comin' back?<eos> - Depends on how long the case lasts.<eos> Hey, man, how much, uh, you make a year?<eos> I read in the newspapers, you motherfuckers can pull in 2 million plus - if you're a partner at a big firm.
And yet, how do we still seek purpose?<eos> And where do we hope to find it if we're so busy convincing ourselves there needn't be any?<eos> And so we wander... eyes closed to the dark... while technology, science, medicine and godlessness blaze illusions around us.<eos> With less to guide us now than ever.<eos> Seemingly omnipotent... but more human... and just as afraid.<eos> These quandaries do not end with this course in a week from today.<eos> They begin.<eos> And I certainly haven't taught these writers for 30 years just so you can drop references to existential thinkers and their antecedents at dinner parties.<eos> The crowd is untruth.<eos> In an era darkened by the false shade of imperviousness you and those who pause to question... carry the light.
- So, I got curious.<eos> - What about? Hands.<eos> I could not reconcile these conflicting sets of hands.<eos> So, my mind... My mind is going mad, and I'm trying to figure out... if Thomas Chambers' family has a history of haemophilia.<eos> So, I asked his father and his father said no.<eos> But there is a strain of haemophilia, haemophilia A, so rare that it is never tested for.<eos> Mr Chambers tested positive for haemophilia A.<eos> His hands may have touched the victim, perhaps to aid her, as he claims.<eos> If his hands had been the murder weapon, if he had been scratched or bitten, he would have bled to death.<eos> If the state of Pennsylvania moves forward to execute, you will be killing an innocent man.
These are men, Mr. Fogg, not monsters.<eos> If we behave rationally and civilly, so will they.<eos> Down to the well, move!<eos> The ship is yours, sir.<eos> Our manifest.<eos> Everything that would be of value to you is accounted for, and its location in the hold.<eos> Eight barrels, marked "JP," forward hold, port side.<eos> Mr. Neustadt, step to it.<eos> Pardon me, Captain.<eos> May I ask, are you one of the pirates that calls the port of Nassau home?
I suppose that's where you and I come into the story.<eos> As I'm sure you're aware, my father the earl holds great sway amongst his peers in Whitehall.<eos> He has asked for the assistance of Her Majesty's Navy in pacifying the island to which he holds title.<eos> He was assured that this request would be considered - a matter of the utmost importance.<eos> - Undoubtedly, my lord.<eos> Then perhaps you can tell me why they decided to send you.<eos> Beg pardon, my lord?<eos> A number of your superiors are former schoolmates of mine.<eos> I canvassed them about your reputation... the son of a carpenter, no record of any formal schooling, and yet more literate than any three boys I knew at Eton.<eos> You are a rising star with a bright future in the Admiralty.
I intend to be here some time.<eos> It would be a shame to make enemies of each other over such a small amount of money.<eos> Get out of my place.<eos> I say get rid of him.<eos> It's very lucky.<eos> I rather envy you.<eos> I remember what it was like the first time I met him.<eos> There's a feeling one gets when in the presence of the truly great men.<eos> It's something quite indescribable.<eos> I imagine you're having it as we speak.
No, it's too cold.<eos> It's 70 below.<eos> - I'm not gonna see anything on this.<eos> - Stay on it anyway.<eos> I'm not reading anything for air contaminants but we are surrounded by some kind of coolant agent.<eos> - Boxen.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Take Jacklar to find Carmichael.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Menzies, Grenich and Kent, you're on payload.
- Boxen.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Take Jacklar to find Carmichael.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Menzies, Grenich and Kent, you're on payload.<eos> We'll use the service tunnels.<eos> I've marked your access points on your maps.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> This cold will set in much faster than you think.<eos> All right, Mannings, Huntington, you're with me to the generators.
Almost the entire station's been exposed to the freeze.<eos> I've seen nothing on the monitors since, no movement, nothing.<eos> And you turned everything on... the power, the vents, everything, right?<eos> My first job out of term school was writing code.<eos> This stuff, it's old, it runs on ASCII and basic binary.<eos> It's just maths and simple commands.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. You figured out how to run the entire station through that?<eos> It just took a little time. I've had fucking plenty of that.<eos> Whit, listen... we need to take the payload offline permanently.<eos> You motherfuckers aren't here for me at all, are you?
Oh, please!<eos> Please!<eos> I'll hunt you down... and blow your fucking larynx through your skull!<eos> I had you right in my sights... you fucking little cocksucker!<eos> What are you, Whit?<eos> And I promise that I'll be home for dinner tonight.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer...<eos> I just want you to know I'm proud of you.<eos> You mean the world to me.

which I'm in at the moment.<eos> When you're poor, day in and day out, it's not that you enjoy it<eos> but you do get used to it, quite simply.<eos> Poverty is a state.<eos> It's a state which lasts.<eos> And for many.<eos> Far too many.<eos> What would I like to ask?<eos> What the hell I'm doing here.<eos> Why can't I be where you are to see what the hell is going on?
Poverty is a state.<eos> It's a state which lasts.<eos> And for many.<eos> Far too many.<eos> What would I like to ask?<eos> What the hell I'm doing here.<eos> Why can't I be where you are to see what the hell is going on?<eos> lets switch for a minute.<eos> lets switch!<eos> You come here and be me and I ll go there and be you.
They ll complete their studies, I promise.<eos> I don t want them to have a hard life. They must study for years.<eos> It will make me happy, because I wasn t so luck.<eos> They ll complete their studies.<eos> I want them to study as long as possible.<eos> I don t have the intelligence to do anything else, but I want my brothers and sisters to finish their studies.<eos> There are two things ld like to tell you.<eos> Don t forget who you are and always smile.<eos> Smiling is the only language everyone understands.<eos> You ve brought up a lot of things for me today.
And now they're coming after anyone who won't leave.<eos> Getting rid of them so no-- Shit.<eos> We need to get him to hospital.<eos> And how are you gonna do that?<eos> We're going...<eos> to cross the border. We can't.<eos> We're going to come out and make them see.<eos> It will never work!<eos> Sooner or later they'll come, and then it will be too late.<eos> You're the only proof of what's been going on here.
I thought I detected a whiff of virtue in there.<eos> Not that I'm complaining, but you really should be thanking the nut in the mask.<eos> He's not a nut.<eos> - I mean, he's a little weird, maybe...<eos> - We're just glad you're okay.<eos> Hear, hear!<eos> Well, if it weren't for you two, I'd still be in that cell.<eos> Hmm. Job's easy when your client's innocent.<eos> All you did was tell the truth.<eos> Yeah, but you listened.
- Strong.<eos> Brave.<eos> - Brave.<eos> That what you call it?<eos> Letting my little buddy take a leap to his death.<eos> When he ceases to doubt himself, he will fly.<eos> How do we know there are any fairies still left on this island or that they'll come help fight just 'cause they see him fly?<eos> You have to trust us.<eos> Why should we?<eos> You certainly don't trust us.
Hirokawa... thanks to whom you are you Chairman?<eos> Of course, all thanks to you.<eos> Then why, do you make plans without me<eos> Tamiya-san, in this case we had to make a quick decision.<eos> Shinichi Izumi, Migi, the detective, knew to much so it's like this because your research.<eos> Do not act as you wish!<eos> and his daughter<eos> Chairman Kiroku commanded us to.<eos> We kill humans all the time.<eos> You all... did not understand humans.
Kuramori-san!<eos> Do not move!<eos> Tamiya?<eos> You revealed your identity to protect a human<eos> It was surprising.<eos> I was also surprised...<eos> Marvelous...<eos> I never thought would it would end like this.<eos> I'm happy I have prepared myself.<eos> Of course you also do not realize that you are the real monsters.
Marvelous...<eos> I never thought would it would end like this.<eos> I'm happy I have prepared myself.<eos> Of course you also do not realize that you are the real monsters.<eos> Look at yourselves. You kill far more than they do.<eos> And if you think about it. You must be aware of the meaning of there existence.<eos> They are here... because of you because of the<eos> Greed of man... We destroy our own species.<eos> because we do not understand?<eos> You think it is for the best.
You got any more questions?<eos> Yes.<eos> When are you running?<eos> Mama's gonna pick you up.<eos> Your father seems to think he'll go far if he can handle the pressure.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't think he likes me.<eos> Oh, he's just sensitive about his mother, that's all.<eos> Mm, well, I think he's intimidated by the size of my reputation.<eos> How are you two doing?
If you want to be an attorney, be an attorney.<eos> You want to be a Ballerina, be a Ballerina.<eos> If you want to be a Fireman, be a Fireman or an astronaut or a playwright.<eos> Technology.<eos> I mean, he can talk directly...<eos> But then I realized that's ridiculous.<eos> When are we gonna talk about ethics reform - and campaign finance?<eos> I can't be a Ballerina, an astronaut, or a playwright.<eos> I'm just not built that way.<eos> Because really, you can only be you.
Justin, what have you done?<eos> Done?<eos> Tell the truth, Justin.<eos> Don't you dare lie.<eos> Ma'am, if I may...<eos> Now, I was just having a few off-duty beers... with my buddy Tyler here when...<eos> Wham!<eos> My dog didn't know what hit him. Got me pretty good too.<eos> Now, that's assault.<eos> I mean, I'm willing to drop all charges... if you go ahead and put him down yourselves.
I think I'm gonna go to sleep now.<eos> Ray?<eos> Now, you said this was a safe place for us to store the merch.<eos> It was, okay, but Wincott started getting nosy.<eos> Look, the ridge is an isolated enough spot... to keep us under the radar till the pickup tomorrow night.<eos> Tyler, I wanna talk to you.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> We're just moving my friend's stuff out, like you said.<eos> Deputy.<eos> You two seem to be spending a lot of time together lately.
Oh, my God.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> - Ms. Wincott?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Your dog escaped from the pound.<eos> Any chance he came back here?<eos> My dog?<eos> I reported my husband missing... and I was told he's not officially missing for 48 hours.<eos> We are aware of that call.<eos> But my dog's gone and you're gonna tear up the town trying to find him?
Vodka and beer.<eos> - Fuck yeah!<eos> Hey Emma, can you take these, - can you show to the boys where is the guest room. -<eos> I'm going to warm up the sauna. Hop hop.<eos> Try to fit in here.<eos> My uncle hasn't finished this room yet.<eos> This is just fine, thank you.<eos> What about that drink Mr. Black?<eos> - Oh fuck yeah.<eos> Are you coming?
Previously on "Chasing Life... "<eos> - (Reporters clamor) - I'm dying and the only cure is an interview with you.<eos> You reporters are crazy, you know that?
- Yeah!<eos> - Yeah, we are gonna try it.<eos> - I can't stop eating it.<eos> It's good. You should... You guys should probably go to your movie.<eos> The movie doesn't start till 8:10.<eos> Yeah, but the showcase has been so crowded lately.<eos> I want to make sure you guys get to sit together,<eos> - so I will get the dishwasher.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You go. Yeah.
Of course you're not.<eos> Nothing I do ever impresses you, Mom.<eos> You're impossible to please. And you know, it's really hard growing up thinking nothing I do is good enough.<eos> Welcome to the club.<eos> Get your things.<eos> You're coming home.<eos> No.<eos> You can't just leave town and then show up and pretend you know anything about my life.<eos> Like, I went off my meds and you didn't even notice.<eos> You let nannies and psychiatrists raise me because you don't know what to do. You suck as parents.
Like, I went off my meds and you didn't even notice.<eos> You let nannies and psychiatrists raise me because you don't know what to do. You suck as parents.<eos> Oh, and by the way, Mom, there is no way I'm going to boarding school.<eos> What's she talking about?<eos> - We'll talk about it later.<eos> - Go ahead, threaten to withhold money from me.<eos> I'll figure something out.<eos> I'll be staying with Brenna until you learn how to treat me with some respect.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you want to play little orphan Annie, we won't stop you.
It'll just be a little early.<eos> Well, we can't go to Bermuda and back in a day.<eos> You know what? You just let me worry about that, okay?<eos> And you go and get yourself out of work.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Love you.<eos> All right!<eos> All right!<eos> I have given this newspaper the best years of my life with my column "What the Heck,"<eos> and you repay me by laying me off?
- I know.<eos> I guess I'll take it.<eos> Actually, make that two tickets.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> We thought we'd pretty much exhausted the national registry over these last three years searching for a donor to match your type of bone marrow.<eos> - Give it!<eos> Give it! - But I have good news.<eos> - Boys!<eos> - That fart-sucker started it!<eos> And I'm gonna finish it if you two don't knock it off.
Okay.<eos> I think we're good.<eos> Dude, dude!<eos> Take it!<eos> Oh! Oh, my God!<eos> Happy New Year's.<eos> You're a dick.<eos> - It felt good. - Oh, shit!<eos> Hey.<eos> What the hell are you two doing out here?
Thanks, Teddy.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, Jude...<eos> So, how long will you be gone?<eos> I just need to confront Johnny and then I'll decide.<eos> I can't just sit around here anymore.<eos> But you'll come back before?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Whether he wants it or not, I want you, of all people, to be there when it happens.
Stephen's our professor.<eos> We're funded by NOA, the...<eos> Look, research grants are nothing but white people's government cheese.<eos> Yeah, and something tells me that you don't vote... and you sure as hell don't pay taxes.<eos> What?<eos> Okay, okay, knock it off.<eos> These people are here to get some work done.<eos> So are we.<eos> We crab at night.<eos> Can you work during the day?
You know, drinking isn't gonna make the pain go away.<eos> Get out.<eos> I hope you're wrong.<eos> Big G, you might want to slow down.<eos> You know, every time you call him Big G, you point out his size.<eos> Are you aware of that?<eos> This is a sensitive fellow trapped in a giant's body.<eos> Oh, I'm trapped all right.<eos> He's so sensitive.<eos> You're not interested in Piaget at all?
They are Germans.<eos> Very well.<eos> Now I feel much better.<eos> Now we will do a test.<eos> It's not a joke.<eos> It's to see if you are really Germans.<eos> If you pass the test, we'll go and not give you any more trouble.<eos> You simply need to sing the German national anthem.<eos> - I can not hear anything!<eos> Can you?
Everyone in town's nervous... but, like you say, nothing bad ever lasts, right?<eos> Annie's coming to visit.<eos> I was hoping we could take a road trip.<eos> You'd be so proud of her, you know.<eos> So proud.<eos> Headlining news this morning, protests continue around... the nation following approval of the President's draft bill... pledging over 100,000 additional troops to Operation Terminus... the ongoing occupation of Iran.<eos> Russian and Chinese Foreign Ministers have intensified warnings... against the United States as the President maintains resolve.<eos> Last week it was braces. Yesterday, Ritalin.<eos> Trading stocks, man, that's my game.<eos> You assholes gonna do any work today?
- In a moment, you will smile a lot less.<eos> - It was just to warn him.<eos> - Paul, if you do not want to tell us, I think you'll be more talkative with someone else.<eos> You can come now.<eos> - Superbe.<eos> - It is how you pay your rent?<eos> - I found them.<eos> I am a collector.<eos> This bothers you?<eos> You can sleep there, I will put myself in this corner.
Queen, help me!<eos> I never can figure this thing out.<eos> Voil.<eos> My spell-- Come, darling.<eos> Oh, oh. There she is.<eos> It doesn't work here, but it will in auradon.<eos> Remember?<eos> When we were spreading evil and ruining lives.<eos> Like it was yesterday.<eos> And now you will be making your own memories by doing exactly as I tell you.
Uh, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, false alarm.<eos> It was a malfunction in the, uh, lm 714 chip in the breadboard circuit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. Say hi to the missus.<eos> Carlos!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Way to go, Jay.<eos> Now we have to go to school tomorrow.<eos> If someone hands you a crying baby, do you, a, curse it?
You need to sign off on early dismissal for the coronation.<eos> Everyone here remembers my daughter, Jane? Mom, no!<eos> It's okay.<eos> Jane, this is everyone.<eos> Hi.<eos> That's okay, don't mind me.<eos> As you were.<eos> Let's continue.<eos> You find a vial of poison.<eos> Do you, a, put it in the king's wine?
What do you think our parents are gonna do to us if we don't pull this off?<eos> I think they will be quietly disappointed in us, but ultimately...<eos> Proud of us for doing our best.<eos> Really?<eos> No, I think we are definitely goners.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, we all know what this looks like.<eos> So it'll be up on the dais under the beast's spell jar, and we'll be coming in from here.<eos> I will be in the very front.<eos> You all will be up in the balcony.
May I see it?<eos> Why?<eos> You're suppose to produce it upon request.<eos> How am I suppose to know, you're not a villain, kidnapping this woman without a warrant in your possession?<eos> What's your name, Buster?<eos> Well... It certainly isn't Buster. It's oswaldo mobray.<eos> - Oswaldo?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I got my warrant, oswaldo.<eos> - I take it you're Daisy domergue?
Don't talk to my prisoner.<eos> I talk to my prisoner, that's it. You got it? I got I got.<eos> Jolly good.<eos> You got anything in here besides coffee that can help warm us up?<eos> The bar is open, follow moi.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Come on, goddamnit I'm cold!<eos> I'll feed and water the horses.<eos> You go inside and get some hot coffy.
Better call Saul. Do you feel doomed?<eos> Have opponents of freedom wrongly intimidated you?<eos> Maybe they told you you're in serious trouble and there's nothing you can do.<eos> I'm Saul Goodman, and I'm here to tell you that they're wrong.<eos> It's never too late for justice. Better call...<eos> I think your brain is just not all there yet.<eos> If we were all held responsible for what we did when we were 19...<eos> I remember what it was like to be a kid.<eos> Think back.<eos> It's all... Judge, what would you say?
If we were all held responsible for what we did when we were 19...<eos> I remember what it was like to be a kid.<eos> Think back.<eos> It's all... Judge, what would you say?<eos> These boys, 19, I can't...<eos> I don't...<eos> These three young men, just like you.<eos> Just like...<eos> Oh, to be 19 again. You with me, ladies and gentlemen?<eos> Do you remember 19?
It's all... Judge, what would you say?<eos> These boys, 19, I can't...<eos> I don't...<eos> These three young men, just like you.<eos> Just like...<eos> Oh, to be 19 again. You with me, ladies and gentlemen?<eos> Do you remember 19?<eos> Let me tell you, the juices are flowing, the red corpuscles are corpuscling the grass is green and it's soft, and summer's gonna last forever.<eos> Now do you remember? Yeah, you do.<eos> But if you're being honest, I mean, really honest you'll recall that you also had an underdeveloped 19-year-old brain.
You're the hammer.<eos> You get in her face, you scare the bejeezus out of her.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> - It's kind of busy here, don't you think?<eos> - Yeah. Witnesses are good.<eos> Witnesses are pressure, all right?<eos> Now, once you've got her good and rattled then you call for an ambulance, but really you're calling for me.<eos> I'm number one on your speed dial, next to your weed dealer.<eos> You call me, I hotfoot it over here. I just "happened" to be driving by.<eos> I stop to see what the trouble is, and this is the important part you don't know me.
Well, not really.<eos> We've all just been pretending, darling, in order to make my sister think that I'm wealthy.<eos> This is Freddie and Stuart's flat, and we're all their friends.<eos> Oh, my God. That's... amazing.<eos> I think I want to move in HERE!<eos> Welcome to our little family, Jessica. Oh.<eos> It's actually just Jess. No.<eos> It's Jessica.<eos> I was only kidding before. Duhh!<eos> You people are all fucking insane.
Contact lens solution. and a Parker roller-ball.<eos> -I didn't know you were near sighted.<eos> I'm near sighted, too.<eos> -Will you stay a few days?<eos> -I'm afraid not, papa.<eos> We're heading back again today.<eos> Tomorrow I'm going away on a business trip.<eos> You know how demanding my job is.<eos> Don't ask if I can stay a few days every time I come.<eos> -Do you all work for the same company?
-Hello everyone, and good luck.<eos> Your room numbers are as follows:<eos> Room 306: the hotel manager and her partner.<eos> They both...they both have nice voices.<eos> Room 240: couple who both like to ski.<eos> Room 282: couple who both studied social sciences.<eos> Name of the yacht Bliss, couple prone to nosebleeds.<eos> -You and you take 306.<eos> You and you take 240,<eos> You take 282 and you two, take the yacht.

The weight's different for men's and women's games, but that's roughly how much it weighs.<eos> Do you know how much a volleyball weighs?<eos> -No. But I'd like to find out.<eos> -Good evening.<eos> -Good evening.<eos> I have something to tell you.<eos> His nose doesn't really bleed on its own.<eos> He bangs it against the wall, or a piece of hard wood, or something like that.<eos> Or he cuts it with a pen knife when you're not looking.<eos> You two are not suited.
All I get to play with is my dolls.<eos> There's gotta be a kid or two out there somewhere.<eos> - There's gotta be someone somewhere.<eos> - My dad says there's not any.<eos> Are you scared of the monsters?<eos> Of course he's scared of the monsters.<eos> That's why he protects himself.<eos> And we'll be safe as long as we protect ourselves.<eos> Yeah, but he's braver.<eos> Now that you two are friends, you can go hunt animals with my dad, right?
- We just want to see you get better.<eos> - Faye, we will all help you.<eos> I can help Tom take care of your dad's business for a few weeks until you're better.<eos> Yes, you can count on all of us.<eos> Well... if you guys don't want me to treat her...<eos> Here... You're gonna need these sedatives for the long ride to Regional.<eos> Doc, it's not personal.<eos> Good luck, Faye.<eos> You know where to find me.<eos> If you're staying here tonight, then I'll go ahead and leave.
Every day, every man has a choice between right and wrong, between love and hate, sometimes between life and death.<eos> And the sum of those choices becomes your life.<eos> The day I realized that is the day I became a man.<eos> Where's your mind, lad?<eos> Horrocks is waiting.<eos> Give him the gold.<eos> I'll trust his word.<eos> The British army trusted him, too.<eos> Perhaps today's not such a good day for business after all.<eos> Whether you deserted is no concern of ours, Mr. Horrocks.
Horrocks is waiting.<eos> Give him the gold.<eos> I'll trust his word.<eos> The British army trusted him, too.<eos> Perhaps today's not such a good day for business after all.<eos> Whether you deserted is no concern of ours, Mr. Horrocks.<eos> We commend ye for it.<eos> I've come a long way at considerable danger to myself, eluding Redcoat patrols.<eos> The man who shot the sergeant was Captain Jonathan Randall himself.<eos> You expect us to believe that a captain, even one as vile as black Jack, would shoot his own man? You know Randall.
Goddess...<eos> Earth mother.<eos> Open the gates.<eos> I praise thee.<eos> Rise from the fires.<eos> You can come out now, claire.<eos> I thought I heard a rustling in the bushes.<eos> But then again, I always like to imagine someone's watching me.<eos> You could have joined me, you know.<eos> But you english are a prudish people.
And you're pregnant.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's been my own special secret for months now.<eos> Not even arthur knows.<eos> You must be joking, surely.<eos> How's that possible?<eos> I don't recall him ever seeing my unclothed body.<eos> Certainly not in daylight.<eos> I thought you two weren't having intimate relations.
I would expect nothing less of the lad. Make no mistake,<eos> I am very fond of jamie, But I'm afraid I must refuse this outrageous proposal.<eos> Will you go away?<eos> I understand your reluctance.<eos> To turn against one's friend is no easy thing.<eos> Friend?<eos> I hardly know the man.<eos> Even if it were so, what of it?<eos> An english nobleman befriending one of his majesty's Most valued officers, That's scarcely inimical to either of our reputations.<eos> Look, my dear, you're a most alluring woman, And I'm sure you will bear jamie many beautiful children, But my time is not my own these days.
All right, come on.<eos> Let's go, let's go.<eos> On your feet.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Let's get this stuff.<eos> Take them to my factory. Come on.<eos> Hey, chief.<eos> Found this folks in Old Town.<eos> They were in the building.<eos> And you went inside?
Look, the way I see it, you got two choices, okay?<eos> You can run.<eos> I won't stop you.<eos> I know you didn't kill anybody.<eos> Or you can come with me.<eos> Now if you really are more human than a machine, maybe there's a way we can... We can take down vice once and for all.<eos> I need two things...<eos> An upgrade and a reservation to vice.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I take it I'll receive full immunity if you ever come calling again?
The charger?<eos> No, I have the earphones.<eos> We need the charger, my friend.<eos> Salah!<eos> Do we have a charger for this mp3?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Sorry, my friend.<eos> I couldn't find it.<eos> We work.<eos> You work.
"Me, I don't work here..." And how will you eat and sleep?<eos> Anyway, Momo is an asshole.<eos> I'm done working for that guy.<eos> Why?<eos> Hello.<eos> Attention, please. First, we want to thank Mama Africa for allowing us to have this meeting.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm happy to be here with all of you and to hear you call me Mama.<eos> And because you left your mothers at home, I'm happy to welcome you.
- Yeah, it seems that way.<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Oh, my God, you're a vampire! Holy shit!<eos> Max turned the fucking janitor.<eos> That one actually makes sense if you think about it.<eos> - You're creating a lot of dead bodies...<eos> - Yeah, you got blood.<eos> It's smeared all over the walls.<eos> People are struggling, they're breaking things.<eos> You got vans coming in full of weapons.
What do you say?<eos> - thank you. - My pleasure.<eos> Over 2,000 years ago, a great scientist foresaw the coming of the Aberrations.<eos> The perfect equation that held our planet together was unraveling, and he knew Mother Nature would do as she always does... she would evolve, she would change the equation, she would change us.<eos> This scientist wanted to save a select sample of humans from this change to preserve our kind as we once were.<eos> So he created an ark.<eos> He created Wayward Pines.<eos> A scientist?<eos> His name is David Pilcher.<eos> Unfortunately, you will never meet David Pilcher, but you can take comfort in the fact that he is always watching over you.

Or if you prefer, you can discover for yourself what is out here.<eos> It's your choice, Ethan.<eos> What you learn today is for your eyes and ears only.<eos> You do not tell your parents.<eos> You do not tell any adults for one simple reason.<eos> The future of this great town lies not with the adults but with you.<eos> Now, you may think what I'm asking is unfair. You may feel like your parents deserve to know.<eos> So did Chris.<eos> Chris was a student, just like you.<eos> He sat in this very room, and he saw and heard the very same things that you did today, and it scared him.
- Ah, that's alright.<eos> Don't worry, we'll keep an eye on your brother for you. You just... you go ahead.<eos> - Yeah, you go ahead, homer.<eos> - Willie, I'm going over to corbett's for a drink.<eos> I am having dinner tonight with Diana and her parents, and I feel the need for a little... fortification.<eos> - Well, ulysses and me can hold down the fort while you're gone.<eos> Can we? You think?<eos> Yep.<eos> Get the good wine ready for pickup.<eos> - Oh, when homer comes back, you two keep him here until sunripe growers calls for their pickup.
I can't say that word.<eos> What you did fucking sucked.<eos> You really are a piece of shit.<eos> I did what she asked me to do.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> You really need to figure some shit out.<eos> - No, can you just give me one second?<eos> - Honestly. Please let me just gather my thoughts.<eos> I'm like... You know, I'm not that much older than you and all my friends have it together. But every time I meet someone five or more years younger than me, they are a complete asshole.<eos> Is it because you were told you were special one too many times and, what, you believed it?
Well, that wouldn't be funny at all, would it?<eos> Wayward Pines needs a new generation.<eos> And one day, not too long from now, you all will have the honor of parenting the first generation of 100% originals.<eos> Now, take a look around the room.<eos> This is a small town.<eos> Right?<eos> Chances are, your mate...<eos> your co-parent is sitting right here in this room.<eos> And it's part of my job as your teacher and counselor to help you find each other.<eos> You two may sit down.
Does this mean you can't think on your feet?<eos> It's very... very hard to stand up carrying the...<eos> They were both very much aware that TV is the present and the future.<eos> And you have to be on it and you have to use it well.<eos> In a way, I think the brilliant thing about Gore Vidal is he had opinions and he was willing to air them and very, very bravely.<eos> I mean, this was the person that wrote The City and the Pillar, published in 1948.<eos> It was the first novel that dealt very openly... with homosexuality as being a perfectly normal sexual activity.<eos> He was willing to take these risks that almost no one statistically was ever willing to take.<eos> He deserved so much credit for that that he does not get.<eos> You have your own narrow views of what is correct sexual behavior.
The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!<eos> Who is first?<eos> Mr. Vidal first.<eos> Uh, it's like living under a Soviet regime here.<eos> The guards, the soldiers, the agents provocateur, and the parts of the police, you've seen the roughing up.<eos> There's very little that we can say after those pictures... that would be in any way adequate.<eos> Let Mr. Buckley comment now.<eos> The effort here, not only on your program tonight, but during the past two or three days in Chicago has been to institutionalize this complaint.<eos> So as to march forward and say we've got sort of a Fascist situation, but don't infer from individual and despicable acts of violence of Chicago policemen, a case for implicit totalitarianism in the American system.<eos> If we can all work up an equal sweat, and if you all would be obliging enough to have your cameras handy, every time a politician commits demagogy, or every time a labor union beats up people who refuse to join his union,
- Paul.<eos> - Ha! No, he's right. You guys have moved in to one weird fucking town.<eos> I think it was just a little spell.<eos> You know, sometimes things get a little hazy.<eos> Like a migraine?<eos> Yes, but on a spiritual level.<eos> It's hard to describe.<eos> Do you think it could be Bobby?<eos> I won't know until we make contact.<eos> Is that something that you two regularly do?
Jess.<eos> Detective Cornell, can you tell us anything?<eos> Detective, is Mr. Crawford a suspect?<eos> Mr. Crawford? Detective, why are you here?<eos> You have a moment?<eos> I suggest you give me a wide berth.<eos> I just know she likes taking pictures of herself.<eos> It would be great if you could tell me... hello, Abby.<eos> Evening, Mrs. Crawford.<eos> I was wondering if you might have any of these.
You lowlife son of a bitch.<eos> Try.<eos> What happened?<eos> Turns out they weren't willing to help with directions.<eos> Well, rise and shine, Mr. Vega.<eos> Where you taking us?<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> But I can tell you this much...<eos> The view is something special.<eos> I been goin' on and on, tryin' to get you boys not to get involved... but you wouldn't listen.
We'll make it worth your while.<eos> We'd love to, but Bernie's got a doctor's appointment first thing tomorrow morning.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Bring it on in for the sweet thang.<eos> You have no idea how grateful I am to the both of you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - You're gonna be all right.<eos> - Hell, yeah.<eos> Who needs another man when I have you two?<eos> You know, you boys are welcome here anytime.
I mean, not, like, officially.<eos> But I'm... you know, I've been here, like, holding down the fort<eos> - and just waiting for people... - Right.<eos> No, I hear you.<eos> Um, we actually reserved this field a while back for my friend Sailor's birthday.<eos> Yeah, we're playing kick the can, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> We are playing kickball.<eos> So we need, like, the bases and the whole, like, official field that you guys don't need.<eos> So is there some kind of compromise where, like, we could have this bit and you could have that?
Actually, please forgive Daddy Warbucks here.<eos> He's from a far-off land called West Hollywood.<eos> They have a different set of rules.<eos> I'm very sorry about that.<eos> Here's the deal... could we possibly compromise?<eos> Like, you guys use the field for an hour, and then we get a turn.<eos> Doesn't that make everyone happy?<eos> No!<eos> How many times to I have to say no to you people?<eos> Like, it is my friend's birthday and you need to respect that.
Look at these trees!<eos> Dude, I'm kind of feeling the brunch vibe.<eos> We want to play you.<eos> Can you get the fuck off the field?<eos> - Hey! - Whoa.<eos> - All right. - Here we go.<eos> You did not just do that.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> We're not leaving.<eos> So either you let us play you, or we're going to be all up in your shit all day. All day.
- Why?<eos> - Because I love her, sir.<eos> - She's a whore. - She is not.<eos> - They're all whores.<eos> I will give you some food as well.<eos> If she comes tonight, for example, I will be able to give her some rice.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> - You are turning me down?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Promotion, money, food, all for an hour or two with a whore and you are turning it down?

Marston, boss.<eos> On your feet.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He has escaped, boss.<eos> - Have you killed him?<eos> He steals your food.<eos> You take him on and that fails.<eos> You grass on him and that fails, too, so you sneak up on him in the middle of the night like the thief you are and you kill him.<eos> Major Ross takes a shine to your woman and then I see her crying in the waves.<eos> Ooh, you are nothing but a pimp, Corporal.
- How did you do it?<eos> - Do what?<eos> Kill Marston.<eos> You would have needed help.<eos> - Would I?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He was huge.<eos> Am I getting a faint whiff of admiration here, Corporal? - No.<eos> - Ooh, I think I am.<eos> You think I killed a man for taking my food.
If you do not work, you do not eat!<eos> If you do not eat, you die!<eos> Spragg, Freeman, log-roping detail.<eos> - Elizabeth Quinn?<eos> - Yes, boss.<eos> You were found in one of the men's huts this morning.<eos> - Yes, boss.<eos> - What were you doing there?<eos> I was sleeping with the man I love.<eos> You manage that by sleeping all alone.
- Yes, boss.<eos> - What were you doing there?<eos> I was sleeping with the man I love.<eos> You manage that by sleeping all alone.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Can I help you, Mrs Johnson?<eos> I think Mrs Johnson is shocked at a woman brazenly walking into the men's hut to have sex.<eos> I did not do that, boss.<eos> I crept into his bed when they were all asleep. I intended to leave while they were still asleep but I had a nightmare and I screamed and I woke 'em all and brought the soldiers running.<eos> - You heard this scream?
I did not do that, boss.<eos> I crept into his bed when they were all asleep. I intended to leave while they were still asleep but I had a nightmare and I screamed and I woke 'em all and brought the soldiers running.<eos> - You heard this scream?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I entered the dormitory. She ran. I pursued her and caught her.<eos> Had I shagged him, he would have let me go.<eos> - That is not true, sir.<eos> - It is true, boss.<eos> But sorry, Private Buckley, no matter how hard things are here, how hungry I am, how desperate, I will never ever shag a soldier.<eos> Would you, Mrs Johnson?
- Private Buckley.<eos> - Let them in.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Sir.<eos> Private Buckley says he will flog the whore, sir.<eos> I lack the stomach for it, sir.<eos> You are doing it.<eos> I will not be able to lay it on, sir.<eos> Private Buckley will.<eos> You will be able to lay it on?
I am an innocent man and I should...<eos> I should not even be in this godforsaken place so I am damned if I will let you treat me this way!<eos> I will lie with her and you may hang me for it.<eos> - Permission to go after him, boss?<eos> - Granted.<eos> Tommy Barrett!<eos> Tommy!<eos> Please, please.<eos> I do not wish Tommy Barrett to die over a thing like this.<eos> Do you?
Thank you.<eos> Sir.<eos> I cannot marry them.<eos> If their spouses were dead, would you do it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - They are as good as dead.<eos> As good as dead is not dead.<eos> They will never see them again.<eos> How can you know that?<eos> How can you know God's will?
Yes.<eos> And it would not lay heavy on your conscience?<eos> - It would not.<eos> - It would mine.<eos> So you hang him, Reverend.<eos> Hang him at dawn while the camp still sleeps.<eos> I will give you two soldiers to escort him to the scaffold.<eos> There will be no need.<eos> On pain of death, he will keep away from her, surely.<eos> You will be hanging him.
Sir.<eos> Look at me.<eos> The blacksmith did this.<eos> Do you think I would take him on unless I had to, unless my life depended on it?<eos> I am sorry.<eos> You have threatened to hang Tommy Barrett if he sleeps with the woman he loves and yet you let go a man who steals another man's food.<eos> We do not believe he is stealing your food.<eos> I am finished.<eos> Tommy.<eos> You all despise me for grassing on a bully.
I am sorry.<eos> You have threatened to hang Tommy Barrett if he sleeps with the woman he loves and yet you let go a man who steals another man's food.<eos> We do not believe he is stealing your food.<eos> I am finished.<eos> Tommy.<eos> You all despise me for grassing on a bully.<eos> Yet there is not one man here who he has not robbed.<eos> Not one man who does not hate him.<eos> And yet I get this.<eos> You will hang Thomas Barrett?
Have you been robbed or raped by a convict yet, Mrs Johnson?<eos> No.<eos> Have you been robbed or raped by a native yet?<eos> No.<eos> It is not because the convicts have suddenly turned decent.<eos> It's not because the natives like having us here.<eos> It is because armed soldiers constantly watch over us.<eos> In return, we make them as happy as they can be in a place such as this.<eos> One way we can do that is to make sure they have women.<eos> This law that you despise, Mrs Johnson, is a law that keeps us alive.
God will say to those on the left,<eos> "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting life "that was prepared for the Devil and his angels.<eos> "For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat.<eos> "I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink.<eos> "I was a stranger and you did not take me in.
How would I cope with the things that live in the bush?<eos> I will look after you, I promise I will...<eos> - Katherine McVitie, you are to come with me...<eos> - We are talking! - I have orders to escort you to Major Ross immediately...<eos> - We are talking!<eos> - ..so if you do not come with me right now, I will drag you to him...<eos> - We are talking, man!<eos> - ..because my orders include the right to use force, if I have to!<eos> - Private Buckley! He has to share his woman - but at least he has one to share.<eos> You do not.
Why are you angry?<eos> Because I fell over, sir.<eos> You may go.<eos> Sir.<eos> Teach me to box.<eos> Why?<eos> Lots of reasons.<eos> The main reason being to defend myself.<eos> They all saw you humiliate me.<eos> They won't put that down to you being good, but to me being bad.
- No.<eos> I promise I'll never attack you.<eos> What did you expect to find here?<eos> Shall I tell you the truth?<eos> Yes.<eos> Native women.<eos> All naked... ..all carrying armfuls of fruit...<eos> ..all wanting to fuck me.<eos> Teach me to box.<eos> You like yourself.

I mean that in a good way.<eos> You like yourself - you like the kind of man you are.
I have some dried peas.<eos> Would you like some?<eos> He does not love you.<eos> He might lust after you, yes, but that is all - lust.<eos> Sharing you cannot possibly hurt him, for you are a whore - and men always share a whore.<eos> This is rather silly, Katherine, because I know how much you like to get it over with and get back to him and sadly, I will not start until you have spoken.<eos> We could be here till morning.<eos> What would you like me to say?<eos> Something truthful.<eos> You think I hate you... ..and you are right.
I doubt that would be a revelation.<eos> I will swear on the Bible.<eos> I will swear on a stack of bibles.<eos> I am no informer.<eos> If I am an informer - may God strike me dead right now!<eos> The only information I have that could be of any interest to the governor is this...<eos> We three killed the blacksmith.<eos> I did not act alone.<eos> If I am an informer - why have I not told him that?<eos> Why are you two still free?
There are not just the living and the dead, Mrs Johnson.<eos> There is the world of the unborn.<eos> Millions of souls waiting millions of years to pass on to the Kingdom of Heaven.<eos> To them - to the unborn - this life is nothing.<eos> It is a river they must cross to reach the other side, to reach the Kingdom of Heaven.<eos> So, they want this life - this river - to be as short as possible.<eos> To the unborn - a woman like you is heaven-sent.<eos> You give birth to them - they die within minutes.<eos> And before they know it - they are with the angels in Heaven.<eos> For the unborn, you are the ideal mother, Mrs Johnson and your children are eternally grateful.
- No. - So, let us go now<eos> - before you lose something even more precious.<eos> - No.<eos> One night with my wife against all your tobacco and rum.<eos> - Yes. - Corporal?<eos> - You should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> You should be down on your knees thanking God for a woman like that - in a place such as this.<eos> - Do not lecture me on morality, Corporal!<eos> - You're gambling her away like a piece of meat.<eos> - You sold your woman for a corporal's sash.
I am sorry about that, boss.<eos> Dig his grave.<eos> Right, boss.<eos> ~ A young woman named Katherine McVitie found the body in the sea.<eos> ~ She was trying to drown herself.<eos> No, she was swimming, got into difficulties.<eos> That is what she says, the truth is she tried to drown herself.<eos> ~ Do you know why?<eos> ~ No.<eos> Because you have been forcing yourself upon her.
But they could... .. give birth... .. breast-feed, nurse, mother... .. whilst I...<eos> You gave only two of them names?<eos> Yes.<eos> Would you like to name the other two?<eos> The boy would have been Thomas, after my husband's father.<eos> And the girl?<eos> Joan.<eos> After my mother.<eos> I am in touch with two worlds, Mrs Johnson - those who have passed on and those who are unborn.<eos> There is a soul there waiting for you to give birth to it.
And you?<eos> I listened.<eos> You did not speak?<eos> No.<eos> I just listened.<eos> What did he say about when he was at school?<eos> He told me a story.<eos> He tried to help a boy, but it all went wrong.<eos> What?<eos> I would sooner you had...
~ I acted in self-defence.<eos> He was stealing my food, starving me to death.<eos> I tried to reason with him, that failed.<eos> I tried to fight him, that failed.<eos> I even tried grassing on him and that failed because you refused to act!<eos> ~ What else could I do? !<eos> ~ We cannot have convicts<eos> ~ taking the law into their own hands.<eos> ~ There was no law!<eos> You put the blacksmith above it!
~ Yes.<eos> ~ Will you do it?<eos> ~ I couldn't harm a fly.<eos> ~ I know.<eos> Then how would you expect me to hang a man?<eos> And being the hangman, you are maintaining law and order.<eos> There are those who will hate you for it.<eos> Fools, scoundrels, they will wish you harm.<eos> They will not do you harm however.<eos> You will have an armed guard with you wherever you go, whatever you do, sleeping, waking, eating, an armed soldier with you at all times.
~ Why?<eos> Because he won at cards?<eos> ~ He cheated, Sarge.<eos> You told him out of spite?<eos> Yes.<eos> You deserve everything you get, Private Buckley.<eos> Let me have the gun, Sarge, please!<eos> If he hits you once, he hangs.<eos> If he rips you to bits, he hangs.<eos> So which do you think is likely?
How is morale?<eos> Low.<eos> Private Buckley will carry his scars for months.<eos> The convicts will see them.<eos> And they will see the man who inflicted them strutting round like a peacock.<eos> ~ Where will morale be then?<eos> ~ Even lower.<eos> To whom do you owe more allegiance - me or the Governor?<eos> You, sir.<eos> You are my commanding officer.
~ Put him behind bars.<eos> I will assume control.<eos> Is that not mutiny, sir? No.<eos> It is common sense.<eos> You think it another "misjudgment"?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Then you must do it.<eos> They will take me back to England and hang me.<eos> Then we will hang together.<eos> You are a rich Englishman.
You may have to.<eos> Fine, sir.<eos> You'd have the stomach for that?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> ~ Will that be all, sir?<eos> I will entertain Katherine tonight.<eos> Sir.<eos> I will not give her food.<eos> To give her food is to treat her like a whore and I know for certain she is no whore.<eos> And you, Corporal, may have acted like a pimp, but that woman of yours is no whore.
And the soldiers?<eos> Rum.<eos> They were gambling their rum?<eos> Yes.<eos> If a convict attacks a soldier, the convict must hang.<eos> You knew that?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> ~ And yet you still attacked him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sergeant Timmins, you were there and you did not stop this attack.
Did you tell the priest that the statue wobbled?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> If the statue wobbled for everyone, someone else would tell him.<eos> If it wobbled only for me, it was my miracle, my secret.<eos> It could have been an optical illusion?<eos> Yes.<eos> But an optical illusion still needs to be created.<eos> It would still be God's work. Or the Virgin Mary's.<eos> You too have been thinking about a story.
You too have been thinking about a story.<eos> Yes.<eos> And therefore thinking about me?<eos> Yes.<eos> * Ah, that stuff it so pleased me * That quickly I sat down... *<eos> Present arms!<eos> Sergeant.<eos> Sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> You had five soldiers there when the Governor pronounced sentence.
Some, yes.<eos> Your corporal?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure of that?<eos> He has too much feeling, too much compassion, to enjoy the death of any man.<eos> He is a soldier.<eos> Trained to kill.<eos> And to enjoy it.<eos> No.<eos> Otherwise you would be dead.
~ Will I find somebody like you?<eos> ~ Perhaps.<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> Unless...<eos> Yes?<eos> .. you take me with you.<eos> Would that be allowed?<eos> Why not?<eos> You and your husband have done good work here.
I believe in talking... in telling the truth, and doing so in the strictest confidence.<eos> My plan was to confess, to get all those black marks off my soul, then drown myself and go straight to heaven.<eos> The trouble with that is the drowning.<eos> Suicide would leave the blackest mark of all, so I would still be damned.<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> ~ Which means I have to hang Tommy.<eos> Yes.<eos> ~ Unless...<eos> ~ Yes?<eos> you get Tommy off.
I will only know it... when I have done it, sir.<eos> There have been times when you have wanted to shoot me.<eos> No, sir.<eos> This conversation is forgotten as soon as it has finished.<eos> There have been times when you have wanted to shoot me.<eos> ~ Yes, sir.<eos> ~ But you lacked the stomach.<eos> ~ No, sir.<eos> I am a marine.<eos> You are my commanding officer.
~ Yes.<eos> But I did not lie to you.<eos> ~ May I go after your wife?<eos> ~ No.<eos> You pick on vicars and their wives because they turn the other cheek.<eos> Well, not this time, Anne.<eos> You have exploited the woman that I love most in this world and for that I will have you flogged.<eos> I have exploited no-one.<eos> I told your wife what I believed and it brought her comfort.<eos> What you believe brings her nothing but sorrow.
~ No.<eos> You pick on vicars and their wives because they turn the other cheek.<eos> Well, not this time, Anne.<eos> You have exploited the woman that I love most in this world and for that I will have you flogged.<eos> I have exploited no-one.<eos> I told your wife what I believed and it brought her comfort.<eos> What you believe brings her nothing but sorrow.<eos> HOW DARE YOU COMPARE YOUR FAITH WITH MINE!<eos> Why not?<eos> The only difference is you do better out of yours.
I feel...<eos> I feel rather naked right now.<eos> I promise I will not say a word.<eos> Thank you.<eos> 'We all know why you are hanging him.<eos> 'You are doing it to maintain law and order.<eos> 'If convicts can strike soldiers, where does that leave law and order?<eos> 'But what good is law and order without justice? '<eos> If you hang Tommy Barrett... you shit on justice.<eos> And if you shit on justice, can we not shit on your law and order?
~ Shame on you.<eos> Traitor.<eos> Come up onto the scaffold.<eos> Will you tell them why, Governor?<eos> Bind his ankles.<eos> I am doing this upon pain of death!<eos> I had the hood over my head, the noose around my neck, and in the last second he offered me life!<eos> He offered me life!<eos> If I agreed to be the hangman... and I agreed.<eos> As you all would have done.
I love you with all my heart, Tommy Barrett. I love you.<eos> ~ I love you. I love you... ~ Pull!<eos> I love you. I love you.<eos> I love you!<eos> Let this dispel the myth that I do not have it in me to hang a man.<eos> If I can hang a man like Thomas Barrett... then I can hang anyone.<eos> Private Buckley.<eos> Sir!<eos> You will guard our hangman, Private Buckley.<eos> ~ If he dies, you die.
Because when you're born into a certain class, there's only one kind of person you're supposed to marry... someone exactly the same as you.<eos> But here, with all of you, it's so new, so different, so filled with possibilities<eos> I never could have possibly imagined.<eos> And I suddenly understood that I could have something real with one of you, not just a reflection of my social status, but a deeper, profound connection that would be uniquely ours.<eos> And that frightened me.<eos> I wouldn't blame any of you if you wanted to leave, although I really hope you don't.<eos> Because I'm sorry for acting like a coward.<eos> I do want something real.<eos> I am truly open to the possibility of love.<eos> And I hope you are, too.
I... it's my date.<eos> You know, uh, honey, everybody here might be blind as a bat, but I have eyes.<eos> And I can see you.<eos> Mommy.<eos> The rabbit.<eos> [Chuckles] Of course.<eos> It's yours now.<eos> Go play.<eos> Mary, I wasn't trying to...<eos> This is my date with Adam, and we're getting along great, better than you ever did, so just get lost.
I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> And here we are, where three become two.<eos> Have you made your decision?<eos> Yes, I have. Anna.<eos> Faith.<eos> Grace.<eos> I've really enjoyed getting to know each of you.<eos> You are all remarkable women.
I'm sure that's not the first time you've been accused of that.<eos> That is you, isn't it?<eos> Leaving the crime scene?<eos> - Didn't you date Reese Hennessey?<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> That's what I do.<eos> I dig up the truth.<eos> It's becoming clear to people that the killer is obsessed with you.<eos> I find that fascinating.<eos> As do you.
Maybe he and the Flirtual killer are connected.<eos> Now, that's what I call a party.<eos> (Chuckles) And my money?<eos> Back in your account.<eos> Thanks for the loan.<eos> - Remember, you owe me one.<eos> - Wasn't that the point?<eos> You're not afraid?<eos> You should be.<eos> You all should be.
Previously on "Eye Candy"...<eos> A serial killer party?<eos> It's a celebration for the people of New York.<eos> If you wanted to kill me, I'd be dead already.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> They're hiding something from you, Lindy.<eos> Do you know anything about my sister?<eos> You're not afraid.<eos> You should be.<eos> You all should be.
You're so right.<eos> Where are my manners?<eos> Daphne, on behalf of all of us here at the American Ballet Company...<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Oh, and congratulations.<eos> I suppose you just made soloist.<eos> I would've been promoted next season and you damn well know it. Mm.<eos> You're probably right.<eos> Though I suppose now we'll never really know.<eos> Okay, you know how much I abhor gossip, so I'm only gonna say this once.
Together.<eos> Thank you. One more.<eos> Children. Children.<eos> Come to me.<eos> Come.<eos> Come, come, come.<eos> I am so proud.<eos> So very proud of my babies.<eos> I'm proud of your hard work and dedication, of your unflinching passion for this exalted, exhilarating art form.<eos> You are the gods and goddesses from the heaven of our divination.
An opportunity that may not present itself again.<eos> If we act right now, we can prevent a catastrophic loss to the Empire.<eos> We can make England stronger tomorrow than she is today. We can save Nassau and all it takes is for us to do a very reasonable thing.<eos> Military pardons?<eos> I know how it will be perceived, sir.<eos> I know how it looks for me to even raise the subject with you here.<eos> But this is too important to be deterred by dangers imagined.<eos> And if I have learned anything from you, it is that it is moments like these that are the precise measure of a man's courage.<eos> Good God.<eos> You perceive the danger about this to be imagined.

Lord Hamilton isn't someone we should be wary of, he is exactly the kind of man we should be listening to.<eos> On the day I was made an officer, you pulled me aside.<eos> You told me how proud you were of me.<eos> You told me that a measure of a man is in the moment when he is confronted by himself.<eos> By opposing voices in his head, both arguing that they are right, but one has to be wrong.<eos> To know the difference in that moment, that is what makes an officer.<eos> What makes a man.<eos> Well, I see the difference here, sir.<eos> I know it.<eos> He arrived just before you did. And he told me what you did.
You need to obtain her from Captain Vane.<eos> And when you return her to her father, you're going to explain what it is you're trying to accomplish here... a Nassau that can self-govern.<eos> It's too great of a force to defeat.<eos> We attempt to fight the body of it.<eos> The only way to beat it is to cut off its head.<eos> Had I two rounds left, I would shoot both of you and be done with all of this.<eos> Can't avoid it any longer.<eos> It's time you made a choice.<eos> Enough.<eos> You two will resolve this.
Then, um, a man came in.<eos> The Scarborough's captain.<eos> And he just said one thing. He said,<eos> "Yesterday, you were a free man.<eos> Today you are a thief condemned to die."<eos> I saw a garrison on Harbour Island.<eos> 200 men.<eos> I saw an armory, some barracks.<eos> They weren't passing through.<eos> The navy is, this moment, fully encamped 40 miles away from where you stand.
The magazine didn't...<eos> Send me to the party tonight.<eos> I was afraid it might be our last night on earth, and I knew I didn't wanna spend it alone.<eos> We should go.<eos> I can't believe she's sitting over there all alone.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Mm, not really.<eos> The Russians still haven't backed down.<eos> And I got a splitting' headache. Well, I was thinking of putting together an astronaut wives cookbook.<eos> You two have any recipes you'd like to pitch in?
The only thing worse than Glenn making history today is... not making anything at all.<eos> Well, the weather can't stay like this forever.<eos> Hey, can you still get Gordo, Gus, and Wally on the radio?<eos> - Why?<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> I'm giving your flight to Carpenter.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I'm not gonna take John's place.<eos> Fine.<eos> There's five more where you two came from.
Look, I'm sure that John is fine.<eos> Deke is all bark and no bite.<eos> It's n-n-not Deke.<eos> It's Rene, isn't it?<eos> Rene st-stood by me f-f-for John's o-orbit.<eos> I sh-should be there f-for her.<eos> Maybe we should all go.<eos> Mom, they're here! Who's here?<eos> Everyone!<eos> - What are you all doing here? - Checking in.
Imagine never having to wait for someone at the manned space center to call and tell you how your husband is doing.<eos> Well, couldn't...<eos> couldn't the three of you just go in and ask about these things?<eos> We think it's best to present a united front.<eos> Yeah, well, Frank and Jim are going up soon.<eos> I don't think it's the right time for us to make a fuss.<eos> Roger is not going to get a Gemini flight, and he's fighting to get into the Apollo rotation.<eos> I don't think this would help his cause.<eos> So?<eos> It's a lot easier for you to take a stand.
Among other things.<eos> Call Marge and Jo.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Well, this is a surprise.<eos> We need to talk to you.<eos> Are they trying to make you ladies wear fur hot pants again for the fashion show? I will call Nieman's.<eos> NASA cannot keep treating us like we don't exist.<eos> Like we're gnats that you SWAT away whenever we get too annoying.<eos> Nobody thinks you're gnats.<eos> And we know that you ladies play a vital role in...
We want to follow the progress of our husbands' missions."<eos> That is quite a list.<eos> Oh, we're not done.<eos> "Pregnancy is a state of health which should be celebrated.<eos> There should be no career repercussions for the husbands of pregnant wives."<eos> You're having a baby?<eos> We also need to be informed about the real risks involved with the missions.<eos> Ladies...<eos> I am sorry if we haven't made you feel appreciated enough.<eos> And I know it must have been hard for you to take time out of your busy schedules to come down here.
My mom died when I was 5, so...<eos> I get it, you know?<eos> Wait, so Julie's actually your cousin?<eos> And my name's not even really Alice.<eos> It's Judy.<eos> Louise changed it because it sounded too much like Julie.<eos> You kidding me?<eos> Wait, doesn't Alice sound like Alan?<eos> That's what I always thought.<eos> What are you two doing here?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what a diaphragm looks like.<eos> Now, I'm sure most people don't even know how this actually works, but it catches you-know-what here.<eos> I could demonstrate that with an egg for you like this.<eos> I'm not sure if one has ever been shown on television.<eos> You know, in the moment, I just thought,<eos> "to hell with the pineapple cake.<eos> There are more important things to talk about."<eos> She was great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, you two seem great.
Thank you so much, everyone.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hon, why are we even talking about my flight?<eos> Wally and the guys are up first.<eos> Well, Dunk told us that Apollo 8 will be the most dangerous mission yet.<eos> He said the odds are 50/50.<eos> Look, Frank, what does that even mean?<eos> I think you know what that means.<eos> I guess I was hoping you'd say something else. Could you...<eos> Look, you ladies are the ones who demanded to know the truth about these things.
Good then!<eos> Then I'll be her man.<eos> I'd rather die right here than to let it be so.<eos> Rather die?<eos> I'll teach you manners tonight!<eos> Please stop.<eos> You think I'm your subordinate as you distinguished yourself at war and found favor with his majesty?<eos> Please stop.<eos> I see.<eos> You want to be her man too?
What do you write?<eos> It's just the small stories of our world.<eos> Please take a look sometimes.<eos> Yes, your highness.<eos> His lordship, King's son-in-law is here.<eos> - Guess she is my father's...<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Let me greet you.<eos> My name is Gahee.<eos> What were you two talking?
My lord!<eos> You treat him like this as he is not your real son?<eos> Do you really think that way?<eos> If not, there is no reason for you to get rage like this.<eos> I have never seen Jin that way.<eos> The problem lies in you if you think the matter that way.<eos> I didn't say anything to you as I have conscience at least. But it is quite hilarious to hear it from you who is hendpecked by concubine.<eos> I can take everything but I will not endure if you treat my son bad.<eos> I hope you have not forgotten who made you come this far.<eos> Can I ask... for whom you and your father did it?
Of course, I'll give her the message.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - Yes, sir I will who are all of these people?<eos> Volunteers.<eos> Over 200 of them.<eos> They've devoted their lives to the cause.<eos> Where do they live?<eos> They live, work, eat, sleep here, in the complex.<eos> They left their families and their lives to help me realize all of this, none of it would be possible without them.<eos> You are the beating heart of Wayward Pines.
Harold and I, we've been thinking for a while about getting a new house and...<eos> What do you want, Kate?<eos> It's a small town.<eos> We can't spend the rest of our lives hiding from each other.<eos> I don't intend on spending the rest of my life here.<eos> We don't always get what we want.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> - Hey, girls.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I didn't realize you two were friends.
No, as you can see, he's very much alive.<eos> And we are desperate to close his crazy ass.<eos> This piece of business is not just millions in the bank. No, it's... it's legitimacy.<eos> Street cred, vindication. Hell, it's salvation.<eos> In other words, it's our ticket out of the shit-shed.<eos> And the loogie. Eh, don't worry about that. It's nothing personal.<eos> He'd unload that thing on any member of his board of directors.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because they don't understand his genius. Wah.<eos> Don't you hate that?
- It was just one time, okay?<eos> - I can't even sleep.<eos> - I can hear you through the walls...<eos> - Ladies, ladies, please.<eos> If we can't play nice, we're going home.<eos> No, you're right, Dom.<eos> Let's just relax, breathe.<eos> I genuinely brought us here, 'cause I thought it would be good for the three of us to get away.<eos> This is not an intervention. Mm-hmm.<eos> Honestly, I need this weekend, even if you don't.
♪ ♪ This music is so disorienting.<eos> Is it coming from behind us or in front of us?<eos> I can't tell.<eos> Maybe we need to retrace our steps.<eos> There better be dykes here.<eos> I'm like catnip for dykes.<eos> [Shouts] Beautiful faggots!<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Tell us, tell us, are we heading in the right direction?<eos> Only you can truly answer that question.
Captain Treville will decide what's fit for the King to hear.<eos> Should you be up so soon, my dear?<eos> My place is at Your Majesty's side.<eos> Your devotion does you credit.<eos> Captain?<eos> The Cardinal believed in destiny.<eos> He saw a day when France would be pre-eminent in Europe.<eos> At such a time, I require a man of stature to fill the Cardinal's shoes.<eos> A man that I can trust.<eos> Treville, I believe you are that man.
You will not reject me at my hour of need.<eos> I detest politics and have no talent for diplomacy.<eos> Such things can be learned.<eos> The council will benefit from your wisdom and common sense.<eos> There are men more able than I.<eos> I beg Your Majesty to choose one of them.<eos> I did not expect you to abandon me in my hour of need.<eos> I am not the Cardinal, sire.<eos> I could not serve you as he did.<eos> Well, then, it is a great shame that he is dead and that you are alive.
De Foix?<eos> He was killed, fighting with the Swedes at Nuremberg.<eos> Did they find his body?<eos> I saw him with my own eyes.<eos> He was taken prisoner and handed over to the Spanish.<eos> You all right, Captain?<eos> The General and I were like brothers.<eos> We were at military academy together.<eos> This is all very touching.<eos> You escaped.
If the Cardinal were here, he would advise Your Majesty to take the path of diplomacy and common sense.<eos> How dare you invoke the Cardinal's name when he's scarcely in his grave!<eos> Rochefort is a French citizen and a patriot.<eos> No, he will not be returned.<eos> You would be wise to listen...<eos> Who do you think you are talking to?<eos> Never insult the King again in my presence.<eos> Will you let this outrage pass?<eos> Frankly, I wish I'd done it myself.<eos> You're a dangerous man, Rochefort, but an entertaining one.
Might the King be joining us soon or...<eos> It was I who sent for you.<eos> I am looking for a reputable young woman to act as my personal confidante and messenger.<eos> Madame Bonacieux comes highly recommended.<eos> - By the Musketeer D'Artagnan?<eos> -Indeed.<eos> He said she was a woman of great sense and discretion.<eos> I have done my best to instil in her the virtues of duty...<eos> Her position will mean her living near me, in the palace.<eos> I assume you have no objection.
What?<eos> Athos, sometimes I think I'm doomed always to want the things I cannot have.<eos> The Dauphin is not your son, Aramis.<eos> He can never be your son.<eos> Unless you confess to an act of treason and take the Queen down with you.<eos> You should not have hit me.<eos> I was humiliated in front of the King.<eos> It was better to surprise you. After all, I am supposed to hate your country.<eos> Your release from prison was not my idea.<eos> You were the Cardinal's man. I see no reason to trust a French turncoat.
Governor Alvarez will, of course, have been told to expect us.<eos> The Musketeers die heroically but De Foix and I are allowed to escape.<eos> There can be no mistakes.<eos> I want Athos, Porthos, D'Artagnan and Aramis dead.<eos> Why them?<eos> Their loyalty to the King is legendary.<eos> Killing them will leave him alone and unprotected.<eos> I will do as you ask.<eos> For your sake, I only hope it works.<eos> What are you doing here?
You will all work under my command.<eos> This is a Musketeer mission.<eos> Athos will take charge.<eos> The King gave me his authority.<eos> The day my men take orders from the Cardinal's stooge is the day I resign my commission.<eos> For the sake of France, we must find a way to work together.<eos> I accept your terms.<eos> The last person the Spanish will expect to see is their old prisoner, Rochefort.<eos> Naturally, they'll be grateful to the bandits who bring him in.<eos> You will be the bandits, of course.
Could you not have found some other place for your entertainment? Ent...?<eos> No, he's unconscious.<eos> I'm D'Artagnan, of the King's Musketeers, I've come to rescue General De Foix.<eos> I'm Lucie De Foix, the General's sister.<eos> Sister?<eos> The Comte de Rochefort said nothing about a sister.<eos> - Rochefort?<eos> -Yes. So, he's still alive?<eos> He is, and with us, at least I hope he is.<eos> How many men do you have?
Thank you.<eos> We won't forget... This.<eos> That was wonderful.<eos> The life of a commoner is so exciting, so exhilarating.<eos> Ripped By mstoll<eos> D'Artagnan?<eos> Your Majesty?<eos> D'Artagnan!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm on duty. And you shouldn't be in the Queen's quarters. I know.
Sebastian LeMaitre never made it to the Americas.<eos> No, he bribed his way off the transport ship and disappeared.<eos> Now he's back plying his old trade.<eos> Snatching men off the streets and selling them to the Spanish.<eos> The King of France chained up in the belly of a Spanish ship.<eos> Dear God.<eos> Well, they can't have escaped the country yet.<eos> There hasn't been time.<eos> According to his brother, LeMaitre likes to take his captives to the border on foot.<eos> Do you believe that?
We'll catch them at Rouen.<eos> Gus.<eos> I told you never to come here, ever!<eos> The Musketeers know about Sebastian.<eos> They're searching for him now!<eos> - Was my name mentioned?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> If anything comes back on me, I'll come down there and kill you all!<eos> You ride after your brother.
Who did you get this from?<eos> Him.<eos> Why?<eos> Is it valuable?<eos> More than the rest of that tat put together.<eos> Then we have a problem.<eos> You!<eos> You, on your feet.<eos> Let me see your hands.<eos> I can't let you hurt him.
Those two!<eos> You two, up!<eos> Come on!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Tell me!<eos> Or he dies.<eos> Don't.<eos> I am Louis, son of Henry IV, of the House of Bourbon and Marie de Medici.<eos> I am your King.<eos> You cannot treat me like this.
Stand and fight, you cowards!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> He's mine.<eos> May I?<eos> For Pepin.<eos> My man has done his work well.<eos> France has a new king and a lonely and vulnerable Queen.<eos> MY apologies.<eos> I was detained.<eos> You brought this whole fiasco down on our heads.
Are you taking sides with a traitor against your King?<eos> I am a soldier not an executioner.<eos> Allow me, Your Majesty.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Thank you, Rochefort.<eos> That was well done.<eos> At least I have one loyal soldier.<eos> First, you take me to that tavern, put my life in danger and now this.<eos> Why do you Musketeers insist on disappointing me?
Help!<eos> I never liked you.<eos> Claire?<eos> I'll tell you a story.<eos> I have to go to the train to go to the costume party. It's a company party.<eos> That's not now.<eos> I know that!<eos> You have a problem with germs, don't you?<eos> I don't like you.<eos> You are blind.
Frances Shea, will you marry me?<eos> We'll live free and above-board?<eos> On my honor.<eos> Yes, Reggie Kray, I will marry you.<eos> That one of mine?<eos> Cheeky.<eos> That's it.<eos> Come on, show us your fucking hoochie.<eos> - Give us a fucking look.<eos> - You're not listening. You're not listening.
-Aren't we going back to the base?<eos> -Yeah, but first we're gonna get our friend out of the well.<eos> -You're not allowed.<eos> -Says who?<eos> -The united nations.<eos> They said you can't do it.<eos> -I don't take orders from them.<eos> I'm not wearing a helmet.<eos> -It was just explained to you by an official.<eos> Who do we need to get for you to understand?
-Her panties.<eos> They were black.<eos> -So?<eos> -So nobody wears black panties to a war unless they're expecting something.<eos> -Where did you hear that?<eos> -You gotta bang her.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> She'll soften up a bit, she writes a favorable report and everybody be happy.<eos> Sophie agrees.<eos> -Oh, you two talked about it?
-I talked to you about my boyfriend.<eos> -Non-stop.<eos> -I left him for you.<eos> -Nobody asked you to.<eos> Did I ask you to leave him?<eos> Did I?<eos> -What's wrong with men?<eos> You know, it's normal.<eos> You talk about your girlfriend.<eos> You carry her photo in your wallet.
Well...<eos> - Well...<eos> - I mean, you're much too good looking.<eos> Private investigators are short and dumpy.<eos> Wear sensible shoes.<eos> Whereas, that hat...<eos> Sorry, have we already started?<eos> This is my husband, Thomas Beresford.<eos> Ah, I see.<eos> Well, I just hope you two get further than the police did.
Is it now that you're supposed to ask me when did I last see my niece?<eos> Ye... Yes.<eos> I was about to ask you that.<eos> Two months ago.<eos> She was studying languages at Cambridge.<eos> She received a scholarship to go to Paris.<eos> Her parents are deceased, so I agreed.<eos> I even drove her to the ferry.<eos> If I knew that was going to be the last time I saw her...<eos> You British have a saying.
Where was my report?<eos> Where was my phone call?<eos> Where was telling me what the hell you were doing?<eos> - We're terribly sorry.<eos> Oh, sorry?<eos> As it happens, Tommy, Albert Pemberton still does the odd bit of work for us.<eos> Did you think the British Government would lose an asset like that?<eos> OK, we've, we, we, we've stuck him in a school, and he's got a piece of wood for an arm, but, um...<eos> .. he still has his uses.<eos> You have no training.
Absolutely.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, let's get some cakes.<eos> Albert didn't mention the photographs.<eos> Neither did you.<eos> Yes, but why keep it a secret from Carter?<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> If Albert is working for Carter, why not tell him the whole story?<eos> Because I happen to think YOU have a better chance of finding Jane Finn than Carter and his team, but you need some help.
- That was your idea.<eos> - You brought Albert onto the team, why is this different?<eos> Albert is a nice person.<eos> Albert is modest.<eos> We need someone to be your backup.<eos> I don't see what your problem is.<eos> He's just so damn American.<eos> Full of how rich he is, and what he can spend it on.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> Well, what is it you British say?
- What?<eos> - Tommy!<eos> - Who's Tommy?<eos> My husband.<eos> If Brown knew about Rita, then...<eos> What about Tommy?<eos> He's in the house in Soho.<eos> The one I explicitly told him not to go back to.<eos> Yes, that one.<eos> What kind of "this is too dangerous" do you two not understand?
Oh, don't tell me you've replaced me already?<eos> Mr Denim, you do tease!<eos> I'm old enough to be your big sister.<eos> This is Mr Meadows. You'll get along famously, he's a bachelor too.<eos> Hunter?<eos> Bird-watcher.<eos> I thought I heard an unfamiliar male voice.<eos> Hello.<eos> I do hope we won't be unfamiliar for long.<eos> Oh, Haydock, Major Khan, hope you're feeling flush.
Private detective agency sort of thing.<eos> Nothing dangerous.<eos> Is that something that would interest you?<eos> - Yes, Uncle.<eos> - Yes! - Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, start thinking about a name.<eos> - Operation Beresford!<eos> - The Young Adventurers!<eos> You two work it out.
Hotel security video?<eos> Disabled during the attack.<eos> Our girl knew what she was doing.<eos> She wasn't alone.<eos> Definitely more than one attacker.<eos> Most likely a male based on the strength required to stage this, and they're not done.<eos> How do you know?<eos> They got some kind of an agenda or message, and they know that they haven't given us enough yet to figure it out.<eos> Which means the killing is only beginning.<eos> You two have a room, you know?
By "the other guy," he meant me.<eos> I'm Steve Murphy, Drug Enforcement Agent.<eos> And as you can see, I am deeply embedded in Colombia.<eos> Hello?<eos> Poison will be partying at La Dispensaria.<eos> Got it.<eos> He's meeting Lizard and the rest of them at midnight tonight.<eos> OK.<eos> I would've loved to go after Poison myself, but the DEA is restricted in a foreign country.<eos> So I did just what you would do...
- Hey, brother.<eos> - Let's go inside and have a good time.<eos> Now, Poison, he was one of the best.<eos> Crazy motherfucker who killed dozens of people.<eos> Probably hundreds.<eos> But don't get me wrong. I would've sent Carrillo there even if Poison never killed a fly.<eos> I don't have a lot of love for the narcos either.<eos> It's on, boys!<eos> We're gonna stop on 14th and go around the corner.<eos> Riano, Trujillo, you're in the front with me.

- All right.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> Look, here are the packets.<eos> You take a packet... you dip it in the oil and swallow it. Easy, right?<eos> You swallow 50, and I pay you $10,000.<eos> All right?<eos> But with you two, we have a problem.<eos> You girls are pregnant, right?
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Same old contraband routes.<eos> If we all start buying potatoes at the same time, the Peruvians will raise the price.<eos> They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.<eos> We can reduce the cost of the refining process if we buy together.<eos> Well, guys, the hard part is getting the merchandise to Miami.<eos> You need a lot of creativity for that.<eos> How much would you charge us to be "creative"?<eos> You deliver the product to me, labeled.
Two of the pellets split open.<eos> Twelve grams in her bloodstream.<eos> No one survives that.<eos> Why won't Pablo ever see me?<eos> I spent all this time waiting around for him.<eos> Tell me something, Cockroach.<eos> Did you ever think you were going to have this much money?<eos> Fuck the money.<eos> I'm talking renegotiation.<eos> If it wasn't for me, you two would still be smuggling cigarettes.
You've got some front, love.<eos> You've got some right brass neck.<eos> Don't go downstairs on your own.<eos> Not with those two.<eos> What, Wargrave and Armstrong?<eos> You wait up here for me.<eos> It was locked.<eos> Which means there must be a master key.<eos> Rogers must have had a master key.<eos> You two dealt with the body!
They... they have to. Mm-hm.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Who's going to come for us?<eos> That Narracott never turned up when he was supposed to.<eos> Reckon he was paid off.<eos> We light a fire.<eos> On the cliff.<eos> Someone's bound to see it. OK.<eos> We're going to need supplies.<eos> I don't want to spend another night in this house, do you?
No.<eos> No!<eos> You don't mean any of this.<eos> You are a good man.<eos> Moral.<eos> Moral?<eos> Maybe there's something in that.<eos> There are differences between Seton and myself.<eos> All his victims were innocent.<eos> You are all guilty.
Are you the liaison sent by the Admiralty?
and then there was light.<eos> And He saw that it was good, and He separated the land from the water, and He called the water the Seas.<eos> And He said, "Let the sea bring forth life abundantly."<eos> And He blessed it, and He said that it was good.<eos> And He formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed life into his nostrils and man became a living soul.<eos> And He beheld all He had created, and He said it was very good.<eos> But the Lord beheld the man made in his likeness and He beheld his solitude... and He said,<eos> "It is not good that he is alone."<eos> And the moral of the story... everybody needs a partner.<eos> You are the partner assigned to me in response to my father's request by the Admiralty, but it would appear that even you believe this endeavor is doomed to fail.
No, no.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No problem.<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> Apologies.<eos> Perhaps it's my jealousy showing.<eos> Liaison to the Hamilton family, that's quite an appointment.<eos> Congratulations, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I must say, I thought myself quite qualified, but then I suppose perhaps for this particular assignment, you were the better man.
Please, help me to dissuade him from putting us on that path again.<eos> If you're concerned for your safety, perhaps you should request sanctuary along with your father at the Underhill estate.<eos> I'd be happy to carry the message.<eos> You think this is about me?<eos> You asked me for my help yesterday with Mr. Underhill. I gave it my best efforts. You asked me today again for my help, but I'm sorry, what you ask is simply impossible.<eos> You don't give a shit about the rest of us, fine.<eos> But Flint. Don't you care enough about him to at least try to stop him from doing this?<eos> Don't I care about him?<eos> He's the one in the most immediate danger.<eos> - You who have enabled him, encouraged his violence, you ask if I care about him?
They're easy.<eos> I haven't even opened my mouth to make an argument.<eos> An argument to abet sedition in times of war?<eos> A war, sir, to ensure that a Protestant sits on the throne of Spain.<eos> Thomas, if I were a rival of this family, I would be shouting from the rooftops that any man who proposes to pardon a traitor in times such as these is himself a traitor.<eos> We are fighting a war in the service of the son of God.<eos> And it is treason to offer forgiveness to any man who would seek it?<eos> What in the hell is it you think we're doing here?<eos> This isn't your goddamn salon, Thomas.<eos> And I don't care to be lectured to! If you do not forgive men their sins, your father will not forgive your sins.

Tell them who you are, tell them you have silver!<eos> - You will be quiet now!<eos> - He is sick with the fever!<eos> We will hold him!<eos> I said we will hold him!<eos> Worthless slaves.<eos> Halig.<eos> Halig.<eos> - I can't stay on this ship!<eos> You are a warrior.
Halig.<eos> - Leave me!<eos> - Get him in the boat!<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Pull!<eos> Pull!<eos> Pull!<eos> Pull!<eos> Pull, Lord.<eos> You are alive only because I am curious to know who you are, and if you'll fetch a good price.
Are you his brother?<eos> We are...<eos> We are bound, I would say.<eos> Up.<eos> You've been asleep for a day or more.<eos> I can do it.<eos> Take off your clothes.<eos> You have not looked me in the eye, not once.<eos> I am ashamed of what I became.<eos> You are Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
- She is married.<eos> Uhtred!<eos> - Is she married?<eos> - Yes!<eos> He is a man of God!<eos> Say it one more time, priest, and I swear the devil will take you.<eos> You're nothing but a heathen and the bitch is married!<eos> You!<eos> You will go to my uncle... and when he asks of his wife, you will tell him she's in the bed of Uhtred of Bebbanburg.<eos> I trust you are in health.
No.<eos> You might return to find me claimed by another, like vacant land.<eos> Gisela, no.<eos> What is funny?<eos> It would not be the first time a king has tried.<eos> You're not coming with me.<eos> It would be too dangerous for you.<eos> It is for you, too.<eos> I could not...<eos> I could not bear it to have you taken from me again.
- Our plan doesn't change.<eos> - You belong to Alfred.<eos> Our plan doesn't change.<eos> Alfred sends me to kill Erik and Sigefrid.<eos> If I succeed, then Guthred will be in my debt and I will demand the use of his men.<eos> I have men and we have our own war, we do not need Guthred's.<eos> How many men?<eos> Enough to take Dunholm?<eos> Guthred made you a slave!<eos> And by swearing to Alfred, you remain a slave!
But if it means we have a greater chance of killing Kjartan, if it means we find our sister, then I will do what Alfred asks.<eos> Kjartan falls... by MY sword.<eos> He will, brother.<eos> He will.<eos> Lord?<eos> You asked for me?<eos> I did.<eos> The king... should be at the centre... surrounded by his enemies.<eos> I am sending Uhtred to Eoferwic to aid Guthred against the brothers who would take the city for themselves.<eos> I want you to go with him.
- I need you to marry me to Gisela.<eos> What?<eos> ! I want us to make our pledges before I ride for Eoferwic.<eos> Mildrith has joined the order, I am free to marry.<eos> You have Alfred's blessing?<eos> It's not Alfred I wish to marry!<eos> Beocca, this cannot wait.<eos> - You love her?<eos> - I do.<eos> I feel you are too fond of love.
This is for Alfred, you must save your sword for Kjartan.<eos> If it is for Alfred...<eos> I will go with you.<eos> And me!<eos> It was my bastard plan.<eos> And I shall wish you all the best of luck.<eos> - If you get caught...?<eos> - Do nothing.<eos> Ragnar, think only of our blood feud and of Thyra.<eos> I hope you're light on your feet, big man.
He is wrong.<eos> Uhtred, you say Alfred has never set foot in Northumbria.<eos> He has no need.<eos> We are here, all of us, to do his bidding.<eos> And he knows how each of us will think, what each of us will do.<eos> Eoferwic can never be the seat of power in Northumbria whilst Dunholm remains strong, and so he allows Uhtred to attack.<eos> He allows nothing.<eos> I'm here because it's my business to be here.<eos> Uhtred, you are his man.<eos> You, more than anyone, will bring about his dream of an England.

- I spared your life.<eos> - Uhtred!<eos> No!<eos> You were my friend and I betrayed you.<eos> My sister is well?<eos> She's my wife.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> I shall write to Alfred, I shall inform him that... that your journey to Dunholm is my instruction.<eos> And I do hope that you can one day find a place in your heart to forgive me.
Halt!<eos> This is where we part.<eos> We will show ourselves only when we know the east door has been opened.<eos> We will attack... then it's up to you to save us.<eos> We will be theirs to slaughter.<eos> Lord, may the gods be with you.<eos> God.<eos> May God be with him.<eos> Us.<eos> You just watch over Ragnar, hm?
Bebbanburg?<eos> Wessex.<eos> It must be Wessex, or Steapa will have instruction to kill me, I'm sure.<eos> I need peace for a time.<eos> I need my woman.<eos> And what of Thyra?<eos> Whatever else, she's safe.<eos> I will not hurt you.<eos> I promise.<eos> You do not know me... but I have known your brother Uhtred since he was a small boy.

Your wife threw up.<eos> - A lot.<eos> - Your wife threw up.<eos> - A lot.<eos> - Okay, we're not doing this.<eos> [mutters] Hold on.<eos> Gonna call your doctor and make you some soup. You lost a lot of fluids.<eos> I'm okay with you smoking pot.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I know I complain about it so you try to hide it, but I just want you to be the Joel you want to be. - That's...
- Crunchy. - Okay.<eos> [car engine revving]<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Hey, Dan.<eos> How was work? - Lisa home?<eos> - [Joel] No, no.<eos> Should be soon, though, I'm guessing.<eos> - Yeah, I don't know her schedule.<eos> - What are you all doing here?<eos> What are you all doing here?
Eric doesn't own a football or anything else that would make him come outside.<eos> That's exactly what he said, only with less implied criticism, so... mystery not solved.<eos> Then, uh, where's the football?<eos> - Run. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Don't shoot!<eos> Don't shoot! - Shoot her!<eos> Shoot her!<eos> [both laughing]<eos> We threw it back over the fence.<eos> So, as you would say, "case closed."
Please slow down. - Oh!<eos> - Whoo-hoo!<eos> Faster, faster, faster!<eos> [salesman] Oh, ohh-ohh!<eos> I got organic, I don't know if that's still important.<eos> What happened to your hair?<eos> Where's your mom?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - [all cheering]<eos> I'm glad you finally decided to join us.
[salesman] Oh, ohh-ohh!<eos> I got organic, I don't know if that's still important.<eos> What happened to your hair?<eos> Where's your mom?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - [all cheering]<eos> I'm glad you finally decided to join us.<eos> This is fantastic.<eos> From now on, always include me in everything.<eos> I can't believe you just went out and bought yourself a Range Rover.
His name is Gary.<eos> He just moved here.<eos> You like him.<eos> Are you two gonna bone?<eos> - Lisa. - What? We decided we shouldn't deny ourselves things, and boning is a thing.<eos> Sheila, let's go home.<eos> - No, honey, I don't want to.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come on, let's dance.<eos> Sweetheart, you bought a car, and now you're grinding on the neighbors, and this is not who you are.

- Life should be fun, honey.<eos> And I don't care what Consumer Reports says, that car is hot.<eos> She wants to have fun, Joel.<eos> And doesn't care what Consumer Reports says.<eos> I heard her, Gary.<eos> - Sheila?<eos> - Then maybe you should go.<eos> You know, 15 years ago, I would have punched you, once.<eos> I might have dropped you.<eos> If not, you would have beaten the hell out of me, 'cause I just had the one move, and you're a substantial man.
Hello, Kimmy.<eos> [in Mandarin] Careful!<eos> My name is library!<eos> [in English] I'm taking Mandarin this semester.<eos> Was that anything?<eos> I'm glad you brought up your classwork.
Do you really think people would go to a restaurant that's just called Dave?<eos> [scoffs] All right.<eos> He gets half.<eos> But I get final wardrobe approval.<eos> -No.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Okay, this kind of stuff happens to Beaker all the time, and he's a professional scientist.<eos> Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God...<eos> Zach, are you okay?<eos> You're Kimmy.
Husky children.<eos> I just dropped out of school. What?<eos> You failed out?<eos> Wow, I thought you were smart.<eos> 'Cause you're not athletic.<eos> I've seen you try to put your backpack on.<eos> No, not failed.<eos> I've only ever failed three tests:<eos> scoliosis, Turing, and lice.<eos> Wait. You chose to drop out?
Yes, it might be a huge mistake.<eos> Well, at least it was your decision.<eos> I think they're gonna make me leave.<eos> And I hate not being in control of my life.<eos> My bedtime's when I say so.<eos> I don't let some pyramid tell me what food to eat.<eos> And I don't care what Titus says, I put my mittens on before my jacket.<eos> Then how do you zip or button it?<eos> That's the price of freedom, Zach!<eos> I'm just saying, you're in charge of your life.
I'm gonna touch a gnome.<eos> I know you are... [mockingly] "'Cause I live in the future."<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> I'd like to open a bank account because of money.<eos> I'll need to see a valid ID.<eos> You take birth control pills?<eos> Just the sugar weeks.<eos> Look at me!<eos> -I said look at me! -Fine.<eos> But only if you look at me.
But as Gordy is my witness, you will be mine.<eos> [man] I used up all my minutes for this!<eos> When's Keith Hernandez gonna do stand-up?<eos> [all] Yeah!<eos> He doesn't even care about boobs!<eos> -Get him!<eos> -[all] Yeah!<eos> It's time to go, girl!<eos> [crowd shouting] Rubbing alcohol?<eos> You don't tell me how to use you either!
We didn't even wait to get home.<eos> We sat in the parking lot, and, on three, we each took a huge bite.<eos> And you know what they tasted like?<eos> Fudging onions.<eos> The world is a Vidalia onion.<eos> It's a lie, it stinks, and it makes you cry.<eos> Sooner or later, you got to just stop biting onions.<eos> What?<eos> Hey. Hey, come on, Red.<eos> You never give up.

I need someone with your emotional intelligence.<eos> That's a real thing?<eos> I thought the dean was making it up so I'd feel better, like when your mom says everything must have fallen out of Santa's sleigh.<eos> Oh, boy. Even I know that's this.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> Zach, I'm... in!<eos> -Get it?<eos> -It was gotten.<eos> Hello, coworker.<eos> I'm Kimmy. What do you do here?
He did spend a month in a rehab facility?<eos> God, that was...<eos> No, his-his teacher caught him and some friends with alcohol after a football game.<eos> I just wanted to stop it before it got out of hand.<eos> By rehab over just one incident?<eos> I'm a recovering alcoholic.<eos> Been sober for six months now.<eos> In Alicia's typical fashion, she overreacted.<eos> You don't get to say that.<eos> You weren't there.
You don't get to say that.<eos> You weren't there.<eos> Not for 15 years.<eos> You shouldn't be here now.<eos> He called me.<eos> - What?<eos> - Six weeks ago.<eos> He said he was having problems adjusting to college life.<eos> He wanted advice.<eos> So what did you say?
It's a war.<eos> I ain't no Boy Scout, but I'm on the right side of it.<eos> So if you hear of any other witnesses, or any info at all, I want to be your first call.<eos> How long before you're initiated?<eos> Couple weeks.<eos> Hang in there, it's worth it.<eos> You're frat?<eos> Yeah, those letters just don't disappear when you graduate.<eos> I'm Sigma.<eos> You're about to be Sigma.
Why don't we just get it out of the way? - What?<eos> - The "I told you so."<eos> I told you he wouldn't open an investigation based on a kid's word against an entire department.<eos> We should have built a stronger case before going to the boss.<eos> - I led with my heart, my bad.<eos> - You led with your ego. You finished?<eos> If you can't listen to the one person who has your back in all this...<eos> - I got it.<eos> - Do you?<eos> Because I need you to have my back, too.
You need to request the department's arrest records for the last three months.<eos> - What exactly are we looking for? - I don't know.<eos> But we'll know when we see it.<eos> This isn't about Jesse and Joey anymore.<eos> This is about the entire sheriff's department.<eos> That was smooth.<eos> You must be Brady.<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> Get up.<eos> Word is if you want weed on campus, you're the man to see.
His uncle's restless.<eos> Cory's still scared.<eos> I sent in another request for protective custody. I'll let you know.<eos> How'd it go with the college kingpin?<eos> He swears Jesse's weed wasn't from him.<eos> I put his stash in the lab to get checked out.<eos> So what are we doing here?<eos> I want to break down what happened the day Jesse was killed.<eos> Get inside their heads.<eos> You're Jesse.
Why not?<eos> Why wouldn't you comply?<eos> Because I'm too drunk.<eos> No, if you were that drunk I would have known it.<eos> - It would have been on my report.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, because I know it's a bogus stop. Racial profiling.<eos> So I call you out on it, refuse to give you my license.<eos> I tell you to get out of the car.<eos> Then something happens and you shoot me.
You're not hearing me, Mom:<eos> I don't want to go to that school!<eos> It ain't open for discussion.<eos> How's it not open for discussion?<eos> You want me to speak my truth, right?<eos> Well, I'm speaking it.<eos> I'm not going to that white school.<eos> Even if you put me on that bus, I'm not going to that school where everybody hates us.<eos> You ain't got to worry about them people.<eos> Maybe you don't, but I do!
- Come on, beautiful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm sure you ain't been worn out in a real long time.<eos> I said thank you.<eos> Hey, the lady said, "No thank you."<eos> The lady? Or your lady?<eos> All you need to know is that she ain't your lady, so step.<eos> Step?<eos> See, that's how little boys get in trouble, sticking their nose in grown man business, boy.<eos> You about to find out how much of a man he is and how much of a bitch you are.

Come on, bro.<eos> You're crazy.
And-and yours as well, Pastor Janae.<eos> You have a surprising collaboration with Governor Eamons.<eos> She credits you with inspiring her educational initiative.<eos> Her initiative is being funded by the Cox Group, Financial, the same company that's building a private prison in our community.<eos> I had nothing to do with inspiring that.<eos> Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> How was your run?<eos> Beck seemed genuinely surprised about the matching strains of weed.<eos> You buying it?

I was going through some of Breeland's reports and I found a pattern.
You reached out to me.<eos> Sorry, I... we're getting it from all ends.<eos> Our donors are freaking out from the town hall backlash, and having Pastor Janae criticize our prison jobs agenda on national TV isn't helping.<eos> And then there's you.<eos> You're working two cases now.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> But...<eos> No "but"...<eos> I just want to make sure that the case that brought you here remains a priority.<eos> "You" want to make sure?
I mean, it was dark, but it ain't this dude.<eos> Dude who shot Joey looked different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Does this man look familiar?<eos> Yeah, I've seen him around.<eos> He used to work the neighborhood.<eos> Was he there when Joey was killed?<eos> Told you, I didn't see the cops' faces.<eos> People are saying you're the wrong kind of witness.
Have you ever considered that maybe I do want another Ferguson?<eos> Well, I guess that's the difference between you and me.<eos> Good luck to you.<eos> What do you got?<eos> I dug through the reports and found another I.D.<eos> Turns out this guy Christopher McFarland is not only an auxiliary deputy for the Sheriff's Department, he's also one of Governor Eamons' top donors.<eos> 60 years old, fits Cory's description of the shooter, and he owns this whole damn building.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I need to head back to D.C. Personal matter.<eos> Carroll said he'd give me the time off, if you're down.
"A few days later, "two white men dragged me out of my uncle's house "and threw me in the back of their truck,<eos> "At first I was relieved. Then I saw him laughing, and I knew it wasn't good."<eos> "The black man held me down while the white men tortured me, "and after my soul left my body, I watched them shoot me, "tie me to a cotton-gin fan, and throw me in the Tallahatchie River."<eos> "Over the years there were times when I thought the sadness "would never leave, but it did... eventually."<eos> "And here I am now," "hoping I can help the sadness leave you."<eos> "Trayvon wasn't sure the sadness would ever leave," "and he asked me about justice."<eos> "So I told him what God told me:."<eos> "Those who have harmed you will answer for their sins in the afterlife." "Suddenly, there's a knock"<eos> "on the door of the Heavenly home I share" "with Trayvon Martin and a new face enters," "one unfamiliar to the both of us."<eos> "'Who are you? ' Trayvon asks."
I just wanted to look into your eyes.<eos> I needed to come here and face you.<eos> Now, I'm not going to ask you why you killed my son because I know you'll lie.<eos> I'd be able to tell, and neither one of us would survive that.<eos> But... I want to know...<eos> Did he suffer?<eos> What were his last words?<eos> Did you tell him that you were sorry?<eos> He didn't suffer.<eos> I hope you do.

Joshua, as long as you're in uniform, unwanted attention will be directed at all officers.<eos> For the integrity of the department and for yourself, I'm placing you on administrative leave with pay until this is resolved.<eos> I guess due process is for everyone but the ones upholding the law?<eos> If anybody else had said what you said on that video, I would have fired their ass.<eos> Would you like me to finish out the day, sir?<eos> I need you to turn over your badge and your firearm.<eos> It never crossed your mind to give me a heads up?<eos> Is that what you're expecting from this?<eos> I expect not to be blindsided.<eos> I don't know what you know.
You're leaving?<eos> Yeah, thanks to you.<eos> I had nothing to do with it.<eos> Yeah, keep telling yourself that.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Off the record.<eos> Not here.<eos> Glad you could make it. I think you'll find this interesting.<eos> So you're saying no jail time?<eos> You help us and we'll help you.
You really want me to go there?<eos> I didn't betray you, Javi.<eos> You screwed somebody else!<eos> I was scared about us and I did something really stupid.<eos> Come on!<eos> I know you, and scared is one thing that you never were.<eos> I wouldn't be alive if that was true.<eos> I was too afraid to believe I deserved that kind of happiness.<eos> Don't do this to me, Ashe.<eos> I'm messed up, I know that, but so are you.
No, you've caused enough problems.<eos> Where's Kai?<eos> Out with her father.<eos> I'll call back.<eos> Javi told me everything.<eos> I'm sure not everything.<eos> We're gonna go to counseling.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> But he's not dropping the custody case.<eos> I think you're a crazy bitch.

I've been caught up in my own stuff... sorry.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Judge is going to make a decision at the end of the month.<eos> When you met with Carroll and Ruiz, did they tell you we were being replaced?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you didn't think to call me?<eos> I planned on telling you in person.<eos> They want us to walk away.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm not built like that.<eos> I don't think you are, either.
Hey, Doreen.<eos> - Hey, Daniel... you wanted to talk?<eos> - Here.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> Robbie left me a message.<eos> Evidently he doesn't want me to go to his academy graduation.<eos> What?<eos> Wait, he said that?<eos> He blames me for you and I splitting up.<eos> No, you're the reason he wanted to be a cop in the first place.

This interview is over.<eos> You know, when I first talked to Sheriff Platt, I told him that I would be happy to assist you in your investigation.<eos> However, I think I misjudged you.<eos> What I took as an intensity for the truth turns out to be the desperation of a man who is in over his head.<eos> And after the recent events here, my town, and especially the families of those two poor deceased boys, we deserve better.<eos> We have an eyewitness that says they saw you murder Joey Campbell.<eos> Is it safe to assume that if you had full confidence in this witness, that I wouldn't be walking out of this room like I am right now?<eos> Hold up.<eos> Hold up!<eos> We got a week left, and you're being soft?
Mom, did you really send in a tank?<eos> A tactical vehicle.<eos> And yes, we've dispatched other departments to help maintain order as well.<eos> Hopefully, your friends won't have too much of a party.<eos> They're not my friends.<eos> I'm one of the few kids that thinks this is insane.<eos> Mom, you're literally occupying a section of Gate Station that's populated with poor people.<eos> Some of the people who are rioting are not even from Gate Station.<eos> I'm trying to protect those poor people from a handful of troublemakers who'd like to destroy all that community has.<eos> Well, it looks like you're being a bully.

And you're a great mom.
What the hell is your damn problem?<eos> What's wrong with you, boy?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - It is not okay.<eos> - These boys are going to listen to me.<eos> - Not like that! You have a problem with the way that I discipline my kids?<eos> Yeah, I do, when you're drinking in the middle of the day and snatching them up.<eos> We are not that kind of family.<eos> My sons are not going to disrespect me, and you are not going to undermine my authority in my house.

As soon as you tell me what the hell happened to my partner.<eos> You want to see me, boss?<eos> Sit down.<eos> How was your car ride with Eamons yesterday?<eos> Awkward.<eos> Not someplace I ever expected to be.<eos> Well, I'm sure it was intoxicating.<eos> Not for me, sir.<eos> She asked about The Tours.<eos> What'd you say?
Joey was the last one.<eos> It ain't going down like that no more!<eos> For your own safety, disperse and return to your homes immediately.<eos> We ain't going nowhere!<eos> We ain't going nowhere!<eos> Disperse and return to your homes immediately!<eos> I ain't going nowhere!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - I live here!<eos> You go home, crooked-ass cop!
It could be in the calendar app or calculator.<eos> Great, po-po.<eos> My God.<eos> This is it.<eos> Check this out.<eos> - You lost, boy?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> What are you doing in this neighborhood?<eos> Why did you pull me over?<eos> Because you don't look right.
Witnesses heard you threaten Joey Campbell.<eos> His mama didn't have no problem with me getting in his face when he was messing up.<eos> Did she know you and The Hands got physical with him?<eos> Do not answer that, Pastor.<eos> I'm having a hard time reconciling the woman we met is capable of murder.<eos> Yeah. People rarely show you who they really are.<eos> But I'm not gonna rush to judgment.<eos> Let's hold a beat before putting out a statement.<eos> - The press will ask you about it today.<eos> - I want you to keep them at bay.
Don't speak the King's English.<eos> Justice is supposed to be blind, but she can be a racist bitch.<eos> We needed that gun.<eos> Shirlane's out of recovery.<eos> We should find out what she knows.<eos> So where did that ten G's you gave her come from?<eos> I know first-year attorneys ain't rolling like that.<eos> Borrowed it from my brother.<eos> You sure ain't the same cat I met six weeks ago.<eos> For a minute, I didn't think you were the same person, either.
You ever feel down, you hear my voice telling you that.<eos> I know this is hard, but just remember, this is part of your journey, and one day, you'll be proud you made it through.<eos> You'll be like a superhero.<eos> You are the very best part of me.<eos> Embrace your fearlessness, okay?<eos> And your curls and your pretty brown skin and your butt.<eos> You got that from me, too.<eos> You are loved, Kai.<eos> Don't ever let anyone take that truth away from you.<eos> If anything ever happens to me, I need you to know this.
Never been more focused in my life.<eos> The new team's arriving in two days.<eos> I don't want them messing up what we started.<eos> Then let's finish it.<eos> You and me.<eos> Breaking news report regarding Jesse Carr's murder.<eos> The footage you're about to see was uncovered on social media.<eos> What are you doing in this neighborhood?<eos> Why did you pull me over?<eos> Because you don't look right.
Quite possibly, we are both, in our own ways, incarcerated.<eos> Got it.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> We did everything we could to protect him.<eos> And to protect our department.<eos> And there is... some honor in that, but...<eos> There's only one course of action, Calvert.<eos> Just keep your mouth shut.<eos> If you talk, you'll go to jail for the rest of your life.<eos> I kept quiet because you taught me to protect our own.
There's only one course of action, Calvert.<eos> Just keep your mouth shut.<eos> If you talk, you'll go to jail for the rest of your life.<eos> I kept quiet because you taught me to protect our own.<eos> But Arlen Cox is not family.<eos> I was protecting him for you.<eos> - For me?<eos> - This should never have happened.<eos> But it did.<eos> And you were the superior officer in charge.
Thank you.<eos> Made me proud to see you graduate.<eos> Thanks for inviting me.<eos> You're a man now.<eos> I respect that.<eos> And whatever problems that your mom and I have won't change that.<eos> You used to be my hero.<eos> Strongest guy in the world, I used to think. But the, the minute you became Sheriff...<eos> I was what, nine years old?<eos> See, when you were home, if I played too loud, I was in trouble.
Disciplinary action within the department is something we'd consider.<eos> - But no jail time.<eos> - Two boys were killed. You got a hand in it and you expect to walk?<eos> No jail time or there's no deal.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> How can I get in touch?<eos> It's protocol.<eos> I have to let the bosses know. Protocol?<eos> Or are you fine letting him get away with murder?
Yeah, well, I'm done protecting them.<eos> I'm coming forward now.<eos> With the backlash from the department?<eos> Even more press outside your door?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I got Kerry, my boys.<eos> And a bachelor party I gotta plan.<eos> Ain't all bad.<eos> Anna's dad is putting his foot down.<eos> He's threatening to cancel the whole deal if you're at the wedding.
He's threatening to cancel the whole deal if you're at the wedding.<eos> I'm working on Anna.<eos> But... well, the video.<eos> "When Caleb and I became deputies, "we took an oath to serve and protect, "but Caleb's been doing that since the first day we met.<eos> "Today, he took a vow for better or for worse.<eos> "Five words used to describe one... loyalty.<eos> "Anna, today you are marrying my best friend,<eos> "one of the most loyal people I know, who will serve and protect you for better or for worse."<eos> Maybe the new guy can use it.<eos> I know how hard it is to come clean when you know that a wrong has been committed... especially when that wrong has been committed by you.
I reached out for my departmentissue Taser and accidentally pulled my gun.<eos> I'm ashamed.<eos> I have to live with the fact that... a simple mistake took the life of a promising young man.<eos> Had Lieutenant Breeland not intimidated me, I believe that I would have come forward sooner.<eos> But as an officer sworn to uphold the law, he did in fact intimidate me and he should have reported the accident to his superiors.<eos> He allowed for Pastor Janae Jones, an innocent woman, to be wrongfully detained.<eos> I can only assume that he had something to do with finding my gun in her church.<eos> I'm going to turn myself in to Sheriff Platt.<eos> Immediately.<eos> You knew this was happening!
Preston Terry.<eos> Grab Ashe and put me on speaker.<eos> Um, she just stepped out, sir.<eos> How can I help?<eos> She approached Arlen Cox. Even though there was a deal on the table with Breeland.<eos> I, I don't think it was that deliberate, sir.<eos> Like hell it wasn't.<eos> She's one of my top investigators.<eos> It was a brilliant move.<eos> Pierce and Davies will stand by to assist. But I want you and Akino to take the lead.
First time I met you, you pulled up your shirt and said, "Do these things look right?"<eos> Look, I haven't had time to tell you because my whole life has been working with you and sleeping with Jacob.<eos> This is why we need more coffee breaks.<eos> I have been there for every "should I" and "shouldn't I" with you two.<eos> How could you leave me hanging now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You've made such a big deal out of sex in the vagina.<eos> And you were right, it is a big deal.<eos> Right?<eos> Turns out sex is pretty good with a man who's not closing his eyes and pretending you're a man.
Is this funny to you?<eos> No, it's not funny to me.<eos> I honestly, I don't understand how we got here.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> You don't.<eos> I like you, you like my dog, we both hate Sharon.<eos> Why isn't that enough?<eos> It isn't.<eos> Not for me.<eos> I don't like how this interview is going, so I'm canceling it and you can't exit.
- Oh, God.<eos> - What now?<eos> - Nothing, I...<eos> Frankie has a really good idea.<eos> Well, you know, it's funny.<eos> Jacob and I were talking last night about the business... Oh.<eos> So, you two were talking about our business?<eos> Well, you know me, Grace.<eos> I take my work home at night.<eos> I don't just shut it down at 3:00 like you do.
We were thinking, condoms might go over well at an incubator where a lot of young men work.<eos> Well, based on what I know about tech guys,<eos> I don't think they're having a lot of sex.<eos> - Hear us out.<eos> We did our homework.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We even mocked up a package.<eos> Show her.<eos> Well...<eos> You poke... and it pops right out.
I'm watching a family of hummingbirds.<eos> - That's an omen.<eos> - Of what?<eos> That we'll need to get a hummingbird feeder.<eos> I could watch them all day.<eos> Then it's settled. We're staying home.<eos> What?<eos> You can watch them all day, but not at the office.<eos> So, like you said, we're staying home.<eos> - You said we're staying home.
Oh, no. These are for laser tag, which we encourage you to enjoy while you're waiting.<eos> I'll tell Highsmith you're here.<eos> In the meantime, have a seat, help yourself to room-temperature liquids.<eos> Oh, well, maybe later.<eos> We drank in the car.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Let's get on our phones so we fit in.<eos> I pride myself on not fitting in, but okay.<eos> So here's the plan.<eos> I'll talk first, and I'll keep talking, and you don't talk.
We'll always have this, though.<eos> Grace, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Didn't I tell you not to bring up those freaking condoms?<eos> What does it matter?<eos> They don't make anything here.<eos> Why are you so mad at me?<eos> We had a vision and a plan for a vibrator!<eos> And now it's all "Poke 'n' Pull" and "Let 'Em Rip"<eos> and our vibrator has been kicked to the curb!<eos> Well, you may not need a vibrator anymore, but I still do.
Previously on Underground...<eos> This rescue gonna be the toughest thing you ever done.
I'll send Elizabeth a wire.<eos> I'll let her know that you got off safely.<eos> Can you tell her I'm sorry?<eos> The plan has changed.<eos> You didn't get your man.<eos> And it got you doubting' everything.<eos> He was supposed to be here.<eos> John was supposed to be here.<eos> But ain't nothin' the way it's supposed to be.<eos> And now you is leavin' me, too.
And now you is leavin' me, too.<eos> You got time to figure things out.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Christmas comin' soon.<eos> It's my only shot of stealin' my mother and brother.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I ain't ready.<eos> You will be.<eos> Everything you learn moving this cargo gonna help you rescue your kin.<eos> And ain't nothing more for you to do about Noah.
We-we here!<eos> We's here.<eos> We here.<eos> We-we rest the night, travel by day.<eos> A friend of a friend sent me.<eos> Reverend Josiah Henson,<eos> Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Arthur Tappan.<eos> Moses usually the one that comes.<eos> Plan done changed, but the cargo still the same.<eos> They need to drink, and you need to eat.
Plan done changed, but the cargo still the same.<eos> They need to drink, and you need to eat.<eos> Well's around back.<eos> I'll bring the cargo through.<eos> Listen to your instincts.<eos> Easy, now.<eos> We gonna want her to bring that cargo back to us.<eos> Something's off.<eos> You should keep that.<eos> John... would want you to have it.
They gonna shame meself.<eos> Shame me father.<eos> Some of 'em good people, but some of 'em... they just, they wait for something to bring the table-tapper low with.<eos> Everybody gonna help raise him.<eos> That's how they be.<eos> Talk bad about you, then help.<eos> And ain't no man gonna want me.<eos> Not for marry, nohow.<eos> I have this baby, maybe this baby all me gonna have.<eos> You got chillun?
It would not describe somebody who provides one bed for three people to sleep in, forces them to do horrible chores and strikes them across the face.<eos> Therefore...<eos> There are many words for people like that. ...to make you feel a little more at home here...<eos> But "standoffish" isn't one of them.<eos> ...I want you to participate in my next play.<eos> Participate how?<eos> [chuckles] I'm... [choking] - [coughs] - [object clatters] The play is called The Marvelous Marriage, and is by the great playwright Al Funcoot.<eos> We will give only one performance, this Friday night.<eos> It tells the story of a very handsome and good-looking man, played by me.<eos> You, Klaus, and you, Sunny, will play two cheering people in the crowd.
Build the sets?<eos> Build the sets?<eos> Oh, heavens, no.<eos> My sister is very good with tools.<eos> A pretty girl like you shouldn't be working backstage.<eos> But I'd like to.<eos> [sighs] Sunny, Sunny, Sunny...<eos> Violet?<eos> Violet, Violet, Violet.<eos> You will be playing the young woman I marry.
Build the sets?<eos> Oh, heavens, no.<eos> My sister is very good with tools.<eos> A pretty girl like you shouldn't be working backstage.<eos> But I'd like to.<eos> [sighs] Sunny, Sunny, Sunny...<eos> Violet?<eos> Violet, Violet, Violet.<eos> You will be playing the young woman I marry.<eos> It's a very important role although you only have one line, and I think you know what it is.
No, no, no.<eos> It's "I do."<eos> [sighs] Count Olaf...<eos> What did you call me?<eos> Father... [chuckles]<eos> I'm not sure I'm talented enough to perform professionally.<eos> I'd hate to disgrace your good name and the name of Al Funcoot.<eos> Plus, I'll be very busy the next few weeks working on my inventions.<eos> And learning how to prepare roast beef.<eos> You will participate in my theatrical performance!
Justice Strauss?<eos> Yes?<eos> May I ask you something?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Oh, there we go, sweet girl.<eos> Good.<eos> Yes, as one legal scholar to another?<eos> "The only nuptial requirements are a statement of active acquiescence by both participants, utilizing in loco parentis if necessary, and the signing of an explanatory document in the bride's own hand."<eos> Does that mean what I think it means?<eos> Well, I suppose it depends upon what you think it means.
"Acting in the role of parent."<eos> That's right.<eos> And that's me.<eos> You see, Violet can get married if she has the permission of her legal guardian.<eos> And she does.<eos> In fact... she has more than permission.<eos> She has enthusiasm.<eos> [chuckles] All the enthusiasm in the world won't get us to participate in your horrible plot!<eos> Mr. Poe will hear about this.<eos> Your play will not be performed, and you will go to jail!
Sorry to interrupt, everyone, but that brave and clever boy with the horrible glasses has just figured out our dastardly plan.<eos> - [all gasp]<eos> Thanks to his stupendous library book, the orphans have achieved a grand victory over our evil ways. - Oh, no.<eos> - Whatever will we do?<eos> - I guess we will go to jail.<eos> - For a very long time.<eos> I guess that proves reading really is fundamental.<eos> [Olaf] Violet, do you think your booky little brother is very brave and clever?<eos> His work speaks for itself.<eos> Count Olaf wants to marry you for real, while you and Justice Strauss and everyone else thinks it's just a play.
[sighs] Remember when our parents first brought Sunny home?<eos> She bit the doorknob off the nursery.<eos> Mother and Father... they made me promise to always look after you two and make sure you don't get into any trouble.<eos> Let me keep my promise.<eos> Having a brilliant idea isn't as easy as turning on a light.<eos> But just as a single bulb can illuminate even the most depressing of rooms, the right idea can shed light on a depressing situation.<eos> As inventing workshops go, Count Olaf's bathroom was small and dimly lit.<eos> But the inventing area in Violet's mind was large and bright... and inside of it was everything she needed.<eos> [white-faced woman 1] Oh, Olaf, that is perfect.<eos> It's so wonderful that, in addition to your many talents, you have a marvelous eye for fashion.
We've got to rescue Sunny and get out of here before the sand runs out of the hourglass.<eos> I didn't realize the sand went so quickly. I bought it online.<eos> You're gonna need to flip it a couple of times, like, okay?<eos> And don't touch the baby!<eos> - It's gonna be okay, Sunny.<eos> - Just hang in there.<eos> It's okay. He didn't mean it as a joke.<eos> Do you think you could invent something to help us escape?<eos> [Violet sighs] Maybe.<eos> Do you think you could research a way to get us out of the wedding?
- Rubber baby, baby, baby.<eos> - Showtime. - All right, all right.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> - Rubber bubber...<eos> - Rubber bubber... [folk music playing]<eos> Here I am, literally standing at the edge of a pond.<eos> He's not literally standing at the edge of a pond.<eos> He's figuratively standing at the edge of a pond.<eos> What is a very handsome man like me to do about it... except perform a lengthy soliloquy?<eos> Don't suppose you know how to play poker.
[both women] He's so handsome.<eos> Okay, if I win this hand, you give me a backrub, but if you win again, I'll put tape on my mouth.<eos> Please, Duchess.<eos> I am very handsome, but I am only one man.<eos> By the turrets of Gravelstein, this very handsome man shall be mine.<eos> By the Gardens of Worthington, if I can't have him, my heart will literally break.<eos> Figuratively. "My heart will figuratively break."<eos> Why, what handsome adventures I have had, only to end up at this same pond on this... my wedding day!<eos> [music stops abruptly] [man coughs] [whispers] Say your line.<eos> Do you... take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?

It was your father's favorite, too.<eos> Well, let's not stand out here.<eos> Come in! - Let's go.<eos> - [Sunny fussing]<eos> Come along.<eos> Yes, we're going.<eos> [Monty] Now you must be Violet, the inventor.<eos> And you are Klaus, the reader.<eos> Your mother was so proud of your voracious intellectual appetites.<eos> And you must be Sunny.
So why doesn't the name Montgomery Montgomery ring a bell?<eos> [heavy accent] Good morning.<eos> I am Stephano, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's new assistant.<eos> It's afternoon. And you're Count Olaf.<eos> Perhaps one of you can take my suitcases up to my room.<eos> The ride along that smelly road was dull and unpleasant, and Stephano is very tired.<eos> You're Count Olaf, and if anyone ever deserved to travel along Lousy Lane, it's you.<eos> We will not help you with your luggage and we will not let you in this house.<eos> [in normal voice] Well, I see you children haven't changed a bit.<eos> Violet, you're obviously as stubborn as ever.

- Will you be okay?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I am your guardian.<eos> It is my job... and my delight, might I add, to keep you safe.<eos> Run along.<eos> Arrive... chechem.<eos> Do you think you can just waltz into my life, and the life of my children, and perpetuate this treachery?<eos> You're a wretched person and a bad actor, Stephano, or whatever your real name is.<eos> [normal voice] You don't know my real name?<eos> Because you... are a spy from the Herpetological Society.
Well said.<eos> Then we travel inward to Ollantaytambo in search of some geckos who have an extra leg.<eos> First one to find one gets to name it.<eos> - Sounds wonderful.<eos> - Doesn't it?<eos> Listen, children. I know that the loss of your parents was a great tragedy.<eos> But you can still have the life they wanted for you.<eos> But now, it is time for bed.<eos> Yes. We have a squidillion things to do tomorrow and a boat to catch.<eos> Oh, Sunny, it seems that you finished all of your marshmallows.
Stephano used this double-barrel syringe to inject the venom into Uncle Monty, to simulate the double puncture marks of a snake.<eos> Then he disassembled it to hide the evidence.<eos> But I loved Dr. Montgomery.<eos> What motive would I possibly have to murder him?<eos> He's after the Baudelaire fortune.<eos> How would Stephano even know about the Baudelaire fortune?<eos> I thought they were penniless orphans.<eos> They certainly dress like penniless orphans.<eos> That's because everything we owned burned up in a fire.<eos> But you already know about that... because you're not Stephano, you're Count Olaf.
I don't make it a habit of socializing with employees, so that's really all I know.<eos> Other than the fact that she came highly recommended by your parents.<eos> Telegram for a Mr. Count Olaf?<eos> It's just Count Olaf.<eos> Count is my honorific.<eos> Calling me "Mr." is not only redundant, it's an insult to my station.<eos> Who...<eos> Well, we meet again.<eos> You might want to ease up on the bronzer.<eos> I hope you don't think you're going to Peru.
Previously on "Designated Survivor"...<eos> Sir, you don't really think Aaron's a traitor, do you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> But until I can prove that definitively, I have to keep my guard up and so do you.
I need you to hold yourselves together, project strength.<eos> The American people deserve nothing less.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This is surreal...<eos> MacLeish, Beth.<eos> W-What about their kids?<eos> I mean, what about those poor girls?<eos> I know. I feel awful about the children.<eos> You know what happened, don't you?
We're just installing more.<eos> And there's more snipers.<eos> It's all part of the increased security plan.<eos> It's just for the moment.<eos> Just for the moment.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No.<eos> Thanks, Mike.<eos> You're the leak?
You said yourself you made a lapse in judgment.<eos> Exhaustion affects our ability to make decisions.<eos> Maybe you need some personal time.<eos> Sir, are you asking me to step aside?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I'm asking you to get some rest.<eos> Take maybe a week.<eos> Come back recharged.<eos> Look, sir, I appreciate you looking after me like that, but with everything that's going on right now, I really don't think a break is called for.<eos> Aaron, it's because of everything that's going on that I need you at your best.
He shared the information with Speaker Hookstraten...<eos> She leaked it to Abe Leonard.<eos> Wow.<eos> Do you think this has anything to do with him suppressing the threat assessment memo?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> But he's gonna take some time off.<eos> You suspended him?<eos> No, I asked him to get some rest and refocus, give us a chance to figure out what the hell is going on.<eos> In the meantime... I would like you to be my acting Chief of Staff.
The President's just looking out for me.<eos> And I'm sure you'll be back in no time.<eos> Curtis is the go-to guy for all matters Senate, and Jamie for the House.<eos> Denise handles military and cabinet.<eos> Aaron...<eos> Good luck.<eos> You sure you don't want me in there with you?<eos> No.<eos> Joyner knows me.<eos> Yeah, he knows you're the one who took down MacLeish, the only guy in the world he trusted.
Yeah.<eos> T-Tom, I'm worried about the kids.<eos> I think we should send them away from the White House.<eos> What?<eos> My mom can help take care of them.<eos> I spoke with her. - With all due respect to your mom...<eos> - N-N-No. J-Just hear me out, okay?<eos> The people who are behind this, they took down the government, th-they... th-they killed that FBI agent's little boy, and they almost killed you.<eos> Slow down. Slow down.<eos> You said yourself that you thought the White House was the safest place to be.

Slow down.<eos> You said yourself that you thought the White House was the safest place to be.<eos> Well, I was wrong.<eos> Because wherever you are, you are a target.
I'm gonna head home to shower and get a change of clothes.<eos> Please do.<eos> Don't miss me too much.<eos> Don't make a sound!<eos> Okay. Uh... you want my wallet?<eos> No. I want your suit.<eos> Is that a Welsh Jeffries?<eos> Oh, you guys are sons of bitches, you know that?<eos> And what about me?<eos> You gave birth to these two.
What do you say, Kimble?<eos> Still drinking that turpentine.<eos> Yeah, read all about it.<eos> I have been.<eos> Rookie move by a dittohead neophyte. Hey!<eos> I wouldn't underestimate Seth Wright.<eos> We're dealing with children, Kimble.<eos> Coddled millennials who wouldn't know a real story if it bit them in the ass.<eos> Same old Abe.<eos> Well, you must have hit a nerve, or the White House wouldn't be going to all this trouble to remind people what a train wreck you are.
I'm gonna go pick an outfit now so that I can be done with that nonsense and focus on what's really important...<eos> Running the damn country.<eos> I've got David Rosen on the phone for you.<eos> He said you'd know what it was about.<eos> I'll take it in the hall.<eos> Inauguration seating chart.<eos> No questions asked.<eos> If you need anything more from me...<eos> Abby, wait.<eos> I need you to take over OPA.
What I did was take matters into my own hands.<eos> He manipulated you.<eos> He will work against you at every turn.<eos> And when the time is right, he will try to seize control...<eos> And how would that be any different from the past eight years?<eos> You think someone hasn't been trying to seize control or, in one form or another, replace me?<eos> You just described every single day I've spent in the White House, Olivia.<eos> This is my chance to effect real change.<eos> To make a real difference.<eos> You, of all people, should understand that.
You're not going to the ball, Luna.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> It's over.<eos> Done.<eos> Your plan failed. Mellie's alive.<eos> What I need to know is if there's a Plan B.<eos> Think. Before you utter your next statement.<eos> Think.<eos> And know that I wouldn't come to you unless I already knew the truth.<eos> If you had evidence, I'd already be in handcuffs. Not being threatened.
Honey, am I tripping?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We're gonna have a baby.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Cyrus.<eos> Wake up. Cyrus.<eos> What...<eos> My God.<eos> What... What... What are you doing here?
It's done.<eos> Fully funded.<eos> Time to turn the lights back on.<eos> I'm here to make a few things clear to you.<eos> One... you have no hold over Fitz.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Two... Mellie is mine.<eos> Mine to advise, mine to protect...<eos> Which is why I'm reconstituting B613 and will run it myself.<eos> You're retired.
Man.<eos> Luna freakin' Vargas.<eos> She does make a good point, though.<eos> A president's far more powerful the night he's elected and the day he dies than at any other point in his presidency.<eos> I've always believed that.<eos> And Luna with those blood stains on her dress?<eos> It's like Jackie Kennedy in her pink Chanel suit.<eos> Put her in the Oval, she'd be unstoppable.<eos> Anyway.<eos> Question for you now, if you haven't answered it already, is how to get rid of her.
Previously on Underground...<eos> Rosalee's got her head in a vice and you want to talk about your sad feelings?
- Ain't no excuse. You right, you right, you right! T-This my fault.<eos> I-I told her she could get some rest. Now, I only said that 'cause you got me going to play music for Massa Matthew later, and I thought she could do some singing.<eos> Y'all get your asses back to work!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What in the hell wrong with you?<eos> Been covering your ass all morning and you walk around the quarters like a...<eos> Ain't nobody ask you to save me.<eos> You mad about that girl?<eos> She ain't mean nothing.<eos> You best be ready to sing for Massa Matthew later.
Come on, now.<eos> Come on, jump!<eos> Higher, higher, higher.<eos> This life be hard and unfair.<eos> You gonna know pain, and ain't much I can do about that.<eos> But every once in a while, we can steal moments like this one.<eos> If you can hold onto them, it'll help you through the hard times.<eos> Understand?<eos> Good.<eos> Now make this bed up better than you ever have, or I'm gonna sic Patty Cannon on you.
We ancestors teach we that.<eos> That we ain't in this alone.<eos> Will you do this for me, Momma?<eos> Well, there's less blood, but it's looking like she crossed here.<eos> Well, then go on in after her.<eos> That water is cold as hell.<eos> I ain't getting in there.<eos> Saw a crested bank a half-mile that way where we can cross.<eos> No, that's where we're gonna cross.<eos> You, however, are going to cross here so that we don't lose her trail.
Patty, listen...<eos> Take off your clothes, and get in the damn water, Jack.<eos> Oh... $10 pants...<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Mm. Massa Matthew don't know what he in for.<eos> Once he hears that voice of yours...<eos> Maybe lay off it a bit, yeah?<eos> Seeing as how we're going to the big house.<eos> More reason not to.<eos> Why you look like... you're going to a funeral?
Once he hears that voice of yours...<eos> Maybe lay off it a bit, yeah?<eos> Seeing as how we're going to the big house.<eos> More reason not to.<eos> Why you look like... you're going to a funeral?<eos> Who you trying to fool?<eos> Massa's house, that's home.<eos> That's where you're at your best.<eos> I was at my best when I was his whore?<eos> Be better if that's all it was, but what you and massa had, that was... that was more.
I think your caption murders veracity in cold blood.<eos> Well, you can't make a legend out of the truth.<eos> At least, not one worth publishing.<eos> Elaborate.<eos> What was the most interesting story you heard about me?<eos> Before you decided to write the book.<eos> The baby over the fire?<eos> All right.<eos> Recite it back to me, as you heard it.<eos> As I heard it, you and your men were on the trail of a runaway named Banjo, who killed his master and hightailed it north.
You came upon a small shack in Braintree occupied by a young, black couple with a three-year-old boy.<eos> You suspected that this couple had recently harbored Mr. Banjo, so you held the head of their baby over the fire until the young couple gave up the man's plan.<eos> And do you think that story is true?<eos> And does it matter if it isn't?<eos> 'Cause it's a good one.<eos> Whether folks are telling it or hearing it, they feel the fire, they hear the screams, and they think of their own babies.<eos> It's sensational.<eos> And that's what this story's going to be.<eos> We build up the Black Rose so that when you catch her and she leads you to Moses, your place in history is assured, is that it?<eos> And you, my friend, get a best seller.
Wearing fancy dress upon escape."<eos> Hmm. You lucky massa ain't sic the overseer on you.<eos> All you had to do was look pretty and sing.<eos> It's your fault.<eos> - You know I didn't want to go up there.<eos> - You ain't tell me nothing.<eos> You know how I got these stripes on my back.<eos> Yeah, you mess up at the great house and then you get sent out in the field.<eos> What kind of crazy you is to do that?<eos> You want to be the massa's bitch, you go ahead, but you leave me out of it.

You know I ain't trying to hurt you.<eos> I love you, Stine.<eos> I love you.<eos> I heard you done helped some of the girls around here.<eos> You ain't with child.<eos> I ain't.<eos> I don't want to be... not ever.<eos> I seen't you parading up at the big house like you on a cake walk.<eos> Fishing for the massa's eye.<eos> Seem like growing a little, yellow weed exactly what you want.
I'd still be a slave, no matter where I sleep.<eos> I don't want the massa, but that's what I get.<eos> And it's not just him.<eos> Them overseers.<eos> Some of them others in that field, too.<eos> Anybody who think they could take a piece of me.<eos> I'm trying to protect myself, the only one trying.<eos> So I'm-a use what I got.<eos> You sad, pretty, little thing.<eos> You can't protect nothing.
You control nothing.<eos> Your body ain't never been yours and never will be.<eos> But looks is all you got, so I suppose you better use 'em.<eos> You cut out your insides.<eos> That's the only way.<eos> You, too, of the massa seed.<eos> They blood is in you, and it seep to the bone.<eos> Ain't no running from it.<eos> Your kin done sold you an old and terrible lie.<eos> That you can survive this.
How does it affect you?<eos> Did it affect you?<eos> Of course.<eos> You didn't seem to like him.<eos> I liked him.<eos> Not sure I respected him.<eos> He lacked critical thinking, for sure, and manners, most of the time, but I can give those a pass.<eos> The only thing I need from my men is loyalty.<eos> That is non-negotiable.<eos> Yet you and Jack were always in a state of negotiation. Mm.
Is he in a mood?<eos> God, how do you drink that?<eos> That man is positively off his chump.<eos> Nonetheless, my desired commission may finally be at hand.<eos> I am most happy for you.<eos> And now my own fate is at hand.<eos> The surgeon's exam?<eos> Yes, I have been summoned. The results are in.<eos> Then is it beyond your control.<eos> Yes, indeed, but... but listen, Anne. If... If you could give a word on my behalf, it would...
Then I am doubly sorry.<eos> I was merely suggesting...<eos> You single me out, yet there were other nurses there...<eos> Whom I do not smell.<eos> That also came out wrong.<eos> We have a history, you and I.<eos> I am constantly writing the next chapter, attempting to predict my future course.<eos> Your perfume draws my mind to the question when my focus is required elsewhere.<eos> You mean to say that you are uncertain about us?<eos> It is amazing how hard you must work not to say what you mean.
Your perfume draws my mind to the question when my focus is required elsewhere.<eos> You mean to say that you are uncertain about us?<eos> It is amazing how hard you must work not to say what you mean.<eos> Is your subject amongst these men?<eos> He is.<eos> You mean to say that... that is him?<eos> It is how he may have looked.<eos> Drawn from your imagination.<eos> Along with precise observations of facial muscle and bone structure, such as I collected during your surgery.<eos> What you call "the interruption."
The field?<eos> What field?<eos> The battlefield?<eos> You went out there alone with soldiers...<eos> She was not alone!<eos> She was with a man of God.<eos> Well, well, if I'm not the black sheep,<eos> I hardly know what I'll be.<eos> She meant well, and she returned safely, James, and that is what matters.<eos> You knew of this and lied to me.
Darling... Darling, I'm here.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> McBurney had a change of heart.<eos> Just like that?<eos> Dr. Foster has a way with words.<eos> You have him to thank for it.<eos> I'll be sure of it.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> I'm only glad that you are happy.
I'll be sure of it.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> I'm only glad that you are happy.<eos> You are peculiar, Mr. Diggs.<eos> In the whole time I've been here, I have not known you to smile.<eos> Suppose I haven't had much to smile about... until now.<eos> I have a confession.<eos> I chose Mansion House because I knew you were here.<eos> You suspected it, yes?<eos> I'm glad you came, nonetheless.
I chose Mansion House because I knew you were here.<eos> You suspected it, yes?<eos> I'm glad you came, nonetheless.<eos> Well, that's kind of you to say.<eos> Though I'm not so sure that is how you feel.<eos> I feel many things.<eos> I will be leaving in the morning.<eos> Didn't think to tell me sooner?<eos> I have just decided.<eos> You have not chosen your future course, so I must choose mine.
War was but an idea, but now it is both fearful and real.<eos> Each man must make his own sense of this war.<eos> It's harder and harder to see any good coming from it.<eos> And I'm tired of all the killing.<eos> This can't go on forever.<eos> Any news from Sharpsburg?<eos> Other than too many dead, nothing certain.<eos> Will Miss Emma be joining us?<eos> She only came to fetch some things.<eos> And you allow this, permit her to continue staying there?
"Please know that my thoughts and prayers are with you."<eos> "And that my pride and our shared struggle helps to sustain me."<eos> Nzinga was a queen in Africa, and she had courage and intelligence.<eos> And her skin was black like my skin.<eos> Like your skin.<eos> I'll tell you more about Queen Nzinga tomorrow. Do your numbers.<eos> Come on.<eos> See you tomorrow!<eos> Bye, now.<eos> That the thing you made?
It means something, not only for myself --<eos> It will in the future.<eos> But while this war is going on, what will you be?<eos> A symbol of their generosity? A trophy?<eos> That's not right, Charlotte.<eos> We have to be actors in our own story, Samuel, not secondary players in theirs.<eos> They're offering me an opportunity.<eos> I promised I'd take it.<eos> I... I have the greatest admiration for you.<eos> I trust you know that.
Have you kept these as trophies?<eos> What are they?<eos> Love letters from Captain Van der Berg -- of the most lewd nature.<eos> You searched my things.<eos> I returned your gloves to a drawer where I found these!<eos> Mother, I can explain.<eos> You led us to believe you're so terribly aggrieved, when all along, you were leading him on, toying with his affection in the most unladylike of ways.<eos> Mother -- Those men are upstairs looking for evidence of murder, all because you've --<eos> I didn't mean for it to come to this.<eos> What became of that Yank you set in motion by behaving in a common, disgraceful manner unbecoming to your upbringing -- beneath you, Alice, beneath this family!
We happy few.<eos> Look me in the eye when you tell me that.<eos> There it is. Yeah.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Fresh off that barge, boss.<eos> Your father -- He looks like he was a good man.<eos> Art is the science of deception.<eos> Time to sit down for dinner.<eos> You may eat in the kitchen, boy.
Once everyone accepts that --<eos> Just leave it be, Mother.<eos> Emancipation is inevitable.<eos> You must accept that.<eos> And what then?<eos> Tell me that, Jed.<eos> If negroes are not to be slaves... then what shall they be?<eos> Free citizens.<eos> Dear!<eos> I can't imagine even you believe that will ever work!
And got a job moving furnitures.<eos> All this time to finally get free only to end up in a place like this.<eos> Jimmy Green was gonna kill us.<eos> But he let us go.<eos> Will Jimmy Green save you now?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Weapons, sir.<eos> That warehouse full of guns like I never seen.<eos> Say what they want of Sharpsburg, this war is far from over.<eos> So you made this contraption?

The body.<eos> I told Hankerson we'd meet here.<eos> Yep, help the cause and repair my family name all at once.<eos> You smell something?<eos> A fire?<eos> Wait here.<eos> Father!<eos> I saved us, Son.<eos> They were gonna find that body.<eos> You take this man who you hold by the hand to be your lawful married husband, and do you promise in covenant before God and these witnesses that you will be unto him a loving, faithful, and obedient wife until you shall be separated by death?
Look.<eos> It seems you were right after all.<eos> Did you doubt it?<eos> Read for me.<eos> "On the first day of January in the year of our Lord 1863"...<eos> Get some help and put this thing out.<eos> ..."all persons held as slaves within any state or any designated part of a state" "the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States" "shall be then, thenceforward,<eos> and forever free."<eos> A better world is coming.<eos> And I promise you, Mary Phinney, you shall be there to see it.
You hard of hearin'?<eos> You ask me, god's usin' you for miracle practice.<eos> I'll take the action, But he'd better come through for ya. Or tell ya someplace to hide where I can't find you.<eos> You lose, It will not be pretty.<eos> Check this...<eos> Bihari's gonna love it.<eos> Whoa. It's kickin' all right.<eos> Mr. Bihari's secretary says he told you he'll call back.<eos> B, do me favor.<eos> Tell mr. Bihari you're calling.
You made that up.<eos> But the lord put it in my head.<eos> What did you say?<eos> The lord placed it in my head.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'm, I'm feeling somethin' else.<eos> What?<eos> Leave alone the loose women, young jerry lee.<eos> Darken not the door of thy juke joints, And spill not they seed upon the ground.<eos> Well, you preach it, jimmy.
We are.<eos> But god meant for them people to be over there.<eos> And us people ought to be over here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, but I bet you do like you some watermelon?<eos> Yeah, same as me.<eos> Which is same as them.<eos> Looks like little willie. Just shrunk up, boy.<eos> Well, he do got you there, willie.<eos> I mean, 'cause you do love you some watermelon.
Bihari's got no ears, Turned down everything I sent him.<eos> Dewey told me about this cat chess.<eos> He's got a label out of chicago.<eos> Come on, marion.<eos> Be bold.<eos> Looking for leonard chess.<eos> Yeah, it's me if you owe me money.<eos> He's over there.<eos> Leonard chess?<eos> Yeah. I'm leonard chess. Who are you?
I like it.<eos> Dam'n right it jumps.<eos> It's gonna have every woman jumping out. Onto the dance floor and into the record shop.<eos> Okay, you want a deal?<eos> Depends.<eos> No haggling. Standard deal. Two points of retail.<eos> That's double bihari's royalty.<eos> You got yourself a partner.<eos> Yo, mickey, give my friends a drink here.<eos> But you already got yourself.
That's my record. Well, joe, now, we didn't talk about no exclusivity now, did we?<eos> Yeah, well, we didn't talk about you whoring around either, did we?<eos> I sent you a lifeline, man. This is how you repay me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your lifeline is barely a maybe.<eos> And I can't pay my bills with maybe, now can I, joe?<eos> Don't be a sore loser, joe.<eos> Come on. Up yours, leonard.<eos> He's tough.<eos> When my b.B. King is the biggest negro act in the country, You're gonna say to yourself,
Kickbacks?<eos> Yes, that envelope had money in it.<eos> For us.<eos> He was late and I demanded he bring it straight to me. Or there, there would be hell to pay!<eos> Is that right?<eos> What the hell is your problem, son?<eos> You've had 15 number ones. I took you from carney tents to headlining' the ryman.<eos> If it weren't for me, you'd still be scamming folks. For nickels to watch ducks dance.<eos> You gambling again?<eos> You're making money, I'm making money.
Let's fill this wall with records.<eos> Come on. Let's make music, baby.<eos> Get real loose, and drink some juice and hop in my car<eos> I love 'em all get some juice,<eos> You are so tanked, You can't even string two words together.<eos> Ike.<eos> Look, man, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.<eos> Look when a man is wrong, a man is wrong.<eos> And I was dead wrong.<eos> You write the hits.
That's what I'm here for. The money.<eos> Where's my royalties at?<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> What do you mean, your royalties?<eos> Jackie sung lead.<eos> I paid him the band's share.<eos> He ain't pay nobody.<eos> That drunk drunk up every dime you give him.<eos> He ain't nothing without me.<eos> You know it, I know it, and now. Mr. Joe bihari knows it, too.
That drunk drunk up every dime you give him.<eos> He ain't nothing without me.<eos> You know it, I know it, and now. Mr. Joe bihari knows it, too.<eos> Bihari?<eos> What's he got to do with this?<eos> Plenty.<eos> I cut b.B. King's three o'clock blues for him.<eos> And it's cookin', too.<eos> Mr. Bihari, knows what ike turner's all about.<eos> I'm a hit record machine. And you should have got me when you had the chance.
Yeah.<eos> Turns out that drunk Brenston ain't nothing but a damned one-hit wonder.<eos> Look, I can't pay today's bills on yesterday's hits.<eos> Sam.<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> I made an appointment with a new doctor, and I think that we...<eos> Thanks for consulting me.<eos> You're my wife, Becky.<eos> Stop acting like my damn mother!<eos> Well, you stop acting like a damn child!
- Sir?<eos> - I'll be back.<eos> You just cost me a sale.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To apologize.<eos> Look, I'm sorry if I did anything to disrespect you or your family.<eos> - That wasn't my intention.<eos> - What was your intention?<eos> I just like the music is all.<eos> You don't drink from colored water fountains, do you, boy?
Uh, Mr. Hutchins. Welcome to the Memphis Recording Service.<eos> What can we do for you?<eos> Well, actually, I'm here to see Marion. But if I've come at an inopportune time,<eos> - I could just come back...<eos> Well, then...<eos> - Oh. - I...

Crowd was goin' wild for you.<eos> There's no reason you couldn't be the next Gene Autry.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Television, Hollywood movies?<eos> I like that.<eos> Now, Hollywood's a snake pit.<eos> You're gonna need protection.<eos> Well, good thing I got me a weasel.<eos> I think you're referring' to a mongoose, but that's the idea.<eos> Oh, you got my take?
- Well, that's not what I see.<eos> Is this a trick question? Money.<eos> I see money.<eos> Money that's goin' into someone's pocket and it ain't ours.<eos> You know, most performers get a good five, six years before they go cold.<eos> Now that's a fact.<eos> What are you gettin' at?<eos> Imagine, a management company with dozens of acts selling out the Ryman, merchandise flying off the shelves, gold records plastered everyplace.<eos> A little piece of this, a little piece of that, before you know it, you got yourself an empire.<eos> And I think you might just be the perfect partner.

Dewey, man, I could kiss you.<eos> This is the one.<eos> This is where it all starts goin' right for Sam Phillips.<eos> About damn time, too.<eos> Yes, sir, good people, that was Elvis Presley.<eos> Now, this is gonna be the number-one record in Memphis for a long time, I can tell you, boy.<eos> This is our office?<eos> I put up a heap of dough to pay your dues at the Sharecroppers Club?<eos> A proper office costs three times as much, okay?<eos> I'm here, you're here, we're doin' business, what's your problem?
But it all takes time.<eos> However, if you're not happy, maybe we should all go our separate ways.<eos> Part friends as they say.<eos> Is this what you want, pumpkin?<eos> Oh, more than anythin', Mama.<eos> Now, hold on.<eos> It's important that Mr. Presley is good with everything.<eos> You just take real good care of our boy, you hear me?<eos> Like he was my own, sir.<eos> You and Jimmy have got to get right, so I invited him here for the Youth Day Fellowship.
Maybe four.<eos> I...<eos> Not in public!<eos> Sorry, Peggy.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, honey, no.<eos> It don't mean nothin'. Okay? Don't cry.<eos> All right?<eos> It don't mean nothing.<eos> Peggy, you're my special girl.
Well, lookie here!<eos> Looks like we got us a steamy office romance goin' on?<eos> Don't you have ad-copy to review?<eos> No, but I gotta call Hedda Hopper about you two, give her the scoop...<eos> - All right, get out.<eos> I'd love to, uh, invite you to the Bon Ton Cafe next week.<eos> I was thinkin' maybe we could invite Sam and his wife.<eos> That would be great, Earle, just not next week.<eos> Actually, I was hoping to get time off.<eos> Station policy is that you show up every day that you're on air, Marion.
Raise you two bits.<eos> You are one plain dolt lugging' that stupid clock all the way to Korea just to bring it back Stateside.<eos> Yeah, it ain't no stupider than re-enlistin' in the first place!<eos> - Right.<eos> - Ay, pazzo, huh?<eos> So every time that bird cuckoos, I'll think of you palookas pulling your puds!<eos> How could we miss you if you won't go away?<eos> I'm gonna miss your hillbilly music, not you.<eos> What's this crap?<eos> And you are?
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.<eos> You look beat.<eos> Go grab yourself a soda pop, hmm?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Make that two rooms, my friend.<eos> I got you.<eos> That'll be $12, please.<eos> Did you hear they invented the LP's so Dee-jays had time to get to the pisser and back.<eos> That silver of wisdom eluded me.<eos> Uh, could you take care of bid'ness and make it back in three minutes?

- It's fine!<eos> Self-pity doesn't become you, Sam.<eos> Well, we can't go back now, can we, Marion?<eos> I saw what I saw.<eos> And I saw you with your baby, Sam.<eos> It tore my heart out.<eos> Right then and there, I knew that would never be me.<eos> Maybe I should leave Sun.<eos> Marion... Sun may be circling the drain, but I got a feelin'... we are on the edge of somethin'.<eos> And we didn't come this far for you to quit.
Hell, no!<eos> Old Gold for you and Gold Old for me!<eos> Ee-gaw!<eos> Mr. Sun Records!<eos> All right, Dewey, that's a nice show.<eos> Now, come on down from there, you're scarin' these fine folks.<eos> Man, you know that Alan Freed...<eos> Alan Freed is going around tellin' everyone that he invented rock 'n' roll.<eos> Man, that ain't nothing but steaming' bull-crap.<eos> 'Cause you know we started it right here!
Last call.<eos> Oh, don't go through any trouble.<eos> I would love to talk, but I'm running so late.<eos> It's great to see you.<eos> You look lovely today.<eos> Humpty Dumpty just walked in.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Don't sit.<eos> You're not staying long.<eos> Well, Steve, it's time for us to move forward from whatever bad feelings you might have.

This might be like that.<eos> It'll make for a bumpy couple of days.<eos> But no permanent damage, Doc?<eos> I'm still not sure I'd recommend it.<eos> People are getting sick on Ice Juice.<eos> Anybody betting it won't turn?<eos> Axe doesn't get positions this size wrong.<eos> Get out of the stock, Chuck.<eos> They're gonna crush you.<eos> Wow, I'm glad to see you view me as so defenseless.
I am so close to getting Axe.<eos> You will get him...<eos> Larry.<eos> Are you supposed to be across state lines?<eos> There's no "supposed to" for me anymore.<eos> This is the first day of the rest of my life.<eos> I'm free and clear.<eos> You, however... well, consider this me returning the courtesy.<eos> You're getting arrested today, Roberto.<eos> I don't suppose you'd like to share any further details.
When?<eos> Today.<eos> I got to find out if this is bullshit or if it's real.<eos> If it is real,<eos> - I have to make some moves before we...<eos> We talked about this. We prepared for this.<eos> But I'm not running with you.<eos> And neither are the kids.<eos> It's not fair to them.<eos> So, you do what you got to do, but we're staying.
Who said anything about running?<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> We stay and we fucking fight.<eos> For a career bureaucrat, you have a David Blaine-like flair for the dramatic.<eos> Because I chose a locale where we were unlikely to be seen?<eos> That's not showmanship.<eos> It's tradecraft. Sure.<eos> Are we gonna have to go through the whole blind-drop routine every time we meet?<eos> We would, if we were to continue meeting.<eos> This isn't just a grand entrance into the job. You're doing a whole thing.
Some people would call that a cover up.<eos> Well, unimaginative types, with no pizzazz.<eos> I'm taking Axelrod at the closing bell.<eos> He'll be sure to be at his desk.<eos> You can read about the rest in the news.<eos> I won't do what you've asked.<eos> And this is the end of the matter for you.<eos> From here on, it's just my team and me.<eos> You're a hard man, Dake.<eos> But a word of caution. You and your team go chasing Axe up into those hills without me, don't forget one thing.
- No. I have come to the decision that we are done with marital counseling.<eos> I am. I didn't realize...<eos> By day's end, all will become clear to you. And I will be glad to discuss it ad infinitum, just the two of us.<eos> You know, the reason people, we, go to therapy together, is that having an impartial witness,<eos> - a counselor...<eos> And I also know that life without you is a misery.<eos> And all the whinging and the whining that we both, at least I, do in therapy seems to be having the opposite effect for me.<eos> I see.<eos> I will be coming home tonight after work.<eos> And, once all is out in the open, I sincerely hope that you will come home, too.
We get this part over with, then we start digging in.<eos> All right.<eos> Listen, until I reach them... I'll stay underground and keep moving.<eos> Can I get you a...<eos> You can't go to bed with Jenna Jameson and expect to wake up with Snow White.<eos> Which means?<eos> Know who you're fucking.<eos> I feel caught a bit off guard.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> So you can't feel that way.

I just heard that you're behind a move against Axelrod, that it's another office prosecuting, but your DNA's all over it.<eos> Axelrod is about to be arrested.<eos> I did put it in motion, but it can't track back to me.<eos> Then why am I hearing what I'm hearing?<eos> How are you hearing what you're hearing?<eos> I used to peg Freddy Reyes in the AG's office.<eos> Well, only once in the office.<eos> Point is, the word's leaking out of D.C.<eos> That doesn't work for me.<eos> My reputation's all tied up with yours right now and you jackpotted me.
- You jackpotted me.<eos> Our entire agreement was based on you telling me everything as soon as I needed to know it, which is immediately, always.<eos> Okay.<eos> Perhaps some coffee, tea?<eos> Don't charm me.<eos> Foley knew I might take down Axe.<eos> I needed to in order to be ready to take the next step.<eos> There is no "might" with Jack Foley.<eos> Rogue moves don't fly.<eos> If he believes that you are holding back from him or me, he'll consider himself released from his commitment to you.
Is this shit really happening?<eos> I believe it is.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Get the shredders here, stat.<eos> We'll do the paper files here.<eos> We'll take care of the hard drives with plasma torches in the loading bay.<eos> Let's talk next steps.<eos> All outside money will be heading for the exits within 24 hours of an arrest.<eos> You should name a CIO to manage the rest.<eos> Don't know who you want, but you should pick him right away.
I just heard from a contact at the Bureau of Prisons.<eos> He's been released.<eos> What the fuck is that about?<eos> I thought I made it pretty clear I never wanted to talk to you again.<eos> This isn't a social call.<eos> I'm reaching out as counsel for Robert Axelrod.<eos> That shouldn't feel good in your mouth.<eos> Bryan, how fast are you moving on the arrest?<eos> Do you have a warrant?<eos> Orrin, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
After the criminal case, recovering in civil court will be...<eos> After he's convicted.<eos> After another four to seven years of dragging him through court, maybe.<eos> Until then?<eos> When I am governor...<eos> When you're governor?<eos> What the fuck happened to you?<eos> When this gets out...<eos> It won't.<eos> And you will make sure that it does not.
When you're governor?<eos> What the fuck happened to you?<eos> When this gets out...<eos> It won't.<eos> And you will make sure that it does not.<eos> You will protect me and my role.<eos> It is to your benefit to have me as governor.<eos> You should act out of rationality, not emotion.<eos> Why?<eos> You didn't.
The new stuff is organic.<eos> No, the new stuff's too expensive.<eos> So, now that we got the vats the Orgo shit came in, we go back to the PERC and we put it in the Orgo.<eos> Give me a minute, Louis.<eos> They're coming for you, aren't they?<eos> All right.<eos> So, what's gonna happen?<eos> How's the firm gonna handle it?<eos> Who are you handing the reins over to?<eos> Just... just so you know, I'd keep a firm grasp of them, as long as it took, and I'd give them right back to you
- the minute you were out.<eos> - Nothing's happening yet.<eos> Plans are being contemplated.<eos> And if and when I need you, I know where to find you.<eos> Still can't believe you put your money into this place.<eos> Diversification.<eos> Positive cash flow.<eos> But, you know, I'm 24/7 ready to deal with Axe Cap.<eos> Yeah, that's not why I came.<eos> You've been through this.
- As soon as he's in custody, before the news streams out, we should sit them all down.<eos> Group meeting.<eos> Let them vent their fears.<eos> The people that are too affected, we send home.<eos> Let them take a leave if they want.<eos> The rest of us will focus on saving Axe Capital.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's very sweet and supportive.<eos> But no.<eos> I don't need you to be the team doctor who stops people from playing and puts them in the concussion protocol.

I'll create a phantom algo for our biggest illiquid names to protect against the high-frequency guys.<eos> And I'll use six different brokers with six different baskets, a billion each, currency, tech, big pharma, et cetera.<eos> And then, on your signal, I hit the button.<eos> We take maybe a five percent hit, but that's why they call it a fire sale.<eos> And if the arrest happens, you are going to ask me to be the Chief Investment Officer.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Well, I'm still not sure that I'll need to.<eos> That's because you know that even if you focus on Axe Capital half the time, you would do a better job than I would.<eos> And that's true.<eos> But, what's best for Axe Cap, long term, is for you to focus every bit of energy you have on getting out of the situation you are in.

I need approval on a commission report.<eos> I don't even look at those things.<eos> I sign them in a big stack on my desk.<eos> I repeat, what?<eos> I...<eos> You guys have been kind of closed off all day, and everyone's starting to wonder, and I was sort of elected...<eos> I elected myself to find out...<eos> Okay, Mafee.<eos> Let's take a walk.<eos> Seems to me that you will be in for plenty of scrutiny, too, with a prosecution in the offing, if you're sticking around.

But until then... I am done with you.<eos> You will get over this in time.<eos> One more thing.<eos> This is for you.<eos> Open it here.<eos> I want to watch you do it.<eos> I had my man follow them to a hotel.<eos> Look at them.<eos> With that morning-after glow.<eos> This is what your wife is out doing while you're working on the marriage.
He's not coming home.<eos> Go play. He's not coming.<eos> Well, there she is.<eos> You know your man.<eos> At this point, I do.<eos> - It's really happening. - It appears to be.<eos> There were times I...<eos> I never thought I'd see this moment.<eos> And this is as much as you should probably see.<eos> You should leave so you can't be called as a witness, because I've arranged that you'll lead the prosecution at Eastern.
Say all that.<eos> On it.<eos> Keep facing the wall.<eos> You can turn around.<eos> I always figured the worst part about being locked up would the company.<eos> You've just proven me right.<eos> I bet the worst is yet to come.<eos> You made a mistake coming here. - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Once Boyd showed up at my door, I knew you were in this, that you'd used him to hook me in. Yeah.
Well, I won't be in here for long. No.<eos> A macher like you?<eos> You'll make bail.<eos> But it won't feel like freedom for a long time, maybe ever again.<eos> I might have underestimated a part of your character.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> I didn't realize just how desperate you were to feel like a man.<eos> You sacrificed over, what, 27 million dollars, every penny you had, just to catch me?<eos> And almost broke your father and your best friend in the process.<eos> I may be ruthless when it comes to dealmaking, but you're as trigger happy as Machine Gun Kelly, spraying everyone in sight.

Tell yourself that.<eos> Maybe that'll help you on all those sleepless nights you have staring you in the face.<eos> Nah, it won't matter.<eos> No amount of money is gonna erase the video of all those lackeys you poisoned, or wipe out the trading records of your tampering with the stock, manipulating the market.<eos> You let your hatred of me put everything you hold dear in jeopardy.<eos> I'm gonna find it.<eos> Whatever it is.<eos> Whatever thread you left behind, however small... the one that threatens everything you are.<eos> We both know it's out there.<eos> You know exactly what it is.
We both know it's out there.<eos> You know exactly what it is.<eos> You were talking about sleepless nights.<eos> It's what you'll wake up thinking about in the dark, shaking, because I'm gonna find it.<eos> You know I will.<eos> And I am gonna pull on it, and I'm gonna pull on it until your whole fucking world unravels.<eos> And when I am done, you won't be governor.<eos> You won't be the U.S. Attorney.<eos> You might not even be an attorney at all.<eos> Yeah, I might go down behind all of this, but one thing is for sure, you are gonna be right there next to me.
Did she ever explain herself?<eos> Something about getting lost in my world.<eos> Took that nobody actress to Mexico.<eos> I don't want to clean up another train wreck.<eos> Well, then let's makes sure this one stays on the rails.<eos> - This is an offer from Kyle West.<eos> - For the movie?<eos> He's offering you a contract marriage.<eos> We just met.<eos> I think that you are amazing.
I'm gonna just get my towel now.<eos> You worked up an appetite.<eos> Well, I had an appetite before we worked out, remember?<eos> Sorry, I'm gonna work on my timing.<eos> Your call with Andres is in five minutes.<eos> What call with Andres?<eos> He wants your notes on the script before you head to Venice.<eos> Mm, I have to get going too.<eos> I have some shopping to do for the trip.<eos> Well, you can handle this.
Great.<eos> Thanks, Ben.<eos> Sorry to interrupt the flow.<eos> I feel like I've never written a book before, which is probably right where I need to be, but...<eos> Probably.<eos> I see you've made plans to join us in Venice.<eos> That's because I couldn't bear the thought of being here without you.<eos> Oh, I imagine that must be very hard for you.<eos> Hmm. It's getting hard for you, actually.<eos> You're marrying me.
Does it feel as false for you as it does for me?<eos> It feels defensive.<eos> That's because I know you don't want me to come to Venice.<eos> Because you know I'm right.<eos> The world is watching to see how Kyle reacts when he sees Lisbeth.<eos> It's not a good look to have his life advisor following him around.<eos> Well, it'll be worse if things go sideways.<eos> They won't.<eos> Look, let me go be the movie producer.<eos> You stay here and write your book.
- I'm dying.<eos> - I'm speechless.<eos> - What?<eos> - You look amazing.<eos> - I know what your problem is.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't think she has a problem.<eos> - She does.<eos> She does have a problem, 'cause she doesn't have an assistant.<eos> You are not going to be my drunk assistant.
Suck a dick, Hope.<eos> Three days ago, we were on our way to Two Bunch Palms to talk about our future, Megan.<eos> Talk about our future?<eos> Nic, don't even try that.<eos> That was my plan.<eos> Your plan was to, like, smoke weed and binge-watch "House of Cards."<eos> And talk about our future.<eos> Nic, we never had a future.<eos> - Wow, okay.<eos> - You... well, you knew that.
Brother, I'm bringing you back a case.<eos> Bye.<eos> Megan, there will be some bumps in the road.<eos> No one can really prepare you for how much attention Kyle gets.<eos> Yeah, I'm trying to imagine, but...<eos> Yeah, just take it one step at a time, and... try and remember some of the small things, like how you hold yourself, the expression on your face.<eos> All of that ultimately reflects back on him, you know?<eos> Can you make a commitment to be mindful of that?<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> Maria Looking for the guy on the plane, and you were talking to that farm girl, and you told her that you were coming back, but you weren't,
Shut up, Cathy.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> I said no.<eos> Okay.<eos> Morning, you two.<eos> Good morning.<eos> How was drinks with the film commission?<eos> Well, it turns out Italian men are kind of grabby.<eos> So let's talk about the day.<eos> You have press to do, and what do you want to do?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> All right.<eos> I do not want to do this.<eos> I can't believe you're making me do this.<eos> All right.<eos> Totally busted taking bathroom selfies.<eos> Sorry you had to see that.
Hey, come here.<eos> Look, um... what people want is for the story to keep going.<eos> It's an addiction.<eos> And we feed it whether we like it or not.<eos> So tomorrow there's gonna be a bunch of shit in the tabloids about Lisbeth and I getting back together, and... people will get their fix.<eos> Was that the plan all along?<eos> The plan was to avoid the other way that it could possibly go, that we hate each other.<eos> It's not a good look.<eos> And what's the truth?<eos> You're the truth.
I'm okay.<eos> No, he was all over you, Megan.<eos> - You can't just say that you're okay.<eos> - I am. I don't know how it looked, but I'm fine.<eos> What the hell were you thinking leaving the hotel like that?<eos> I was on my way to the gym, and I ran into some friends, and they invited me out.<eos> It is not that simple, okay?<eos> You have to think.<eos> You can't just do whatever the hell you want.<eos> And you can't act like this is my fault, because it's not.
Please, look.<eos> Look, please.<eos> Look, please. Not now, okay?<eos> Look, I said not now.<eos> God damn it. I told you to stop!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Shit.<eos> I need you.<eos> It's taken care of.<eos> That guy, he jumped out at the wrong time, and you reacted.
That guy, he jumped out at the wrong time, and you reacted.<eos> You're a human being.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, you sure you want to stick around for all this?<eos> It's gonna get old real quick.<eos> I'm not leaving your side.<eos> Terence?<eos> You didn't have to come all the way out here.<eos> But I'm glad you did.
Tax-free medical pension.<eos> You trying to get rid of me?<eos> What?<eos> God, no.<eos> I'm not...<eos> Hold on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Lieutenant, I want to charter a boat to Santa Cruz Island.<eos> I need your approval.<eos> All right, it sounds like you're already on a boat.
It's what it is.<eos> No amount of practice makes you taller.<eos> Mom.<eos> You weren't supposed to be here until Christmas.<eos> You want me to go back?<eos> No way.<eos> Aw. God, I missed you.<eos> And you're taller.<eos> Do not go down that road.<eos> Where are you and Reggie staying?
That's you.<eos> You still have to explain why it was on your boat in your possession when Xavi Moreno is supposedly on a beach somewhere in Mexico.<eos> Anything else you want to clear up, counselor?<eos> Mr. Dobbs?<eos> Didn't think so.<eos> You know... there's nothing worse than a leader who betrays his own troops.<eos> In country, that gets you the death penalty right there.<eos> But to kill a 16-year-old boy.<eos> For what?<eos> I'm going to make sure you live the rest of your life in the black echo.
Call RHD.<eos> Tell them you've taken a personal interest in the case and ask for a briefing.<eos> When they mention finding my mother's murder book, ask for a copy.<eos> I'll take it from there.<eos> You want me to help you conduct a secret investigation of the man who is scheduled to pin the stars on my collar.<eos> Don't you want to know if that man's a murderer?<eos> I got Daddy's bag.<eos> I called it.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> Jack, you're bigger.
Morning.<eos> Am I taking Maddie to school, or are you?<eos> She's driving.<eos> I'm closing my eyes.<eos> I heard that.<eos> How's the house hunt?<eos> I've got four appointments this morning.<eos> Of course, if there's anything I like, I'm gonna run it by you, Maddie.<eos> Why?<eos> If we're going to live there, I want you to have a say.

You tell me.<eos> I'm good.<eos> How'd you know they were driving a Cadillac?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> When Rudy flipped and you led him through the story, you slipped.<eos> You asked if the Cadillac they were in was stolen.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> How'd you know it was a Caddy?<eos> It wasn't in the video that was sent to the Times.<eos> They stole it for that job, and somehow you knew.
Hey.<eos> Are you mine?<eos> Please be mine.<eos> Hey, I'm Bryan, and you are Rufus.
Who's there?<eos> Who's out there?<eos> Rufus?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Rufus?<eos> BRIDGEVILLE CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL<eos> Eve, you shouldn't have done it.<eos> You have a group of parents petitioning to have you fired now. I know who.<eos> They've been trying to get me fired since I started.<eos> And sometimes it seems like you want them to succeed.
I mean, all football is is white male aggression.<eos> 3/4 of the NFL is black.<eos> Well, maybe they're oppressed, and this is their way out of a bankrupt education system. But maybe they like football.<eos> Maybe you can be oppressed and still like football.<eos> Either way, I'm gonna enjoy my male privilege and stare at their bodies.<eos> Is that one of the moms that got you fired?<eos> Okay, Mia, tell me where it is.<eos> Tell me where it is!<eos> You goddamn junkie.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.<eos> Yes, what?<eos> Yes, she can go.<eos> She's almost 17.<eos> Which still makes her 16.<eos> She has to get out and experience life.<eos> It's time to let her go.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> She just wants what's best for you.<eos> Do you also think this is what's best for me?
I think you should just move in with us and we could adopt you.<eos> Oh, like a little shelter puppy.<eos> Yeah, then we can watch cheesy eighties movies every night.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure Kevin and Eve would love that.<eos> Yeah, of course they would.<eos> They'd love it. I'd love it.<eos> And you are aware that pretty much all of these people are superficial assholes.<eos> No, they're not.<eos> Look...<eos> I promise I will follow you wherever you want to go when you fall in love with a guy, okay? Or a girl.
We can't be offensive.<eos> Well, that was nice.<eos> Thank you. What now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We dance?<eos> Sure.<eos> What's the faggot doing here?<eos> I am here to hook up with hot football jocks.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> - I thought you were a bottom.
- Yeah? - Yeah.<eos> - That's what you thought?<eos> Let him go. Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We were just having fun.<eos> Doesn't look like he's having fun.<eos> I'm sorry for my friends.<eos> Apparently they forgot what century we live in. Yeah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm glad you came.
- Oh, yeah?<eos> You can remember the law, huh?<eos> Well, it looks like we are calling Arrowhead, and you are staying a while longer.<eos> Get me prints on that weirdo. Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kevin?<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Maybe it's best we speak to someone else.<eos> Hey, Jay.<eos> We need you to come with us. Why?
Okay.<eos> Kevin?<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Maybe it's best we speak to someone else.<eos> Hey, Jay.<eos> We need you to come with us. Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Just please come with us.<eos> Is it something with my dad?<eos> We just need you to come down to the station and answer a few questions.
No, I don't know what to do.<eos> I can't watch TV.<eos> I can't read.<eos> I wanted to listen to some music, and I need to pick a song.<eos> I was like, the song I pick, it'll always be the first song I heard after...<eos> We can choose a really bad song?<eos> Like a stupid Katy Perry song or something.<eos> That way, you won't ruin a good song.<eos> I like Katy Perry.<eos> You hate her.
What are you gonna do?<eos> Find my wife and daughter.<eos> No, what are you gonna do with us?<eos> Look, what... whatever's happened,<eos> I'm sure it'll be over soon.<eos> Please, I'm just here because the Sheriff thought I was crazy when I warned them about the mist.<eos> Don't let her out.<eos> She looks unstable. She did something bad.<eos> Not to anyone good.<eos> Unlike me, you're a nice guy, and you're never gonna be able to live with yourself if you leave us behind, 'cause, if you do, we die, and you know it.
What's going on with Gunn? Beats me.<eos> You have to ask Robertson.<eos> Right now he has me chasing down watch band and bezel patterns.<eos> What's a bezel?<eos> The metal circle that secures the crystal on a watch.<eos> What for?<eos> Marks on Gunn's neck and back.<eos> Robertson thinks choke hold, maybe.<eos> Like old school LAPD.<eos> You ever do that? Choke somebody out?
I freaked and I split. That's all.<eos> Okay, look, you're not a suspect.<eos> I just need some help here is all.<eos> Nobody's gonna ever know we talked.<eos> Wouldn't hurt you to have a friend in the department.<eos> Yeah, so I'm taggin', all right?<eos> A car pulls up.<eos> Black SUV you told me about.<eos> Someone gets out, they go in, they come right back out, like, a minute later, they take off.<eos> - You saw all this?
- Thank you.<eos> So, you think it's Jimmy.<eos> I don't picture Pierce tipping that reporter.<eos> I'm sure he knows by now Harry's been stalking Gunn for years.<eos> What else has Jimmy got?<eos> He noticed marks on Gunn's neck and back.<eos> Possible choke hold.<eos> He told Pierce he thinks it could be connected to law enforcement.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> And what do you have that Jimmy doesn't?
Detective Bosch, Scott Anderson.<eos> I'd really appreciate a few minutes of your time.<eos> You have my number.<eos> Message deleted.<eos> No more messages.<eos> Hey, Harry.<eos> J. Edgar.<eos> How was the Getty?<eos> What?<eos> The other day when I met with Goshen, you were off the radar.
He's a fuckin' liar.<eos> It was written all over his face. - It's you.<eos> - Go fuck yourself.<eos> All right, you know what? Stand down, both of you.<eos> My office, Monday morning, we will straighten all this out.<eos> Take the weekend to cool off.<eos> I'm following the evidence, Bosch.<eos> I sure as hell don't want to see it buried by your friends in the department.<eos> You're on very thin ice. Not another word.<eos> And you have impeccable timing.
You in the mood for a ride?<eos> Where to?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's a place.<eos> Not too far.<eos> Little more private.<eos> Anything in particular?<eos> I hope you're bilingual.<eos> Yeah, I am, if the money's right.<eos> Look, you're gonna have such a good time, you're gonna pay me.
So, uh...<eos> Why do you look like you've been in a fight?<eos> - We were wrestling and... - Okay.<eos> We were playing football, and then it... And then it turned into wrestling.<eos> Only because you said I didn't tag you, and I... I, clearly, I did.<eos> Yeah, but who's... who's the one who got the worst of it?<eos> Not me.<eos> I just can't wait until at least one of you acts like you're not 12 years old.<eos> Yeah, I don't... I don't think she bought that.<eos> No way in hell she's gonna believe you got the better of me.
Pete's mom said something happened on his 11th birthday.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> One bit of good news.<eos> - The guy, the asshole who hit me... - Yeah, yeah. - He's got a record.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?<eos> Me?<eos> Look, I haven't seen you in 20 years, you could be out there, I don't know... robbin' banks.<eos> Not recently. No.<eos> Good. Good, in case you have to testify.
It's not a customer, you idiot.<eos> That's my grandson.<eos> Wh... what?<eos> Pete?<eos> Pete Murphy?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> - Yeah, just got back.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I literally cannot believe it.<eos> Given what a little fuckin' thug you were, I'm amazed you're not in prison sucking' dick, because, let's be honest, you developed a taste for it.
Look, why don't you get the fuck out of here.<eos> - I'll see you later, Pete.<eos> - Get the fuck out of here.<eos> - Good guy!<eos> - You shoulda picked a better photo.<eos> You can see your lazy eye.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Don't you remember him?<eos> That's Shawn.<eos> He's the kid that you and Taylor made cry.
I'm pretty sure that's only for hookers.<eos> But no, I'm not a cop.<eos> I'll take the oyster.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Showing up.<eos> You know, and paying for his daycare, and most of all for fainting.<eos> So good.<eos> You know, Google says that's called the parasympathetic response, and it is entirely involuntary.<eos> Wait, wait, you already knew about this?
Well, I mean... I mean, I honestly didn't think there'd be blood. That nurse is a butcher.<eos> I'm sorry, you knew this could happen, and you came anyway?<eos> Yeah, he's my kid.<eos> Oh, my God, you are such an idiot.<eos> - Okay, well, it's been nice... - No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Listen, I have a present for you.<eos> It's just like... kind of like a-a-a little thank you thing.<eos> It's just, uh... let's see if it happens again. Please?<eos> I missed it the first time. Ha, ha.<eos> You got a thing with the old...
- What?<eos> - Your partner.<eos> I don't know what you're...<eos> Come on, you're running a fiddle con with the watch.<eos> I'm just wondering who got to spook Ben, say it's worth 50 grand?<eos> I don't know what you're sayin', I don't...<eos> Look, Pete, I know who you are.<eos> Wait, how do you know my name? How is not important.<eos> What's important is<eos> I know you and you don't know me, which means you're not well suited for the life.
Besides, the way the business is going...<eos> It was a strategic decision?<eos> I get no weekends.<eos> I get higher pay, and I get Bixby to do the rough stuff.<eos> I'm too old to take a bull...<eos> or a baseball bat to the head.<eos> You know the story of this bat?<eos> Is it funny? I like funny stories.<eos> I think it's funny.<eos> I got this bat 30 years ago before you came to join us.
So you don't know any cons? - What?<eos> - Con artists.<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> I just was wondering if it had something to do with why you haven't seen your mother in three years.<eos> You don't know?<eos> I thought maybe you would have been in touch with her.<eos> No, I wish.<eos> I wish.<eos> After you and your mom left, Lila and Maggie wrote letters back and forth for a couple of months, and then your grandmother did, uh... well, you know what she did, and that was the end of the letters.<eos> I'm glad you're back, Pete.

Yeah, that's a fake?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 40 years I look at Rolex on wrist of middle age man caught fucking waitress, getting divorced, needs money to hide from wife.<eos> I know this shit backwards.<eos> Damnit.<eos> - How much you pay?<eos> - Well, I didn't.<eos> I made a deal, but I thought I was getting the better end of the deal. - Heh.<eos> - That's the worst, isn't it?<eos> When you think you're the one playing, but you're actually the one being played.
- What'd she say?<eos> She said she stopped you from getting yourself killed.<eos> Is she in?<eos> She's already started.<eos> Vince, if I saw anything, I would tell you, I swear.<eos> Calm down, Tate.<eos> I'm not accusing you of anything.<eos> Been watching the hands?<eos> Watch all their hands like you told us.<eos> All right, so when you're watching Ivy's hand or Hector's hand, who's watching our little Indian friend here? He could be up to something, right?
You ain't good enough for this here life.<eos> I ain't talking about the money or even the freedom.<eos> You ain't enough of a man to earn drawing breath.<eos> And the thing is, you know it.<eos> Everyone around you knows it.<eos> Everyone who's ever known you.<eos> I thought you wanted an honest conversation.<eos> That's what you wanted, right?<eos> You wanted to talk, let's talk.<eos> Let's talk about why I'm sitting here and why you ain't out there looking for your wife and your lost little girl.
One afternoon, on my way home, the man was gone.<eos> The boy was still there, and...<eos> I walked over to him. Do you know what he said to me?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Because he doesn't exist.<eos> Why do you assume that I need some deep personal reason to fight this war?<eos> Slavery is wrong.<eos> I know that.<eos> You know that.
*** is blue.<eos> Red.<eos> Blue.<eos> You can drive them around.<eos> Should we go answer the door?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's Auntie Maggie!<eos> Ready for your birthday breakfast?<eos> You know what, Mags? That was... that was really, really, really kind of you, but you shouldn't have bothered.<eos> Oh, right... I forgot you're one of those anti-birthday people.
Oh, right... I forgot you're one of those anti-birthday people.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Kinda.<eos> Well, waffles à la Maggie aren't really optional.<eos> Mmm, just like my mom used to make, or like I used to make for myself because she was still asleep.<eos> Somebody has to help you shake that negative birthday attitude, Reid.<eos> It's supposed to be a celebration.<eos> Historically, hasn't been the best day for me.<eos> And now with Luke, birthdays are for him.<eos> I remember you and Charlie always having these crazy fancy birthday plans.
It's just the phone.<eos> It's rude.<eos> Wow! Here we go.<eos> Five minutes, and you're already a clinger.<eos> No, I'm not, and I'm gonna prove it to you by saying goodbye.<eos> I hope you and your phone have a beautiful life together. Sorry.<eos> What?<eos> No, I'm sorry that we've wasted our time.<eos> This isn't about my phone, is it?<eos> If you ask me, I think you're not sure what you're actually looking for.
Hey.<eos> I understand how weird this can be, believe me. So if you change your mind, I'm up to try again.<eos> Well, any doubts anyone had about you cutting it in trauma, Dana, I'd say they're eating them right about now.<eos> I don't know, Charlie. My heart's beating like 500 times a minute.<eos> I haven't felt so alive in years.<eos> - Ready with more suction, Dr. Sekara?<eos> - You got it.<eos> Dr. Sharpe?<eos> Stabilizing.<eos> You look like you've got everything under control.
I've been 12 for 20 years, mister.<eos> This could be my only real chance to get through to him.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Aisha?<eos> How is he? Well, we were able to take care of his lung infection, but there were complications during surgery, so his condition is still very serious.<eos> People are coming to my party.<eos> He's got to be there or it won't happen.<eos> Aisha, your father is fighting for his life.<eos> There is no way, even in a best-case scenario, that he's going home today.<eos> You don't know anything!
I thought I'd be on the outside looking in forever, you know?<eos> And at that time... there was only one way I could see out.<eos> Shahir, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> When you don't see anything good in yourself... ending your life might seem like a favor to those you love.<eos> So I think your father, in his own tortured way, was trying to spare you.<eos> I know.<eos> I-I know that most of the time.<eos> It's just with everything that's been going on between Charlie and me, I've been thinking about growing up without a father. And I-I don't want Luke to have that life.<eos> But it's you and Charlie.<eos> See, whatever the two of you are going through, I don't think you're gonna let that make you bad parents.

Hey!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Everybody, um, I had no idea.<eos> - Um. - But you can thank Maggie for carrying the birthday ball.<eos> Maggs... you're the best.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Okay, everyone, we are here, so, um, let's have some fun.<eos> All right?<eos> Wow. Welcome to your, uh, worst nightmare.<eos> - You weren't in on this, were you?
Thanks. - Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hmm? - Come here.<eos> Sit.<eos> Oh, sweetie, we never should have thrown you this party.<eos> No, no.<eos> You know what? it's great.<eos> Oh, you are the worst liar ever.<eos> You hate your birthday.
- Hey. - I'm starving.<eos> I haven't eaten anything all day, and all I keep thinking about is what's squirming around in the spinach dip or what laid eggs in the fruit.<eos> Don't even get me started on the cheese mites.<eos> Look, I've always believed that tough love is the way to go in the E.R., but I might have maybe pushed you a little bit too hard today.<eos> We're a team.<eos> We need to help each other out.<eos> Maybe I needed to face my phobia.<eos> I was impressed by your fortitude... before the fainting, that is, I mean.<eos> - You heard?<eos> - Oh, yeah. Oh, and just so you know, my phobia... snakes.
That is a great idea.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yeah. Well, since I'm gonna be moving out, what do you say we go home and wreck the place?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have listened.<eos> I thought I could change your mind about the whole anti-birthday thing.<eos> I'm glad I wasn't alone, and I'm happy now, so thank you.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, you relax, and I'm gonna start tidying up.
- Shit. Scotty.<eos> Look at you.<eos> - Look at you.<eos> Goddamn. It's good to see you.<eos> Uh, get one, and put that on mine.<eos> - That's kind of you, man.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - Oh, it's the least I can do.<eos> It's the least I can do, man.<eos> I figure you and Billy were-- you were like brothers, so that makes us like brothers, so...
You be sure and send her some flowers now, son.<eos> The point is, you left Phil breathing all those years ago, or it wouldn't be a problem now.<eos> The way I see it, it's your mess.<eos> But hey, I'm more into carrots than sticks, so... let's talk about your girls instead.<eos> Junior high by now, hmm?<eos> Family court judge by the name of Winthrop found himself "over-served" one evening a while back.<eos> And he dented up the front of his Prius with the skull of an address-free citizen.<eos> You might say I helped him sweep that up.<eos> And I know that he would fall all over himself doing me a favor in return.<eos> Like revising your custody deal, for instance, so you can see your daughters again.

You get your girls back.
You know what this is?<eos> You expect me to be impressed 'cause you didn't drink in jail?<eos> Dad! Come on!<eos> Look, see, this is complicated.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You say you've changed.<eos> Good.<eos> I hope it's true.<eos> I've prayed for it long enough.<eos> I'm happy you're home, and I love you, but you don't get extra points for doing what's simply required, what everybody else does.
Old friend.<eos> So how is he-<eos> - I mean, it's bad, huh?<eos> I'm a hospice worker.<eos> Yeah, well, he's a fighter.<eos> Charlotte?<eos> Thank you for taking care of my friend.<eos> You're gonna sit there with your stupid fuckin' shirt and tell me I can't see my own father?<eos> My kids can't go?<eos> He just wants you to call first, Junior, that's all.
- What?<eos> Where was the meeting you were at?<eos> - It's anonymous, Mom.<eos> We're not gonna do things like this.<eos> I'm telling you right now.<eos> - I'm doing everything I can!<eos> - All right, okay.<eos> I wish I could believe you, Joe, but you make it so hard.<eos> No.<eos> You make it so hard, because you don't want to believe in me.
Based on what?<eos> "New information" is all he would say.<eos> It's like he wanted to dangle it in front of my face.<eos> Fuckin' prick.<eos> Whatever Phil says he's got, it's smoke. He's fishing.<eos> He's got a hard-on for the Vasseys. Always has.<eos> There was talk about Junior, maybe he'd been around the tracks that night.<eos> But they could never back it up.<eos> It was what it was.<eos> A shitty accident, like you said.
This thing works pretty good, huh?<eos> Now, I didn't wake up in this mood.<eos> I was thinking, "Don't worry.<eos> My pal Joey will carry his water on this thing."<eos> But then I hear, uh, no.<eos> This Caldwell grand jury is, uh, in motion after all.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Did I tell you time was short?<eos> Did I tell you what was coming?<eos> And what did you do but fuck around.
Then I'll run.<eos> Well, that either.<eos> Do I need to recharge your battery?<eos> F-Fu- - I can't do Manny. I can't do Phil.<eos> You name a third way or get the fuck out.<eos> I just bought a new gas grill.<eos> Stainless steel.<eos> Got an infrared system on it.<eos> To be honest, I don't even know what that means.<eos> But if you think that I wouldn't buy some crackhead nigger for 500 bucks to come into your parents' house and slit their throat while they sleep... if it meant that I got to keep that grill, you got me mixed up with somebody else.
Good.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> - Getting you help.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> 'Cause... you were like a brother to Billy.<eos> That makes you like a brother to me, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> Except he didn't fall on any fucking train tracks, did he?<eos> Not the way they said.<eos> You... put him there.
'Cause... you were like a brother to Billy.<eos> That makes you like a brother to me, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> Except he didn't fall on any fucking train tracks, did he?<eos> Not the way they said.<eos> You... put him there.<eos> That's crazy, Scotty. Just--<eos> We're almost there, okay?<eos> Junior... told you to do it.<eos> And you did it.
You want it?<eos> - What are you doing with it?<eos> - I'm taking it to the girls.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> - I'm not trying to buy them.<eos> Just gonna give it to 'em.<eos> Most of it.<eos> See them once more, and then I'll just--<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You are going nowhere near those girls.
What? !<eos> There's a lady here to see you. Who is it?<eos> Joan Crawford.<eos> You're fucking kidding me.<eos> Bette.<eos> Lucille, what the hell brings you to the theater?<eos> Well, you, of course.<eos> Oh, you were wonderful tonight.<eos> You lit up the stage.<eos> I can't believe you didn't get better reviews.
With Mr. Gary Cooper.<eos> You do remember.<eos> You wanted to play the pretty young servant girl, and I was to play the old hag of a wife.<eos> Forget it.<eos> But this is different.<eos> These are the parts of a lifetime.<eos> No, thanks, Lucille.<eos> I've got plenty of better offers.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I know what kind of offers you've been getting.
Did you fuck Joan Crawford?<eos> No, I did not fuck her.<eos> Not that I didn't have ample opportunity.<eos> We all know what special relationship Joan has with her directors.<eos> Oh, come on, Bette.<eos> William Wyler?<eos> Oh, I see someone has been a good little boy and done all his homework.<eos> Bette, listen, here's the deal.<eos> Crawford's name on the marquee gets us distribution.<eos> I need her to get the picture made, but I need you to make the picture great.
I'll show them to you.<eos> And you know what else?<eos> I won that suit, I won it.<eos> And she was ordered to come back to work for me...<eos> She just wanted better parts, Jack.<eos> A say in her own destiny.<eos> Yeah, okay, fine.<eos> But because of her selfishness and her bullheadedness, the entire studio contract system came crashing down!<eos> The whole thing because of her!<eos> She's the one who put the crack in the levee, and you want me to work with her again?
Whoever gets there first gets top billing right underneath the caption in tomorrow's paper.<eos> Why, thank you, Lucille.<eos> How about one with the two of you signing your contracts?<eos> Oh, man, that's great.<eos> And one more.<eos> Get the car, Mamacita.<eos> Joan, you didn't sign the contract.<eos> You know, I expected more from you, Bob, I truly did, though why I don't know.<eos> Starting with my no-good father, who ran off with a stripper from Galveston, to Louis B. Mayer, I have been lied to and cheated on by men my entire life.<eos> I don't know why you should be any different.
And it's the one thing I've never gotten.<eos> It took me until Mildred Pierce to be taken seriously as an actress.<eos> And when I won my Oscar, do you think I received any congratulatory notes or bouquets?<eos> No.<eos> But I did.<eos> From men.<eos> Men whose admiration I already had and whose respect I never craved.<eos> But not the women. None of the bitches in this town.<eos> Least of all Queen Bitch, who always thought she was better than me, more talented than me.<eos> You admire her.
You have a perfect face for the movies, Miss Crawford.<eos> There are no bad angles.<eos> Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> Look, just give me a chance to talk to her.<eos> We can work this out...<eos> Are you talking about me?<eos> No. Yeah.<eos> I'm just offering some ideas.<eos> Don't tell me how to play my character before I've even shot a scene.<eos> I have done a lot of hard work and preparation, and you are just trying to throw me.
Just wait.<eos> Now, I just think there are too many words in this section, Bob.<eos> God, I miss the silent pictures.<eos> Christ!<eos> She can't be serious.<eos> Hello, Daddy.<eos> All right, all right!<eos> Everybody back to work!<eos> Action.<eos> Blanche, you aren't ever gonna sell this house.
Christ!<eos> She can't be serious.<eos> Hello, Daddy.<eos> All right, all right!<eos> Everybody back to work!<eos> Action.<eos> Blanche, you aren't ever gonna sell this house.<eos> And you aren't ever gonna leave it...<eos> And... action.<eos> Blanche, you aren't ever gonna sell this house.
Everybody back to work!<eos> Action.<eos> Blanche, you aren't ever gonna sell this house.<eos> And you aren't ever gonna leave it...<eos> And... action.<eos> Blanche, you aren't ever gonna sell this house.<eos> And you aren't ever gonna leave it. Bob, isn't that lighting unnecessarily harsh?<eos> Oh, we haven't balanced the footage yet, Joan.<eos> Don't worry. Don't worry about it.<eos> Blanche, you aren't ever gonna sell this house.
I take it that's not Pepsi-Cola.<eos> Vodka. 100 proof.<eos> I say if you're going to drink, drink something you like.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Dining room's through there.<eos> I hope you gals brought your appetites.<eos> It's an ambush.<eos> She's out for blood.<eos> You gonna give it to her?<eos> Are you?
Wh...<eos> Oh, Joan, I-I don't have time to recast. We're shooting tomorrow.<eos> I have co-star approval. She's not a co-star.<eos> That's right.<eos> And she never will be.<eos> What?<eos> You wanted to see me? Yeah.<eos> Forget the little daily gifts, Lucille.<eos> I'm going to be much too busy working to shop for anything in return.<eos> Whatever you say. Only let's not fight.
I'm going to be blunt, Bette.<eos> Aldrich is a lady-killer.<eos> He likes young blondes.<eos> The cookie that's playing the neighbor.<eos> I saw her. She's no threat.<eos> Well, not now, of course.<eos> But what happens when he starts sleeping with her?<eos> Suddenly she has more lines and scenes than you do.<eos> Now, I've asked him to replace her with someone less showy, less likely to pull focus, but he refused.<eos> Course, you have more scenes with her than I do, so... perhaps I'm being out of line.
You know, maybe Warner's got the right idea.<eos> He wants to leak some dirt to the gossip columns, you know, get a little catfight going.<eos> Bob, that's terrible.<eos> Well, it could get a lot of pre-release publicity that way.<eos> Anyway, pitting them against each other might be just the way to control them.<eos> Bob, don't you dare. It's too cruel.<eos> They need to feel secure and supported.<eos> But not by each other. I can support 'em both.<eos> Well, don't fool yourself.<eos> Even you're not man enough to satisfy two women.
Oh, Roger, hi.<eos> Nancy, you look beautiful.<eos> Barbara, how are you?<eos> Hello, Bob.<eos> And let me just say again what a thrill it is for me to be directing these two legends of the screen. Mm.<eos> Really, Bob?<eos> - That's it?<eos> - That's it.<eos> I'll leave it up to you to spruce up the adjectives.<eos> Oh, I think you've got me confused with Adela Rogers St. Johns.
I came here for red meat, not pabulum.<eos> No one wants to read about how those two battle-axes make nice with each other.<eos> Well, what can I tell you, Hedda?<eos> They're both consummate professionals.<eos> You know who you remind me of?<eos> Not John Ford.<eos> Now, there's a man who commands not only a movie set, but his own press.<eos> He knows how to play the game.<eos> Which is why he's as vital now as he was before talkies.<eos> Where are you, Bob?
Sylvia.<eos> Fuck off, Sylvia.<eos> Oh!<eos> Come on.<eos> Go to my room and read a goddamn book.<eos> Come in.<eos> Let's have a little talk.<eos> I'd love that.<eos> Although I know you prefer chewing the fat with gossip columnists.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
I'd love that.<eos> Although I know you prefer chewing the fat with gossip columnists.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Louella Parsons, today.<eos> You're quoted on the record, Lucille.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> That.<eos> Let me just cut through the movie star bullshit you cling to when the waters get too deep for you to stay afloat and explain something to you.<eos> I can't wait to hear.<eos> You seem to have forgotten that the unflattering makeup I'm wearing in this picture is a choice designed to create a character.
- No, you don't need that. You know the words. - Ugh...<eos> You need your hands,<eos> Jane is open.<eos> Big, theatrical gestures.<eos> Remember, she's vaudeville.<eos> You got plans for dinner?<eos> I feel like I owe you something for having you cool your heels all morning.<eos> I promised Harriet I'd take her to Perino's.<eos> Bring her.<eos> I want you to take all the costumes and just lay them out in the dressing room and that way, I can go through them and determine which... I said, okay, how about...
Who the hell do you think it is, Joan?<eos> It's Bob, you called me here.<eos> No, I thought for a moment maybe Peter had come home.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry about Peter, Joan.<eos> You know what I'm sorry about?<eos> I'm sorry I gave up a wonderful relationship with a man who truly cherished me, a doctor no less, for you and this picture.<eos> Really, it's just too much.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You know goddamn well what I'm talking about.<eos> You and Davis, cavorting behind my back.
Weekend rehearsals my ass.<eos> How long have you been sleeping with her?<eos> I'm not sleeping with her.<eos> I won't be made a fool of.<eos> I'm out, but don't worry,<eos> I won't stand in your way.<eos> I'm sure Warner will let you recast.<eos> We're not recasting, Joan.<eos> This picture's only happening because of you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you remember that.
That'll be all for now.<eos> No, Sven's staying put.<eos> I want this young man to bear witness.<eos> He should know whose carcass it is he's been handling, and just how many others in this town could identify it in the dark.<eos> That column has already been written.<eos> "Joan Crawford's Early, Tawdry Years."<eos> And it's been locked away in my desk drawer since 1946, the last time you went to Louella behind my back.<eos> Oh, I told you then, Hedda, I didn't go to Louella about my divorce from Philip.<eos> No, she came to me.<eos> And you confirmed it.
Come on, I need a drink.<eos> All right.<eos> Look at this, Hedda.<eos> All of this could be gone in an instant, everything I've worked for my entire life.<eos> I mean, where, at my age, am I going to find another rich man to save me?<eos> You've never needed a man.<eos> Neither one of us have.<eos> And yet we've always been at their mercy.<eos> - Hmm. - At least I have.<eos> You don't know how lucky you are, Hedda, that being an actress didn't work out for you, that you were never a star.

I'd smack you across the face for that if your braces hadn't cost a fortune.<eos> You're jealous because men don't look at you anymore and they look at me.<eos> You can't take it that your turn is over, so you're punishing me.<eos> What a joke.<eos> For years when I was growing up, all I ever heard from you was "Christ, when is that old buzzard<eos> "Claudette Colbert gonna retire?<eos> When is Norma Shearer gonna realize the ship has sailed?"<eos> I am not going to apologize for having ambition!<eos> I am not going to apologize for being a working mother who has to have opportunities so she can put food on the table for her family.<eos> You know what those women had that you don't, mother? Dignity.

I am not gonna fire him.<eos> I don't want you to fire him.<eos> I don't want you to fire him. I don't know what I want.<eos> Bette, listen.<eos> I understand everything you said.<eos> You've had a brilliant career.<eos> Me, I'm still on the B-list.<eos> I'm working like a dog to keep a roof over my family's head.<eos> I missed my kids growing up, and my wife now wants to give me the heave-ho.<eos> At least you've got an Oscar. Two.

Two.<eos> Two.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> I think maybe we both mucked things up.<eos> Oh, you haven't mucked up anything.
Sir, this area is off limits.<eos> Sir?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Sir, I'll need you to come with me.<eos> Eric!<eos> Are you armed?<eos> Shoot it!<eos> Have you been injured?<eos> You seem sound.<eos> Who are you?
He got away because of the glow.<eos> Right, the glow.<eos> I didn't make it up.<eos> Look, if you're looking for psych evalu...<eos> I didn't make it up.<eos> Sir, you know I'm not one for crazy stories.<eos> Okay?<eos> I saw someone who wasn't human do something impossible.<eos> And you saw.<eos> Eric's face. Look, I believe you think you saw something.
I, too, have left the confines of Sleepy Hollow, and... yet again, my eyes are opened to a plain fact.<eos> I'm out of my element.<eos> But I remain hopeful.<eos> I have found new allies.<eos> Although they may need to work on their trust issues.<eos> The condition of the victim's body was the same as Eric's, and he had a puncture wound at the base of his skull.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Is the basis of our partnership to be suspicion and doubt?<eos> This is not a partnership, this is a temporary alliance.<eos> And you have a history of running.
I'm sorry.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Now, look here, Mr...<eos> Jake.<eos> Yeah, not "Mr. Jake," just Jake.<eos> Damn, not again.<eos> Alex!<eos> You said you weren't gonna set things off anymore.<eos> I said I wouldn't set things off while you were in the room.<eos> You weren't in the room.
They're most intrepid in the face of the unknown.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier.<eos> Cell service in the Himalayas is spotty.<eos> Tell me, were your travels productive?<eos> I had some really good yak cheese.<eos> And I learned a lot about Tibetan concepts of soul migration. But as far as tracking the next Witness...<eos> She's really gone, isn't she?<eos> Yes, I'm afraid she is.<eos> If a new Witness is out there, you two will find each other sooner or later.<eos> In fact, there's a chance that you already have and don't know it.

We're still keeping tabs on Crane. Good.<eos> Good, good, good.<eos> We're gonna need him back soon.<eos> Shouldn't we just grab him now?<eos> Now? Oh.<eos> It's not quite time.<eos> And time is the most important resource of all, because time is the one thing you can't buy.<eos> Anything else can be had if you're willing to put in the work.<eos> Anything.<eos> : I finished the ceremony while you were away.
Please, Jimmy...<eos> Whatever you think of me, whatever colorful names you're calling me in your head right now, please understand I'm trying to help you.<eos> Here's what's going to happen.<eos> The police will arrest you, and I'm sorry, but I will be pressing charges.<eos> I told you there would be consequences.<eos> But I have to believe that you'll face those consequences and you'll come out the other side a better man.<eos> I know it's hard to see right now, but, Jimmy, this is an opportunity.<eos> That's why I'm doing this. Not to punish you. To show you, truly show you, that you have to make a change before it's too late.<eos> Before you destroy yourself... or someone else.<eos> And I believe you can change.
This way.<eos> Hey, speaking of... they, uh, still trying to replace you over there?<eos> Arms out.<eos> How's, uh, Omar?<eos> Why? You looking to make a change?<eos> Well, leave all this glamour behind?<eos> Hey, who do you think's gonna catch this?<eos> Eh, it depends on who's available when it comes in.<eos> - Face me.<eos> - You think you might be available?
It's pretty late.<eos> Chances are, you're spending the night.<eos> You, uh, gonna be okay?<eos> Beats the back of a nail salon.<eos> I do not doubt that, my friend.<eos> Oh, pick the biggest guy. Punch him as hard as you can, okay?<eos> Show dominance.<eos> Right. Got it.<eos> Dominance.<eos> You, uh, do know how to throw a punch, right?
"They"?<eos> Not you?<eos> Prosecuting your case? Nah, man.<eos> It's not me.<eos> You never catch a lucky break, do ya?<eos> - Bad timing?<eos> - No, conflicted out.<eos> Conflicted out?<eos> I mean, I figured that'd happen.<eos> You and I have wheeled and dealed together too many times.
It's not what I expected.<eos> Bad not what you expected?<eos> It's just that...<eos> It's different.<eos> She's offering me Pre-Prosecution Diversion.<eos> Seriously?<eos> A PPD?<eos> That's great, Jimmy.<eos> Best I could hope for, right?<eos> Right. What does she want you to confess to?
He's waiting in the office.<eos> I know where he is.<eos> Don Hector.<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> Don Hector, mine is a cartel business, but it is mine.<eos> And it is legitimate.<eos> My employees are civilians.<eos> Your actions here today have endangered them, my interests, and those of the cartel.<eos> I am the cartel.<eos> And from now on, you are my mule.
All right.<eos> If you ever need anything from my end...<eos> Hasta luego.<eos> May we talk?<eos> You can park it over there.<eos> You sent back the payment we agreed upon.<eos> What I did, I didn't do for you.<eos> The man.<eos> The one killed for helping the truck driver.<eos> If I may make an observation... Perhaps you are trying to correct something which cannot be corrected.
I was wrong.<eos> Mr. McGill, could you at least look your brother in the eye?<eos> Chuck...<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I lost my temper, and I did some things... so many things that I regret.<eos> I shouldn't have broken down your door.<eos> Doesn't matter how I was provoked.<eos> I-I shouldn't have done that. There's no excuse for that.<eos> Or for the things that I said.<eos> I regret it all, all of it more than you can imagine, because... 'cause you're my brother, and no one should treat his own brother like that.
There's no way you were gonna let him destroy the only copy of that tape, so you made a duplicate...<eos> - it's the first thing you did.<eos> - Kim... this is not how we do discovery.<eos> Actually, Jimmy destroyed the duplicate.<eos> Ah, it's fine, Howard.<eos> The original is under lock and key, and in due time, it will be put into evidence for your review.<eos> So, of course, file whatever motions you'd like. - It's your privilege.<eos> - I will.<eos> Count on it.<eos> But, Kim, you should be aware... because I believe this will be your first disciplinary hearing... uh, the Bar Association's standard of proof is far more lenient than what you're used to.
Oh, it's nice.<eos> Atmospheric.<eos> I mean, I still can't get over Jimmy being a lawyer.<eos> Neither can I.<eos> He's got his own shingle out and everything.<eos> I mean, a real, responsible citizen.<eos> I mean, who woulda thought?<eos> Mm. This place is the same.<eos> I mean, i-i would've thought you'd Change things up. Move things around.<eos> You've got great taste.
Did you finally get to see salzburg?<eos> Not yet, but next month, after Vienna.<eos> Do you remember when we tried to go to salzburg?<eos> And that crazy old lady on the scooter...<eos> Oh, yes! Yes!<eos> ...Chased us out of the train station.<eos> Yeah!<eos> And then, um -- and then we went and got, uh, it was a-a-a raspberry linzer torte in innsbruck?<eos> To make ourselves feel better? Mm.<eos> You said, "we'll never finish this!"
Just tell her what's going on. No.<eos> No.<eos> She'll understand.<eos> She'll -- would you rather she think you're a raging prick than know the truth?<eos> No.<eos> Look, if you won't tell her, then I will.<eos> No, no.<eos> No!<eos> You will not tell her.<eos> You... Will not tell her.
Believe me, uh, we're happy to get this one off the docket.<eos> Not as happy as we are.<eos> Again, great job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Ladies, dinner's on me.<eos> Kim, I knew you were good, but i didn't know you were this good.<eos> Oh, I'm glad you're happy.<eos> We couldn't have done it without you.<eos> And I hope you realize this means a whole lot a work comin' your way.
No, I do.<eos> I'm the only person who can adequately explain the context of that tape.<eos> Otherwise, the defense'll tear it to shreds.<eos> It's already a solid case.<eos> We have Jimmy's statement from the pre-prosecution diversion. There's my testimony and the private eye's.<eos> Maybe there's no need to put you through the wringer like this.<eos> This isn't about me or my health.<eos> This is about PR.<eos> We lost a client.<eos> That happened because, while you were...
He has good in him. But the law is too important.<eos> Ah.<eos> Be right there, Howard!<eos> The law is too important.<eos> Jimmy: I sure shit wouldn't be tellin' ya otherwise.<eos> But,yes...<eos> It'sthetruth.<eos> Chuck: You'd go to such lengths tohumiliateme ?<eos> Ididit forKim !<eos> She worked her butt off togetmesaverde while you and Howard sat around sipping scotch and chortling.
It causes me great pain.<eos> However, I'm perfectly lucid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. mcgill, I have only one more question for you.<eos> Do you hate your brother?<eos> I love my brother.<eos> There's nothing malicious in Jimmy.<eos> He has a way of doing the worst things for reasons that sound almost noble.<eos> But what I know for sure is that the law is too important to be toyed with.<eos> It's mankind's greatest achievement -- the rule of law, the idea that, no matter who you are, your actions have consequences.
Please be brief, counselor.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> She'll be here.<eos> Do you have anything for cross?<eos> Uh, can I look at your notes?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Can we, um... Yeah.<eos> -Hey.<eos> -Hey.<eos> So glad you made it.
I want you to stay.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't seem happy to see me.<eos> I am.<eos> Just surprised, that's all.<eos> Please, stay.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes, I'm sure.<eos> You've been sold a bill of goods, Rebecca.<eos> I want you to see what's what.
You know, she's gonna hate you when this is over.<eos> Yep.<eos> All right, uh, Mr. mcgill, I'll remind you you're still under oath.<eos> I understand.<eos> At this time, I'd like to turn cross-examination over to my co-counsel, James mcgill.<eos> Uh, well, there's been a lot of fuss about it, but you and I have never really talked about this tape you made.<eos> We lost the opportunity when you burglarized my house to destroy it.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Um, and I was in the wrong there.<eos> But, still, I'd like to try and follow your story of why and how you recorded it.
Yeah, I do.<eos> Earlier, you talked about other diseases.<eos> Physical conditions, you said.<eos> Uh, so, okay, if you'd had, um - - I don't know -- lung cancer, would you have told Rebecca then?<eos> If that had been the case, maybe.<eos> I might have.<eos> So how is this different?<eos> Mr. mcgill.<eos> Move it along.<eos> You don't have to answer that. I want to get down to brass tacks.
We didn't formally meet earlier. - Right.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, I-I was, uh, just at Chuck's, and he won't answer the door.<eos> I-I was out there knocking for almost an hour.<eos> That sounds like Chuck.<eos> I'm sure he's fine.<eos> He's just being dramatic.<eos> Oh, well, I think it's a little bit more than that.<eos> I want you to come with me to get him to let us in.
Well, they need someone who knows how to pour concrete.<eos> And the slide and the swings need something called footings, I think.<eos> Sweetheart, that's not really my department.<eos> Sure it is, Pop.<eos> You built a carport when Matty was a kid.<eos> I did?<eos> Yeah. He told me about it a bunch of times.<eos> He said that when you were pricing it out, you thought that all the people who gave you quotes were crooks, so you decided to do it yourself.<eos> And you let Matty write his initials in the wet cement.<eos> Pop, the way he talked about you, it was like you... hung the moon.
I almost let one of my ads run today.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I know, but can you believe this?<eos> I've got nine airings left.<eos> I'm out 4,000 bucks.<eos> I guess... you have to find a local business and try to sell 'em your time.<eos> - What else can you do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This pile of garbage explicitly states I'm not allowed to resell.<eos> You're a lawyer.
It's a huge client!<eos> I looked into it, and breaking the lease will cost a hell of a lot less than 10 months' rent.<eos> No, we didn't go through all this just to give up everything after one day of suspension.<eos> One day!<eos> It's not everything.<eos> It's an office.<eos> Four walls and a door.<eos> Why waste money on something w-we don't need?<eos> As... as far as I'm concerned, nothing's changed, all right?<eos> I'll hold up my end, you hold up yours. 50-50.
- Jalisco.<eos> I want... a new way to get my stuff over the border.<eos> A legitimate business.<eos> Right. But the chicken man...<eos> Temporary.<eos> I want a new front...<eos> My own.<eos> Don Hector, my father is a simple man.<eos> He is not in the business.<eos> You will teach him.
Previously on AMC's "Better Call Saul"...<eos> I want a new front.<eos> My father is a simple man.<eos> You will teach him.<eos> Tonight, I celebrate with the world's best attorney.<eos> Have you given any thought to what you're gonna do for the next year?<eos> I'm out 4,000 bucks.<eos> So you're gonna keep paying for half a law office even though you're not practicing law?<eos> I'll hold up my end, you hold up yours.
I don't know...<eos> Tell him you can't get what he needs.<eos> I already ordered them.<eos> I mean, the shipment gets here in two days.<eos> He knows.<eos> Then make up an excuse.<eos> Fine. $3,000.<eos> - I'll give you $3,000.<eos> - I'm not interested.<eos> And you find a way out of it.
And you find a way out of it.<eos> But...<eos> Not interested!<eos> Look... full disclosure.<eos> When you told us about the disciplinary hearing, I admit it... I had concerns.<eos> So, just so you know, I had to do my due diligence.<eos> I read the transcripts.<eos> All of them.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> What you did to Charles... you and James set him up perfectly.
I didn't mean to speak to you that way.<eos> Kim.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> At all.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> There's no excuse for talking to you like that.<eos> I know how hard you've been working on this.<eos> Please, I've forgotten about it already.<eos> You should, too.
I'm in.<eos> Hey, let's get outta here.<eos> What?<eos> Get out where?<eos> I am up to my neck in Mesa Verde.<eos> I can't. - C'mon, we're going.<eos> Up. - No, I can't.<eos> - Na-ah!<eos> Nope. Nothing...<eos> - Jimmy... nothing you can do to stop this.
He took 3 points.<eos> He's a fool.<eos> Look, is it wrong...<eos> Whoa. Hey, hey, this guy over here.<eos> Yeah, he wants everyone to know what a big spender he is.<eos> I got every dollar the guy owns.<eos> We're here to meet a celebrity who's donating to my charity.<eos> Kevin Costner.<eos> I-I will go stand in that corner.<eos> You point me out... you're meeting Kevin Costner.
Hector keeps the pills in his coat pocket.<eos> When he hangs up his coat, I'll make the switch.<eos> He goes down.<eos> Then what?<eos> His heart goes out.<eos> That's it. A lot of eyes on Salamanca.<eos> You do this, how are you gonna stop them from finding out it was you?<eos> Are you tryin' to tell me not to do this?<eos> I'm not tellin' you anything.<eos> Just want to make sure you know what you're getting into.
Continuing notes from Gatwood Oil meeting.<eos> Contact rights holders, begin scheduling.<eos> Howard!<eos> - What are you doing here, Jimmy?<eos> - We have business to discuss.<eos> Is this about Chuck?<eos> Who?<eos> If you actually have business, then call my secretary.<eos> I did.<eos> She stonewalled me, as if you didn't know.
_<eos> Okay, and I'm still waiting for those third-party subpoenas.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Let me know, then.<eos> - Thanks, Francis.<eos> - All right.<eos> Julie, what's up?<eos> From Chuck.<eos> It came via messenger...<eos> the instructions say he wants you to read it as soon as possible.
It's just so...<eos> - It's so cruel. - Mnh. And I don't even know why.<eos> I think, uh... maybe I do.<eos> You do?<eos> Could it be the settlement?<eos> I mean, maybe they... want the money, you know, to improve their lives?<eos> I had no idea any of them needed money.<eos> No one said anything to me.<eos> Well, maybe it's not about the money itself. I mean... hello... who wouldn't want more money?<eos> I mean, maybe it's the idea that they don't think you're considering them, you know?
Don't get bogged down in the details!<eos> Trust me... they're settling!<eos> Wow, that... - Yeah. Yeah!<eos> - That's great, then.<eos> So, hey, let's celebrate.<eos> I can tell that you... pulled another all-nighter here, you know?<eos> You... you got to stop and smell the roses.<eos> Hey, who's got two thumbs, a bottle of Zafiro, and 20% of the common fund? ! - Huh?<eos> - This guy!<eos> I know... you do.
- Excellent!<eos> - I know.<eos> Oh, here's your partner.<eos> Hey, get him into make-up, and we can carve this turkey.<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen.<eos> Ex-excuse me. Not now.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I just got off the phone with the station.<eos> You don't even work for them. I never said I work for the station.
Look, Howard, you were very generous when I left HHM, but it never sat right with me that you covered my law-school loans.<eos> It seemed to sit right at the time.<eos> I appreciate the gift, but now that I'm able to afford it, - I want to pay you back.<eos> - Oh, you "appreciate the gift"?<eos> - Yes, I do, Howard.<eos> - You know what I'm doing in there?<eos> Take a guess.<eos> I'm doing damage control.<eos> And I'm doing it three meals a day for the past two weeks with every one of our clients.<eos> I'm busting my ass, trying to repair the reputation of the firm after you and Jimmy dragged it through the mud.
I'm saying...<eos> I could cover our expenses for a while.<eos> - Kim, you got the cash in your hand.<eos> - Yeah, I know, but...<eos> - So why are we talking about this?<eos> - All I'm saying is... I looked at the numbers, and I can carry us.<eos> Not forever, but at least until you're back to 100%.<eos> I appreciate the thought, but no.<eos> I'll do what I have to do to take care of my half.<eos> You do what you have to do to take care of yours.
Yeah. What are you... a narc?<eos> I'm the guy who's gonna get you out of here - and let you keep your hours.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How you gonna do that?<eos> Lemme worry about the how, okay?<eos> You just... 700 bucks, and you're gone.<eos> No, I don't have 700 bucks.<eos> Hey, you got a couple grand in your sock.<eos> 700 bucks. And you can get me outta here?
You got a house?<eos> A pension?<eos> Kiss it all goodbye.<eos> Look, out here, you might be King Douche-nozzle, but in court, you are little people.<eos> Look, the judge and I... we'll gladly spend the next five years in the courtroom. But for you, it's expensive.<eos> It's very, very expensive.<eos> It's third-mortgage expensive.<eos> So...<eos> I'm offering you a simple choice.<eos> You can go to your wife. You can explain to her you're about to lose your job, your pension, and whatever pinhole of a reputation you've got at the bowling alley on Glow-ball Sundays, or let my friend here visit his sick daughter in the hospital,
Get outta here.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> That was some Jedi mind shit right there!<eos> The best $700 I done ever spent.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yo, I'm on my way.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I've got a problem I think you can help me with.
Here you go.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yo, I'm on my way.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I've got a problem I think you can help me with.<eos> I've got cash I can't spend.<eos> About $200,000.<eos> If anything happens to me, my family'll never see it.<eos> Now, it seems to me you opened this place to solve a similar problem.
What happened Friday night was wonderful, but it can't happen again.<eos> Oh, Betty, you don't know how happy I am to hear you say that.<eos> I was looking at Harriet this morning, and I thought,<eos> "Oh, this... this can't happen again." You're right.<eos> I agree with you completely.<eos> Good.<eos> But did you have to agree so quickly?<eos> What's all this?<eos> Oh, cannon fodder.<eos> Possible replacements for the girl that you and Crawford had me can.
- But she'll know it came from me.<eos> - How?<eos> Anyone on that set could've complained about her offensive body odor.<eos> But nobody works under those lights in such close contact as I do.<eos> She'll know.<eos> Well, I'll be damned.<eos> Joan Crawford, Miss Crystal Allen herself, is actually losing her nerve.<eos> No, it's just that I think I am beginning to understand her a little bit.<eos> I mean, she's a single mother working in Hollywood.<eos> I don't think you can begin to appreciate, Hedda, just how tough that can be.
Where's your wheelchair?<eos> It's on the set, of course.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're gonna need it after I break your goddamn legs.<eos> Where do you get off telling Hopper that you're gonna be in the Best Actress category and I've decided to be in Supporting?<eos> - It was your idea. - What?<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Well, now, she'd had a bit to drink... that's true... but she seemed lucid and certainly sincere.<eos> You said you didn't care about awards, that you wanted to support me.<eos> And you took that to mean that I would go into Supporting and hand you Lead Actress?
We're both leads.<eos> Ladies, why are we fighting about the Oscars?<eos> We haven't even finished making this movie yet.<eos> Can we please concentrate on the matter at hand?<eos> There's room for both of you to succeed.<eos> In this town?<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> Fuck off, Bob.<eos> And it was Gloria Swanson who was robbed in 1950, not you, bitch!<eos> Well, boss, it looks like... you got yourself another war picture after all.

Okay?
No, she's not.<eos> Try as if you were talking... to your best friend.<eos> She should be billed as B.D. Merrill, not Davis.<eos> Julie says that sister is... A little louder.<eos> What?<eos> That's her name.<eos> He adopted her.<eos> Legally.<eos> You know, Julie says that sister is kind of peculiar.<eos> - Did you ever notice that?
Legally.<eos> You know, Julie says that sister is kind of peculiar.<eos> - Did you ever notice that?<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> What should I say to her? Well, she's your kid.<eos> You're not going to tell her she stinks on ice.<eos> You'll... You'll lie to her.<eos> Don't they ever have company?<eos> I mean, it must be awful.<eos> Well, I think you're good.
Once you sting, you die.<eos> But not the queen.<eos> Oh, come on, Bette.<eos> All those ridiculous studio press releases touting how wonderfully well you two have been getting along?<eos> It's hogwash.<eos> I happen to know every single nasty thing you've done to Crawford over the last six weeks.<eos> Kicking a woman in the head?<eos> Academy members don't reward that sort of behavior.<eos> I mean, regardless of what we think of Crawford, she is an institution.<eos> Or belongs in one if she really thinks you're her friend.
But that's on the screen.<eos> This is real life.<eos> Real life?<eos> This isn't real life.<eos> This is Hollywood, Hedda.<eos> It's all fake, from the manicured lawns in the desert to your manufactured concern.<eos> Well, I am concerned.<eos> I so wanted to write a story about how two of Hollywood's golden titans were getting along. As an example to ladies everywhere.<eos> But I am a truth teller. I must report the facts, regardless of how ugly they may be.<eos> You have been circling this project like a vulture from the start.
Jane, I... I'm dying.<eos> There's no time.<eos> You must listen.<eos> I made you waste your whole life, thinking you'd crippled me.<eos> Please stop.<eos> You didn't do it, Jane.<eos> I did it myself.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> I crippled myself.<eos> You weren't driving that night.
Don't you understand?<eos> I crippled myself.<eos> You weren't driving that night.<eos> You were too drunk, I wouldn't let you drive.<eos> I made you go open the gates.<eos> I watched you get out of the car.<eos> You'd been so cruel to me at the party, imitating me, making people laugh at me.<eos> I watched you get out of the car. I wanted to run you down.<eos> Crush you.<eos> But you saw the car coming.
That explains why I've been shunted to the junior leagues.<eos> No offense.<eos> None taken.<eos> Don't give up the ghost, Miss Davis.<eos> Worst case, the movie bombs and people forget all about it.<eos> You'll be back.<eos> Well, I'm sure once the picture opens, there'll be no end of offers.<eos> And we'll be here to field them.<eos> Fuck you, Marty.<eos> If I have to find my own projects and wait for you to field offers instead of drumming them up,

We're in hoc up to our eyeballs.<eos> If Baby Jane goes down, so do we.<eos> Is it not good?<eos> Honestly, I can't tell anymore.<eos> Well, we knew it was a gamble from the start.<eos> If we have to sell the house, we'll sell the house.<eos> Yeah, what about the kids?<eos> We'll sell them, too.<eos> But I think we'll get more for the house.<eos> You don't have to go down with the ship, you know.
That's good.<eos> May I come in?<eos> ♪ What a town without pity can do... ♪ It's called The Black Slipper.<eos> It's written just for Joan.<eos> She'd play a choreographer falsely accused of shoving a principal dancer off a catwalk.<eos> She gets locked up for murder, pushed around by some hard-bitten convict broads.<eos> Then she's proven innocent and whisked from her cell to dance the dead girl's role on stage.<eos> It's a story about the irrepressible human sprit.<eos> You want to leave the script for Miss Crawford?<eos> You're Joan's right-hand lady.
You think I'm crazy?<eos> I think this is a marvelous idea.<eos> You do?<eos> This is America.<eos> No one can tell you you're crazy.<eos> In Werdohl, you know how you must live when you are born.<eos> Born to a shoemaker, you must make shoes.<eos> Born a girl, you must be a mother.<eos> Here, you decide.<eos> There is opportunity to become anything you want.
At the preview for Kiss Me Deadly, the canisters got switched.<eos> The atomic bomb went off in the second act.<eos> I hear this one bombs in the first.<eos> Just eat your goddamned sandwich.<eos> Well, it's time to face the music, Mamacita.<eos> All right, Blanche Hudson!<eos> Miss big, fat movie star!<eos> Miss rotten, stinking actress!<eos> Blanche.<eos> You aren't ever gonna sell this house.
It's one review, Joan.<eos> The notices have been uniformly good. Oh, good.<eos> Oh, there've been raves.<eos> But they're all about her.<eos> Listen.<eos> "A brilliant tour-de-force."<eos> "A brave and naked portrayal."<eos> "You won't be able to take your eyes off Miss Davis."<eos> She has the critics, so what?<eos> You have the audience.

No, Jack.<eos> No more "B" horror movies.<eos> I'm capable of so much more. I'm back now.<eos> I want to show people what I can really do.<eos> Wh-What, like your Oscar-winning masterpiece?<eos> Why not?<eos> Well...<eos> How about because that's never gonna happen?<eos> I mean, what do you think, you're like a big star director all of a sudden, Bob?<eos> I mean, no offense, but you're a journeyman.

You can hear the voices of doubt.<eos> Pick up a bottle, and suddenly the party starts all over again.<eos> Pain goes away.<eos> Get her.<eos> Well, look who's here. - If it isn't Jack Warn...<eos> - What is this shit about you not wanting to promote the picture?<eos> Jesus Christ, Joan.<eos> I already have a cross-country tour announced for the two of you.<eos> I'm not traveling with that woman.<eos> Besides, why should I promote your picture when you won't return the favor?
- It wasn't cute when you were 45, and it sure as hell isn't cute now.<eos> - You know what? - What?<eos> You were never in my corner.<eos> All these years, you always thought Davis had more talent than I did.<eos> She does.<eos> She can act rings around you.<eos> But your ass is nice and your tits aren't sagging, so...<eos> - Get out of my house. - Okay.<eos> You don't want to do this tour, that's fine.<eos> But when those nominations come out, I want you to be shaking hands and sucking cocks, even if you yourself are not nominated.

So you finally deigned to pick up, huh?<eos> I had just walked in the... Joan?<eos> Please stop referring to me as an old broad, or I'll have to consult my lawyer.<eos> And it impairs my ability to secure future work.<eos> The only thing impairing your ability is a fifth of vodka.<eos> This is sad, Joan.<eos> I'm sad for you.<eos> - For me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Jesus Christ, we're a goddamned bona fide hit, and you're incapable of enjoying it.

I wrote it for Joan.<eos> When the hell did you find the time to do that?<eos> Well, if it's something you care about, you get up early, right?<eos> I didn't know you were a writer.<eos> I'm also a director.<eos> At least, I think I am.<eos> No, I-I am.<eos> Uh, Pauline, I'm lost.<eos> I wrote it to give myself a picture to direct, Bob.<eos> You said you couldn't have done Baby Jane without me. That is what you said.
So then you will read it and you would consider producing?<eos> Why do you sound so surprised?<eos> Because some men find it off-putting, imagining a woman in charge.<eos> Really?<eos> What men?<eos> Oh, your friends at the old folks' home?<eos> It's a new world, Pauline.<eos> Thank you, Bob.<eos> I will not forget this.<eos> Well, since you're in charge now, why don't I let you tell Sinatra where he can put this?
- And it didn't.<eos> - No, it didn't.<eos> And I'm still not getting any offers.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're doing Perry Mason.<eos> It's television.<eos> There's no shame in doing television.<eos> Says the man who just signed Sinatra and Dean Martin to a multimillion-dollar Western romp.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> It's disgraceful how you and Joan aren't getting the credit you deserve.

I'm gonna have to kick it open, the way I always have.<eos> I found a script.<eos> I want you to direct.
- We're still rolling.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Okay, going again.<eos> And... action.<eos> - "You don't leave me much choice." - I know the line, - you stupid bitch!<eos> ROBERT:<eos> All right, - all right, that's out of bounds. Out of bounds?<eos> !<eos> Who the fuck do you think you are, out of bounds? !<eos> You're nobody.
Do you think I have the potential for greatness?<eos> No.<eos> Honey, get Frank.<eos> He took a jet to New York, Pop.<eos> What?<eos> H-He said to shoot around him.<eos> What is this, Bob?<eos> Sinatra's notes, which I invite you to stuff into a Molotov cocktail.<eos> No, this was my script.<eos> I worked on this for months, and you used it for scrap paper.
Sinatra's notes, which I invite you to stuff into a Molotov cocktail.<eos> No, this was my script.<eos> I worked on this for months, and you used it for scrap paper.<eos> You even read it?<eos> Well, I-I needed something to write on, Pauline.<eos> It's not like I tossed it out.<eos> No, you just told me to "stuff it into a Molotov cocktail."<eos> Pauline!<eos> I'm drowning here. I'm underwater.<eos> And you're asking me to move a mountain for you.
I thought about the ones I destroyed.<eos> The reds, the queers, the whores, the cheaters and dopeheads.<eos> The ones who cursed me, sued me, offed themselves.<eos> And I felt... good.<eos> That I'd contributed to our moral economy.<eos> And so you have.<eos> You have been nothing short of a bulwark against the tide of smut crashing over this culture.<eos> But I can't stop it lapping at your door.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Somebody's been shopping a stag picture in which you allegedly appeared, in your youth.
It's about your last hit. What?<eos> I think the fact that Bob Aldrich had his biggest success with a woman's picture, well, I think it's knocked you off-balance.<eos> Ah, Harriet...<eos> You have to stop moping around the house.<eos> It's not good for you.<eos> It's time to decide what it is that you want to do, and then do it.<eos> Even if Jack Warner does think it's a good idea.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Carson's on.<eos> I'm glad you finally came to your senses, Bobby.
This is my one condition, Jack.<eos> I am not working with them again together, never again.<eos> You can't work with them?<eos> Wha... They hate each other.<eos> Besides, they'd never agree to it.<eos> Bobby, if you think it's twilight for us, it is midnight for them.<eos> They are gonna do your Charlotte picture. And you know what?<eos> They're gonna do it for less.<eos> And you know what else?<eos> So are you.

So are you.<eos> All right, I want you to get those two harpies' signatures on the dotted line. You got it?<eos> Got it, Jack.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now get out of here.<eos> Joanie.<eos> Bette.<eos> Another horror picture, Bob?<eos> I wouldn't classify it like that.<eos> Weren't you the one that said we shouldn't be repeating ourselves?
Got it, Jack.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now get out of here.<eos> Joanie.<eos> Bette.<eos> Another horror picture, Bob?<eos> I wouldn't classify it like that.<eos> Weren't you the one that said we shouldn't be repeating ourselves?<eos> This is completely different.<eos> This time, you get to kill the cleaning lady.
She actively lobbied against me, and then she wormed her way into accepting Bancroft's award, which I understand Bancroft hasn't even laid eyes on.<eos> - Well...<eos> And have you gotten a load of the interviews that she's been giving lately for that stinker, Lady with the Axe, or whatever the hell it's called?<eos> So goddamn grand, you want to vomit.<eos> And now she's doing television?<eos> I mean, really, is that a face America wants in its living room at dinnertime?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> She wouldn't promote our picture. But she has no problem taking her cow town carny act on the road with Bill, Bill...<eos> Castle.<eos> What I don't understand is why you would want to work with her again.
You bastard, I know it's you.<eos> You threatened to tell the world about me and Daddy Cassin.<eos> I kept my mouth shut on all that, didn't I?<eos> A very expensive silence.<eos> Hey, it's an expensive town.<eos> Why do you do this to me?<eos> When you came to Hollywood, I found you work.<eos> As an extra, playing a clown.<eos> Nobody starts at the top.<eos> Yeah, guess you're proof of that.

Miss Big Fat Movie Star.<eos> You saw Baby Jane?<eos> I see all your pictures.<eos> I'm proud of my kid sister.<eos> That check is all you'll get for now.<eos> I'm at the end of my career.<eos> You want to call Lolly Parsons?<eos> Go ahead, ruin me.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I just want you to remember where you came from, Billie, and how lucky you are.
Brando isn't begging for a recurring role on WagonTrain,either.<eos> Maybe we'll find a solution in reading the whole story aloud. That's right, thank you.<eos> Uh, uh, Pauline, pick it up from where we ended.<eos> "Big Sam grips his cigar box "as if to smash in John's skull, "but then takes out a stogie to smoke.<eos> "He laughs at the fear on John's face."<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake, you said there was to be no photography.<eos> He's up in the catwalk. He's not gonna bother us.<eos> Oh, I didn't even see him there.<eos> Didn't you?<eos> I'm sorry you're not camera-ready, Bette, but we don't have eight hours to wait for you to put your face on.
If you're here to smother me with a pillow, wait till I fall asleep.<eos> Why bother? You're dead to me already.<eos> What do they say is wrong with you?<eos> My appendix.<eos> They want to take it out.<eos> Oh, well, that's a minor matter.<eos> But before you call around town with more lurid lies about me, here.<eos> To cover your medical expenses.<eos> If you've any decency, you'll agree.<eos> There's enough there to purchase whatever it is you think you have.
But before you call around town with more lurid lies about me, here.<eos> To cover your medical expenses.<eos> If you've any decency, you'll agree.<eos> There's enough there to purchase whatever it is you think you have.<eos> You mean my personal copy of Velvet Lips?<eos> Oh... So much for the great Joan Crawford being cash-strapped.<eos> I got an advance on my next picture.<eos> I'm going to star with some of my Oscar-nominated colleagues from Baby Jane, so the studio is optimistic.<eos> Jesus, Joan.<eos> I'm lying here like a beached fish and you still need to show off.

Let's just go home.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm sorry, you have to leave early in the morning, and we can talk about it when you get back.<eos> Why don't you want to be part of my movie?<eos> Because I don't want to be part of your life.<eos> What?<eos> Because I haven't been for quite some time.<eos> And I never am when you're making a picture.<eos> And you're only happy when you're making a picture, going into battle.
Because I haven't been for quite some time.<eos> And I never am when you're making a picture.<eos> And you're only happy when you're making a picture, going into battle.<eos> If you'd ever fought as hard for me in this marriage as you do for one of your stars, I wouldn't be saying this.<eos> And I hadn't planned on saying it tonight, but I want a divorce.<eos> Harriet.<eos> And I have to believe the only person who wants it more is you.<eos> Oh, please, don't say that.<eos> Oh, Christ, Bob, somebody has to.<eos> And you won't.

What, sit here by myself toasting my memories, hmm?<eos> There are many pleasures still to enjoy. New friends.<eos> You are invited to parties all the time.<eos> I can't show my face without having a picture to discuss.<eos> If I'm not working, I might as well be dead.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> It's a long flight to Baton Rouge.<eos> All right, everybody, take five.<eos> I can't play a schoolmate of these children, it's obscene.<eos> Well, I hate to break it to you, Bette, but you're the one who insisted on playing young Charlotte yourself.

Where the hell is Bob?<eos> Taking a nature break.<eos> Uh, maybe...<eos> All right, the wheels are flying off the scene in there, and you're out here watering the daffodils.
The crazy irony is that we were all going to be together on this picture.<eos> You know, the kids have all got parts. Adele's working on helping with the script.<eos> Harriet was supposed to be here enjoying it with me.<eos> Now I'm just looking around and I'm thinking... this has ruined my marriage.<eos> I'm not going to candy-coat it.<eos> Harriet is a wonderful woman.<eos> Losing her is going to be bad.<eos> It always is.<eos> I know, I've been through it four times.<eos> But I survived... and so will you.
Well, I remember seeing her in Humoresque. Shunned by John Garfield, marching into the ocean, every hair in place.<eos> Beauty, dignity and death, all in one exquisite pose.<eos> She marched into the sea to her death and never got her hair wet.<eos> Well...<eos> It meant a lot to me.<eos> Turndownservice,MissDavis?<eos> I wish I had known for a single day what it feels like to walk into a room and knock them out without a single word.<eos> Bette, you don't even know yourself.<eos> You've been too long in this business.<eos> Oh, you have no idea what it's like to be a woman in this business, with the constant scrutiny and competition.
Mamacita had to find - a phone and call a city cab<eos> - Jesus, Joan.<eos> - to bring us back.<eos> - I had no idea.<eos> No, I don't believe you.<eos> The proclaimed alliance back in Los Angeles, you never had any intention of honoring.<eos> That is not true.<eos> Christ, what a fool I was to sign up for this picture.<eos> And a bigger fool to think I could ever trust you.<eos> I need you to be brilliant. I'm just trying to help you get there.

They don't see the character, they see the acting.<eos> And they don't see you at all because of all your glamour makeup.<eos> Well, let me give you a tip.<eos> The answer to feeling unattractive isn't to make yourself even uglier.<eos> I'm a character actress.<eos> Well, I said what I came to say.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> How did it feel to be the most beautiful girl in the world?<eos> It was wonderful.<eos> The most joyous thing you could ever imagine. And it was never enough.
I played Elizabeth I, twice.<eos> You're not marrying a 40-year-old man.<eos> - I'm 29, actually.<eos> - You're twice her age.<eos> Old enough to give your daughter everything she deserves.<eos> Protection, affection and financial stability.<eos> I give her all that.<eos> We're in love, Mother.<eos> And we're getting married, whether it's now or two years from now when we won't need your permission.<eos> You don't want my permission, you want my attention.
I am bedded here with the script, making notes and coming up with all sorts of wonderful ideas for improvements.<eos> And, as a result of my convalescence,<eos> Charlotte is sure to be a much better picture once I recover.<eos> Well, Bob, what a lovely surprise.<eos> Mamacita, turn that off.<eos> Uh, c-could you give us a few moments, please?<eos> Seeing you is a tonic.<eos> Has it really been 12 days?<eos> I would have come sooner, Joanie, but... I've been busy trying to keep a train on track.<eos> Well, I'm touched you could find a spare moment.
Oh, I don't want a funeral bell.<eos> I want a glorious, joyful chime.<eos> Uh... what do you think of that, B.D.?<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you like it or not?<eos> It's your wedding.<eos> Whatever you think's best.<eos> Could you all please go into the dining room and give us a moment?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Darling, I want you to answer me truthfully, and don't for a second worry about the consequences.
Well, then I've prepared you to be a good wife.<eos> And I'm gonna miss you terribly when you're gone.<eos> This wedding is something I can give you.<eos> And if you want it,<eos> Your first wedding is the one that you remember the most.<eos> My first wedding?<eos> Jeremy and I are forever.<eos> Of course, darling, I... Of course.<eos> And however long that forever lasts,<eos> I want you know that you will always have a place to come home to.
But it's impossible.<eos> I've only just aired out my Swiss chalet for the season.<eos> And, besides, I've done my turn at Grand Guignol already.<eos> Help!<eos> Please help!<eos> I'm trapped in a small private elevator!<eos> The whole experience just left me feeling... humiliated, and I'd rather not repeat it.<eos> Oh,no,Olivia.<eos> This is completely different.<eos> This time you're not the victim.
In 1988, you vanished from the Ocean City beach home your parents were renting.<eos> You were raised by Frank and Eva Phelps.<eos> Ran away at 12, taken in by the Major at 14.<eos> You have no idea what is coming for you.<eos> You need to do as I say.<eos> What are you... Who?<eos> For what?<eos> You.<eos> They may be listening.<eos> Listen to me, whoever you are...
Hello?<eos> You expect me to listen to another word you have to say... you're gonna tell me who you are right now.<eos> I'm your father.<eos> We need to keep moving.<eos> You died in a plane crash.<eos> It's all over the news.<eos> The plane was sabotaged... a way to kill me and secure control of the company I built.<eos> But I took advantage of their plot, and now they believe I'm dead... which is best.<eos> The way it has to be.<eos> For 30 years, I searched, and... You're actually here.
What?<eos> He's alive... and paranoid.<eos> He wants me to go undercover in the company he created.<eos> Uh, back up.<eos> What are you talking about, he's not dead?<eos> He says my mother tried to kill him, so he faked his own death.<eos> What did he mean, he wants you to go undercover?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He said Scottie Hargrave is gonna offer me a job.<eos> Well, she already offered you a job, and you told her no.
Something tells me Scottie Hargrave is not the kind of woman who takes "no" for an answer.<eos> Tom Keen.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Hey, babe...<eos> I think I got to call you back.<eos> 18 hours ago, a strike team abducted CIA operative Anna Copeland and her son.<eos> Anna Copeland... I remember her.<eos> We did a job together years ago.<eos> Which is why you're here.<eos> We're hoping you may have intel on the man who abducted her... Leland Bray.
Anna Copeland... I remember her.<eos> We did a job together years ago.<eos> Which is why you're here.<eos> We're hoping you may have intel on the man who abducted her... Leland Bray.<eos> Bray was her associate... until he went rogue.<eos> The man is trained in government-sanctioned dark arts... snatch and grab, enhanced interrogation.<eos> But you're never gonna find him.<eos> I couldn't. He's a ghost.<eos> We've been hired to bring Anna Copeland back, preferably before she's forced to divulge intel that might compromise national security.<eos> You know him, we don't.
I can't imagine what you must be going through.<eos> Why don't we drop the act?<eos> I know the truth, Tom.<eos> What truth?<eos> That he's alive.<eos> - Who is?<eos> - Matias Solomon.<eos> There he is, in the flesh.<eos> One of my best men.<eos> I trusted you to work with him, and you shot him and left him for dead.
What do we know about him?<eos> Bray is ex-CIA.<eos> In 2011, he went rogue while on a black op in Athens.<eos> Since then, he's gone to the dark side.<eos> He has abducted and killed over a dozen covert operatives.<eos> And Bray has made a fortune targeting assets like Copeland, stripping them down, and selling what they know to foreign intelligence agencies or terrorist organizations.<eos> Aren't you Encyclopedia Brown.<eos> I actually met Copeland working in Rabat in 2012.<eos> We were contracted to help bring Bray out, but... we failed.<eos> But you came closer than anyone to doing it.
That'd give me remote access to the security codes, which is the good news.<eos> The bad news is, you'd have to be close enough for it to work.<eos> Like... make-out close.<eos> If you can do that, I can remotely navigate the non-linear filtering functions and code the preloaded blank card with valid biometrics.<eos> So, you want to duplicate the key?<eos> That's probably a simpler way of saying it.<eos> Look, fellas, I'm just as impressed by everything I've said as you are, but even if I can read the key, it's gonna take time.<eos> - How much time?<eos> 20 tops.<eos> Tom, I do hope you have a tux.
She spoke about you.<eos> She seemed... devastated. She must be pretty good.<eos> There's something else you need to see.<eos> After you disappeared...<eos> Scottie and I... we shared a living hell.<eos> We... searched, we cried, we searched more, and then, gradually... she healed.<eos> At first, I was angry at her for... for being able to do that.<eos> And then I realized, it wasn't anger, it was envy.<eos> Because that was something I was not able to do.<eos> I never stopped obsessing and believing that you were out there somewhere.
No, there were 17 dead people. - What's the difference?<eos> - They were already dead...<eos> John Does from a morgue in Estonia.<eos> The crash took place near what we think is a secret Russian military base.<eos> The reason we think but don't know is that the Ruskies are using some kind of ground-based signal to jam line-of-sight with our birds.<eos> Since we can't see by air, we need boots on the ground.<eos> So you downed a plane.<eos> - To avoid an international incident,<eos> Russia has invited a go-team from NTSB to investigate in the hopes of ruling out an act of terror.<eos> You and Tom are on that team.
Independence... population 216.<eos> What is it?<eos> During the Cold War, there were rumors that the Soviets built replicas of American towns to train their agents how to live like us.<eos> No one ever proved they existed.<eos> You know, a place to train sleeper agents made sense back in the day.<eos> But today, when you can get a visa and send them to Disneyland?<eos> What are they up to?<eos> Should we inform General Phillips? No.<eos> Not until we know what we're dealing with.<eos> Seems like maybe you already do.
Not until we know what we're dealing with.<eos> Seems like maybe you already do.<eos> I don't, but I know someone who might.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Men only!<eos> I'll let you know if I see any.<eos> I said I couldn't help you.<eos> Yes, but you didn't mean it, not after Riga.<eos> Please, don't push me on this.<eos> You don't know the people involved.
Occasionally, some of the new boys call me, ask for recommendations, agents or assets I may have had who are fluent in Russian or English.<eos> For assignment in Independence.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> I have two agents for you to recommend.<eos> Listen to what I'm telling you.<eos> I send agents in, but they never come out... ever.<eos> I'll have two dossiers for you within the hour.<eos> You think Scottie knows more than she's saying?<eos> Every day of the week and twice on Sunday.<eos> I hope you're a quick study.

Nez?
It's personal.<eos> Two hours, not a minute more.<eos> She's doing a complete audit.<eos> Tell me about Operation North Star.<eos> Accounts, case files, everything.<eos> The relief workers, the plane crash.<eos> - Has she taken the contract?<eos> - She knows you hid things from her, and if she looks closely enough, she's gonna find out it's me.<eos> Let me worry about her.<eos> You worry about the op.
Open a bottle of Beaujolais and let it breathe a while.<eos> Sorry, Briar.<eos> You're gonna be late for that Beaujolais.<eos> - Scottie, what are you d...<eos> - Briar, if I were you, I'd talk little and listen big.<eos> I don't want Mr. Solomon to have to get bloodstains all over these aniline leather seats.<eos> The account in the Antilles, the one you set up for Howard without telling me?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Howard was making secret payments to someone.<eos> You would know who.
_<eos> Answer it.<eos> Hello.<eos> Lisa, this is Mitchell with First Street Bank.<eos> I'm calling to remind you about our interview today.<eos> Sorry about last night.<eos> Can't really form attachments.<eos> Stan, what are you talking about?<eos> Sometimes you say the strangest things.<eos> Nobody knows when they're sending us to America, unless you know something I don't.
Please, just come with me.<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> No.<eos> During the Second World War, the Red Army carried these instead of standard tags.<eos> It's an identity capsule.<eos> A soldier's vitals are written on a slip of paper inside.<eos> My grandfather's are in this one.<eos> Hasn't been opened since it was used to identify his body, a life he gave for Russia.<eos> You know, most candidates react timid to that test, but not you.<eos> You have an instinct that cannot be taught, a capability.
If they're gonna be on our heels, there's no way we're gonna make it on foot.<eos> Maybe we don't have to.<eos> They're gonna blow the door.<eos> How about we blow it for them?<eos> They're wiring those explosives with blasting caps, which are stable but sensitive to stray electrical current.<eos> I think 10,000 volts ought to do it.<eos> Care to say goodbye?<eos> First off, the stick?<eos> I wasn't moved.<eos> You want to honor Gramps for giving his life for Mother Russia, we can arrange for you to do the same.
This place.<eos> He gave me a job.<eos> He helped me clean up.<eos> He gave me a shot at something I-I never tried before.<eos> Do you want... Do you want to grab a coffee?<eos> Toast to a job well done?<eos> Maybe next time.<eos> - Yeah. - ♪ Can you pull me up?<eos> Damn, girl.<eos> I was hoping you'd be one of the ones who stayed gone.
Before he died, Howard hired someone to track down our son, Christopher.<eos> Track him?<eos> I don't understand. I thought your son was dead.<eos> I talked to the man.<eos> He found a record of a child services in Wilmington, less than 20 miles from where Christopher disappeared.<eos> A boy Chris' age.<eos> Blue eyes, brown hair.<eos> His name was Christopher.<eos> A week after we lost our boy, that boy was brought to child services.<eos> But you told me your husband was out of his mind, that his search for Christopher was a delusion.
We're done here.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> We didn't say that, all right? It's just not what we expected.<eos> Give... Give us a minute.<eos> Ungrateful.<eos> I am risking my life here.<eos> These days, even the rumor that you spoke critically of the president is enough to get you thrown into a cell.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That could work to our advantage. How?<eos> You said you had friends in the National Police.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Do you realize how big this is?<eos> That is everything.<eos> So you're saying that Scottie encodes messages to your agents at your company, and you can't read them?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Do you realize how big this is?<eos> That is everything.<eos> So you're saying that Scottie encodes messages to your agents at your company, and you can't read them?<eos> Agents she turned.<eos> The ones she convinced to work against me.<eos> But now I've intercepted a message, and you're gonna help me decrypt it. How?

How?<eos> Scottie doesn't trust me enough to tell me.<eos> I have the key book. All you need to do is get the key word.
I have the key book. All you need to do is get the key word.<eos> And then what she knows, we know.<eos> What if she doesn't know anything?<eos> She keeps the key word in her safe.<eos> What proof do you have that Scottie is a sleeper agent?<eos> Because from what I can tell, she seems to be trying to do good.<eos> And I seem to be crazy, and the world thinks I'm dead.<eos> Things aren't always how they appear.<eos> She's manipulating you.<eos> Or you are.
I knew that they would do whatever it takes to get their hands on the blueprints for the KR-20.<eos> - Did the plane crash?<eos> - So I told them you had them.<eos> - Did all those people die?<eos> - I tried to talk to you.<eos> I did everything that I could to get you to listen to me.<eos> If something terrible did happen to that plane, I don't blame you for that.<eos> Me?<eos> For pushing me away, for getting the restraining order.<eos> You don't see it, but I did all that for you.
Angry millennials intent on exposing corporate corruption.<eos> What's the latest?<eos> Still at his hotel.<eos> Meeting's in less than three hours. Okay.<eos> And we're still on?<eos> Itstartedinnocentlyenough. Shutting down meat processing plants to protest animal cruelty. Uh-- leakingembassycables.<eos> Good luck, Brian.<eos> Leakingwasonething, butMayhewdidn'tstopthere.<eos> He infiltrated a top secret NSA mainframe, stole identities of operatives, the schematics of the C-34 ICBM.<eos> Okay, assuming you're right, what's Mayhew going to do next?
I'd invite you to stay for lunch, but clearly you've already eaten.<eos> I wouldn't have come if it wasn't important.<eos> I have business.<eos> My big brother, the corporate shill, marionette who just loves to dance for the man, wants to talk business with me.<eos> The man is the government.<eos> Halcyon's a private company.<eos> The man is whoever's holding the almighty dollar.<eos> Hacktivist united.<eos> Used to code with those guys?<eos> And you used to be mom's favorite.
There's nowhere to go.<eos> Drop it!<eos> Put it down.<eos> Brian Mayhew?<eos> There's no way out.<eos> Jeremy, put your weapon down.<eos> You haven't done anything wrong.<eos> The mission-- this is the mission.<eos> It doesn't involve you getting killed for me.<eos> Brian, don't do anything you're going to regret.
Fourteen months ago, our firms liaised on a protection detail in Riyadh.<eos> The point man of your company was named Zachary O'Neill, the same man in that photo.<eos> Odd that he stopped for a cappuccino right in the middle of one of the worst acts of espionage in U.S. history.<eos> Do you have any idea how many employees work for my company?<eos> I don't keep tabs on all their whereabouts.<eos> You knew why Mayhew went to that key ceremony.<eos> You knew what he was looking for-- proof of his innocence.<eos> And when you found out that he accessed your url, you sent your hit squad after us to get him back.<eos> Brian Mayhew's a criminal.<eos> Actually, he's a hero. One who you framed in order to set off a firestorm in the U.S. intelligence community.
Previously on "Blacklist:<eos> Redemption"...<eos> Remember, Whitehall... she has to tell you about Whitehall.<eos> Your accomplice...<eos> I need to know his name.<eos> He's your son.<eos> I don't know anything about Whitehall.<eos> If you tell me, nothing will happen to you.<eos> Who are you?
- You leave that to me.<eos> All you have to worry about is assembling a team that'll stay off of Halcyon's radar.<eos> High risk, low probability of success.<eos> Got any takers?<eos> Yeah, I think I do.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We didn't talk about it.<eos> I told you I knew about you and Kat, that you were sleeping with my assistant. You apologized.
I want everyone released.<eos> They were trying to kill us.<eos> They were only doing their jobs.<eos> Take everyone into the command center.<eos> I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> Just hold still.<eos> Hold still.<eos> Okay, there.<eos> Keep the pressure on.<eos> You're closer to Scottie than anyone else.
I'll tell you what I told the board.<eos> I'm only interested in the truth.<eos> She will have her day in court.<eos> But, first, we have to find her.<eos> Anyone who is not comfortable with that mission... may leave now... with my blessings.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's all.<eos> Dumont.<eos> Sir.<eos> You knew that they had access to the elevator, and yet, you said nothing.
That's all.<eos> Dumont.<eos> Sir.<eos> You knew that they had access to the elevator, and yet, you said nothing.<eos> And that allowed Scottie to escape.<eos> Now you're gonna help us find her.<eos> How did my team access the facility?<eos> You... programmed the servers to overheat, opening the vents.<eos> Which shut down the network.<eos> I want you to get it back up.
Stop! Stop!<eos> It's over.<eos> It's over.<eos> Howard's setting me up.<eos> If that's true, then come in.<eos> If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to hide.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Well, that sounds like guilty.<eos> Look, I understand why it's hard for you to believe me, but we both know Howard did something incredibly cruel when he sent you to me and didn't allow you to tell me that you're my son,
Whatever help you need.<eos> I like what you've done with the place.<eos> How does it feel?<eos> It feels... right... this, being here with you.<eos> You know, my daughter turns... she turns 1 next week.<eos> This isn't the end, you know?<eos> This is just the beginning.<eos> Yeah.<eos> For our family, which I hope... I want you to be a part of.<eos> And I want you to be a part of this.
For our family, which I hope... I want you to be a part of.<eos> And I want you to be a part of this.<eos> I know.<eos> Maybe, someday.<eos> Who knows?<eos> For now, I am going home to my daughter's birthday.<eos> Well, of course you are.<eos> You should.<eos> You're coming to the party by the way.<eos> It's a princess theme, so I hope you've got a tiara.
She's adorable, happy... dying to walk.<eos> Her first steps...<eos> God, I don't want to miss those.<eos> I feel like I missed too much already.<eos> You said we could help.<eos> If my father's being held against his will, the FBI can get him back.<eos> We can certainly try.<eos> Where's his location?<eos> Howard won't ever say a word.<eos> - But you want to talk about Keen?
You knew I've been looking, that finding my son was everything.<eos> You saw my pain and anguish and you said nothing?<eos> Here you are... my boy, my long-lost son.<eos> You're finally here.<eos> And you broke my heart.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm...<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> I mean... when was I supposed to tell you?<eos> He's telling me one thing, and you're telling me something else, and I don't know...
Sorry.<eos> I'm...<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> I mean... when was I supposed to tell you?<eos> He's telling me one thing, and you're telling me something else, and I don't know...<eos> I don't know... I don't know what to believe.<eos> Tom...<eos> Christopher, your father's not well.<eos> Whatever he's told you about me, you can't trust.<eos> Why are you the one holding him prisoner?
I have a job to do.<eos> If you're there when we arrive, I'm gonna do it.<eos> I got two guards on the perimeter and one on the roof.<eos> The physical guards are only there as a visual deterrent.<eos> If I were Scottie, I'd have this place under a digital canopy to protect Whitehall... satellite imagery, UAV full-motion video, thermogenic cameras.<eos> Dad, Dad, English, please.<eos> - Digital feeds.<eos> - Okay.<eos> One nation under CCTV, son.<eos> Listen to me... it's too dangerous for you to come with me.
You'll... you'll see that when you're better.<eos> And I know why you did it, too.<eos> I know about Whitehall.<eos> Whatever this is, your... your confusion, depression, disorder, we have to treat it.<eos> And I want that treatment to be as painless as possible.<eos> You look skinny.<eos> You should eat come carbs. Piece of cheese, maybe.<eos> I saw what you did to your apartment.<eos> I know someone in the company told you we were coming.<eos> I need you to tell me who that is.
- Life is not fair.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> Which is why you're here.<eos> My assistant gave me the headlines.<eos> The abduction took place up in the Catskills?<eos> Less than six hours ago.<eos> Gable Lang... software exec... his wife, 9-year-old son, and their driver.<eos> - No bodyguard?<eos> - Killed on scene.<eos> And I'm guessing you haven't involved the FBI in all this or they'd be sitting there with you.
Carthay Insurance.<eos> They write policies on CEOs, athletes... people whose profiles might attract the attention of someone like Rocha.<eos> So, it's a straight ransom play.<eos> Things are never straight with Rocha.<eos> After he grabbed the NATO Ambassador, we were contracted to deliver the ransom.<eos> Rocha got the ransom.<eos> We got back... most of the Ambassador.<eos> And has an exchange been agreed to?<eos> A meeting's been set... tomorrow... to start negotiations.<eos> You and Tom will be meeting with Rocha's representative.
- Have you talked with him?<eos> - We tried.<eos> The warden wouldn't let us, even after I told him Cantara could help save the lives of three Americans.<eos> - They gave you no explanation?<eos> - Nope.<eos> And when I insisted on one, he said I had to get it from the Justice Department.<eos> Kat, call Helen Abernathy at Justice.<eos> Tell her we need to talk about the curious case of Carlos Cantara.<eos> - So, tell me.<eos> - You were the enemy.
- You were the enemy.<eos> You nearly killed Solomon.<eos> Now, suddenly, you're part of the team? You can trust me.<eos> You didn't answer my question about how you fit in to all this with Howard.<eos> Why you?<eos> You say you're his man here.<eos> - Prove it.<eos> - You'll have proof, all right?<eos> I'll either get Howard back or I'll die trying.<eos> You're on his side, right?
Your instructions were quite explicit.<eos> Are you telling me you turned the surveillance cameras off?<eos> On the wing he's in, yes.<eos> - What about outside?<eos> - Those were operational.<eos> It's difficult to identify anybody.<eos> Put the footage on a flash drive.<eos> I'll expect to take it with me after I visit my husband.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> It's important for me that you know that.
I'll expect to take it with me after I visit my husband.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> It's important for me that you know that.<eos> That your illness is what makes you think I'm the enemy.<eos> I'm sad about it, but I accept it.<eos> Or I did, when I thought your confusion was benign.<eos> But faking your death, working against me?<eos> What was all that you burned?<eos> Whitehall.<eos> I don't think you have the capacity to understand the consequences of what it could be, which is neither here nor there, since, at the moment, you're in no position to do anything about it.
We got a lead on Cantara.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Queens.<eos> As part of his deal, the Feds pay him a stipend under the alias Joaquin Cruz.<eos> Now, it turns out that Mr. Cruz accesses that stipend from an ATM at the Liquor Plus in Flushing, which has a lot of public housing projects.<eos> And I'm thinking it sounds like a good place to disappear if you're Carlos Cantara.<eos> Find Solomon and get out there.<eos> We have less than two hours until Rocha executes a hostage.<eos> Dumont.<eos> I need you to do something for me.
D-D-Diego, I have a baby girl.<eos> I have a baby girl.<eos> Please.<eos> Her name is Rose.<eos> Please, Diego.<eos> Slicing the anterior tibial... will give us more time together.<eos> We have so much to catch up on.<eos> I don't want to get my hands dirty.<eos> This kind of exposure is risky for me.<eos> But you are going to tell me what you told the Feds about us.
Tasty.<eos> - Come on, come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Come on!<eos> Everybody in the truck.<eos> _<eos> Um, so, you know how I said connecting Burton to Rocha was better than whatever I was gonna find on the surveillance footage?<eos> I'm not 100% on that.<eos> Were you able to render it?<eos> Any chance you're gonna tell me what this is about?
What is?<eos> When the rush ends and the case is over.<eos> You know, Howard did get me clean.<eos> After he died, after I got a taste for it again in Russia, I just slipped back.<eos> But he didn't die, did he?<eos> And now he's in trouble, and I want to help him, but I can't do it if I'm using.<eos> And I can't stop on my own.<eos> Where's the electrician?<eos> I have to admit... I, uh... I didn't see it coming.<eos> Even now, knowing the truth, I don't know how you made it happen.
There was something about him.<eos> He... he reminded me of you.<eos> Maybe it's just the familiar scent of deception.<eos> Okay, I'll bite.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> - You're not gonna kill him.<eos> I already gave the order.<eos> And now you're gonna rescind it.<eos> Howard, you may think you're a genius, but you're no magician.<eos> There is nothing you can say that will make me call off the hit.
Knock, knock.<eos> Larry! You're out on bail!<eos> Meet the dream team. Ah.<eos> Just, uh, wanted to see how it's going.<eos> I hear they may be going for the death penalty.<eos> That's just legal posturing.<eos> We're working on your defense as we speak.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Let's see what we got. Hey.<eos> Now, Larry, I just want you to know, very early on in the process.
Oh, hey.<eos> Glad you're here.<eos> I have a twin who's in town saying awful things.<eos> There he is.<eos> The man who holds my fate in his hands.<eos> Josh, have you met my daughter, Summer?<eos> - Actually, we...<eos> - Nice to meet you, Josh.<eos> Come on in. I made a delightful paella, and we're talking about how I'm gonna die.<eos> You'll know this.
We don't need your boss. We have you.<eos> I appreciate your confidence, Summer, but I cannot do it myself.<eos> I've never tried a murder.<eos> Trust me, your dad can do a lot better than me.<eos> With who?<eos> Some court-appointed lawyer who thinks I'm a kook?<eos> Kook is a strong word.<eos> I'll never get a fair trial in this town.<eos> I need someone who believes in me, like you.<eos> You do believe in me, right?
- Previously on Underground...<eos> - Rosalee?<eos> There's one man I know motivated to pluck the petals off the Black Rose.<eos> Who among you is feeling bricky tonight?<eos> I seen you.<eos> You're still the snake of a slave driver you was when you left Macon.<eos> Those who make peace impossible make violence inevitable!<eos> You got chillun?
But the sheriff said "fraud."<eos> The arrest was due to a family matter. - I will handle it.<eos> - Georgia.<eos> We don't have time to waste.<eos> I saw your papers.<eos> You've been passing.<eos> If you tell me what's going on, maybe I can help you.<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> Hey, nigger.<eos> You ain't fooling nobody.
And I knew if I could learn a little more from Moses, maybe I could have it all back.<eos> Then my belly started to grow, and... it got very real.<eos> Every time I saw myself... holdin' this baby,<eos> Noah's baby, he was right there with me.<eos> My mama was right there with me.<eos> I need 'em, not just for me... for both of us.<eos> I feel so scared.<eos> I can't do it alone.<eos> Rosalee, listen to me.<eos> You are not alone.
Noah's baby, he was right there with me.<eos> My mama was right there with me.<eos> I need 'em, not just for me... for both of us.<eos> I feel so scared.<eos> I can't do it alone.<eos> Rosalee, listen to me.<eos> You are not alone.<eos> But if you kill this baby trying to get the rest of them back, you will be.<eos> Mama taught me how to make this 'fore she cross over on home to the ancestors.<eos> I can't believe you ain't never had bread pudding.
I can clean up the rest, thank you.<eos> I know you're thinkin' about that bottle.<eos> When you're gonna get some.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> A man who wants.<eos> A man who needs.<eos> A man who acts.<eos> If I am going to cut a dog loose, especially where we're going, I am going to want a dog that can bite.<eos> You can still bite, can't you?
And I know...<eos> I don't seem like much now, but...<eos> Noah, I'm strong.<eos> You found your way back to me just in time.<eos> Noah, I know together we can do anything.<eos> I hate animals.<eos> Especially horses.<eos> Why can't he just be like the other buckra and stay up in the big house?<eos> I'll do all the talkin'.<eos> You just listen.
Don't look back.<eos> He watching'.<eos> You gonna come back for that basket a little after super.<eos> After he done had his after-dinner whiskey.<eos> That's when you stay a little longer.<eos> How is she doing?<eos> Restin' now.<eos> I was real sorry to hear about John.<eos> I appreciate y'all takin' care of her.<eos> I'm glad you're back.
She needs you.<eos> No, she done all right.<eos> All them people she helped to freedom... it's amazing.<eos> Last time we saw each other, we was runnin' from danger, now she runnin' into it.<eos> She told you about the plan to rescue her family.<eos> She want me to go with her.<eos> Be back in Georgia by Christmas.<eos> I know.<eos> Going back right now to the hell we ran so hard to get away from... that seems crazy, with her hurt like that.<eos> She won't go if you don't go.
I ain't never had no family, but<eos> I'm-I'm startin' to understand the pull of it.<eos> And I know it ain't so easy for her to just start over, but... goin' back to Macon... that'd be the last thing I want to do.<eos> And that's how I been livin' my life, always at the point of just doin' the last thing I want to do.<eos> I ain't never had no choice.<eos> And now that I got one, I...<eos> Then tell her that.<eos> Be honest with her.<eos> She will hear you.<eos> If you don't go, she can't go.
- Previously on Underground...<eos> - I made a plan.<eos> Going back to get Momma and James.<eos> But ain't nothin' ever go as planned.<eos> You can still bite, can't you?
Not unless he working.<eos> When he was younger, Momma used to sneak him into the attic to sleep with us in the bed, then sneak him out 'fore Miss Suzanna woke, but one of the house girls told on us.<eos> I think it was Corra.<eos> All right, so, if we approach through the sugar cane, the wash house'll give us some cover.<eos> Get us eyes on the back porch without any on us.<eos> And we wait till she come to us, just like Harriet taught me.<eos> You run 600 miles to win your freedom, and now you headed back?<eos> But you ain't even touched on the hardest part of this plan.<eos> How in the hell you gonna get your asses back on Macon land?<eos> Well, that's where you come in.
- No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> And why you tryin' for save him?<eos> He done hurt you, too.<eos> We done hurt each other, and I'm trying to save you.<eos> Killing?<eos> That's a dark place you don't want to live in.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know.<eos> And even if you work through Massa Matthew, the blood still going be on your hands.

I know.<eos> And even if you work through Massa Matthew, the blood still going be on your hands.<eos> I don't need massa for this.<eos> I gon' do it; you gon' help me.<eos> Make me a poison.<eos> I know you know how the root work.<eos> I can't let you do this.<eos> Let me?<eos> You ain't my momma.<eos> Massa done arranged for you to go work on the mainland just like I told him.
He her favorite now.<eos> - We got to get him out of here.<eos> - Oh, we will.<eos> And the four of us gonna ride on out and never look back.<eos> Four of us?<eos> She ain't coming with us.<eos> I ain't made for the fields.<eos> They gon' be the death of me.<eos> At least in the big house, I had clean clothes, a bed, food.<eos> - And you think you gon' last on the run?
I...<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Well, if you think you might, you should know, she 'bout to do something she gon' regret.<eos> She may look pretty on the surface, but she got some scars that run deep.<eos> You can't live the life we do and not.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> Just 'cause bad things happen to us, don't mean we got to be bad people.<eos> We got to learn to forgive ourselves, the shame done to us, 'fore we visit it on others.<eos> You care about her, you need to tell her that.<eos> Why don't you just tell her?
Christmas present.<eos> Go on, open it.<eos> I remember you had one when we was on the run, for a bit, anyways.<eos> Yeah, I lost it in the brush huts.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, you ain't slept since we got off that train.<eos> Corra gonna be back soon.<eos> I want to hear what she has to say about James.<eos> I'll keep an eye out for her.<eos> You go on, get some rest.
I want to hear what she has to say about James.<eos> I'll keep an eye out for her.<eos> You go on, get some rest.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> About what?<eos> That house you're going build for us.<eos> Where Massa Matthew?<eos> Out riding that horse of his.<eos> But he don't mind if I'm in here, and you my guest.
Ain't nothing good come from they world, even if you sitting at the top of it.<eos> Matthew should be back soon.<eos> He always asking me to come ride with him, but I told him, I ain't gon' let one of them beasts kill me.<eos> He swear it gon' save his life, he ever have to do any fighting.<eos> War coming, he say.<eos> That all he be talking 'bout, worrying 'bout.<eos> I just tune him out, cause them white folks start fighting, ain't nothing ever gonna touch this island.<eos> But he should be worried.<eos> He got some anger in him, but he ain't got it in him to kill a man.<eos> And you do?
I don't care about that man.<eos> Before today, he didn't even exist.<eos> The only thing I got to do is protect you and me.<eos> And if that means that man's got to suffer, then that's what that means.<eos> You say that as if you don't have a choice.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Let-let them sell you?<eos> Yes.<eos> If it's between me and subjecting 30 people into servitude, then yes.<eos> You don't understand what it's like.
She probably just got held up.<eos> I knew we should've never trusted her. She sold us down the river.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - Don't you see?<eos> Turning us in is her ticket back - to the big house.<eos> - Nobody come for us yet.<eos> We got to go right now.<eos> Hey, we ain't going nowhere till you tell me the plan.<eos> I sneak into the big house, get my brother.<eos> You get that book from Bill's. Then we meet back at the stables.
That's her.<eos> It is.<eos> I'll take all of it.<eos> I'll probably get a toothache, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for a cause.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> How was hearing Harriet speak?<eos> Life-changing.<eos> She's inside.<eos> She's come for the money for Noah and Rosalee's return trip. Georgia!<eos> Any chance that you actually will be able to purchase all of this?
It seems that the Christmas spirit is not inspiring charity this year.<eos> I noticed it was emptier than usual inside.<eos> Boarders have steadily declined since the raid.<eos> There have been rumors about me.<eos> Elizabeth Hawkes.<eos> I knew that was you!<eos> Laney.<eos> I haven't seen you in a long time.<eos> And I take full blame for that.<eos> I just want to let you know Dean and I are deeply sorry that we missed John's funeral.
Once the withdrawals kick in, even if she wants to run, only place she's gonna go is right back to you.<eos> Get up.<eos> They're trying to cut off the boat.<eos> We got to move back into the trees.<eos> Come on!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Noah.<eos> Good. You know who I am, so I'm gonna just get to it.<eos> I just found out I'm gonna be a father, which means you're gonna be an uncle, so that makes us family.
- Go.<eos> - Yes, Massa James.<eos> Just now you remind me so much of Momma.<eos> Why did you come back here?<eos> For you.<eos> To take you away from all this.<eos> Sam got kilt 'cause he ran.<eos> I ain't gonna let nobody hurt you.<eos> I ain't scared of nobody hurting me.<eos> I'm scared of you making everything bad again.
You said you wanted to get behind the cause, and I'm here to help you do that.<eos> Elizabeth, it's Christmas, and my family...<eos> There isn't a better time to give to those who need.<eos> Listen, I won't be donating to anything that Georgia woman is involved with.<eos> So if you excuse me, I wish you all the luck.<eos> I don't want your wishes or your luck.<eos> I don't want your fake condolences or your fashion tips from Paris.<eos> They're all empty.<eos> Just like this is.<eos> What I want is for you to fill it.
That it is.<eos> You cargo, too?<eos> No.<eos> I just tidy up from time to time for Miss Georgia.<eos> Now that's two questions of yours I done answered, and I only asked you one.<eos> I-I just heard some of us might be movin' on soon, and I wanted to thank her for all she done for me.<eos> I think she's in the kitchen.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Minty.<eos> And why aren't you?
John Hawkes.<eos> That's right.<eos> Been asking' around about you.<eos> Seems your husband wasn't that smart, either.<eos> Got what he deserves.<eos> Get out.<eos> We need to do something.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> I am not scared, I'm angry.<eos> And why aren't you?
And it's true.<eos> Elizabeth, he's just a boy.<eos> He's his father's son.<eos> Raised to believe that owning people is his birthright.<eos> He could have been different.<eos> And we may never know because of your actions.<eos> You think I'm heartless, but I'm not.<eos> I feel so deeply.<eos> I look at this boy, and my heart breaks, just as it does for every brutalized runaway that's come through your station.<eos> The difference is you caused this boy's pain.
I ain't never doubted you.<eos> Not ever.<eos> But I ain't sure I'm meant to lead.<eos> - This wasn't what we talked about.<eos> - The money's all there.<eos> You said four runaways ain't nobody be lookin' for.<eos> - I know, but the plan change.<eos> - Word spreading' fast.<eos> By noon, the whole county'll know y'all burned down your big house.<eos> And you branded.
We go, the money goes.<eos> And it look like you need it.<eos> Y'all stay away from the windows, and you stay quiet.<eos> This your idea of a safe house?<eos> 'Cause I ain't feelin' very safe.<eos> Not with no white woman.<eos> White, black, she don't care.<eos> We ain't got nobody or nothin'.<eos> - She ain't turning' us in.<eos> - Says you.

No!<eos> No!<eos> How much longer till we ain't got to run no more?<eos> We gon' meet my friend Harriet at the next station, and she gon' give us tickets to take a train the rest of the way.<eos> We got to ride in the bottom of that, too?<eos> Nah.<eos> You gonna like it.<eos> It's fast.<eos> How fast?<eos> It's faster than any horse you ever seen.
- How did you let this happen?<eos> - I wasn't there when the photo was taken, Van, because you forgot your ivory cufflinks and made me fly 3,000 miles<eos> - to go and get them. - Oh, so I'm supposed to wear the gold ones two days in a row like some kind of certified pre-owned car salesman?<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe I ask too much of you.<eos> - I agree. - Maybe if I want something done right, I should just do it myself.<eos> - I'd love that.<eos> - I'm trying to say you are incompet... you don't even feel shame properly.<eos> Didn't make the Dream Team, huh, Van?<eos> And you know that I did.
So do chimps.<eos> Until you dress them up and have them perform "12 Angry Men" for your Yale buddies.<eos> Yes, that happened.<eos> Guys, I can't stress enough the importance of peoples' heads remaining attached to their bodies.<eos> Fuh-fuh-Fantasy Superhero League...<eos> Have you just been playing that fantasy site?<eos> Emily, we're creative people.<eos> We can't just grind away for 15 hours straight.<eos> I totally get that you have a process, but Corporate said they need this done by Friday.<eos> No, you said you need it done by Friday, which makes me think you don't fully understand the meaning of the word need.
Don't worry. We're gonna put everything else aside until we figure this out.<eos> Emily, get in here!<eos> Come on!<eos> So I think there was some sort of miscommunication.<eos> I just wanted the fantasy site blocked.<eos> Now they're spending all their time trying to get the Internet back.<eos> So if you could just put it back.<eos> Emily... What do you think HR does?<eos> Oh, well, you know, it's... HR does the... It's human resources and...<eos> You have no idea.
Why'd you quit the army then?<eos> My sister.<eos> I quit for her.<eos> I know you hate me for what I did, and I don't blame you.<eos> These are some dangerous people who were gonna kill me if I didn't cooperate.<eos> I was weak.<eos> And I just got in way over my head.<eos> But these people will stop at nothing to stop your case against them.<eos> Including blackmail.<eos> And after you ended our relationship for the sake of your wife and children, I fell apart. I admit it.

Thank you.<eos> What, for saving you or the economy and the President?<eos> Please tell me it's the latter, because I nearly lost a man in Zurich.<eos> - You have to understand...<eos> - No, I understand perfectly.<eos> You're a cheat and a liar, among other things...<eos> Weaknesses these bankers hijacking our economy were hoping to exploit to blackmail you, to force you to drop your case against them.<eos> The Associate Attorney General of the United States, the third most powerful law enforcement officer in the country.<eos> And the sad part is...<eos> You know what the sad part is.
- Is she dead?<eos> - Sedated.<eos> Guessing Ingersol told them no body count<eos> - until, you know...<eos> - It counts. Whole thing from start to finish took 49 seconds.<eos> Neighbors never saw or heard a thing.<eos> I'm so sorry, Dan.<eos> - Just get her out of here, please.<eos> - I'm not leaving. Sorry.<eos> Dan, we need to get you ready for the ransom call, okay?
Mr. Solitzki.<eos> Who's this?<eos> I also have the laptop... And the code.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Is Mattie there?<eos> Mr. Golitzki, this is her father, Dan...<eos> Is Mattie alive?<eos> Put the other guy back on.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> - You killed my brother?
Hi-tech, huh?<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Last thing they expect.<eos> Gives you more time.<eos> To what?<eos> Get away... whatever.<eos> Have you been broken into before?<eos> - No. - Oh.<eos> Um... knock on wood.<eos> You should take the bedroom. Uh, I'm...
They adored Cali.<eos> Did I forget to tell you that your loving little sister used to brag about you, like, a lot?<eos> - What if they don't like me?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - It's possible.<eos> - No, I mean you seriously care if they like you?<eos> Mm, that's so sweet.<eos> Now you're making fun.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I won't tell anyone how sweet you really are.
This should be interesting.<eos> Can't even imagine what that must feel like.<eos> Face-to-face with your sister's murderer?<eos> Why make him do this?<eos> - To face his demons?<eos> - Or maybe it's her way of showing him she's finally starting to trust him.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Look at the picture.<eos> Do they think sending you in here will intimidate me?<eos> Word on the street is you don't need much intimidating.
New York, Boston, Chicago, everything in between.<eos> Look, you knew I wasn't gonna risk losing Vitek.<eos> Your personal agenda cannot contaminate this operation.<eos> Says the person who pushed that connection in first place.<eos> In 2006, the Feds hit Dunne with a 36-count indictment... Everything from human trafficking to murder.<eos> Then somehow he just vanishes into thin air moments before the Feds hit his compound to make the arrest.<eos> Eight days later, the Mejia Cartel rolls into the top corner and takes over.<eos> Are you beginning to get the picture?<eos> Now that Mejia's gone, Dunne's planning a comeback.<eos> And you may have just blown our one and only chance to get up on him.
The problem with you Green Berets is someone told you you're special, and you bought it.<eos> Rule number one...<eos> You ain't special.<eos> If and when your ass ever gets captured, now's the time, if you're still alive, to save all your strength for in here.<eos> You don't show anger.<eos> You don't show anything.<eos> You flatline, become dull, gray, no threat.<eos> A bump on a log.<eos> Who are you?<eos> And then you start to look for weaknesses, because your enemy, believe it or not, is still a human being...
For the last 20 minutes, the tracker-tagged vehicle has been speeding northeast from Montreal for about 30 miles, away from its established movement pattern.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> We're here to see your guest.<eos> Guest?<eos> I work for Mr. Dunne.<eos> We got this.<eos> Tell Mr. Dunne...<eos> Think.<eos> You're not thinking.<eos> You got to make them believe you're too weak to do anything...
Almost.<eos> Take him down.<eos> Clean him, feed him, hydrate him, get some clothes on him.<eos> _<eos> What is this?<eos> I told you to clean him up and take care of him.<eos> Go get him something warm to wear.<eos> Take his cuffs off, please.<eos> The good cop is the closer.<eos> He wants you to believe, to hope... That he's the only one that can bring you back from the brink...
Get up.<eos> How many more men?<eos> How many more?<eos> Three.<eos> Our orders are to shoot through him.<eos> Those are orders he gave.<eos> You have five seconds to come out, and...<eos> You can come out now.<eos> It's clear.<eos> Now it's time for you to answer some questions.
_<eos> Tatjana.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Where are your bags?<eos> - Yura, I'm scared.<eos> - We already talked about this.<eos> No, I'm really scared.<eos> Aren't you scared?
- Do you really want to die?<eos> If Yuri's still a live Asset.<eos> - You want to die.<eos> - We have to protect him. Don't do this.<eos> Please?<eos> Joan.<eos> There has to be another way out of this.<eos> Five!<eos> Four!<eos> - God, I hope you're right. - Three!
_<eos> Why me?<eos> I prayed for a solution, and he... Gave me you.<eos> I honestly believed you left that life behind a long time ago.<eos> I honestly did.<eos> Problem is, you never believed that I too left it behind.<eos> That is not true.<eos> I'm not the answer to your prayers, George.<eos> You know why?<eos> I don't think you praying right.

I'm not the answer to your prayers, George.<eos> You know why?<eos> I don't think you praying right.<eos> I think you praying like some kind of punk-ass hypocrite.<eos> Maybe you should stop praying for solutions and just try harder to be one.<eos> You ready to roll?<eos> You really got kids, huh?<eos> Yep.<eos> They're the reason I do this work.<eos> You're crazy.
This is what you do when someone is sick.<eos> You make them smoothies.<eos> I think you mean soup, and she's not sick.
She's new. I took advantage.<eos> It's been four weeks since she turned down Charlie's proposal.<eos> She's been distant and glum ever since, and that's not Alex.<eos> They'll sort it out, Shahir.<eos> They always do. Look, I'm Team ShAlex.<eos> It's my job to be here.<eos> You can leave if you want.<eos> Your smoothies taste like vomit.<eos> Alex? It's Maggie and Shahir.<eos> You better not be naked.
I just need to run them through Alex, and then we'll be good to go.<eos> Well, choose wisely.<eos> A study can live or die by patient selection.<eos> I just think that if you were to kind of cut it on an angle, it would kind of highlight your features better.<eos> Can I talk to you for a sec?<eos> There was this little issue about a thing.<eos> That dating profile we started for you...<eos> I thought that was a bad dream.<eos> Please do not let me drink gin when I'm feeling vulnerable.<eos> But you only drink gin when you're feeling vulnerable.
Got sideswiped by a tow truck.<eos> Dr. Reid, Dr. Lin. This is Bree and this is Violet.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - So, what happened?<eos> We were just sitting at a light, I was mid-Kelly Clarkson, like, really going for it, and then... pfft!<eos> - This... - The truck hit my side, and the window shattered.<eos> Should we divide and conquer?<eos> Yes.<eos> The way I see it,<eos> I'm the front-runner for Chief Surgical Resident, but I don't want you to let me win just 'cause we're sleeping together. Slept together.
Sekara, flex those pipes.<eos> Clamp!<eos> I must have dislodged a clot.<eos> Dr. Williams, I need help over here.<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> You?<eos> You can see me?
You said it yourself, the vascular work can't wait.<eos> Go and help Charlie.<eos> - Page Plastics! - You're here.<eos> Sekara, what are you waiting for?<eos> I'm so sorry. I...<eos> Well, move!<eos> I need a vascular tray and a boatload of 5-0 sutures.<eos> Please. Tell me what's going on.<eos> I'm gonna give you some space while you do the vein graft.<eos> We're gonna put a rush on the biopsy results so we can talk options before you leave.
Well, you do the arterial graft.<eos> If there's still no pulse, then we'll talk.<eos> I'm not giving up on this kid yet.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> Her partner left and you feel bad, but you heard Dawn.<eos> We have to be selective.<eos> Bree is a good candidate.<eos> Speaking of which, Matilda McPhee is coming in next week to be enrolled.<eos> I haven't looked at her chart.<eos> I know things are complicated and that you and Charlie are taking a time-out...
Uh, Palmer says it's healing.<eos> Healing.<eos> Not healed.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't be an idiot, Charlie.<eos> I'll keep your secret, but you stay out of the O.R. until it's healed.<eos> You're too good to piss it all away.<eos> Thank you... I think.<eos> So, how are things with Alex?<eos> Uh, I think you would know better than me.
So, what's going on, Alex?<eos> What's, uh, what's happening?<eos> I think I deserve an explanation.<eos> An honest one.<eos> I... I can't marry you because... because I made a promise... to God or whoever, whatever's out there.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> When Shahir was removing your tumor, you, uh... you flatlined on the table. And I-I was terrified.<eos> I was desperate.<eos> I got down on my knees, and I made a promise that I would stay away from you forever if you lived.<eos> And you lived.
I was desperate.<eos> I got down on my knees, and I made a promise that I would stay away from you forever if you lived.<eos> And you lived.<eos> You lived.<eos> And so, maybe that's a sign that we need to stay apart because... because I'm bad luck.<eos> Baby, that's... that's insane.<eos> Says the man who talks to ghosts.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, that's not the first time you brought that up, so is that what this is about?<eos> No, you're not listening to me.

I want to hear something that makes some sense, okay?<eos> I just want to hear the truth. What's the truth?<eos> You don't...<eos> You don't want the truth.
Okay.<eos> Well, that's not the first time you brought that up, so is that what this is about?<eos> No, you're not listening to me.<eos> No, I am listening to you.<eos> I just...

You don't...<eos> You don't want the truth.<eos> - Yes, I do want the...<eos> - You want an apology.<eos> No, I... I thought you were okay with all of that! I was, I am!<eos> And that you're supportive of me.<eos> I am supportive of you!<eos> I have always been supportive of you.<eos> From the moment we got together,<eos> I have always stood by your side. When you were Chief and I was a resident.
I am supportive of you!<eos> I have always been supportive of you.<eos> From the moment we got together,<eos> I have always stood by your side. When you were Chief and I was a resident.<eos> When you were in a coma, you couldn't have found a more supportive...<eos> What were you gonna say?<eos> Finish it.<eos> A more supportive what?<eos> Wife?<eos> But you're not my wife, Alex.
You've accomplished so much, I don't want anything jeopardizing that.<eos> I mean, just think of your poor sister.<eos> She was such a shining star before she let that Blossom boy ruin her.<eos> Mom, I'm not Polly.<eos> You missed curfew last night.<eos> By seven minutes.<eos> I was with Archie, who has red hair, yes, but is nothing like Jason Blossom.<eos> Oh, but sweetie, all boys are like Jason Blossom.<eos> I love you so much, Elizabeth.<eos> I just need you to be smart, okay?
I have a little money saved.<eos> I was praying that someone in Riverdale, maybe an old friend, would be willing to give me the benefit of the doubt.<eos> If it were up to me.<eos> Isn't it up to you?<eos> It's your company.<eos> Well, I have clients.<eos> I can't very well have Hermione Lodge, the wife of Hiram Lodge, on trial for fraud and embezzlement, balancing my books.<eos> Can I?<eos> No.<eos> I suppose you can't.
I can't very well have Hermione Lodge, the wife of Hiram Lodge, on trial for fraud and embezzlement, balancing my books.<eos> Can I?<eos> No.<eos> I suppose you can't.<eos> Can I join?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Listening to one of Archie's songs.<eos> I thought we were going to have to pretend to like it, but it's actually really good.<eos> Wait, that was you singing?
So how's your first day going?<eos> Good? Not to be a complete narcissist, but I thought people would be more...<eos> Obsessed with you?<eos> Any other year, you'd be trending number one, for sure.<eos> This year, though, it's all about Cheryl trying to win the Best Supporting Psycho Oscar for her role as Riverdale High's bereaved Red Widow.<eos> Hey, I should go.<eos> I got that meeting with Grundy and then football tryouts, so.<eos> You play football, too?<eos> What don't you do?<eos> Before you ask, Blue Jasmine, no, she has not invited him to the dance yet...
- Uh, no.<eos> - Go ahead, Betty.<eos> Tell Veronica about your sister and my dear brother.<eos> Polly and Jason dated.<eos> I wouldn't say "dated".<eos> - It didn't end well.<eos> - In fact,<eos> Jason's probably why your sister had a nervous breakdown and now lives in a group home, isn't it?<eos> That's what my parents think.<eos> What do you have to say about that, Betty?
Go ahead, the floor is yours.<eos> Whatever you've been dying to spew about Jason and how he treated Polly, unleash it.<eos> Destroy me.<eos> Tear me a new one.<eos> Rip me to shreds.<eos> Annihilate me.<eos> I just...<eos> Finally.<eos> I just wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened to Jason.<eos> I can't even imagine what you and your family must be going through.
Let's move.<eos> There we go.<eos> Looking good.<eos> - What's up, Coach?<eos> - Here.<eos> - This is Jason's number.<eos> - It's yours now.<eos> Usually, sophomores, they only play JV.<eos> This year, we've got an open spot in varsity.<eos> From what you've been showing us, well, I want you to fill it.
Jason hurt Polly, but it's my mom who broke her.<eos> Archie.<eos> - You're so doing this.<eos> - What? Slaying your dragons, Betty Cooper, one by one.<eos> - Hi, Teen Outlander.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Nice outfits.<eos> Betty here has something she wants to ask you about the Back-to-School dance.<eos> Go on, Betty, ask.<eos> I was wondering if you wanted to come with both of us.
Unlike the rest of Riverdale.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Um... A spot of good news.<eos> The car service found and dropped off your missing bag.<eos> Missing bag?<eos> Oh, Hiram...<eos> What have you done?<eos> I, um...<eos> I got a call from your coach today.<eos> He's under the impression that you can't play varsity football because I'm making you work for me.

That's it?<eos> We don't talk anymore?<eos> Dad.<eos> I would never force you to play football.<eos> I don't care if you play football.<eos> And you don't have to work with me or for me, ever again.<eos> But some advice, man-to-man?<eos> These decisions that you're making now, son, they have consequences.<eos> They go on to form who you are and who you'll become.<eos> Whatever you decide, be confident enough in it that you don't have to lie.
Give you a hint... His name may be Moose, but I'd describe a certain appendage of his as horse-like.<eos> Don't panic, I'm not stalking you.<eos> Archie, didn't we have a deal?<eos> No, Geraldine, we have a secret,<eos> Multiple secrets, actually.<eos> And maybe we could've done something to help Jason that morning, or maybe we couldn't have.<eos> And I won't tell anyone anything, but you need to help me.<eos> This summer, the only thing that kept me sane was writing these songs.<eos> So here's my not-so-indecent proposal.<eos> I want to do an independent study with you, as many mornings a week as you can spare, and I swear that's all it'll be.
I know her brother died and everything, but...<eos> Cheryl Blossom truly is the antichrist.<eos> So, uh, do you miss New York?<eos> It's been less than a week.<eos> But...<eos> Yes.<eos> Six minutes, twenty seconds.<eos> Okay.<eos> Your turn. Ask me a deep, probing question to kill time.<eos> It looked like you and Betty were having fun at the dance.
I know everyone grieves differently, but Cheryl's hosting a pep rally to cope with her loss.<eos> That's either brilliant, or psychotic, or both.<eos> Yeah, well, at least Cheryl's not putting on an act.<eos> Pretending she's a butterfly when really she's a wasp.<eos> For the record, the only reason I went into that closet with Archie was so that Cheryl wouldn't.<eos> - Oh, so you did it to protect me?<eos> - Damn straight.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> You know, Archie and I were fine before you got here.<eos> If by, fine, you mean he was oblivious and you were pining after him in quiet desperation.
And don't despair.<eos> I don't think your story with Betty is over.<eos> Your room's so sweet.<eos> It's too pink.<eos> It doesn't feel right anymore.<eos> No, I like how girly it is.<eos> Mine is, too.<eos> You should come over and see it sometime.<eos> But, just you, not Veronica.<eos> I mean, she must be evil incarnate if even you won't have her as a friend.
I like her.<eos> So I'm guessing she's the reason you've been acting weird since summer?<eos> One of them.<eos> "One of them." There's more?<eos> We were at Sweetwater River on July 4th.<eos> We heard a gunshot.<eos> The gunshot.<eos> - Dude, you have to tell somebody.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Neither can you.

There's more?<eos> We were at Sweetwater River on July 4th.<eos> We heard a gunshot.<eos> The gunshot.<eos> - Dude, you have to tell somebody.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Neither can you.<eos> If people find out about Grundy...<eos> A kid is dead, Archie!<eos> And you're worried about some...
The boy I like doesn't like me back.<eos> He may not be crushing on you, but he does love you.<eos> And he's legit miserable without you, if it's any consolation.<eos> My mom says sometimes a friend is better than a boyfriend.<eos> Maybe this is one of those times.<eos> And Sheriff Keller's grilling me, Mantle the Magnificent.<eos> 'Cause I'd want Blossom dead. When he was, like, the only good quarterback we had.<eos> And speaking of offensive tight-ends, I should've sent the cops to you, Moose.<eos> Because here's another unsolved mystery.<eos> What exactly were you and Kevin doing at the river, huh?
You didn't do stuff to the body, did you?<eos> Like... After?<eos> It's called necrophilia, Reggie, can you spell it?<eos> Come here, you little...<eos> Hey shut the hell up, Reggie.<eos> Boys.<eos> What do you care, Andrews?<eos> Nothing, just leave him alone.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Did you and Donnie Darko kill him together?
Jughead and I, we were disagreeing about a girl.<eos> - Because there's this girl.<eos> - There usually is.<eos> But it's not about me and Jughead, it's about me and this girl.<eos> I think we should do something.<eos> And it's the right thing, Dad.<eos> But the girl says that if we do or if I do this thing, it'll ruin what we have.<eos> That doesn't make any sense, does it?<eos> You know, this is the most honest talk we've had in a while.<eos> And I'm glad that you want to do the right thing.
There's one person who was at the river on July 4th that no one's talking about.<eos> - Dilton Doiley and his Scouts.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Hey.<eos> I texted.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Football practice. Then I was writing.<eos> Songs?<eos> Your music?<eos> I thought you and Jughead were on a road trip on the 4th.
- He's lying.<eos> - About what?<eos> The gunshot.<eos> It was him.<eos> He was teaching us how to shoot targets.<eos> Dilton Doiley shot the gun on July 4th?<eos> He's a hardcore survivalist.<eos> He says if we don't protect ourselves, no one will.<eos> Melody's our technique queen.<eos> And you're the songwriter?
Recording them. So, you feel qualified to write songs for the Pussycats?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - For divas of color?<eos> - No.<eos> Maybe, maybe.<eos> Look, this isn't LA or New York, this is Riverdale, and people's minds are opening up, but do you have any idea how much hate mail my mom got when she was elected mayor?<eos> I campaigned for your mom, I get it.<eos> No, no, no, baby, you don't.<eos> I mean do you know why we're called the Pussycats?<eos> Because we have to claw our way into the same rooms that you can just waltz into. So, if you think that you can write my experience...
♪ Come around the corner, make you stop and stare ♪<eos> ♪ She don't pay no mind, 'cause she don't really care ♪ ♪ What you think about her, think about her ♪<eos> ♪ I don't care what you want me to be ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause it ain't for you, no it's all for me ♪<eos> That was... That was so good.<eos> What else you got?<eos> Uh, I was thinking maybe we could invert the second and third verses.<eos> Seduce Scarlet doesn't suit you, dear.<eos> It's Polly's. I'm borrowing it.<eos> Polly grew up too fast. I don't want you to make the same mistake.

I don't want you to make the same mistake.<eos> Well, I like it.<eos> It makes me feel... powerful.<eos> You coming with us to the Mayor's shindig?<eos> No.<eos> I'm going over to Veronica's to study for a test.<eos> I don't want you associating with a girl like that.
Definitely.<eos> Um. Hey, and don't worry.<eos> I'll be gentle.<eos> - Can't wait.<eos> Welcome home, Ferris.<eos> Sneaking out, breaking curfew.<eos> Getting into fights.<eos> Dad, don't freak out, okay.<eos> I was with Josie, helping the Pussycats with a song they're doing at that Taste of Riverdale thing.<eos> - And I was hoping you would let me go.
- No, Archie.<eos> You don't get to go wherever you want, whenever you want, and damn what anyone else says.<eos> Dad, this is the first time a song I worked on is gonna be performed in front of people. On stage.<eos> Please, let me go to this, and then ground me for the next six months, a year.<eos> We're not haggling over your punishment, end of story.<eos> Fine.<eos> But you have to own it.<eos> Own what?<eos> Okay, if I had a football game tomorrow night, would you stop me from going?<eos> No, because football you understand.
Maybe we should slow it down a little?<eos> It's fine.<eos> Right, Chuck?<eos> You don't want to slow down, do you?<eos> Oh, I'm 2 Fast 2 Furious, baby.<eos> Good.<eos> Good boy, Chuck.<eos> Hello, Dilton.<eos> I talked to one of your Scouts.<eos> I know you fired the gun.
Ms. Grundy was at Sweetwater River on July 4th.<eos> Were you with her?<eos> Did Jughead tell you?<eos> Jughead knows about this?<eos> What's happening out there?<eos> Do we know?<eos> Is it about me?<eos> I have a strong inkling, and no.<eos> Also, I'd let it go.<eos> Yes, but you're you, and I'm me.

I have a strong inkling, and no.<eos> Also, I'd let it go.<eos> Yes, but you're you, and I'm me.<eos> You do you, girl, I'll be back.<eos> What was it like before she got here?<eos> I honestly cannot remember.<eos> It's not what you're thinking.<eos> So, it's platonic?<eos> Okay, well, maybe it's a little like - what you're thinking... - Archie.<eos> Are you and Ms. Grundy, like, together, like, romantically?
Where did you find all this?<eos> The deep web.<eos> The dark internet.<eos> Check it, it's all online.<eos> Simple googling.<eos> And did you cyber-stalk Ms. Grundy before or after you interviewed her for a fake article?<eos> Why are you doing this, Betty? - I'm not in any danger.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do, I'm with her.<eos> I know what we have, and you don't.
But that's what you think we should do?<eos> Don't you?<eos> So, that bow is a goodbye gift?<eos> It's a see-you-around-the-halls gift. A don't-forget-me gift.<eos> That is hardly likely.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> There they are. What did I tell you?<eos> Can someone tell me what's going on here?<eos> Of course.<eos> Archie, would you like to share with us what you and Mrs. Robinson have been doing during your "music lesson"?
I'll see you there.<eos> Bye.<eos> - So, I'll see you.<eos> Bye. - So...<eos> Bye. Going on a date with Trev?<eos> Does Mama Cooper know about that?<eos> Kev, I'm not on house arrest.<eos> Okay, she's out of town at a Women in Journalism spa retreat.<eos> Anyway, it's not a "date" date.<eos> You just called it a date.
Great.<eos> Can I get a huge cup of coffee to go?<eos> I'm running on little or no sleep.<eos> Archie. Up all hours.<eos> Listen, I was thinking maybe we should take another stab at going on a date.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> Dinner?<eos> Fred, um...<eos> I'm married.<eos> And you are too.
I think she must've...<eos> Connected with you in a way that I just don't see us doing.<eos> Wait, are you...<eos> Is that it?<eos> You're saying I should just quit?<eos> I'm saying that...<eos> I don't think I can help you.<eos> Thank you for having me.<eos> Cheryl invited you.<eos> I have no idea why you're here.
I can't practice with you watching!<eos> Daddy, I'm shy!<eos> I hope this isn't weird, but Jason was crazy handsome.<eos> The handsomest.<eos> Something tells me he would've liked you.<eos> Why did you invite me tonight?<eos> Why not Tina?<eos> Or Ginger?<eos> Aren't they your besties?<eos> And yet, that night at the pep rally, after I had my panic attack, you helped me.
I didn't call the police because I don't trust them.<eos> I don't trust half the people in this damn town.<eos> Just you.<eos> Which is why you gotta tell me why the Serpents...<eos> It's Hiram.<eos> He owes them money. How much money?<eos> Fred.<eos> That's between Hiram and the Serpents.<eos> Thank you so much for coming here tonight.<eos> But I don't want to get you any more involved than you already are.
Your wedding was the last thing I was living for.<eos> I lost a grandson, but you, you've lost the love of your young life.<eos> Poor child.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I have to...<eos> I can't...<eos> I had to.<eos> It's what Jason would've wanted.<eos> No, Cheryl.<eos> As always, it's what you wanted.

As always, it's what you wanted.<eos> I hope you enjoyed yourself.<eos> 'Cause after tonight, there will be no more River Vixens.<eos> And if not for the fact that no one would have you, I'd be shipping you off to a boarding school in Europe tonight.<eos> What if Ms. Grundy was lying?<eos> People lie all the time.<eos> Maybe she didn't want to hurt my feelings.<eos> Anyway, it doesn't matter.<eos> Castillo doesn't think I have the chops.<eos> So, Ms. Grundy said you were good, and you thought you were good?

Who's telling you you can't do your music?<eos> Your coach?<eos> Mr. Castillo?<eos> Your dad? Or is it just you?<eos> You dragged me out of the Blossom house, and then you don't talk to me the whole way home.<eos> Dad, Jason and Polly were engaged.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> Is that what you and Clifford Blossom were talking about?
Hold up, hold up.<eos> Look, Val.<eos> You don't sing on the bridge.<eos> Actually, the bridge is meant to be sung by two voices.<eos> What is up with you today, J?<eos> What is up with you today, Mel?<eos> You're asleep at the snare drum...<eos> Relax.<eos> Josie, it's a Variety Show in the auditorium, not show time at the Apollo.<eos> Whether you are performing at Madison Square Garden or Ace Bowling Alley, you do it at 150%.
Josie, it's a Variety Show in the auditorium, not show time at the Apollo.<eos> Whether you are performing at Madison Square Garden or Ace Bowling Alley, you do it at 150%.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you want to say something to me, Valerie?<eos> It's just that I don't have to deal with this diva crap when I'm working with Archie.<eos> Working with Archie how?<eos> Co-writing songs.<eos> - Singing with him.<eos> - Unacceptable.<eos> You sing with the Pussycats.
Dad, it's okay.<eos> You're good.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> I do like her, and I...<eos> You know, I think maybe I'm ready...<eos> If this is something that makes you happy, then I say go for it.<eos> You're good. Mom's good.
If this is something that makes you happy, then I say go for it.<eos> You're good. Mom's good.<eos> I'm good.<eos> All right.<eos> Mom, Valerie quit the Pussycats.<eos> Replace her.<eos> Val writes our songs.<eos> She's irreplaceable.<eos> No, Josie.<eos> You're irreplaceable.
- Yeah, okay.<eos> Mmm. And Josie...<eos> Don't disappoint.<eos> Are you gonna leave Dad when he gets out of jail?<eos> Honey, why would you ask such a thing?<eos> I saw you, Mom.<eos> With Fred Andrews in the trailer.<eos> Oh, Veronica.<eos> Honey, I am so sorry that you did.<eos> But I want you to know that we've...
I'm not sure.<eos> I'm so sorry, baby.<eos> It just happened, Veronica.<eos> And I know that this must be confusing.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> So, what can I do to help?<eos> You know what, Mom?<eos> There's actually nothing.<eos> ♪ I've got you ♪<eos> ♪ And you've got me ♪

Ronnie, hey. Great news!<eos> Valerie quit the Pussycats.<eos> So, that makes me what, then?<eos> Backup? No.<eos> I mean, you were just doing it as a favor to me, right?<eos> You are unbelievable, Archie.<eos> You literally have zero loyalty, you ginger Judas!<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Ronnie. What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong, Archie, besides the fact that you have no integrity whatsoever, is that your father kissed my mother.
- I am, Polly.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I am so sorry I didn't come sooner. I should've, but Mom and Dad... They stopped...<eos> No.<eos> What did they tell you?<eos> That I was on drugs?<eos> Alcohol?<eos> They said you were sick.<eos> That you tried to hurt yourself.<eos> And they told me you didn't want to come and see me, which I knew was a lie.
We used to practice in the stock room.<eos> I'll never forget the day Josie came to rehearsal with a bag of cheap cat ears from the Halloween Store.<eos> I found my voice with them.<eos> Mom?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I pay the Sisters good money. You think they don't notify me if Polly gets a visitor?<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Polly...<eos> Jason's dead?<eos> And you didn't tell me?
- I didn't know that was your real name.<eos> - After Josephine Baker.<eos> You have no idea who that is, do you? Fred?<eos> You wanna get started on that presentation? Yeah.<eos> Polly needed to hear the truth.<eos> And I did, too.<eos> So?<eos> Did you find what you were looking for?<eos> To be honest, Dad, no, I didn't.<eos> You hate the Blossoms.
Yeah, but I know dysfunctional families.<eos> I'm not sayin' that what your mom's doing is right, but maybe there's another side to the story.<eos> - Maybe one worth hearing?<eos> Dad, if I tank at the Variety Show, would you...<eos> Would I be mad?<eos> Son, whatever happens with that show, or any show, whether you go up there and kill it or you bomb like electric Dylan at a folk concert...<eos> I'm not sure who that is.<eos> I would still love you, okay?<eos> Support you.<eos> I'd be proud of the fact that you were brave enough to go after somethin' that you care about.
I don't want to be the guy that broke up The Beatles.<eos> In your heart, you're a Pussycat.<eos> You'll always be a Pussycat.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But singing backup with no vote, no agency...<eos> - Well, after meeting Josie's dad...<eos> - Myles is in town?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why she's been acting like Catzilla.<eos> I'm betting you can negotiate new terms.
This is all evidence.<eos> Crap.<eos> This whole car is a crime scene.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to get Sheriff Keller and then we need to get Polly.<eos> That was Josie and the Pussycats!<eos> Long tails and ears for hats.<eos> - You guys killed it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> So will you.
Well, if you freeze out there, Red Troubadour, just focus on someone that makes you feel safe.<eos> - Here's Archie Andrews!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Go.<eos> Stick to football!<eos> ♪ Can you hear me?<eos> ♪<eos> ♪ Am I drowned out in the crowd?<eos> ♪ Are you listening?<eos> ♪ Or is everyone else too loud for you to hear anything?
- Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi, Mr. Andrews. - Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Well, I was just, um, telling your mother...<eos> You know that SoDale contract?<eos> It was awarded to Andrews Construction.<eos> The buyer, whoever they are, they approved us.<eos> Thanks to my lucky charm.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Andrews.<eos> Looks like you won.
She needs her family.<eos> What do you want, Cheryl?<eos> What we both want.<eos> For the baby to be safe.<eos> How can I help?<eos> You can't, I don't trust you, Cheryl.<eos> So don't trust me.<eos> Watch me like a hawk. Tell me the barest minimum.<eos> But let me help you help Polly.<eos> You think Polly's crazy.
You can't, I don't trust you, Cheryl.<eos> So don't trust me.<eos> Watch me like a hawk. Tell me the barest minimum.<eos> But let me help you help Polly.<eos> You think Polly's crazy.<eos> I do, I think she's crazier than a serial killer on bath-salts, but so what?<eos> She's carrying Jason's baby. That trumps everything.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> If I did, I wouldn't tell you.<eos> - Oh, my God, you do.
- Yeah. Go ahead. You get this one.<eos> You know, if I'd have known, I would have gotten another milkshake.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> And don't say clubbing, it's a school night.<eos> But that's exactly where I'm going, and do you know why?<eos> Because I have a Get Out of Jail Free card.<eos> Okay, Ronnie, enough.<eos> Checkmate.<eos> What do you want?<eos> For you to admit what you did.
So that was that.<eos> He went his way, and I went mine.<eos> You know, I think I need something a little harder than beer.<eos> Clifford and I were so relieved when Cheryl told us that Polly and the baby are safe and sound.<eos> And money won't be a problem, Betty. Not now, not ever. Not with us.<eos> But, of course, we don't want to just offer financial support, we want to give Polly all the emotional support that a young mother-to-be needs.<eos> Where is Polly staying now?<eos> I'd rather not say yet.<eos> You understand.<eos> Of course, but you and Polly are part of the Blossom family now, and we will protect you ferociously.
Or I could call my mom, the mayor.<eos> This should cover it.<eos> Veronica, did your mom cut you off?<eos> She did.<eos> - And that's a good thing?<eos> - Oh, Reggie. This is how we Lodge women roll.<eos> We feint, we parry, we approach, we retreat.<eos> We're like a cobra and a mongoose dancing.<eos> She blinked, which means, I suspect, that Hermione Lodge is ready to negotiate.<eos> I'll sleep right here on this couch, you can have the bedroom.
So generous you didn't give him a second chance?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> You have no idea how many times I bailed that man out of jail.<eos> Son, when someone is drowning, you can try to save them, but not if they're gonna drag you down with them.<eos> I did the best I could for my family.<eos> For you.<eos> Yeah, and who cares if Jughead ended up drowning, too.<eos> Reporting my American Excess card as stolen, well-played.<eos> I thought you might appreciate that.<eos> Now, mija. I've done things to upset you. You've done things to upset me.
Lodge Industries needs to partner with legitimate businesses, not criminals.<eos> Understood. I don't want Daddy thinking I betrayed him.<eos> I will tell him about the forgery. And say it was all my doing.<eos> And in the meantime, the online shopping, the clubbing, all that stops.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Uh, what's up?<eos> I'm going to need you to come down to the station with me.
Son, listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna do what you want, get my act together.<eos> I'm gonna get your mom and Jellybean home so we're all under the same roof. I promise.<eos> But I...<eos> I just need a little time to do that.<eos> Not a lot, not long, a month, two at the most.<eos> Hey.<eos> And then we'll be back on track, all right?<eos> You...<eos> You believe that, don't you?
Yeah, well, FP's got his tricks, I got mine.<eos> Maybe I should've given him another chance back then.<eos> Either way, Jughead doesn't deserve what's happening to him.<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> The Blossoms should be here soon.<eos> Once we've talked things through with them, we'll call Mom and Dad.<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> I'm thankful.<eos> At the home, the Sisters said each of us had a guardian angel.<eos> You're mine, Betty.
And... Whoa!<eos> It's kinda ripe in here.<eos> Does someone wanna open a window?<eos> I got it.<eos> - You settling in, Jug?<eos> - Oh, completely.<eos> It's like Archie and I are just roommates in a college dorm.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> What does that make me, the RA?<eos> No, you're the third roommate.
- What, Dad?<eos> It's true.<eos> It's also not helping.<eos> Have you heard from Mom?<eos> Is she coming?<eos> She's invited.<eos> Hey, it doesn't matter.<eos> If Mom doesn't want to come, that's on her. It's her loss.<eos> Betty, I've decided...<eos> I want you to be the baby's godmother.
You got a death wish?<eos> Archie, back off.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> You like beating up teenagers?<eos> This isn't the first time one of you Bulldogs has come in here, looking to 'cause trouble.<eos> Hey!<eos> That's enough, Mustang.<eos> Let 'em go.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> Not you, Red, you stay.
Hi, guys. Good to see you.<eos> - Hey. Hey.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> You're sweet to be here.<eos> I know this isn't exactly your scene. What?<eos> Organizing a baby shower?<eos> It's totally on my bucket list.<eos> Mom!<eos> Polly, look, Mom's here!<eos> I'm so glad you're here, and you're safe.
No big deal, it's only the best stroller money can buy.<eos> So expensive.<eos> All I ask in return is that you make me your baby's godmother.<eos> Kidding!<eos> So not kidding.<eos> Come on, Nana Rose, let's get you a good spot by the food.<eos> Polly.<eos> Let me begin with an apology.<eos> When I first heard about the baby, my initial instinct, to embrace the baby but not you was wrong.<eos> I hope you can forgive me.
We were supposed to be together.<eos> And you didn't let us have that, neither of you.<eos> And you know it cost Jason his life.<eos> Polly.<eos> Mom.<eos> You need to talk to her.<eos> Polly, I'm sorry.<eos> - It's just that woman...<eos> - Didn't send me away.<eos> You did.
Dad's just gonna have to get over it.<eos> Are you sure he's not just gonna try and make another appointment for me?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What appointment?<eos> Before you sent me away, Dad made an appointment for me to see a doctor.<eos> Said he would be more than happy to pay for it.<eos> That I shouldn't have to live with my mistake.<eos> Oh, my God...<eos> He didn't even ask me what I wanted.<eos> Dad, before you say anything, I was trying to help.

Anything else you wanna ask?<eos> Did you have anything to do with Jason Blossom's death?<eos> You really think I could do that?<eos> It's the dark ages, Dad.<eos> I don't really know what to think anymore.<eos> I'm not a perfect father, Jughead, no getting around that, but...<eos> I'm no killer.<eos> - Do you believe him?<eos> - I do.<eos> Do you?
That you offered to pay for?<eos> Behind my back?<eos> So that she could fix her...<eos> Her mistake?<eos> Alice.<eos> Bastard!<eos> So you did to Polly exactly what you did to me?<eos> See, this is why I didn't involve you, for this very reason.<eos> I knew that you would overreact.<eos> Honey, you weren't ready, okay?
By that family.<eos> Polly is moving home, into this house, where she belongs.<eos> The hell she is, Alice!<eos> 'Cause I will not be party to raising a child that has Blossom blood.<eos> Get out.<eos> No.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out before I do something that we both regret.<eos> And I think, by now, you know what I'm capable of. No.
Hiram?<eos> But...<eos> Why would he... Maybe he got a whiff of your little romance with Freddy Andrews?<eos> But the real question is, who ratted you out?<eos> Mom had no idea, Polly.<eos> Dad never told her. She swears it.<eos> I just...<eos> I can't believe she kicked him out.<eos> She meant what she said.<eos> She wants you and the baby, or babies, to feel safe.
Dad never told her. She swears it.<eos> I just...<eos> I can't believe she kicked him out.<eos> She meant what she said.<eos> She wants you and the baby, or babies, to feel safe.<eos> Which means...<eos> You can come home now.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> I tried.<eos> Polly, we're so happy you're here.
It was awarded to Andrews Construction.<eos> Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?<eos> I asked around about those bruisers going after your crew.<eos> Pretty sure we both know who has business in Montreal.<eos> Hiram, why would he even...<eos> Maybe he got a whiff of your little romance with Freddy Andrews?<eos> When my father got arrested,<eos> I made a pact to become a better person.<eos> You're the bravest of them all, Ethel Muggs.<eos> You hate the Blossoms and now Polly is pregnant with his baby.
It is.<eos> Beyond.<eos> It's also incredibly exclusive.<eos> Family and inner circle only.<eos> Wanna be my date?<eos> The maple-tapping's something Jason and I have done together since we could walk.<eos> It was our extra-special thing.<eos> But I...<eos> I can't face it alone.<eos> If you came, as my escort,
Clifford didn't send those thugs.<eos> Hiram did.<eos> He was trying to stop us.<eos> He found out about you and me from Clifford.<eos> So you have dragged me into a war between Hiram and Clifford, that's great.<eos> I know you're angry.<eos> And I know that I have no right to ask this...<eos> But please stay on this project.<eos> If you jump ship, I can't start over with someone else.<eos> So, I do the grunt work while your husband's taking potshots at me and you're playing both sides?
Your father and I haven't been seeing eye-to-eye lately.<eos> I came for Cheryl, Mr. Blossom.<eos> And because I'm grateful for what Mrs. Blossom is doing for me.<eos> The music academy, you mean?<eos> Yeah, that would be quite a feather in your cap, now, wouldn't it?<eos> You know, we can be extremely generous,<eos> Archibald, to the right people.<eos> Now later this week, we're hosting a banquet for the board at the Belmont Lodge.<eos> It's a simple thing, a little dinner, chit-chat, dancing.<eos> We would love you to attend as Cheryl's escort. You two make quite the pair.
Okay, Ethel, open your eyes.<eos> What is happening?<eos> I was purging my closet, thinking how you would look magnificent in some of these.<eos> Here, try this on.<eos> This is...<eos> This is so nice.<eos> And I love this.<eos> It is so you, Ethel.<eos> Ronnie, I can't take all this.<eos> I want you to have it.
No, but her dad did.<eos> He accidentally swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills.<eos> He's going to be okay, but that's why Ethel's been so sad lately.<eos> Now, everybody knows...<eos> We were tested this year.<eos> As a town, as a company, mainly as a family.<eos> And it may not have been Jason's hand that staked the maple this year, but it was the hand of hope.<eos> Don't think they're being nice or genuine.<eos> They wanted me to fail at the tree-tapping.<eos> But you're going to help with all that.
Don't think they're being nice or genuine.<eos> They wanted me to fail at the tree-tapping.<eos> But you're going to help with all that.<eos> I'll do whatever I can.<eos> Archibald, have a word?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.<eos> You did?<eos> You will?<eos> Well, you've helped our family.
I'll do whatever I can.<eos> Archibald, have a word?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.<eos> You did?<eos> You will?<eos> Well, you've helped our family.<eos> Cheryl, especially.<eos> You fit in so well.<eos> I think you and your father have a very bright future with us.
You okay?<eos> What did my dad say to you?<eos> That everyone thinks I'm a train wreck?<eos> Jason was the golden boy, but me...<eos> People hate me, Archie.<eos> And at school, that's fine, whatever.<eos> But this is my family.<eos> Forget them, Cheryl.<eos> Forget what they think.<eos> I think you're awesome.

Cheryl, I can't do this right now.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Archie Andrews, if you leave, the radiant sun that is the Blossom family stops shining on you.<eos> And everything we've given you, including Brandenburg, disappears.<eos> Are you sure you want to give that up?<eos> Are you sure you want to do that to your dad?<eos> Cheryl, I came here as a favor to your mom, to help you.<eos> Oh, Archie, don't start lying now.<eos> You may not want anything from me, but you do from my mom and dad, that's why you're here.<eos> Which means, as much as I want you to be better than everyone else...
Yes.<eos> You and me...<eos> Whatever was going on there is over.<eos> Now, we're just business partners.<eos> That's it.<eos> Right.<eos> Ethel, I meant what I said.<eos> I'm sorry, Ethel, for everything my family did to yours.<eos> It's not your fault what your dad did.<eos> And you were there for me when no one else was.
This is between me and your mom.<eos> I'll check in.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Veronica, this is Paul Sowerberry, your father's attorney.<eos> He's here to prep us for our statements and help at your dad's hearing.<eos> Except, I told you, Mom, I'm not giving one.<eos> - Not one you'd want.<eos> - Just...<eos> You won't be asked any questions about your father's business arrangements.<eos> We just need you and your mother to speak to his character.
Screw it. I'm with Betty.<eos> My dad's away. We can do it at my house.<eos> We could all use a good time.<eos> Now you're talking my language.<eos> It's gonna be epic.<eos> Mr. Jones,<eos> I didn't mean to ambush you.<eos> I know you don't do birthdays, but Archie and I are having a few of Jughead's friends over at Archie's house.<eos> And I bet it would mean so much to Jughead if you came.<eos> - Man, you don't quit, do you?
And you being there...<eos> That would be special.<eos> Great news, Betty.<eos> I just had a terrific meeting with Principal Weatherbee, who agrees that the Blue and Gold can benefit greatly from my professional guidance<eos> - as your new advisor.<eos> - That's great, Mom.<eos> So what are we working on?<eos> A list of supplies for Jughead's birthday party.<eos> You're really falling for this Jones boy, aren't you?<eos> Mom, when you and Dad started dating, did you tell him everything about yourself?
I told your father that you were...<eos> Conflicted about helping him.<eos> "My darling daughter.<eos> If you do not testify on my behalf,<eos> I'm afraid your poor mother might be drawn into this awful mess.<eos> It pains me to say, but she is not nearly as innocent as you believe.<eos> Think carefully about your next move, Veronica.<eos> The rest of your life, and your mother's, will be decided by it."<eos> Hey, I was talking to Kevin.<eos> He told me that you and Chuck had some scene in the cafeteria yesterday.
- Yeah.<eos> And the plot thickens.<eos> Betty.<eos> - You here to roofie me again?<eos> - No, Chuck,<eos> I'm going to ask you to leave.<eos> - Nicely.<eos> - Nicely?<eos> Because, what, you're back to being the nice girl now?<eos> Betty, what you and Veronica did when you guys got me kicked off the football team, you ruined any chance I had of playing for Notre Dame.
- Yeah.<eos> - I'll find out. - Yeah.<eos> You better.<eos> These kids are more on the ball than the Sheriff.<eos> You do know my dad has a drinking problem, right?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I didn't think people would be drinking tonight.<eos> I didn't plan on Chuck and Cheryl, and the rest of the school crashing, okay?<eos> This was supposed to be just your friends.<eos> You and Archie are my friends, okay?
- I'm looking for Melody.<eos> - No, no, no, can we talk?<eos> I just wanted to say what if...<eos> What if we made a mistake?<eos> First of all, we didn't do anything.<eos> I broke up with you because I thought you were a hot mess.<eos> Clearly, I was right.<eos> Wait, Valerie...<eos> What is your problem, Archie?<eos> You shut me out, remember?
- Shh. Everyone has their secrets.<eos> And we've all done our fair share of sinning.<eos> That's one thing my dear brother's death has revealed.<eos> So let's play a little game to get those secrets out in the open.<eos> What the hell is Secrets and Sins?<eos> It's a variation on Truth or Dare. In which we own our truths.<eos> By telling it like it is.<eos> I'll start the game with Veronica Lodge.<eos> - Naturally.<eos> - Let's begin with the day you and your mob wife of a mother came to town for a so-called "fresh start."
Isn't it true that your father, from prison, illegally purchased the drive-in land?<eos> Which makes me wonder. What else is he doing from behind bars?<eos> Well, I can't speak for my father, but I can think of someone with a very dirty secret.<eos> Specifically, Cheryl killing her very own brother.<eos> Everyone knows how much I loved my brother.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But did you love him maybe in ways that a sister shouldn't love a brother?<eos> And as you got older, Jason started to think it was strange, unnatural.<eos> So he chose Polly over you.<eos> So you shot him between the eyes with one of your father's many hunting rifles.
This game is sick.<eos> - I wanna go next.<eos> - That's the spirit, Doiley.<eos> What secrets do you have to reveal to us?<eos> I saw Ms. Grundy's car by Sweetwater River, the day Jason went missing.<eos> I told Betty and Jughead, and then, Ms. Grundy quit her job and left Riverdale, like, two days later.<eos> And let's not forget that Archie was also at the Sweetwater that morning.<eos> Oh, my God, color me shocked, Archie Andrews.<eos> Is that why you became a mediocre musician overnight?<eos> Because you and Ms. Foureyes were pulling a Mary Kay Letourneau?
Leave her the hell alone, Chuck.<eos> Shut up, Andrews.<eos> Look, you may get a free peepshow every night, but you do not know her.<eos> Hell, Betty doesn't even know herself.<eos> Everybody knows why I got suspended.<eos> But what you don't know...<eos> She dressed up like a hooker, in a God-awful black wig, drugged me, handcuffed me in the Jacuzzi, and I almost drowned until she got me to say what she wanted to hear.<eos> And then she really lost it.<eos> She actually thought she was Polly.<eos> But, hey, you knew all about this, right, Jughead?
After what I just saw in there, she needs you.<eos> FP.<eos> As block captain of the Neighborhood Watch, I am obligated to ask you what you're doing on this side of town.<eos> Don't act so high and mighty, Alice.<eos> You may not live on the Southside anymore, you may not dress like you're from the Southside, but we both know the truth.<eos> Snakes don't shed their skin so easily.<eos> Good night, FP.<eos> Now get the hell out of my neighborhood.<eos> You're still hot, Alice.<eos> Too bad you're a stick in the mud.

Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Why Jason Blossom, huh? Out of all the things you could write about, why pick a dead kid?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was sort like he picked me.<eos> Tell the story that no one was gonna tell.<eos> Or even know how to tell.<eos> From the outside, looking in.<eos> Who do you think killed him?<eos> I mean, you and Betty are in this deep.
You really believe that?<eos> My dad paid Jughead's dad to trash the drive-in.<eos> - Maybe he paid him to...<eos> - Commit murder.<eos> And, for all we know, that gay Greaser Serpent is an accomplice.<eos> And what are you basing that off of?<eos> That you saw FP and Joaquin talking?<eos> It didn't look like they were talking. It looked like they were conspiring.<eos> Conspiring about what?<eos> That's what I need you to find out.
-She's a part of this?<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> She's gonna keep FP busy while we search his trailer to find anything that links FP to Jason.<eos> Or, more importantly, FP to my dad. We should just talk to Jughead.<eos> No, what if he's protecting FP or tries to warn him?<eos> He's our friend, Ronnie.<eos> My dad is this close to being released, and my mom's in denial and she's ready to welcome him back with open arms.<eos> Me, I'd like to know exactly who we're inviting back into our lives.<eos> Look, Veronica, I really wanna help you, I do, and I definitely don't want Jughead to get hurt, but I'm telling you, FP's cleaned up his act.<eos> I hope you're right about that, Archie, because if not,
- Mmm. Betty tells me that you're working for Fred Andrews now.<eos> How do you balance that with all of your other responsibilities?<eos> You mean like being a father?<eos> - And being a part of the Southside community.<eos> I'm not ashamed. And it's not just me, there's a bunch of us working on Fred's site.<eos> So, if you don't mind me asking, I mean, I'm just curious, how did you make your living before that?<eos> I scraped by.<eos> Odd jobs.<eos> I know that you worked for the drive-in, Jughead, before it was closed.<eos> Did you find work there, too, FP?
You start in the bedroom, I'll start in here.<eos> You wanted an explanation.<eos> The last time Clifford saw Jason was the day my son washed his hands of our family.<eos> Jason wanted nothing more to do with the Blossom name, nor our lineage.<eos> Including the ring, which he threw in Clifford's face as his final rebuke.<eos> Clifford then gave the ring to me for safekeeping.<eos> I thought the ring had been lost...<eos> Nothing's lost forever.<eos> Everything comes back.<eos> Now. Unless you have any more questions,
Of hell.<eos> - Dad, please.<eos> -No, this is a fun story, I promise.<eos> Fred and me, we were all set to play at the dance.<eos> I was backstage, dropping off our gear when I heard these voices yelling.<eos> It was your mom and dad.<eos> They were fighting about...<eos> About I don't know what.<eos> But it sounded like life or death. Shut up, FP.<eos> Happy to oblige if you are.
For the murder of Jason Blossom.<eos> I'm not a perfect father, Jughead, no getting around that, but...<eos> I'm no killer.<eos> Kevin said someone tipped off his dad, was it you?<eos> - I was at the dance, Betty...<eos> - Answer the damn question, Mom.<eos> And don't lie.<eos> Was it you?<eos> It was not.<eos> But I'm glad that you're safe.
FP has always had his demons.<eos> I really thought he'd changed, Mom, I...<eos> It's very hard for people to change, Archie.<eos> You know, after I heard you play and before everything happened,<eos> I was going to ask you to come to Chicago with me.<eos> To stay.<eos> You could study music.<eos> I'm not even thinking about that right now, Mom.<eos> No, I know, I know.<eos> It's just, I want you with me.
We had to make sure FP wasn't involved in Jason's murder.<eos> And now we know the truth.<eos> He was.<eos> What?<eos> Mom, no. We just told you.<eos> - The gun was planted.<eos> - By whoever killed Jason.<eos> Couldn't you have just missed it?<eos> Yeah, excuse me if I trust the detection skills of an officer of the law over three amateur sleuths.<eos> Mom, you're the one who asked Veronica to break in!
Or maybe, the only friends he has just completely betrayed him.<eos> - Is that him?<eos> - No, it's Veronica.<eos> Hey. You okay?<eos> Not really.<eos> My mom's spiraling, and I'm on the verge.<eos> I just wanted to talk.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm with Betty. We're looking for Jughead. Wait.<eos> You and Betty went on a manhunt without me?
Set up a drop-off point for payment to get him back.<eos> Before I sent word to Blossom, the kid got loose. Tried to escape.<eos> And that's when you shot him and stuffed him in the freezer.<eos> Once things quieted down, and your guys were done dragging Sweetwater River for his body, that's when I dumped it.<eos> The only place we'd already looked.<eos> You break into my house and steal my files? Yeah, I did.<eos> I even followed my son and Betty Cooper to Jason's getaway car, and torched it.<eos> You must've thought you're real smart.<eos> Now, I wanna hear you say it.<eos> Did you kill Jason Blossom?
And he would think that there was some kind of motive.<eos> Wait, you mean about Great-Grandpappy Cooper being murdered by a Blossom?<eos> Betty... Your great-grandfather wasn't just murdered by a Blossom.<eos> He was a Blossom.<eos> After the murder, our family severed ties with the Blossoms and their name, and we took a new one. "Cooper."<eos> I'm... A Blossom?<eos> Polly is a Blossom, which makes her and Jason relatives by blood.<eos> - Which is why you wanted to...<eos> Alice, that's why.<eos> Oh, my God, Hal. If you're willing to send our daughter away to keep her away from Jason...
The guy you got into a fight with at the Wyrm.<eos> I heard him tell FP something about some rich guy.<eos> I don't know who.<eos> - Where is Mustang?<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> You do not want to go see him.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And you're going to take us.<eos> Or... Or I'm going to tell my dad about your little clean-up job.<eos> I'm so glad that you're home, Pol.
Oh, we can't sing it at the Jubilee.<eos> No, my mom already approved Astronaut.<eos> - But my song is about...<eos> - Your friends.<eos> Who've been through hell and back, I get it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Exactly. - Yeah. So...<eos> The Jubilee, that's for the entire town.<eos> Not just your friends.<eos> It's the best thing you've ever written.
You're just as bad as Mayor McCoy.<eos> We're just as bad as this whole town.<eos> The other reason we don't want you publishing this anywhere, is there's been reports of attacks on the Southside.<eos> What?<eos> Betty, people, not just the police, are going after the Serpents.<eos> The whole town agrees with Mayor McCoy.<eos> Crime is spreading.<eos> There's real anger out there, Betty.<eos> And they're needing to focus it somewhere.<eos> Right now, it's the Serpents, and we don't want you suddenly becoming a target.
It's Weatherbee, it's Social Services, it's the entire multiverse telling me that I don't belong here,<eos> - so why don't I just do everyone a favour... - Hey, hey.<eos> You belong here just as much as everyone else.<eos> This is your home.<eos> - You know that, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me guess, for Daddy?<eos> Veronica, wait.<eos> You and Archie... Getting closer?
Yes.<eos> Let me guess, for Daddy?<eos> Veronica, wait.<eos> You and Archie... Getting closer?<eos> Maybe, why do you ask?<eos> Your father and I made Fred an offer to buy out the SoDale contract, but Fred is still on the fence about it.<eos> I was hoping maybe you could talk to Archie. Maybe he could convince Fred to sell?<eos> Yeah, sure, Mom. No problem.<eos> I'll just sexually manipulate Archie into doing my bidding.<eos> As long as you're in control.
Nothing happened at school, it was fine.<eos> Fine?<eos> So, no one wrote on your locker,<eos> "Go to hell, Serpent Slut," and hung a Betty doll from a noose?<eos> Jeez, Poll. Is there anything you didn't tell her?<eos> She wouldn't stop grilling me!<eos> I warned you, Elizabeth, about publishing that article.<eos> - Why do you constantly defy me?<eos> - Because. I'm sick of all the secrets and the lies in this town and in this family.<eos> I would much rather take some heat for being honest than do what you're doing.
- Why do you constantly defy me?<eos> - Because. I'm sick of all the secrets and the lies in this town and in this family.<eos> I would much rather take some heat for being honest than do what you're doing.<eos> Living in fear of the truth.<eos> I am scared for you, Elizabeth, not of the truth.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Let's go then.<eos> You talk a big game about liking Jughead, but wouldn't you be much happier if we weren't together?<eos> Thought so.<eos> Question number two, when you invited FP over for dinner, he said that you and Dad got in a huge fight when you were in high school, at Homecoming.
Your mom ever tell you about that night?<eos> Shut up, FP.<eos> - What was that about?<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, come on, Mom. I saw the look on your face.<eos> You were terrified.<eos> What were you so scared he was going to say?<eos> That is none of your damn business!<eos> Dad was keeping a secret that almost destroyed us.<eos> How many are you keeping?
Hi, hi, everyone.<eos> We're switching things up tonight.<eos> We are singing a song that my boy, Archie Andrews, wrote.<eos> So...<eos> ♪ Every moment we're together ♪<eos> ♪ Is a moment I remember ♪<eos> Sheriff Keller tells me that you still haven't given any names.<eos> He's hoping I can convince you otherwise.<eos> I've been sweating it out, Jug, and, uh, the only conclusion I've come to is that both options suck.<eos> Hey, I wanted to let you know that I... I'm gonna be okay.
We must do better.<eos> Fred.<eos> Have you given any more thought to my offer?<eos> Yes, it is a, uh, very generous offer.<eos> I'm not selling, Hermione.<eos> I told you, it's in your best interest to get out before Hiram comes back.<eos> Is it in your best interests?<eos> What's best for the town?<eos> Didn't you hear Betty?<eos> Riverdale is at a crossroads, and I think you are, too.
I'll fund your IRA.<eos> God, you're a dumb-ass.<eos> The thumb drive?<eos> They hired Swagger to kill us.<eos> Now he's gonna kill them instead.<eos> You arranged this with Swagger?<eos> Worth the risk in order to get my shot at him.<eos> For years, I wanted to be as good as you, but... we both know I'm better now.<eos> I'm the sniper.<eos> You're just a... marksman.

I don't like the unknown.<eos> Then get out of the espionage business.<eos> Perhaps we'll dig a hole for you, Mr. Meachum.<eos> Swagger's gone.<eos> He's got Annex B.<eos> Our mutual friends will not be pleased.<eos> Good-bye, Mr. Meachum.<eos> Hey, you remember the old Ranger station?<eos> Are we in trouble?<eos> I need you and Mary to get there as soon as you can.

We can meet, or I can hunt you down.<eos> Text me the location. - I'll come alone.<eos> - I really don't give a shit.<eos> Just be there.<eos> Bob Lee?<eos> It's Swagger.<eos> He wants to cut a deal.<eos> - You should get going.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You didn't really want to be a part of this anyway.
And you get it out of her head, you're not collaring these guys.<eos> Annex B for your family. Do you understand?<eos> There's no other play.<eos> Fine, but you play for my team until this is over.<eos> Agreed. ♪ If Daddy had to run ♪<eos> ♪ If he had to crawl ♪<eos> ♪ If he had to swim 100 rivers ♪<eos> ♪ Just to climb 1,000 walls ♪<eos> ♪ Always know that he would find a way ♪<eos> ♪ To get to where you are ♪

You're not the one who should be scared.
- Mommy, I'm scared.<eos> - No.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I'm right here. You're not the one who should be scared.<eos> Hold it.<eos> How did our friend take the news?<eos> Meachum is no longer my problem. He failed us one too many times.<eos> That seemed inevitable.<eos> Are you my problem, Lon? You mean because you hired Swagger to kill me for $10 million?<eos> Yeah. My understanding is, you made the same deal.
You tell me to meet you here, then you make me wait?<eos> Gotta to make sure you weren't followed.<eos> You chose to hole up in an FBI front company, and you're worried about me compromising security?<eos> Look around.<eos> That op is over.<eos> Enough.<eos> Is my family alive?<eos> Call this number.<eos> Let me call it in. Calling the FBI is not a part of the plan.<eos> You're not dictating the terms.
Yeah. I'm on my way.<eos> Make sure we lead him to the right room.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Happy hunting.<eos> I need you to get all of this.<eos> MP-5s, pistol ammo, rifle ammo, thermal scope.<eos> A 50 cal? If I sign out this much firepower, it's gonna raise eyebrows.<eos> I don't care. Call it in.<eos> We'll pick it up at the armory on the way.<eos> Okay. Isaac, go get the thermals. You can scope out from across the street.
So you want me to provide overwatch?<eos> No, that would give up your position.<eos> I need you to guide me to family and keep up an eye out for any surprises headed our way.<eos> Okay, what about what she can't see?<eos> What do you think I'm bringing you for?<eos> Are you going somewhere?<eos> Have a drink, Grigory.<eos> Relax. I will have a drink when this business is over.<eos> And since we're now partners, I think it's not out of the question for me to want to know what you are planning.<eos> You're not my partner, and I suggest you show a little more gratitude for the hospitality
Wave me over.<eos> There you go.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - Clear.<eos> My men tell me Swagger still lives.<eos> I would've had Swagger if one of your men hadn't gotten in my way.<eos> Your obsession with Swagger has clouded your judgment.<eos> I'm starting to wonder who I've more to fear from, him or you.<eos> I think you should leave.<eos> I think you are probably correct.
Well... if you feel that way, Grig, perhaps you should take it up with him.<eos> You really want your fate tied to such a man?<eos> Look, if you'd have just paid me, you wouldn't be in this jam.<eos> So quit your bitching.<eos> Lon has a score to settle, and I'm not crossing it.<eos> You have already crossed it.<eos> Yeah, and he let me back in.<eos> So I'm gonna be a good little soldier from this point on.<eos> I'm glad to hear it, but even the most loyal soldier needs someone to cover his flank.<eos> Even you must realize you're expendable.
If you bring the evidence, you have my word I'll release your family.<eos> You don't give a shit about the evidence.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.<eos> I never have.<eos> You can leave the way you came in.<eos> He'll be here.<eos> He never could follow orders.<eos> You want to leave?<eos> You know, if Bob Lee can learn to work with me, you can too.
The exchange is gonna go down at the Great Meadow Golf Course.<eos> We gotta move.<eos> We're gonna need the 50 cal.<eos> Lon Scott wants to take me out with a long shot.<eos> With his skill, he could be shooting from almost any distance with a line of sight.<eos> Don't worry about saving me.<eos> Just make sure Julie and Mary get away safe.<eos> Hey, if something happens to me...<eos> - You're on your way?<eos> Yeah, but I just want to make sure you realize that if you do this,
We have to find Mary. We have to.<eos> Some man took her from the back of the... a van a few minutes ago. - Look, we have to get her.<eos> - We are gonna get her back. - We have to.<eos> - Okay? - No, no.<eos> No.<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> Calm down.<eos> If we lose our heads, we lose everything.<eos> No, listen, listen, you don't... you don't know where she is.<eos> You don't know who took her.
Baby, you just got to hang in a couple more days.<eos> Heard that before.<eos> You can believe me.<eos> We're in field-goal range<eos> I promise it's almost over.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, you remember the old Ranger station?<eos> - Damn right I do.<eos> - Okay, settle down.<eos> I need you and Mary to get there as soon as you can.
That's Meachum and...<eos> That's Grigory Krukov, the FSB officer I mentioned earlier.<eos> Full security detail.<eos> He's not taking any chances.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm moving ringside.<eos> Where is Payne?<eos> Shit, did we forget to send him an evite?<eos> He wants $10 million for the thumb drive.<eos> You screwed up.
Don't call here again.<eos> Lon Scott, Meachum, and Payne, are you not forgetting someone?<eos> Me.<eos> I'd like to kill you.<eos> But if I do, more Russians keep coming.<eos> If I kill them, it's tied off on their side.<eos> But...<eos> I want what you're giving Payne.<eos> What makes you think I want him dead that badly?<eos> 'Cause they're amateurs, and you're thinking about it, which means you still get paid even with them dead.
You kill me, you'll never find out.<eos> Hey, it's a rental.<eos> Next time, it won't just be a muzzle burn. What, kneecaps?<eos> Nuts?<eos> Word of advice, if I bleed out and die, the Russians are gonna be pissed.<eos> I don't give a shit about the Russians.<eos> - Where's the thumb drive?<eos> - Right.<eos> You're still Meachum's errand boy.<eos> Well, he can't have it, and neither can you.

How about you?<eos> Yeah, I remember it.<eos> You know, my accident happened before I got a chance to serve my country.<eos> I serve it now, though.<eos> For years, I wanted to be as good as you.<eos> But we both know I'm better now.<eos> Yeah, the shot that killed the Ukrainian president was a good one, even with your special red bullet.<eos> But try making it when you got grenades landing all around you, command screaming in your ear, and your buddy's bleeding out 20 feet away.<eos> I'm the sniper.<eos> You're just a... marksman.
There'll be no innocents in that hangar today.<eos> Like I told you, if all goes well, all you'll have to do is spot.<eos> But if some shit goes wrong, you keep Payne alive until we get the evidence. Copy?<eos> Copy.<eos> Isaac?<eos> This is some Deep Throat shit.<eos> The situation has grown untenable. No kidding.<eos> Swagger approached me with a deal.<eos> Let me guess. He gets to kill everyone.<eos> In exchange, you leave him alone.

No kidding.<eos> Swagger approached me with a deal.<eos> Let me guess. He gets to kill everyone.<eos> In exchange, you leave him alone.<eos> He wants his life back.<eos> After Swagger has killed Lon Scott, Meachum, and Payne, I'd like you to kill him.
CEO of Anhur Dynamics?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> We've been hiring PMCs to handle off-book black ops.<eos> This has "war crimes" written all over it.<eos> These so-called...<eos> Karlina Ordenko is dead.<eos> I believe a man named Grigory Krukov gave the order to have her killed.<eos> He's a high-ranking member of the FSB.<eos> You're a drunk with a security clearance.<eos> And you're that asshole who thought he could outsmart me.
This will all be over soon.<eos> This is never gonna work.<eos> The embassy is a fortress.<eos> There's no other way. Then give Krukov what he wants.<eos> Honey, if I believed for one second that I could trust that guy,<eos> I would.<eos> The ambassador's at a cocktail party at American University.<eos> He should be there for another two hours.<eos> That should fit.<eos> Okay, Julie, you're up first.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _ _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _ _<eos> Change of plans.<eos> Figured you and Julie'd be halfway to Mexico by now.
Memphis, let's go.<eos> You're gonna need every long gun you can get.<eos> Let me help.<eos> It's not my call.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Does your boss know you're doing this?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna let Swagger die today, and neither are you?
Yeah.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> I'll go door-to-door.<eos> - Officer Rhodes.<eos> - Detective.<eos> What fresh hell we got here?<eos> Well, the vic lives right upstairs.<eos> And... looks to be a straight shot.<eos> Last name Gunn.<eos> You told this asshole you'd look out for him?
So that, my friend, will set the world right on its axis.<eos> And your bowels will thank me later.<eos> Probably like that.<eos> Yeah, but if you turned it around...<eos> If it was like this, if this means anything...<eos> Why do you keep looking at that?<eos> Gunn's now a murder.<eos> Drop seemed odd.<eos> You still worrying over my prints, Jerry?<eos> You're not?
That's twice what I was paying before.<eos> Your account has been inactive for more than 30 days.<eos> Any account that's been inactive for more than 30 days, it's considered fully terminated.<eos> Hi, uh, this is Kimara.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Um, give me one second.<eos> Ishmael?<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I want you to know you're not in trouble.
Are you from around here?<eos> Did you travel here?<eos> Any family you want to talk to? Anybody you want us to contact for you?<eos> How old are you?<eos> Over 18?<eos> 17?<eos> Under 17?<eos> Would you like to talk to the police about...<eos> I don't want to talk to them.<eos> If you just tell them about your pimp...
! Get your hands up!<eos> You all right?<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Other hand.<eos> Check to see if the girl's okay.<eos> I got his hands.<eos> Going!<eos> Shae?<eos> My name is Kimara.<eos> I want you to know you're not in trouble.
Says the man who comes to give me money so he may add the power of my family to his own.<eos> My father is the Prince of Mantua, my Lord.<eos> I am his heir.<eos> And the Capulet name is older even than that of your royal house, Paris.<eos> You think I don't know what my own blood is worth?<eos> Juliet will be well cared for in Mantua.<eos> I give my consent.<eos> Good morning, Mother.<eos> - Father.<eos> - I'm glad you're in a good mood.
To join a nunnery, to turn your back on your own house.<eos> He's my husband!<eos> A secret known only by people who aren't likely to reveal it.<eos> Paris is said to be a handsome man.<eos> Romeo is a handsome man.<eos> And to be married to two men at once would be a sin.<eos> There's no sin in being a widow, and a virgin widow at that.<eos> I'm not... a virgin.<eos> Do you think me a fool?<eos> I think you are young.
I'm not... a virgin.<eos> Do you think me a fool?<eos> I think you are young.<eos> And so is your husband.<eos> In truth, there is only one man I blame for this.<eos> Take this potion, girl, and your body will go cold and still and you will appear to be dead until you wake in the Capulet tomb as if from a pleasant sleep.<eos> Only take one drop.<eos> More than that and you will die.<eos> What dark magic is this, Friar?<eos> It is better, my child, that you do not ask.
She's my fiancée!<eos> No, I assure you, stranger,<eos> Juliet belongs to no man but me.<eos> Why do you lie about the virtue of the dead? - Aah!<eos> - That is not a lie!<eos> Juliet is my wife.<eos> And with a kiss...<eos> I die.<eos> No, no!<eos> How can it be that my own daughter is dead while you and your sister continue to live?
And with a kiss...<eos> I die.<eos> No, no!<eos> How can it be that my own daughter is dead while you and your sister continue to live?<eos> It is generous of me, is it not, to allow you to attend my daughter's funeral?<eos> Is it not?<eos> It's no more than Juliet would have wanted.<eos> My Lady.<eos> Livia is so very gracious.<eos> You never seem to appreciate anything I've done for you.
- Livia!<eos> - No!<eos> Livia!<eos> Livia!<eos> Livia!<eos> Stay with me, Rosaline.<eos> My men will find us.<eos> I can't. My sister...<eos> Is on her own, wherever she may be.<eos> But you, right now, are safe.
Milan to the west and Venice to the east, and between them, our fair city of Verona... a jewel just waiting to be taken by anyone with an army strong enough to overcome us.<eos> And trust me when I tell you that if we're attacked by the Medici or the Papal States or anyone else, the quarrels of local families will mean absolutely nothing.<eos> We must have peace, no matter the cost.<eos> Escalus, Verona is burning.<eos> You saw them wed? !<eos> Did you not see that Lady Capulet has lost her mind?<eos> We need to leave here.<eos> She told me she plans to make our lives even more miserable than they already are.<eos> Our lives or just yours?<eos> The world believes Romeo and Juliet were a pair of youths caught up in forbidden passion, but now you say they were man and wife, bound by God, with you as their witness?
Hush!<eos> Girl.<eos> By royal decree, I, Escalus, Royal Prince and sole sovereign of the city of Verona do herefore order the marriage of Rosaline Capulet and Benvolio Montague to cement your families as allies, not rivals.<eos> If Montague and Capulet cannot coexist as two, they must become one.<eos> Our city's survival depends upon it.<eos> Uncle, her?<eos> You consented to marrying a Capulet maiden.<eos> A maiden, yes, but not this... harpy.<eos> And I never consented at all.<eos> You will do as you are told.
- It's not just me, right?<eos> This happens.<eos> People develop feelings for their lawyer because they're dependent and they're scared.<eos> But it isn't real.<eos> - We should go.<eos> - Everyone thinks I killed Amy.<eos> Everyone... her mom, probably some members of my own family.<eos> And I keep trying to tell myself that it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, as long as I know what's true.<eos> But it matters to me what you think.<eos> And I need you to know I didn't kill her.
You may step down, sir.<eos> You're excused.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> It was my voir dire, and you made me look like an ass.<eos> He had an uncle who was "mental."<eos> It wasn't gonna take 45 minutes to figure out this guy wasn't gonna be sympathetic to Lester.<eos> Okay, well, then you could have pulled me aside, 'cause now the judge and Holland think that I'm an idiot.<eos> You're a second-year associate. Nobody's thinking about you at all.<eos> Okay, well, you want to know what I think?<eos> I think that you are cracking under pressure and you are making stupid, rash decisions, and you are taking it out on me and...
I went to ask Billy if he knew where she was.<eos> The cat was sleeping beside him.<eos> When he rolled over, it got mad and scratched him on the cheek.<eos> What can I say?<eos> The cat was an ass.<eos> It's not gonna be easy to explain the coincidence of the cat scratch to a jury.<eos> Did you cut yourself shaving?<eos> Or did you murder someone last night, Mr. Cobb?<eos> That is one tough woman.<eos> Speaking of tough women, have you and Gemma set a wedding date?
- Yeah, a little.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Calls for speculation.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just...<eos> I haven't been back here since that night.<eos> So, you and Amy left a Halloween party at a neighbor's house, which was...?
The smart one or the other one?<eos> The other one.<eos> And that's not nice.<eos> The kid finally bailed?<eos> You're looking for dirt on Michael Slater?<eos> So we're back to the plea. Yeah.<eos> It's a good deal.<eos> How am I gonna look Billy in the eye and tell him two years in jail and being a convicted felon for the rest of his life, is a good deal?<eos> You're a great lawyer, Sadie.<eos> Like, I spend way too much of my free time hating on you for being so good, but not even you can overcome a credible witness.
There was a fire at the 93rd precinct in 2006. A bunch of evidence was moved.<eos> It has her blood on it.<eos> And they just discovered it has somebody else's blood on it, too.<eos> I have to ask you what your blood type is.<eos> Billy's bloody type is O negative.<eos> It's not a big deal. A lot of people are O negative.<eos> I'm probably O negative.<eos> You're A positive.<eos> - How do you know my blood type?<eos> - How do you not?
And our client's blood type matches the blood on the murder weapon.<eos> I would say that's a very big deal.<eos> We need to get the weapon thrown out.<eos> Allowing the scepter into evidence is a miscarriage of justice.<eos> There was a clear break in the chain of custody, causing a significant likelihood the evidence was tainted.<eos> These issues of custody go to weight, not admissibility.<eos> That rule doesn't apply in cases where the police mishandle the evidence.<eos> You raise a valid point, Counselor.<eos> I'd like to submit my blood.<eos> I talk, you don't.
You need to keep your freakin' mouth shut and let the trained professionals do their work!<eos> I'm telling you it's gonna be exculpatory.<eos> What, did you watch a couple episodes of Law Order and now you're a lawyer?<eos> - Albert.<eos> - What? !<eos> Can you give us a minute alone, please?<eos> Without physical evidence connecting you to the murder, we have reasonable doubt.<eos> We have it.<eos> But with you offering them your blood and spit on a silver platter, who the hell knows what they're gonna find?<eos> You don't, Perry Mason.
What are you doing?<eos> I was winning in there.<eos> I'm trying to prove my innocence. You don't have to.<eos> It's on Ferretti to prove you're guilty.<eos> My blood isn't gonna match. I can prove that I didn't kill her.<eos> We're going back in there and you are going to apologize to the judge.<eos> What are you so afraid of?<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> This is about some evidence that shouldn't be allowed in.<eos> This is about you letting me do my job.
- Lester, we won.<eos> - Thank you, jurors.<eos> We are now in adjournment.<eos> I was gonna buy you a drink, but it looks like you're all over that.<eos> Our client's on his way to a mental institution, and we're supposed to be celebrating?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know I shouldn't let this stuff get to me.<eos> Maybe I should just move back to Iowa.<eos> I don't know if I'm cut out for this.<eos> The fact that you're having these feelings means you're good at your job.
We can't.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Please let me go.<eos> You're gonna redo these.<eos> Sadie, what's going on?<eos> Mention the state trooper you killed by name,<eos> Joseph Thomas.<eos> And his wife Marilyn and his four children,<eos> Joe Jr., Tara, Siobhan and Peter.<eos> It's important that you say their names.
Danny was a scholar, you know?<eos> He was studying for his PhD in physics.<eos> He had a big future, Mr. Stone.<eos> I know how painful this must be.<eos> He had dinner with us every Sunday night.<eos> The night that he was killed...<eos> They know all this, honey.<eos> We usually walked him to the bus stop.<eos> That night... I was too tired, and you had to watch your game.
But they did nothing.<eos> They didn't want to be called bigots.<eos> I did something.<eos> I'm a good American.<eos> I'm a hero.<eos> I am not a criminal.<eos> Thank you, Jafar.<eos> Now it looks like we're prosecuting a damn hero.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> I don't have videos like that on my cell phone. Do you?
Yes, but we'll never know for sure, will we?<eos> Besides, Jafar's the one on trial, not Danny.<eos> Somehow I doubt a jury of patriots will see it that way.<eos> What?<eos> Me, I never fought in a war, but my nephew, Eddie, he's overseas right now.<eos> Now, we keep in touch with that Skype thing.<eos> Last month, he gets in touch with me and he lets me know that his best buddy over there... he stepped on an IED, and he... blew his legs off.<eos> I started to tell him just how sorry I was, but he cut me off.<eos> "No, no, Uncle Billy," he says, "No.<eos> We do it so you don't have to."
Harold, make yourself known.<eos> Rachel's here.<eos> She wants to talk to you.<eos> He's here.<eos> He wants you to know he thinks the new haircut is hot.<eos> 32 years we're married. Now that you're dead, you like it short.<eos> Harold says he was stupid.<eos> - He hated change.<eos> - God, Harold. Not a day goes by I don't miss you something awful.<eos> He doesn't want you to grieve him forever.

- It won't be long.<eos> - I don't want to die.<eos> You'll be an angel up in Heaven with God.<eos> We cast you out, every unclean spirit...<eos> - Every legion!<eos> My own children leave me here to rot!<eos> Go to hell!<eos> Company pull!<eos> Hey.<eos> You must be Manfred.
Well, no harm in asking.<eos> You got the place for a month.<eos> You need it any longer... I know where to find you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> _<eos> Does this look like a Walmart? No.<eos> I don't provide crayons.<eos> Amuse your own children.<eos> I'd like to place an order to go.<eos> You're Manfred.
It's where we sit.<eos> Except the Rev. He eats alone.<eos> Now that you live here, you eat with us.<eos> So if Midnighters eat there then...<eos> The rest of the folks are ranchers, folks from Davy. - Well, I don't want to bother.<eos> - You're not.<eos> It's usually more crowded.<eos> Folks are getting ready for tomorrow.<eos> It's the Annual Fall Picnic. You should come.<eos> Well, if you'll be there.

You should come.<eos> Well, if you'll be there.<eos> You meet your neighbors yet? Sort of.<eos> You're the non-musician.
Usually I'm the freak in the room.<eos> So, uh... none of this neck thing?<eos> Oh, that's always on the menu.<eos> Madonna's pot roast special.<eos> See, I told you you'd like it.<eos> So, if you want, I could stop by your place tomorrow and we could go to the picnic.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I'm spent.<eos> You'll feel better in the morning.<eos> I'll have to miss it, but you should go.
- Why ours? - Luck, I suppose.<eos> Do you work for the police or any law enforcement agency?<eos> - Were you sent here<eos> - to find someone?<eos> - No. - Did my dad send you?<eos> - Y-your dad?<eos> No!<eos> I'm getting bored and hungry.<eos> Okeydoke, this could go sideways real fast.<eos> I don't want that. You don't want that.
They showed up my door. I didn't want to give them my secrets. So I gave 'em Aubrey's.<eos> I-I'm done with the questions and getting punched in the face, thank you.<eos> So either end it already or let me get dressed.<eos> Untie him.<eos> He's one of us.<eos> Midnight has been a haven for people like us for centuries.<eos> Some, like Xylda, stop for a bit and move on.<eos> Others, like us, make this home.<eos> Wait, everyone here is..<eos> - What are you?
Of course. Apologies for the little misunderstanding.<eos> This is usually a quiet and peaceful town.<eos> Looking for me?<eos> So you killed Aubrey because you found out the truth about her?<eos> You're not welcome here.<eos> 'Cause we know the truth about you.<eos> Where'd you hide the weapons, the money?<eos> They don't belong to you.<eos> Tell me that... maybe you live to see sunrise.<eos> I think you misjudged the situation.
You can always count on him to help.<eos> I wonder what brought him and Chuy to this place.<eos> Bobo never talks about family or where he came from, but he's sweet and kind.<eos> And you will never meet a more honest person than Bobo.<eos> The Rev, I still haven't figured him out.<eos> I've seen him pull a gravestone out of the ground with one hand and he's completely obsessed with his pet cemetery.<eos> I know Fiji's more than just a New Age cat lady, but she doesn't have a mean bone in her body.<eos> Rev's gearing up.<eos> Case you didn't notice. I'm busy.<eos> Whatever you're doing there, won't do no good.
But since I have to call the police every time I want to leave town, I had to say no.<eos> You seem angry.<eos> That's an understatement.<eos> Perhaps I can take some of that from you.<eos> I was wondering when you'd ask.<eos> Midnight's weird, but it's home.<eos> Yeah, never lived in any one place for very long.<eos> - There.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Well, you fit in pretty well here.
Okay.<eos> Um, I'll go old-school.<eos> - Just give me your hand.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Your life line's long, varied.<eos> Will be an interesting life.<eos> You're, uh...<eos> Uh, and here, you'll meet your soul mate.<eos> Ah, you may already have.<eos> Someone who... sees how special you really are.
- What's the point?<eos> - Yeah, I know, right?<eos> I like making bad decisions.<eos> All I know is they are paying me to heighten the awareness to the brand.<eos> So, are you going to stay for dinner?<eos> Hmm, let me see - stay and have a nice home cooked meal with you and the kids or go home and listen to Stevie tell me the scientific reasons why the "Walking Dead" could never happen?<eos> Yeah, I think I'll stay here.<eos> All right.<eos> Um, did you talk to Marley about our meeting with Ms. Frye?<eos> No, you said never to parent when you're not in the room.
Is that more important than spending quality time - with your family?<eos> - Dad!<eos> I used the fort toilet!<eos> Son, come on!<eos> That's your mama's Crock-Pot!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - See? That proves that you need a night out.<eos> Yeah, but he made family plans to see "Slaughter Camp."<eos> It ain't always about Marlon.<eos> Girl, you're the one who ended this marriage.
Turn up!<eos> Turn up! - Okay, stop, stop!<eos> Okay, I think it's time we put our phones away.<eos> Marley...<eos> Daddy and I need to talk to you.<eos> Ooh, Marley's in trouble!<eos> This is new!<eos> No one is in trouble, Zack.<eos> Okay? Marley, we sat with your counselor today.<eos> She said that you seem a bit withdrawn, and we just want to make sure that you're okay.
Listen, white people are genetically predisposed to fear black people.<eos> - Marley...<eos> - Google it!<eos> Okay, Marley, just talk to the girls.<eos> You tell them bullying is wrong.<eos> What in "The Brady Bunch" are you talking about?<eos> No, Marley, listen to Daddy.<eos> Okay, if them girls step to you, you just got to act a little ghetto.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> They come at you, you gotta be like, "Oh, hell no!
Hell no!<eos> Hell to the no!<eos> - Are you done?<eos> - Hell no.<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> It's them shoes.<eos> I should've known something was up when I seen them shoes.<eos> See, those are ho shoes.<eos> - They're Yvette's.<eos> You know, I can't believe you lied to me.
Do you want that for our son?<eos> Seriously, Ash, seeing their mother with another man?<eos> That could be traumatic for them.<eos> That could lead to serious depression.<eos> They really wanted to show me the fort.<eos> He doesn't even know the password.<eos> This is a really beautiful restaurant, Devon.<eos> - For a beautiful woman.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So your ex-husband, were you two together
Oh, yeah, and I hear you, but you know, you just don't want to leave garbage cans out, you know?<eos> God forbid one of our kids get mauled by a bear.<eos> I saw "The Revenant", and if a bear gon' do that to Leonardo DiCaprio, imagine what it's going to do to our son's little black ass.<eos> But your date's more important than the potential death of our son.<eos> - Give us a second, Jeff.<eos> - It's Devon.<eos> Marlon, why are you here?<eos> Because I did some research on the Internet, and I dug up some dirt on your boy Devon over there.<eos> - What did you find out, Marlon?<eos> - Well, I'm glad you asked.
What's the password? Can we please not do this right now?<eos> What's the one thing in the world the kids and I cannot live without?<eos> I am not in the mood for this.<eos> What is the one thing in this world the kids and I cannot live without?<eos> Me?<eos> You may enter.<eos> What happened tonight, Marlon?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I panicked, I guess. Over one date?<eos> You've been on hundreds of dates since we separated.
And we don't have time for it.<eos> I am not you or Fitz, so...<eos> You have nothing to worry about.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> Fine.<eos> *SCANDAL (2012)* Season 06 Episode 02 "Hardball"<eos> Frankie Vargas has been shot.<eos> Reporter ♪2: Literally killed for this job.<eos> I know you killed him, and I'm going to prove it.
Who told me to do that?<eos> The election is over, Liv.<eos> And so is this meeting.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> Frankie Vargas' funeral is tomorrow.<eos> I want this case locked down.<eos> That won't stop Liv.<eos> As long as she still believes She has a shot at the oval<eos> - with Mellie, any shot... - I'll take care of Mellie.<eos> You make sure we get that confession.
I can make a stronger appeal to them, yes.<eos> Well, they actually still watch Baseball. And throwing out the first pitch at Nationals Park is a good way to make a strong appeal.<eos> In two weeks?<eos> You can do this.<eos> You have me. I'm gonna teach you everything I know.<eos> I'm rich.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> We could afford a professional to teach me how to do this.<eos> I can see why you don't have many friends.<eos> I am just sure you have better things to do with your night off.
The FBI.<eos> How is it?<eos> Well, I'm the boss, so, you know, No one's gonna actually comment, But, you know, I get the look.<eos> The usual "how did you get here" glance.<eos> I love the glance.<eos> And the "you must be in the wrong place" smile.<eos> "The service entrance is in the back" handshake. Hmm?<eos> Angela drives a nice ride.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Well, I'm glad that you're here.
- I respect you.<eos> I mean...<eos> President Grant is very...<eos> Attractive?<eos> Magnetic?<eos> - Charismatic?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But no, nothing has happened between us.<eos> Nothing.<eos> And it's important to me that you know that.
Attractive?<eos> Magnetic?<eos> - Charismatic?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But no, nothing has happened between us.<eos> Nothing.<eos> And it's important to me that you know that.<eos> Okay.<eos> And nothing ever will.<eos> Unless you give me the green light.
Allow you to bother my boss with a matter that's already been taken care of?<eos> Like I said, he's a busy man.<eos> This most certainly has not been taken care of, Abby. Not when the White House has decided to pin Frankie Vargas' assassination on the wrong guy.<eos> Mcclintock confessed to everything... to planning his attack for months to gaining his access to forged press credentials To his ties to various White-Supremacist Groups.<eos> - He confessed.<eos> - Because you forced him to sign some ridiculous paper.<eos> - That just isn't true.<eos> - Abby, how could you?<eos> How could you manage to do something so terrible, - something so beneath you?<eos> - What was it you said, Liv?
- Because you forced him to sign some ridiculous paper.<eos> - That just isn't true.<eos> - Abby, how could you?<eos> How could you manage to do something so terrible, - something so beneath you?<eos> - What was it you said, Liv?<eos> Sometimes we have to do what's necessary - No matter the conequences.<eos> - Don't you dare.<eos> That is what I am doing, Olivia...<eos> My job. I am protecting this office.<eos> No, you're destroying it.
Mellie got out on that Baseball field and she sold it.<eos> America's pastime for the win.<eos> Abby...<eos> I may need a favor from you.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's about Marcus.<eos> I think he and Mellie...<eos> I think there's something happening between them.<eos> Okay.<eos> I may need you to offer him a job at the White House...
I may need you to offer him a job at the White House...<eos> Something big, something he can't turn down.<eos> Is it just a fling, or...<eos> I think it's more than that.<eos> I see.<eos> So, I'd be helping you break them up<eos> The way you broke up me and David.<eos> We're making the President happy.<eos> We do whatever's necessary, No matter the consequences.<eos> Did you get Marcus the press secretary job?

Back and forth, Hemming and hawing about marrying Charlie.<eos> It's a big decision. And?<eos> And I made it quickly without thinking.<eos> - And?<eos> - And he's done horrible, terrible things.<eos> - And?<eos> - And...<eos> And he's old!<eos> And he somehow loves you.<eos> And you somehow love him,
- I am not scared.<eos> - Then what?<eos> What is stopping you from accepting something That most people never have? What?<eos> Share your life.<eos> Because you're not tethered to power.<eos> Because you live below the radar.<eos> Because you're free from it.<eos> Because you can.<eos> You are being offered normal, maybe even happy.<eos> The fact that you're questioning whether you should take them, Frankly, it's annoying.
I've been going through Jennifer's video footage.<eos> You're gonna want to see this.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> There's something you need to see.<eos> I hate the fact that I ever trusted you!<eos> What you did is vile!<eos> Inexcusable!<eos> Frankie, please.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> No, what you don't understand is the moment I'm elected President of the United States, My first order of business will be to put you in the coldest jail cell possible.
Well, your vitals all look good.<eos> How's the little man? How's Col?<eos> Good.<eos> Real good. Yeah, Dr. Reid's operating right now, transplanting a quarter of your liver.<eos> You're saving our son.<eos> I don't know. Maybe this is the drugs talking but...<eos> I want to try this again... us.<eos> Yeah. We can be like a little family again.<eos> Hey.<eos> And you can look after our little boy.
It's not over, Danny.<eos> I'm tired of running, I'm tired of hiding.<eos> It's a good thing you did today.<eos> Man, that's the best thing that I've ever done.<eos> Which isn't saying much.<eos> For the first time in my life, I'm at peace.<eos> I just wish I could see my boy one more time.<eos> I think we can arrange that.<eos> Bile flow is good.<eos> Most beautiful purple you ever saw.
Missed a spot.<eos> This is exactly as bad as it looks, and, of course, the Boy Wonder came by and got himself a nice little eyeful, didn't he?<eos> It's been a day.<eos> You know, I could kill him, make it look like an accident.<eos> You're too pretty for prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't know you came out here, too.
I just hope Colin knows how much his dad loved him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry I lied.<eos> I just feel like I don't...<eos> I don't see him anymore.<eos> Well, you can see him any time you want.<eos> Yeah, you say that, but it's not happening.<eos> And I miss my son.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're... you're right.
- What did Jason Hodges want?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Wait, he didn't try to ask you out, did he?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Shut up, Greg.<eos> No, you're right, that would be way too weird.<eos> You're not one of those Jason Hodges type of girls anyway.<eos> And what exactly is a Jason Hodges type girl?<eos> You know, like, um... no makeup, effortlessly gorgeous, uh, does well at parties...<eos> You're more of a "no makeup, uh, I don't care what people think about me, I'd rather be at home gaming" type girl.
They've canceled classes and everything.<eos> - Okay... that's enough.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> We're gonna continue the tour.<eos> You think they'll make us go back to school?<eos> Ten million dollars.<eos> You have to understand our situation.<eos> Sarah, were you aware... your husband was embezzling from the endowment?
She loved that. - The Daily Herald.<eos> Great job.<eos> I cannot believe that you talked to her before you talked to me.<eos> Well, I wanted her input.<eos> What about my input?<eos> It's my life!<eos> You can't just send me four states away and expect my perfect sister to fix me.<eos> We never said she would fix...<eos> I'm tired of student council and all the clubs that I run, and everything that I have to do and be responsible for every day.<eos> - But you're so good at it, Dakota.
In three days?<eos> That's not the point.<eos> The point is that we can do this.<eos> What?<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> I don't know, why?<eos> It's an alarm that I was making for my room, but I was hoping if I handed it to you... you'd start playing with it and I could probably use it to prove a point.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Good work, Benny.<eos> Hodges, you are not in this class.
What can you do?<eos> What's your thing?<eos> Alibis, planning, covers.<eos> You know how serious I am about organization.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> She used to color code our entire dating schedule. - Mmm.<eos> - It was horrible.<eos> Thoughtful. It was very thoughtful.<eos> I also act, so I have access to the theater wardrobe department, for anything that we need as far as covers go.<eos> - You act?
You know what?<eos> I can't do next week either, Greg.<eos> Fine.<eos> Friday night gaming is permanently canceled.<eos> Fine.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> What, is he on to us?<eos> No, he's just an idiot.<eos> So what are we doing?<eos> Glad you changed your mind.
That's not my fault, Hodges.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> - Bye, guys.<eos> - See you.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> You shouldn't be.<eos> He shouldn't have said that.<eos> You're, uh... you're better than that.
That's good.<eos> You've made IDs before?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I've made a few.<eos> - I'm not a criminal, you know.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, that's not what I meant at all.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's not okay.<eos> I know what it feels like to have people expect you to be something that you're not.
And I didn't even do it for the extra cash, you know, it was...<eos> It was for people in my neighborhood who were getting stopped by immigration.<eos> Sometimes at Dennington, I feel like the people that I made those IDs for.<eos> I'm always being watched by these people who are just waiting for me to mess up.<eos> I really don't think that's true.<eos> I mean, they gave you a scholarship.<eos> Yeah, because I'm smart.<eos> I want to go to college.<eos> I want to be an engineer.<eos> I think it's great that you know what you want to do.

I saw your mom was packing all this stuff up herself, so...<eos> Okay, well, I'm here now.<eos> Jason, please, I don't want you to think of me as the bad guy here.
They know he broke the law.<eos> There's no way around it.<eos> And even with a plea deal, he's gonna do time.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We got practice at Max's.<eos> I'm just dropping off some of your stuff.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought you were driving.
Did you find out about the scholarship?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Well, when are you gonna find out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Soon.<eos> We need to know so we can make a plan in case it doesn't come through.<eos> I'll talk to them tomorrow.<eos> I thought I saw you down here.<eos> Why aren't you at Junibel's party?<eos> What are you still doing at school?
- Have it figured out.<eos> So I think, if they're cheating, then why can't we cheat the system a little bit?<eos> If the adults are the ones who mess things up, then why do they get to tell us how it's gonna be?<eos> That's just the thing,<eos> I don't know that I'm the kind of guy who...<eos> I don't know, um...<eos> Who finishes sentences?<eos> Who finishes anything, apparently.<eos> You're doing your best, I think.<eos> How are you always so cool about everything?
Right... and after we're finished, you'll just pretend that I don't exist.<eos> No, that's not what I'm saying.<eos> - I just think that...<eos> - Sure.<eos> If you need a grade, or a schedule change, or to break into a government institution, I'm sure I'll be the first person you call.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I thought you never come to these things.<eos> I, um... kind of figured you'd be here, so...<eos> Well, I'm glad you did.
I was thinking about what you said.<eos> I was thinking about it a lot, actually.<eos> I'm sorry we didn't get to talk more. That was stupid. So I...<eos> We... we can't.<eos> Hey, there's your girlfriend.<eos> Hey, Benny.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Not used to seeing you at these things.<eos> Guess I didn't realize I needed your permission to come to someone else's party.<eos> No, just, you're in North Philly, right?
I don't...<eos> What, do you want me to say it's okay, so you don't have to feel bad?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No. No, I get it.<eos> You gotta look out for you.<eos> None of these people care about you.<eos> Isn't that what you said?<eos> No, I said they don't know the real me.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> You're exactly what all these people think you are.
This is over.<eos> Alice, take the coin out of production.<eos> Delete it.<eos> Jason...<eos> Just do it.<eos> Good job.<eos> You know what? Yeah.<eos> This was a shit idea from the very start.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I'm sorry you have to see me like this.
I am not singing.<eos> When we were still together, you helped me write practically every single one of them.<eos> There would be no band without you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let me see the set list.<eos> So you made sure we're on the HVAC schedule, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> And Dakota called and... said that the regular HVAC guys won't be there, right?<eos> Yeah, she called and sent an e-mail.<eos> And you're gonna be able to loop the security footage?
- What's wrong with us two?<eos> - Nothing. Follow me.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're only gonna have five minutes until the feeds are live, after I reset the security cameras.<eos> Alice, I don't...<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry about what I said the other day.<eos> It's just...<eos> You know, I like you.
Come on.<eos> Have you guys seen Hodges and Dakota?<eos> Guys, have you seen Hodges and Dakota?<eos> Okay, it's our job to chaperone.<eos> Hey, I thought you had a project due tonight.<eos> We just turned it in, actually.<eos> Then why are you just standing here looking so miserable?<eos> I'm sorry, Greg.<eos> For what?<eos> You were right.

Dakota, that was incredible.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Can you play the next one without me?<eos> - You're the lead guitarist, we can't.<eos> - Great job.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You, too.<eos> Wait like five minutes.<eos> Hey, look, you can't be back here.
- I don't know.<eos> - I know this is hard, but you can't just walk around pretendin' like it's not happenin'.<eos> You have to face it.<eos> I know what's happening.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What's that?<eos> This cancer, it's a message... from God, and he's showin' me the path that I have to travel.<eos> Well, what-what path is that?<eos> That I have to be of use with what precious time that I've got left.<eos> Well, I mean... regardless of whatever, you know, celestial message you're receiving', there's still practicalities to take care of. There's treatment.

Stubborn one?<eos> Well, boy, you'll learn.<eos> Hey, you're gonna hurt yourself.<eos> Medical ain't no better.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> I killed my mother.<eos> I killed Lady Ray.<eos> I took the oak in a manner impure.<eos> And the punishment for this, for all that I've done, be banishment.<eos> You are the rightful Bren'in.
- No, don't speak.<eos> You know, one of the happiest days of my life was the day that I heard you were shot dead.<eos> The only thing that made me sad was that I didn't get to bury you.<eos> Well, maybe you'll get your wish... soon enough.<eos> No, you see, that's not our way.<eos> It's what I deserve.<eos> Maybe Asa'll come around and finish the job.<eos> Asa?<eos> Asa's dead, Foster.<eos> And yet, here you stand.
Stitches worse than the wound.<eos> You do that yourself? No.<eos> They were done to me.<eos> In a house of horrors, the likes of which I hope you never see.<eos> You come to heal me?<eos> I don't want it on my head you dyin' alone in the woods.<eos> Hey, leave us.<eos> Go.<eos> I forgive you for what you done.<eos> You forgive me?
See how far it goes. But, Hasil, don't be startin' any trouble.<eos> Stay on our side for now.<eos> The law of the mountain says all this is ours.<eos> We're straying' from that completely.<eos> You got somethin' to say, cousin, say it plain.<eos> That man, he almost killed us all, and now you think about lettin' him back in.<eos> If you think I'm the only one that's got a problem with that, Bren'in, then you foolin' yourself.<eos> I hear you.<eos> I'm just threading' the needle is all.<eos> I need you to trust me.
Stories about this... this mountain... and that the-the natives here, the Cherokee, they called it Blood.<eos> The ga-ha-gedane.<eos> Blood Mountain, they named it, yes.<eos> Well, these scary tales she told, they were of a clan, a cult of thieves, evildoers, of witches.<eos> She said they were called the Kenna.<eos> Yes, I heard those stories as a girl myself.<eos> Fairy tales, I believe they are called, Foster.<eos> And so, these Kenna, you don't fear them?<eos> Would you if they were men?<eos> You fear all women, don't you?
Strong as you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Just one who's joined my people to yours and worries for the fate of both in the tryin' times to come.<eos> So, you're plannin' on bein' here a while then.<eos> We have no other place to go.<eos> Well, you are meddling' awfully high, awfully soon, for someone with no place else to go.<eos> You're right.<eos> You and yours, you got here not days ago.<eos> You're new to our clan, but sometimes the freshest eyes, they don't see shit.<eos> You love her, and that love is at war with another feelin'.
It's gonna be steep even with the insurance.<eos> I'm gonna sell the house.<eos> If I do a bit of work on it, it'll drive up the value, and, you know, we can pay the whole thing off in installments, cut a few expenses, and, I'm more than willin' to take on a night job.<eos> Maybe I can do somethin' in security.<eos> Wade, listen.<eos> - I'm not gettin' treatment.<eos> - What?<eos> I appreciate all that you are tryin' to do.<eos> I don't care if you appreciate it or not.<eos> You're gettin' treatment. No.
Well, if that's your intent, you're gonna be frightful occupied for the next couple of years.<eos> I was sick.<eos> Robbed of reason, but I'm better, now... and I'm ready to right my wrongs and serve my family.<eos> I'm ready to be a tall, handsome man with regular-size ears.<eos> That ain't likely to happen neither.<eos> A man can change.<eos> A man, yes.<eos> There ain't gonna be no more jackanapin' around.<eos> Bren'in, she's countin' on us to keep watch down below, and we are gonna do it proper from this moment on.<eos> It ain't half funny how you preaching' down on us when you're the one who come back with a mouse under his eye.
He's high on his horse, bossing' down on us.<eos> And we gotta be all serious now.<eos> Skinny little eight-fingered tinpot!<eos> You know, how 'bout this?<eos> How 'bout we take this little run in town and grab us some cold beers?<eos> That sounds a mite better than walkin' that fool fence, - doesn't it?<eos> - Why, it surely does, but how we gonna get around that fence?<eos> Well, I know me a spot.<eos> We just do us a little diggin' and squeeze on under.<eos> As long as you suck in that gut!
Draw the thing that's going to keep you alive, because, son, you're going to need it.<eos> Hey, Jenny... Fill that up.<eos> Ain't you got coffee at headquarters, Wade?<eos> Battery acid is more like it.<eos> Coffee's on me, Jenny.<eos> It's okay, Henry, I got it.<eos> Your money's no good here, Sheriff.<eos> Let me get in on the good side of the law.<eos> Might kill my wife any day now.<eos> Gonna need you to turn a blind eye.
"Look what I did;<eos> Because after your recent... accident, you want to put all that talk in town to rest?<eos> You need a win.<eos> You hear?<eos> Damn it.<eos> I just thought that since she's carryin' a Farrell child, maybe... maybe she could stay.<eos> Never before has an outsider been allowed to live among us.<eos> Never as far as I know, but, , I mean, we got the Kenna here now.<eos> The Kenna are of this mountain.<eos> The clans look at folks one way... either you're kin or you're not... and your girl ain't kin.
We allow it to find us.<eos> Mother Mountain... lead the most considerable of your creatures to us so that we may be sustained during the long winter to come.<eos> And let tomorrow's hunt be remembered for years to come as one of the most bountiful in the history of all the clans.<eos> And now... we celebrate!<eos> You can go if you want.<eos> I ain't gonna leave you.<eos> Plus it's better this way.<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> Three of us.<eos> I just want you to know that whatever happens...
- You think so?<eos> - Yeah, oh yeah.<eos> - All right!<eos> How you doin', Foster? Hey, year after year, you always capture the biggest prize.<eos> Don't see why the rest of us even try!<eos> Well, I've been at it longer than you, boy.<eos> Take your purpose a little more serious.<eos> Maybe next time you can bring in somethin' bigger than a chipmunk.<eos> My Bren'in pleased?<eos> Well, I think you proved that you're our best hunter.
You're like a beetle up my backside, ain't you?<eos> You see, this is what comes for allowing' the devil back in and straightaway putting' him in charge of the hunt!<eos> If you got somethin' to say, Shurn, just say it.<eos> Kenna women out-hunted him!<eos> Made him look like a fool, so he burned up all the game outta spite!<eos> Better you watch your crooked tongue!<eos> Perhaps the woman is right.<eos> I've heard stories of your past cruelties.<eos> Hot-headedness can lead a man to do all manner of destructive things.<eos> Yeah, well, you ain't one of us, all right?

This is my home.<eos> You know the money's permit finally is gone<eos> If you knew whats up there... you would be... What?<eos> Whatever you think we have up here, is going away, and soon.<eos> What should I'd do?<eos> Show them who we are.<eos> They don't own the land where we live on.<eos> I wonder why<eos> And if you come up that mountain, you aint going to<eos> I'm sure you are a woman and I'm a man, but

Wade.<eos> Wade, Wade, we gotta get outta here!<eos> Sheriff?<eos> He's awake!<eos> Wade...<eos> What happened?<eos> You hear that?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> It's what you wanted.<eos> You're the Bren'in now.
Let's go.<eos> Doesn't change anything now.<eos> I'm still gonna get the person that killed Breece.<eos> I don't blame them anymore for Breece's death.<eos> I don't.<eos> I blame that company and that woman.<eos> The minute he started that job, everything went to hell.<eos> Turn off the television.<eos> I'm gonna get the man who did it.<eos> I don't want you goin' back up that mountain.
They're lost, and you know what,<eos> I hope they rot in whatever hell they're walking towards, you understand me?<eos> Hey, brother, I didn't mean nothin' by it.<eos> You people never do.<eos> You have a good night, now.<eos> Bronnlagh brenairah sli ayn-clan, ayn sah-wyl myrlagh un-Bren'in.<eos> Bronnlagh brenairah sli ayn-clan, ayn sah-wyl myrlagh un-Bren'in.<eos> You make me happy, you make me smile.<eos> You bring me up when I'm down.<eos> You finalize...

you know what I mean?<eos> Come.<eos> You call for me, Bren'in?<eos> Hasil, yes.<eos> When them policemen came up here, they took our peace of mind 'cause we were unawares.<eos> That can't happen again.<eos> - I agree.<eos> - Good.<eos> I've decided that we need a patrol.<eos> We need eyes all over this hill and I think you're the man to be set to that task.

All right, we are commencing a scout.<eos> Now we can't get caught like we was, not ever again.<eos> What I reckon is that they're already out there and they're out there watching.<eos> Each man's going to survey a stretch of woods.<eos> Now we want to know where they are without them knowing nothing about us, so we are gonna go quiet.<eos> We walk, no bikes.<eos> Well, then... I mean, that's... that's going to take all day on foot.<eos> No vehicles.<eos> You understand me?<eos> Barnabis, I want you to take the East Creek Falls.
It ain't as cut and dried as some folks might like.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, I don't think he killed him.<eos> In fact, I know he didn't.<eos> You know, based on what?<eos> Based on he told me and I believe him.<eos> I do not understand you, Wade.<eos> You are some kind of man.<eos> Listen, I know you want to sort this out.<eos> No, you know jack and shit...

I mean, just out of a sense of justice, you know?<eos> You're the best lawyer around and...<eos> I've got to give you credit, Wade.<eos> You told me you loved me before you tried to stick it in.<eos> I don't know about that, but, um... I... mean, I think this man deserves a proper defense.<eos> I assume we're talking about that Farrell.<eos> Man, why do you care?<eos> I mean, why do you want to get mixed up with all that?<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> Yeah, if you say so, but it's not the smart thing.

But if you're lying, like you were before... you're going to pay for it.<eos> Okay, go.<eos> Bren'in, can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> What is it?<eos> I thought you'd want to know.<eos> It's, Asa.<eos> Bury it.<eos> Not in our grounds, halfway down the mountain.<eos> He never was one of us, not really... but he wasn't one of them, neither.<eos> You go outside... and you run as far as you can and don't you never come back.
Jerrod, quit bringing up old bidness.<eos> Now, Kevin, I am proud of the man that you have become.<eos> And we all know you're gonna go out there and kill all the bad hombres and make us proud.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Carmichael.<eos> You know, I just woke up one morning and felt there was a greater calling for my life.<eos> I decided to join something bigger than myself.<eos> I wake up before the sun rises just to get to work protecting this country from threats you can't even imagine.<eos> You just completed basic training.<eos> You learned how to do sit-ups and make the bed.<eos> I don't expect you to understand the type of responsibility this takes, Jerrod, but you don't have to.
You know, make a sacrifice.<eos> Sacrifice!<eos> Daddy, it's like you're his hype man.<eos> Jerrod, no more disrespecting Kevin.<eos> Kevin is a good soldier on his way to achieving greatness.<eos> Now, thank him for his service and give this man a doughnut.<eos> Fine.<eos> Kevin, thank you for your service, you arrogant deadbeat dad.<eos> Hmm, um, cinnamon sugar or jelly?<eos> Do you know how un-American you are right now?
...let me just say this. If it hadn't been for slavery, we'd still be in Africa.<eos> Probably starving to death.<eos> Probably wind up on one of them infomercials begging some family from Ohio to sponsor us for 98 cents a day.<eos> What... what kind of food can you get for 98 cents a day?<eos> What are we sending them, a pack of gum?<eos> Uh-oh, Jerrod?<eos> Kevin just pulled up outside.<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> Well, Jerrod offended him, and he's come for revenge.<eos> Now, the parent in me wants to protect you, but the patriot in me is thinking you probably deserve what you're about to get.
I'm being deployed to Afghanistan tomorrow and I haven't been able to find someone to watch my dog while I'm gone.<eos> Ooh, a dog?<eos> Ooh, a dog sounds fun.<eos> Hi, I'm Maxine; no one introduced me 'cause they were afraid you were here to kill Jerrod.<eos> Joe, tell him we are not dog people.<eos> We're not into dogs like that.<eos> Oh, don't worry about it.<eos> I know it's a big ask.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, Kevin, there's not an ask too big when it comes to my dad, especially with the military.<eos> In fact, before you got here, he was just lecturing us on the importance of supporting the troops.
Golden Retriever.<eos> Dad... a Golden Retriever.<eos> Kevin, it would be my honor to watch your dog.<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> Thanks, Mr. Carmichael.<eos> You saved me.<eos> The six months will fly by, I promise.<eos> I'll go get him out the car so you can meet him.<eos> Joe, are you crazy?<eos> Yeah, Daddy, you hate dogs.
That's like gay conversion therapy.<eos> You just need to accept him the way he is.<eos> Joe, there is a spirit inside this dog that just is not right.<eos> Last night while we were making love, he came inside the room and watched us.<eos> And his eyes rolled up in the back of his head.<eos> Well, next time, we'll just close the door.<eos> Well, he's just gonna sit outside and listen!<eos> So what if he listens?<eos> He can't tell nobody 'cause he's just a damn dog.<eos> Joe, I can't believe that you are doing this.
He got friendly fire written all over him.<eos> Bobby.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Bobby, what are you thinking?<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> We came here to tell you that joining the army is the biggest mistake you gonna make in your life.<eos> Dad, why are you telling me I'm making a mistake?<eos> You didn't tell Kevin he was making a mistake.<eos> Okay, I see.<eos> I know you're looking at Kevin thinking he's a hero, thinking you can be one, too.

In fact, I usually ask myself "What would make Dad proud?"<eos> - Then I just do the opposite.<eos> - See?<eos> And that makes me feel ashamed of him.<eos> We got a thing and it works.<eos> But I love the way you talk about this country.<eos> It just makes me want to be a better American.<eos> I do love this country, but I don't trust your life in the hands of this government.<eos> I love you too much.<eos> Now, look, I know you're looking around this room, seeing all these posters, getting all hyped up and inspired, thinking you can do anything.
I just really didn't think it'd be relevant.<eos> Right, so when I asked you the other day if he'd contacted you...<eos> Well, technically speaking, he didn't contact me...<eos> But, you know, yes, I am sorry that I didn't tell you.<eos> I... actually just find it hard to talk about.<eos> To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure what I was looking for by going there.<eos> Maybe closure of some sort, but it was a deeply unsatisfying experience, massive mistake.<eos> He said almost nothing and just... stared.<eos> He looked like a madman, if I'm being honest.<eos> It's possible you provoked him.
Dylan.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're doing great.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> Can we talk about the earring?<eos> Look, you kept it for a reason, and I know you say that door is closed, but there are no absolutes.<eos> Maybe we should think about reaching out to your mom.<eos> I know it's complicated, but, honestly,<eos> I've been thinking about her, and she's a nut, but how amazing would she be as a grandmother?<eos> Look, Emma, I know that you think you have this superpower where you know what people want even though that's not what they say, but it's getting...

And sometimes people actually do know what they want without you having to tell them.
No, no, I'm off today and Sam is back in Seattle, so I'm free.<eos> I could be there in ten minutes.<eos> Okay, yes, great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> I feel terrible about last night.<eos> What you must think of me...<eos> I don't think anything bad.<eos> I just think you're lonely, Madeleine, but I don't blame you.
Why did you tell me that I need to talk to Sam?<eos> What could you possibly know about Sam that I don't know?<eos> I met your husband before I ever met you.<eos> He brought a woman to my motel.<eos> You must have seen someone else.<eos> Sam wouldn't do that to me.<eos> I'm not wrong.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So you've known this whole time that I've known you?<eos> And you just... You and Sam both knew, and I was just this idiot in the middle?
Yes, no, I'm... I'm fine.<eos> It's all good.<eos> It's all gonna be good, Norman.<eos> It's all gonna be good.<eos> I told you I needed you here early. I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I woke up feeling terrible.<eos> I only came in because I knew this was important to you.<eos> I hate these money transactions.<eos> I don't want the cash in the office over the weekend, and now Jeff wants me to show him the Capitol Hill property before he flies to New York, so I need you to deposit this money before the bank closes.
I don't want the cash in the office over the weekend, and now Jeff wants me to show him the Capitol Hill property before he flies to New York, so I need you to deposit this money before the bank closes.<eos> You usually do that yourself.<eos> Yes, but Jeff is feeling a little enthusiastic, and I think it's safe to assume that this is not his only briefcase of cash.<eos> Mr. Lowery?<eos> I was wondering, with Janet leaving... I'd like to submit myself for her position.<eos> You're interested in Janet's job?<eos> Yes, I've been here for three years.<eos> I think I've shown my value.<eos> I have my notary license.<eos> Well, Marion, I... I don't mean to be harsh, but, may I ask, do you have a college degree?
So you're not having blackouts anymore?<eos> No, no, not since I...<eos> Not since I started the medicine.<eos> Where are you getting your prescriptions?<eos> They haven't called me for a refill in a year and a half.<eos> I just started going to a closer psychiatrist.<eos> It was too far to go to you, but I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> I'm just glad you sat down to have coffee with me.
Easy, easy, easy.<eos> Easy, now, let's... Let's not have another accident. Come on, put it down.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Hey, this is a very serious thing you've done. Put it down.<eos> That your house?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Go inside. Get... get... A first-aid kit or some bandages.<eos> Or anything like that, and bring it to me, But don't let anybody see you.<eos> Listen, I know you didn't mean to hurt me. I... i know it was just an accident, all right?<eos> I won't say a word about it if you won't.
Because you've had them forever, mother,<eos> For years, and look... Still the same old dresses.<eos> What the hell crawled into your pants?<eos> I don't like how things are.<eos> Well, neither does all of anyone in god's creation.<eos> We are a species of complainers.<eos> What makes today so special? Because nothing ever happens.<eos> The way that I think it should, mother.<eos> I wanted caleb to go, But, no, he goes and gets hit in the street.<eos> And I wanted to call the cops, But, no, you and chick decide. That it's better to go and get rid of a body.

Or dump people in lakes.<eos> And since when are you and chick such great friends?

Dead or not, I can't be prancing around the house naked.<eos> You don't like your old dresses anymore?<eos> Make up your mind.<eos> Do I like them, or do I not like them?<eos> No, I'll get it.<eos> Yeah, coming.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm... i'm sheriff greene.<eos> We haven't met formally, But I've seen you in town.<eos> You're norman bates, right?
No, it's just... it's not that.<eos> I just don't... I just don't like him.<eos> He put too much pressure on my mother, And I feel that's what led to her death.<eos> Well, what concerns me is the timing here.<eos> Blackwell gets out of prison...<eos> Has your address.<eos> Shortly after that, romero escapes.<eos> Why would a guy who had every chance of getting out of prison. After two years doing easy time on a work farm. Risk escaping?<eos> Had to be something worth it out here.<eos> M-might be here in your house, And you don't know it.
She was asking about jim blackwell...<eos> If we'd seen him.<eos> He skipped parole.<eos> I bet he did.<eos> Apparently he had the motel address. With his things.<eos> I know.<eos> I know;<eos> This is exactly what I mean, mother...<eos> Why I'm upset... because you just decide things are best.<eos> And don't include me in the decision, When I'm really not sure you know what's best at all.
Even by my own standards.<eos> I brought some of my things, So you mind if I stay in dylan's room, Or should I crash on the couch...<eos> Maybe we should talk, chick.<eos> Yeah, we got plenty of time to talk.<eos> Let's talk inside.<eos> No, no, I like it here.<eos> All right.<eos> Just let me put my bird down.<eos> Fire away, champ.<eos> The thing is, I just... Don't think you should spend so much time here.
You are overreacting.<eos> We are miles from the motel, And no one's found it so far.<eos> That's because no one's been looking for it, mother, And now they are.<eos> Where's the key?<eos> I threw it away.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> Well, do you know how to hotwire a car?<eos> Of course I don't.<eos> I don't know why you don't. Care more about this, mother.
Okay, that sounds great.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> All... all right, yeah, 7:00.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Okay, bye.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Look what the tide washed up.<eos> Thought you didn't want to hang out anymore.<eos> No, no, I never said that, chick.<eos> I think you're just overreacting.
I mean, there is something. Very, very wrong with her.<eos> And then I've tried to help,<eos> Chick, she's going to ruin us. If I don't rein her in, and I just... Don't know how to rein her in, exactly.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, maybe I can help you... With her.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yeah, I don't... I don't think so, though.<eos> But... but thank you.<eos> Thank you for helping me with the car. With... with everything. You've really been a good...<eos> So are you, norman.
So are you, norman.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm going to madeleine's for dinner.<eos> I see.<eos> What if I don't think that's a good idea?<eos> Well, I'm not really interested. In whether or not you think it's a good idea.<eos> We've been on the opposite side of what a good idea is lately.<eos> You have free will;
He's fine.<eos> He's almost done with the deal. He's got going on in seattle.<eos> Hopefully things will settle down after that.<eos> And did you ever get to talk to him. About how you were feeling?<eos> No, i... I think I was just having a bad day that day.<eos> We all have bad days when we wonder what's real and not real.<eos> Do you have days like that?<eos> Yes, i... Think it's the nature of relationships.<eos> They shift constantly. They change shape, Sometimes even minute to minute.<eos> It's hard to know what's real in any moment, Unless it's right in front of you. And you're experiencing it.
You hurt me.<eos> I've done nothing but deny myself and look out for you.<eos> Did you deny yourself last night?<eos> I went to the bar.<eos> I know the secret now.<eos> The big secret.<eos> Whoop-de-doo.<eos> I was lonely and got laid.<eos> Big deal.<eos> I mean, you're always going out with that Madeleine person.

I made you up.<eos> My mother is not here.<eos> Now get out of my way.<eos> If I'm not here, then... Why am I here?<eos> Because of the girl who checked in.<eos> Because she's... attractive.<eos> You see?<eos> I'm starting to understand it all now.<eos> Norman, you can't outmaneuver me.<eos> You're not real.
Seriously?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm stuck here in this shitty Motel, waiting for you.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, I'm sorry, I just... I can't...<eos> I... I...<eos> I get that it's a surprise, me showing up, but I promise you, this is gonna make you very, very happy.<eos> I know that.<eos> The... there's nothing better ever than seeing you.<eos> Whatever you're doing over there isn't more important than this.
The hell is going on down there, Norman?<eos> Why didn't you tell me that mom died?<eos> I... Ii just didn't know how to reach you.<eos> Well, you could have figured it out.<eos> You left, Dylan.<eos> You changed your number.<eos> You said you didn't want to be contacted, and I was just respecting your wishes.<eos> Norman, I called you after I left.<eos> I tried to reach out.<eos> You told me it'd be... It'd be best if we didn't speak.
Stop it!<eos> Then say it's real!<eos> It's real!<eos> Say it!<eos> I'm real!<eos> All right!<eos> All right!<eos> Okay, it's...<eos> It's real, mother!<eos> You're real!
I was gonna bring you the key 'cause I'm checking out.<eos> Y-You're going home?<eos> I can't go home.<eos> I did something before I left, something I can't undo now.<eos> I see.<eos> All my life, I played by the rules.<eos> Been a good person.<eos> Where has it gotten me?<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> At least you told me the truth.
Here... here are your clothes.<eos> I don't want them.<eos> Just throw them out.<eos> I... okay, well, just, please... Please, go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just... just... Get out of here while you can, okay?<eos> You let her get away.<eos> I didn't want her to get hurt.<eos> She was trying to get you to sleep with her, you know.<eos> And I know how much you wanted her.
Okay.<eos> You are a big boy now.<eos> Let's talk on an even level. Okay, one adult to another.<eos> Your mother suffered.<eos> You kept me from feeling things, didn't you?<eos> Feeling bad things.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's why you created me.<eos> When you were little and you were so scared, and your dad got violent, and your mom was so scared, over and over, and you were so afraid that you sent me out to handle things for you.<eos> Things that you couldn't stand to feel because they were so painful and so scary and you were so little.
That's why you created me.<eos> When you were little and you were so scared, and your dad got violent, and your mom was so scared, over and over, and you were so afraid that you sent me out to handle things for you.<eos> Things that you couldn't stand to feel because they were so painful and so scary and you were so little.<eos> So you've always been there with me... To keep me safe?<eos> Yes.<eos> We are two parts of the same person.<eos> Both are very real.<eos> But there's one thing you don't know.<eos> The pain that I keep you from feeling, you need to feel it.<eos> Like Adam wanting all the knowledge and eating the apple in the Garden of Eden, you get the truth, but you also see the pain.
There's more.<eos> - Did i--did I have anything with me when I got here?<eos> It--everything is just such a blur.<eos> - Nope.<eos> No, just you.<eos> Well, and a big, infected wound.<eos> I got some antibiotics.<eos> That's what you've been taking.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I'm pretty sure you saved my life.
- Whe--when did you stop seeing him?<eos> - after mother died.<eos> It was all too much.<eos> - Are you still taking the meds?<eos> - no, no, I... Haven't for a while now, actually.<eos> I really don't think that I need them.<eos> The only thing is that I do sometimes miss our mother.<eos> So very much, Dylan. I can't even tell you.<eos> It's just not the same, and it never will be.<eos> - I don't think you're well, Norman.
I couldn't bring myself to tell you the horrible truth, which is that sh-she committed suicide.<eos> No... that is not what happened.<eos> I know her, and she wouldn't do that.<eos> Hey, Sheriff.<eos> I'm comin' for you when you least expect it, so don't get too cozy up at that house all by yourself.<eos> I've just been down at the little lake down the road.<eos> We found multiple bodies there.<eos> I'm Emma's mother.<eos> What sort of a person runs away from their sick child?<eos> I don't think you're well, Norman.
We found multiple bodies there.<eos> I'm Emma's mother.<eos> What sort of a person runs away from their sick child?<eos> I don't think you're well, Norman.<eos> Mother, should I just turn myself in?<eos> How can you say that to me?<eos> I made you up.<eos> Say it!<eos> I'm real!<eos> Mother, you're real!
Yes.<eos> We pulled two bodies from the lake that night...<eos> Jim Blackwell, as I told you, and an unidentified female.<eos> Her body was too decomposed to I.D., but we're working on it.<eos> Or maybe you could just tell me who she is.<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> Could you speak up?<eos> I want the recording to hear you.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you kill them, Norman?
I don't know.<eos> Did you kill them, Norman?<eos> It's possible.<eos> - It's possible?<eos> - There's a... just a lot that I don't know, Sheriff, a lot that I try really... very, very hard to understand, and I just never can.<eos> Here's what I'm starting to think.<eos> I'm starting to think you're making it up.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I've seen the way you live.<eos> You had a crazy mother who left you a failing business. You've developed this strange adult affect to present maturity, but from where I'm sitting, you're a child.
Which is hard and... and cruel and undeserving of your kind soul.<eos> I know you tried.<eos> I know you did.<eos> You tried so hard for such a long time.<eos> But, hon, you are in a big pickle.<eos> Norman, you are.<eos> And I'm not mad at you, but I just can't let you do any more damage.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's time for me to fix this.<eos> I just don't think that you can fix this, Mother.
You never requested a lawyer, Norman.<eos> In fact, you said you didn't want one.<eos> - Do you remember that?<eos> - Of course I remember that.<eos> You just wouldn't let me take my meds, so I was not able to think clearly.<eos> So you're requesting a lawyer now?<eos> Actually, Jane, I think I'd rather leave.<eos> I mean, I... know I said a bunch of crazy stuff, but that's just what happens to me when I stop taking my meds.<eos> So I do apologize if I've inconvenienced you, but I'd very much like to go home now.<eos> Well, I can understand why you might wanna go home, but you confessed to murder.
All right.<eos> Starting simple.<eos> After Norma died, Norman felt lonely.<eos> And I felt lonely after my kid and my wife took off, so we became friends.<eos> You know, but when I say it like that it sounds like, you know, reductive.<eos> It wasn't just a-a-a friendship of necessity. I recognized in Norman that he... had the soul of an artist.<eos> - When I was in college...<eos> - Chick, Chick.<eos> What are you doin' here?<eos> You want me to say that he's crazy.
What are you doin' here?<eos> You want me to say that he's crazy.<eos> I wouldn't say that he's crazy.<eos> Really?<eos> I would.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe the world... tosses that word around too much.<eos> He killed his mother.<eos> And he loved her.<eos> So... so I'm... I'm gathering that it was probably... very hard for you to get here and that you're feelin' a little miffed that Norman's not home.

I'm gathering that it was probably... very hard for you to get here and that you're feelin' a little miffed that Norman's not home.<eos> Where is he?<eos> So my sources tell me that... last night he confessed to murder.<eos> He's in jail.<eos> So what the hell are you doin' here?
Don't move. I'm coming down.<eos> I hate to steal anyone's thunder, but... I've got that beat by a mile.<eos> This isn't real.<eos> This isn't happening.<eos> I know; I feel the same way.<eos> I mean, even though I've thought these things, and... wondered about all this stuff for so long, it just... doesn't seem possible.<eos> I'm so sorry, Emma.<eos> I never wanted to bring you anything but happiness.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You didn't bring Norman into my life.
Look, we can take our chances fighting it piece by piece, but you have a legitimately strong insanity plea.<eos> Because my stepfather locked me up in an institution?<eos> Sure.<eos> Also, because maybe you needed to be there.<eos> Look, uh, your brother says... you struggle with multiple personalities.<eos> And Dylan's a doctor now?<eos> He didn't know the proper term, but I do.<eos> Dissociative identity disorder:<eos> DID.<eos> Do you know if you've ever been diagnosed with it?
No.<eos> - Do you want to be a mother?<eos> - No. That's smart.<eos> 'Cause you seem like you like to succeed, to win.<eos> And being a mother is an impossible job to win.<eos> We'll take it one step at a time, okay?<eos> One step at a time closer to Hell?<eos> I don't believe in Hell.<eos> Dad, I... I don't know.<eos> No, I don't want you to come here.
Okay, thanks for calling.<eos> What's up?<eos> Uh, the medical examiner called.<eos> They're releasing my mother's remains to a funeral home.<eos> I've got to go make the arrangements.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> Sorry, I just want to be on my own.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you going to the hearing?<eos> Not if you don't want me to.
Your Norman, your friend.<eos> Where's Norman?<eos> I am sorry about your mother, Emma.<eos> She wasn't nice.<eos> She was using Norman and she was using you.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> Death isn't about deserving.<eos> It's just part of the deal.<eos> She made her own bed.<eos> You... you know that better than anyone.
Nobody move.<eos> Nobody move.<eos> Up, up, up, hands up, now.<eos> Hands up.<eos> Get up. And get in the back.<eos> - What the hell is this, Romero? - Get in the back.<eos> Shut up and get in the back.<eos> Okay, on the floor, face down, hands on your heads.<eos> Let's go, everybody.<eos> Let's go... you too, Davis, let's go.
- If you wanna know more about my attack, why don't you just ask the weed dealer?<eos> Green hair. She's the one who took the necklace.<eos> Where did Jules say she found that necklace?<eos> She said Ophelia found it outside of Zeta.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> I can barely remember the girl that I was before I got raped.<eos> Things have been good ever since we... cheated.<eos> I hope that things continue in that direction.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> If you and your sick sidekick raise your hand against another woman, it'll be a world of trouble.

I think you're the one in trouble now.<eos> _<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I think you dislocated my boob.
_<eos> Nope.<eos> Ahh! [bleep] you, Renee Lasher.<eos> If we airplay this to the TV, I bet we can watch it in 3-D.<eos> That arm is a major problem.<eos> Well, you can hardly tell in that video.<eos> It's so dark and far away.<eos> Oh, and you don't think the police are able to zoom in - and get a clearer image?<eos> - Of course I know that they do.<eos> I just didn't think you did.
Okay, Olivia Benson, who is it?<eos> - Jules.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I've been calling you.<eos> - Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> We were just... we were trying to get off the streets fast.<eos> - But you're okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.<eos> Hey, um, if anything happens tonight, like if, um, if something goes wrong,<eos> I want you to know that I-I really care about you.
- And where are you coming from?<eos> - Arms out.<eos> You have ID on you?<eos> Barton, it's me.<eos> Give me a call when you have a chance.<eos> I have a theory I want to run by you.<eos> It's maybe a little crazy, but maybe it's not.<eos> Call me back.<eos> Okay.<eos> So Harris definitely thinks you're the vigilante.
But if he keeps looking, he will eventually figure it out, and if he convinces Barton...<eos> Wait, that security guard?<eos> Don't you call him Paul Blarton, Mall Cop?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I mean, he's still campus police.<eos> You know, he's still a threat.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - The plan is simple.<eos> One person can't be in two places at once.<eos> So if Harris has a run-in with the vigilante while you're there, logic suggests you're not the vigilante.

Would you two pull it together, please?<eos> No one cut any power if the lights are still on.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay, the batteries are dead.<eos> Jules has another one in her room.<eos> I'll go find it.<eos> - Hey, Kay.<eos> How's it going over there?<eos> I saw your Instagram.<eos> You and Tyler are so cute.
- No!<eos> We... sorry.<eos> Yes.<eos> I just... I can't believe he's ruining a vigilante plan.<eos> I know. It's like, let a bitch live, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, let's just do this 'cause I can't take any more of this uncertainty 'cause I feel like there's a elephant sitting on my chest.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> And once I handle this, you and Tyler can come up here, and I will get Nate out of the store.
- Did you just...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It just kind of rolled off my tongue, and I think it's got real potential. Like I think if we brand ourselves, we could...<eos> - No.<eos> - But you... do you get it?<eos> It's 'cause... We both have vaginas.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I told you.<eos> I was at the pizza place.<eos> I wanted to make sure you were safe.
Are you sure you're all right?<eos> I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Hey, people on Twitter are saying that they saw the police take some kid into custody a few blocks from here.<eos> - Really?<eos> That's...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wait, what are all of you doing here?<eos> Oh, I wanted to make sure you were okay.
Did I... did I do something wrong?<eos> No, it's not you.<eos> J-Jules, wait.<eos> Hey, I thought you were, uh...<eos> Jules!<eos> What the...<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're gonna listen to me.<eos> Let me get one thing straight.<eos> I told you to stop, and I told you no, and you did this.
Jules!<eos> What the...<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're gonna listen to me.<eos> Let me get one thing straight.<eos> I told you to stop, and I told you no, and you did this.<eos> You put your hand over my mouth, and then you raped me.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - I'm not done.<eos> What you took from me wasn't yours to take, and the fact that you thought it was sex for just one second is disgusting.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - I'm not done.<eos> What you took from me wasn't yours to take, and the fact that you thought it was sex for just one second is disgusting.<eos> And you came here tonight to make me feel safe?<eos> I don't think I'll ever feel safe again because of you.<eos> All I feel is just this... emptiness.<eos> And I've tried everything I can to get rid of it.<eos> I've... I've lied to myself, to my friends and I've smiled and pretended and... and said I was gonna run away.<eos> And I've done everything I could except this, which is tell you how alone and broken I feel watching you with my best friend like nothing ever happened.<eos> Because you don't carry this like I do, and I hate you for that.

I thought that you should finally know.
Us.<eos> I don't think that it's working.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just... my life, it's, like, really complicated right now and...<eos> So what?<eos> Everyone's life is complicated.<eos> All right, we've all got our stuff. That doesn't mean you... you cut and run when things get hard.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> You don't understand.
Hi.<eos> Um, I have to tell you something that I... should've told you a long time ago, and I don't really know the right way to say it or even if there is a right way...<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Nate just left.<eos> I thought you were my best friend.<eos> How could you have sex with him?<eos> How could you do that to me?<eos> Wait, how could... what exactly did he tell you?<eos> - He told me enough.<eos> No, you don't understand.
All I tried to do was talk to you, Jules.<eos> That's all I tried to do.<eos> I just wanted you to tell me what was going on, and at every single turn, you lied.<eos> You lie about where you are.<eos> You like about what you're doing.<eos> So why should I believe you now?<eos> Because you're... you're my best friend.<eos> See, I don't know if I am anymore, Jules.<eos> You know, you've actually been a stranger to me for a long time, and I just couldn't admit it to myself.<eos> And now either Nate is lying or you're lying, but either way, you're right.

Harris, I got something you need to see.<eos> Previously on "Sweet/Vicious"...<eos> Ophelia.<eos> Sending texts as his dead brother feels kind of twisted.<eos> Please remain inside...<eos> I've been working on the article about the attacks.<eos> - I know what it is.<eos> - The plan is simple.<eos> Harris has a run-in with the vigilante while you're there.

Oh, whoa. Cool. That...<eos> Yeah, that makes sense. So that... that kid, um...<eos> Chase.<eos> Chase Park.<eos> Yeah, him.<eos> They... they let him go.<eos> - Yeah. - So your article says...<eos> There's a vigilante on campus.<eos> So dope.<eos> I can't wait for you to read it.
Oh, absolutely not.<eos> You should go talk to someone, though.<eos> There's a counselor at Darlington in the Title IX office. Do you know what that is?<eos> Um... yeah, I've heard of it.<eos> Is that where I would...<eos> Go report what happened to you.<eos> If I report it to the school, will...<eos> - will they tell my dad?<eos> - No.<eos> You don't have to file a report unless you choose to.
Vodka soda.<eos> Think you're done.<eos> Vodka soda, vodka soda.<eos> Okay, you sound like an alcoholic toddler.<eos> Is that Evan? What the eff?<eos> No, it didn't work.<eos> I'm su...<eos> I'm sure he's just with a friend.<eos> - No, you got to go over there.<eos> - You think? Yeah.
- Exactly.<eos> Evan!<eos> No, no, no, no. He can't see me.<eos> - Did he see me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Go on, girl.<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Are you drunk? No, no.<eos> You're drunk.
Evan!<eos> No, no, no, no. He can't see me.<eos> - Did he see me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Go on, girl.<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Are you drunk? No, no.<eos> You're drunk.<eos> You're... you're drunk, drunk guy.
Well, I don't like this "kind of."<eos> Not a fan of this "kind of."<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I called you, like, three times today.<eos> You didn't want to hang out with me.<eos> But it doesn't mean I want to see you with her.<eos> - I mean, she sucks.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> I'm sure you're great, but she sucks.
She's, like, ugh.<eos> Why her, you know?<eos> No, you should be with me, but I shouldn't have to see you all the time, - but you should want to see me.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Evan, come on.<eos> Evan, look, I know it's not reasonable, but it's what I want.<eos> I like you.<eos> I really like you, and I don't know what to do about it.<eos> I think you should sober up and then come back at me with what you want.
I don't...<eos> I was asleep.<eos> I wasn't feeling well, and I-I asked to lay down in his room. Wait.<eos> You asked to be in his bed?<eos> Yeah, but I...<eos> It's not like that.<eos> We've been friends for a while.<eos> Can you give me the name of the student?<eos> It's, um... it's Nate Griffin.<eos> I worry that you don't understand what will happen if we move forward opening a case like this.

Barton, it's me.<eos> I know I said I was done, but I had a change of heart.<eos> Tell me more about what you found.<eos> Harris, I swear I didn't steal the toilet paper, okay?<eos> A mouse... ate it.<eos> Did you mean what you said?<eos> Uh, yeah, I didn't steal the toilet paper.<eos> No, uh, earlier at the bar about... you know, liking me a lot.<eos> Yeah, I meant it.<eos> Okay, look, if you're in, I'm in.
- Get Tyler out of jail.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yeah, I'm gathering that's important to you, and I'm working on it.<eos> Look, the MVP ceremony is next week.<eos> Do you really want to see that kid get up there and accept an award in front of the entire school?<eos> You can't avoid the elephant rapist in the room.<eos> Yeah, no, that...<eos> That sounds like Nate Rapes Elephants.<eos> But he is a rapist who's also the elephant in the room. He's not an elephant rapist. And in the meantime, you...<eos> you deserve this takedown.
But it just went away.<eos> They questioned the guy.<eos> Thurston ruled in his favor.<eos> It's like there was no due process at all.<eos> It's classic.<eos> This is what I was trying to tell you.<eos> The system is a joke.<eos> The school doesn't want girls reporting, because if they report it, then they have to record it.<eos> And then the recordings go public.<eos> And before you know it, Darlington is rape city, USA.
Our deepest apologies to anyone that is offended by this heinous content.<eos> - Go home! Go!<eos> - This is over!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Can I come in?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> There's no way that you're okay right now.
No, you're not.<eos> There's no way that you're okay right now.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't do this with you, Jules.<eos> When I think about what you went through... My entire body feels so wracked with guilt that I could ever...<eos> - Feel like... - Like you miss Nate?<eos> You loved him, Kennedy.<eos> And you have to mourn this loss.<eos> Trust me, shutting down this reality, it just... It makes things worse.<eos> You just, you have to find a way to get closure.
Give me some of that Kennedy realness. What would you say?<eos> There is no Kennedy realness anymore.<eos> - The realness died.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, I'd say...<eos> You are a strong, beautiful woman, and nothing can break you unless you give it permission.

Okay?
- I am.<eos> - You're not.<eos> I am definitely Charlie.<eos> - Heard that. No, you're not.<eos> - I am.<eos> Okay, Bosley.<eos> You look so happy.<eos> So different.<eos> I feel different.<eos> You just... You make me feel so amazing and happy and...
Okay, Bosley.<eos> You look so happy.<eos> So different.<eos> I feel different.<eos> You just... You make me feel so amazing and happy and...<eos> Just thank you for being you.<eos> And for being mine.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> So pleased you decided to join the team.
Whatever. I can deal with it.<eos> They remind me of stuff I don't want to remember, so it feels good to start fresh.<eos> Well, I have some fun news for you.<eos> I checked the video feed for the wall.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Mm. Things got pretty weird this morning.<eos> Snack.<eos> Muah!<eos> How's this gonna work?<eos> You're gonna be a girlfriend and a vigilante?
I'll handle it.<eos> I told you I needed time.<eos> You can't just keep showing up here.<eos> I know.<eos> I just need five minutes, and then I promise I'll leave.<eos> No. I can't.<eos> Not right now.<eos> - Please, I made a mistake.<eos> Nate, a mistake is forgetting to get me a birthday present.<eos> You slept with my best friend... and she's saying that you...
You know that.<eos> But do you know Jules?<eos> Uh, what is that supposed to mean?<eos> Look, I know how hard this must be for you, but you said it yourself.<eos> She has been lying to you all semester.<eos> She told you that story because she isn't brave enough to own up to what we did.<eos> If you still love me, we... We can get through this.<eos> Do you?<eos> I... I don't...<eos> Okay, I... I have to go, and... and you need to go.
- The Bacchanal.<eos> It's the best night of the year.<eos> The theme is Greek.<eos> - How very on the nose.<eos> - You guys should come.<eos> All of the fraternities open their doors.<eos> - All the frats are open?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> I cannot go to an undergrad party.<eos> I'm happy you want an old, distinguished gentleman such as myself by your side, but I can't.
Thanks, man.<eos> The whole week is gonna be out of control.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know. - I am so psyched for Bacchanal.<eos> Did you get Kennedy to change her mind? No.<eos> I mean, how's it gonna look if I show up to the party without her?<eos> She's being ridiculous.<eos> Say no more, okay? You know how I'm the king of romantic comedies?<eos> Do I know that?<eos> Listen, man, being a lover of the genre has gotten me more ass than you could ever imagine.
What's up, man?<eos> Hey.<eos> What... is Jules around?<eos> Uh... Kennedy said she moved out of Zeta.<eos> I thought maybe she'd be with Ophelia.<eos> You just missed her.<eos> They went to the Bacchanal.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I really want to get her back.<eos> We're going to the Bacchanal, and you can win Jules back.
With your body on the dance floor.<eos> Or with words in a quiet hallway.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I can go to an undergrad party if I'm wingmanning a grand romantic plan.<eos> Wha... I mean, I could just go by myself if I...<eos> No.<eos> You need me for moral support.<eos> I'll sacrifice my night for you, bud, and if I have to party in the process, so be it.<eos> - Hey, you're Brady, right?
- Yeah.<eos> I've, um, heard a lot about you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's only good things.<eos> Weird.<eos> Hey, you wanna get out of here?<eos> Uh, no, I'm okay.<eos> Why don't you go find someone else?<eos> Hey, are you ready to party-hop?<eos> Oh, yeah, my feet kind of hurt, but you go.
Oh, yeah, my feet kind of hurt, but you go.<eos> I'll catch up with you.<eos> No. I'm not going anywhere without you.<eos> What?<eos> Let's find you a couch.<eos> Take a picture of me in my toga!<eos> - Coming up.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You certainly wasted no time.<eos> Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, but am I supposed to just wait around until you want me back?
But I can tell you that I'm scared, and I just want you to be better, but I can't be the one that heals you, okay, and for that, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, well, you want to fix me?<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> Poor little rich girl runs to my aid to fix me.<eos> I don't need you, Ophelia.<eos> I never did.<eos> You invaded my life like a disease, and you make mistake after mistake, and you want to know why?<eos> Take a guess.<eos> 'Cause you told me that first night at Beans, remember?<eos> Because you are a mistake.
Lambda Tau. A kid's been beaten up.<eos> Fudge nipples.<eos> Fun night?<eos> I have no idea who that is.<eos> I just passed out.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> So uh, Jules is staying with you?<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> I think that's a question for Jules.<eos> You, um, have a...
Uh, what?<eos> Ghosted.<eos> Vanished.<eos> She found a port key.<eos> I've looked everywhere for her, and she's gone.<eos> She told you the truth, and you... you looked the other way.<eos> Okay, you actually have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> No, I know that you know what happened between Nate and Jules.<eos> You saw the change in her after that night.<eos> Somewhere deep down beneath the Yas Girls and the Zeta realness, you know the truth, and it terrifies you.

I'm working on it, man.<eos> I promise.<eos> All right, well, thanks for the heads-up, and can you just...<eos> if you find anything, will you let me know?<eos> Look, man, I've already let you in on more than I should.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Hey, Jules.<eos> Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night.<eos> Things are really bad with Carter.<eos> And if you don't want to talk to me again, I understand, but if you can...
And if you don't want to talk to me again, I understand, but if you can...<eos> Forget it.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> Ophelia, where are you?<eos> _<eos> You know, I've never met someone who made it this hard to be mad at them.<eos> I will take that as a compliment if you take my apology for being a dick at Bacchanal.<eos> Look, I'm into you an embarrassing amount, and I really messed up, and I'm sorry,<eos> and I'm still learning how to be a good girlfriend just like you're still learning how to be good at video games.

She sucked.<eos> It was always one of my socks.<eos> Grilled cheese with tomatoes.<eos> I also have hot sauce in my bag.<eos> Swag.<eos> I'm so sorry, Jules.<eos> For everything, for not seeing exactly what was going on with you, for not believing you when you told me the truth.<eos> I...<eos> I've been thinking a lot about this, and I realized that some part of me, um... Always knew what he really did to you, so... but I just wasn't ready to face it.<eos> I can't... I can't imagine what you've been through and the fact that you had to go through that alone.
You have to report this, Jules.<eos> He can't just get away with this.<eos> You have to tell the school.<eos> I tried.<eos> They don't want to help me.<eos> It's Nate, Kennedy... he's "Mr. Darlington."<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not, okay?<eos> You deserve to be heard... And you will be heard.

- This is what we do!<eos> - This is not what we do.<eos> You want to fix me?<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> She's not well.<eos> You know what happened between Nate and Jules, and you are the only person who can help her now.<eos> I'm so sorry Jules for not believing what he really did to you.<eos> He can't just get away with this.<eos> You deserve to be heard.<eos> I worry that you don't understand what will happen if we move forward opening a case like this.
You were working with Barton.<eos> I wanted to find out who derailed my career and attacked me at Vinalyton.<eos> You bashed my knee.<eos> I had to!<eos> You would have...<eos> What, found you out?<eos> So what I heard, uh... does that mean that Jules was... ?<eos> She tried to go to the school, but... Most of these girls tried to go to the school, but they don't help.<eos> There's a reason that you kept this from me, Ophelia.<eos> It is because you know that what you and Jules are doing goes against everything that I believe.
Kennedy, she's, uh...<eos> She's been lying to you all semester.<eos> Would you just stop, please?<eos> Please, please don't. Don't do this to me.<eos> I love you.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a summons to testify before the Title IX board.<eos> I wanted to give it to you myself.<eos> Jules reported you to the school.<eos> I don't think you, uh, realize what this is gonna do to Jules.
T-Tyler has filed a missing person's report on Carter, and the police... they're going back to the garage to look for evidence.<eos> Tyler, you gorgeous idiot, whose side are you on?<eos> His dead brother's side.<eos> I mean, we wiped that place clean, but, I mean, we were frantic, and we were rushing.<eos> We could have missed something, and your vomit was everywhere, and...<eos> Um, I can't believe this.<eos> I have to go and testify.<eos> Maybe I could just push the meeting. No, no, no.<eos> Um, I got this.<eos> You just need to... you need to focus on your trial, okay?
I just can't stop thinking about it.<eos> Why would she do something like this?<eos> She could ruin Nate's life.<eos> I'd love to get raped by Nate or any CSOs.<eos> Let's just get out of here.<eos> Good to see you, Miles.<eos> You guys sure are talking a lot of shit.<eos> You're worried it's gonna ruin Nate's life?<eos> What about Jules's life?<eos> What if this happened to your best friend or to you, or, no, wait, I forgot, you'd love to get raped.
Hi, Mackenzie.<eos> Good, you saw me.<eos> I didn't want to sneak up.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I was thinking of organizing a protest.<eos> That's very sweet, but, um... that's not gonna do much.<eos> You're just gonna let them overturn this?<eos> You're not angry?<eos> You know what?<eos> I got to tell my truth, and that alone is more liberating than you could ever know.
Hi, it's me.<eos> I just called to say hi.<eos> You're so good, Harris.<eos> You're so good.<eos> You're my...<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> And I know I screwed things up, but I'm... I'm gonna make it right.<eos> You're so good.<eos> I'm going to the DA's office right now to turn myself in.<eos> And, uh... And you can be free, and you don't have to live with my secrets anymore.
Don't ask questions, all right?<eos> Just let it happen.<eos> Hey, can we actually, um, do this later?<eos> I've got somewhere I need to be right now.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, later... later's fine.<eos> I will see you later, right?<eos> Of course.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> Bitch, what are you doing here?
Uh, Miss Thurston, just the woman I was looking for.<eos> Harris, what are you doing here?<eos> I just wanted to say, if I wasn't clear when we sat down before, that I would love to be considered for an internship here.<eos> Please keep me in mind if there are any openings. Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> You were gonna turn yourself in.<eos> I mean, I knew you were crazy, but that was... no, not cool.<eos> You're too close to us, Harris.<eos> I just didn't want you to go down for my crimes. What...
You put tracking software on my phone.<eos> Ophelia, if we'd have been any later, you'd have gone to jail for a very, very long time.<eos> And did you ever think about the fact that there's two of us in these hits?<eos> They would have found me.<eos> That is... that is a good point.<eos> Look, I'm just really tired of messing everyone else's life up.<eos> I'm tired of being the screwup.<eos> Look, you... you've bailed me out a million times.<eos> You're so kind and smart, and just the thought that I might have ruined all that for you is...<eos> Yes, I want you to take responsibility for your actions, but that doesn't mean I want you to throw your whole life away.
I've got it.<eos> I'd like to do it.<eos> Sure.<eos> Usually start with his vitals.<eos> But I'm sure your way works too.<eos> This isn't quite the same as Sahin's baklava, is it?<eos> With all that fresh pistachio and honey.<eos> Remember, I used to say,<eos> "Grandpa, I don't want to finish dinner. I only want baklava."<eos> And you'd say,
Please, can I make it up to you?<eos> Look, Holden, I really need to get to class.<eos> Jamie.<eos> Do you believe in fate?<eos> - What?<eos> - Do you believe in fate?<eos> Not really.<eos> Gimme one shot to change your mind.<eos> If you don't have the best time ever, you never have to see me again.<eos> You just make sure the right Holden Matthews shows up this time.
I don't have a Blockbuster card.<eos> Yeah, neither does anyone else.<eos> What happened to Blockbuster?<eos> Um, it's in a better place.<eos> Actually, I'm what's called exploratory.<eos> Like Magellan?<eos> Like that, yeah!<eos> Yeah, totally like that.<eos> The world is such a big place, and I'd really hate to get in the way of way of what it has to offer.<eos> Sounds like you believe in fate after all.
We will need to recalibrate our approach, Dr. Frost.<eos> Dr. Frost.<eos> Frost was...<eos> Arthur's partner?<eos> ♪ The heat of the moment ♪<eos> ♪ Telling me what your heart meant ♪<eos> ♪ The heat of the moment ♪<eos> - ♪ That shone in your eyes ♪<eos> - All yours.<eos> Hey. You're on deck, big guy.
I will randomly pick a song with my eyes closed.<eos> No cheating.<eos> If you know the song, then we sing.<eos> - We'll let fate decide.<eos> You're on.<eos> "Call Me Maybe."<eos> Oh gosh. We sang that like a million times freshman year, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, um...<eos> I think, you, uh... meant to stop there.
Oh! Holden, please stop!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> Stop! Please!<eos> What did you do?<eos> That machine was our only way back!<eos> Exactly.<eos> We're never going back.<eos> - What?<eos> No, Holden, you don't understand!
It's just... it's complicated.<eos> Let me know when you UN-complicate it.<eos> You know where to find me.<eos> You feeling okay?<eos> Yeah, uh, why?<eos> Well, you mowed our entire yard voluntarily.<eos> Any parent would find that alarming.<eos> It's a good thing I didn't reorganize the garage.<eos> Oh, honey, I'd have you committed.<eos> You... going out?
Your mom's going through a lot right now with your brother and all.<eos> You getting kicked out of school for dealing drugs may not be what she needs right now.<eos> I wasn't dealing drugs.<eos> Just for what it's worth.<eos> So, you were covering for somebody.<eos> Wouldn't happen to be that girl you've been seeing, would it?<eos> Something tells me we'll be seeing a lot less of each other.<eos> Good.<eos> Time apart. That's a good idea.<eos> Yeah, you would know, wouldn't you?
Oh, don't tell me this one with the go-kart, for a go-kart contest.<eos> First place. Two years in a row.<eos> Why doesn't that surprise me?<eos> Hey, do you want to stay for dinner?<eos> Are you gonna take that?<eos> No, it's... It's not urgent.<eos> So what are we having?<eos> - No...<eos> - What did you do?<eos> What you were afraid to do.
Whatever.<eos> Just another lie to add to the pile.<eos> I asked him not to 'cause I wanted that part of my life to be behind me.<eos> Your grandfather disagreed.<eos> Said it was part of who I am.<eos> He saw potential.<eos> Everyone else saw an ex-con.<eos> He saw the best in people.<eos> Look where it got him.<eos> You're more like him than you know.
When Holden puts his mind to something, you'd better watch out.<eos> I'm happy you two found each other.<eos> Okay. - Mm.<eos> Righty.<eos> Dear Lord, I'm moving in.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Least you're eating your veggies.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hey, my man, can I get two more beers over here?<eos> No, no, I don't need you to buy me a beer.
Hey, my man, can I get two more beers over here?<eos> No, no, I don't need you to buy me a beer.<eos> What are friends for?<eos> Sorry about what happened to Kevin.<eos> He was a good kid.<eos> Good man.<eos> I failed that man.<eos> So now it's on me to make sure that<eos> I make the right connections that no one can see.<eos> Think maybe you've had too much to drink, Jeff.
The hell are you talking about?<eos> That's the guy who killed my brother.<eos> When Holden was in a coma, was there anyone that came around asking about him?<eos> It was 12 years.<eos> Researchers were asking about him all the time.<eos> Anyone saying they were from Hollow Sky?<eos> What's Hollow Sky?<eos> It's a religious organization.<eos> Tax-exempt status might be easier than you think.<eos> And you think this...
What's Hollow Sky?<eos> It's a religious organization.<eos> Tax-exempt status might be easier than you think.<eos> And you think this...<eos> Shoemacher woman is the head of it. No.<eos> It's someone higher.<eos> And you really believe these people are interested in my son?<eos> I know they are.<eos> You've spun a lot of theories here, Jeff.<eos> I think you need some help.

No.<eos> It's someone higher.<eos> And you really believe these people are interested in my son?<eos> I know they are.<eos> You've spun a lot of theories here, Jeff.<eos> I think you need some help.<eos> I need your help.<eos> All right?<eos> You want to know more, Tom, and I can see it.<eos> I need you on board.
You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Should have known.<eos> Holden, wait.<eos> Hold, can you... can you...<eos> Can you just hear me out?<eos> Holden, stop!<eos> We're the ones who survived the Realm!<eos> We're the ones who came out of it screwed.<eos> Ever since I woke up from my coma, people have tried to use me for their own stupid goals and I'm so, so sick of it.<eos> And I know you are too!
Don't give me that look, bitch.<eos> That's two.<eos> That's three!<eos> Oh, my God, five?<eos> What's going on in there?<eos> The first one was for pee. And the last four were to piss you off.<eos> So you're basically murdering the planet just to spite me.<eos> Yeah, and it worked.<eos> Ay, it's impossible to be Zen in this house.<eos> You know, it's bad enough that you take 40-minute showers.

Oh, mansplaining.<eos> Is that like manscaping?<eos> I just learned that and I love it.<eos> No, mansplaining is when a...<eos> It's when a man explains something to a woman... that she already knows, but he acts like he's teaching her.<eos> Does that make sense?<eos> What?<eos> I was just explaining what mansplaining... Oh, wow!<eos> Elena, microaggressions and all this little crap...<eos> If I got bent out of shape every time a man said something stupid, you wouldn't be here.
Wow, you broke Schneider.<eos> Mom... this stuff might not seem like a big deal, but it chips away at you.<eos> You gotta call Scott out.<eos> Why would I waste my time?<eos> That is right.<eos> You will never win men over by confronting them.<eos> You flirt with them.<eos> You hypnotize them.<eos> And then you do whatever the hell you want.<eos> And then... they will think they are the boss, but really, you are the boss.

But maybe you didn't hear, because you were on your phone like now.<eos> Uh, what?<eos> Yo voy a matar este hombre.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I'm just thinking about lunch. I'm hungry.<eos> Oh.<eos> When it comes to ideas, no one's keeping score, but today, Scott wins!<eos> Oh, all right, I need to say something. I do.<eos> Okay, uh, Scott...<eos> Sometimes I've noticed, when I'm talking, you don't listen.
How about all the times you take off early for your kids' appointments and I'm left to pick up the slack, because moms are special?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Uh-oh! I dropped my pen.<eos> Scott, could you go get that for me?<eos> Moms are special!<eos> Because we have to work twice as hard.<eos> We really do!<eos> Dogs are not children, Lori!<eos> Look, sometimes I do have to take time off because braces need tightening or because my kid's head is a, quote, "lice carnival."<eos> But I always make it up, and it is just as valid as you leaving early for Shark Week.
So, tomorrow, we try the makeup again?<eos> No, Abuelita, I tried it and I didn't like it.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> This morning I saw what you could be.<eos> The granddaughter I have always wanted.<eos> I wish you would've said that in Spanish, so I didn't understand it.<eos> Oh, niña, no!<eos> No, I didn't mean it like that.<eos> No, no.<eos> You know, you use makeup like armor because it makes you comfortable.
I do this.<eos> Are you asleep, mi amor?<eos> Abuelita, no.<eos> We're not doing this again.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm not here to make you up.<eos> I'm here to do this.<eos> This is me.<eos> No armor.<eos> I think you look beautiful.
Your dear husband is just going to lose his mind when he sees you in your new suit.<eos> - Ladies?<eos> - Waldorf salad, thank you.<eos> Could the kitchen make me some tomato finger sandwiches?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, what's the point of a dress if it doesn't send a man straight to the asylum?<eos> God bless Scott for knowing something clothing.<eos> I swear, I could wear a burlap sack and Harold wouldn't even blink.<eos> When did you and Scott talk about fashion?
I read the "Tribune," of course.<eos> And I read your little debut novel, of course<eos> It was quite an interesting, let's see, what did I call it?<eos> We all know what you called it, Heywood.<eos> and we all know you were wrong.<eos> But then, you're so often wrong... so difficult to take your words seriously.<eos> Thankfully people read the paper for other reasons.<eos> Door was open.<eos> You're missing the reading.<eos> And so are you.
I know you're an author, not an actor.<eos> Good God, Ober, is that the best you got.<eos> In this case, yes.<eos> It will no doubt be immortalized by...<eos> There's the little prick now.<eos> Goddamn bottom feeder.<eos> Fitzgerald, I don't think this is the time.<eos> Mr. Broun.<eos> I think I understand why you became a critic.<eos> You understand everything, I imagine.
