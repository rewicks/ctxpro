That's what Natasha had in her guitar case, and that's why the killer took the bottle.<eos> It sounds better when Natasha sings it, doesn't it?<eos> I'm ... I'm rehearsing.<eos> I've got a show.<eos> Your shy roommate didn't know how valuable her songs were, but you did, didn't you?<eos> Natasha told you she was gonna take that microphone and sing her own song in front of the record company that signed you.<eos> Broad Sound records wanted to hear their new star.<eos> Because it's my song.<eos> That's why Broad Sound records signed me.<eos> When did you write it?
Why couldn't you sleep?<eos> Are you worried about us?<eos> I know that I was in a strange place earlier.<eos> And you were right about this not working unless we tell the truth.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just really glad you stayed.<eos> Me too.<eos> Wait. He has a surveillance camera?<eos> What if the building manager put it there?
He thinks that one of us did it.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> Well, now we know it's a work of fiction.<eos> Which one of us is he trying to pin it on?<eos> I didn't get that far.<eos> You didn't think to ask?<eos> Why?<eos> We know that that's not true.<eos> Just because he wrote a book doesn't mean he's not "A".<eos> You know, he could be using it as a way to place the blame on one of us and keep suspicion off of him.
If he came to help his mother, why wouldn't he be?<eos> Probably because "chiffon versus taffeta" isn't where he's most helpful.<eos> We're never getting upstairs.<eos> Why?<eos> The house is event headquarters.<eos> We're not going to be able to squeeze past Alison's mother without her noticing.<eos> I'm lucky if I can squeeze out of this tent.<eos> Ladies, when you're finished with your touch-ups, please remember to check the list by the stage.<eos> Spencer, what happened to your veil?<eos> Oh. I think I must have left it inside
But he believed me when I said that CeCe and I were roommates at UPenn.<eos> We hung out a lot at this pub near Hollis.<eos> That's where I met Ezra.<eos> Excuse me, can I have a gin and tonic?<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's tragic, isn't it?<eos> Oh, sorry?<eos> The book.<eos> It's one of my favorites.<eos> I read it every summer.

Yes, of course, let me grab his number for you.<eos> Right.<eos> His name is Dr. Thomas Larkin.<eos> At 202-251-6258<eos> And if you'd like, I can give him a call before hand and let him know you'll be reaching out.<eos> OK, you let me know if I can be of any help.<eos> Good night, Tricia.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We'll see.<eos> The idea is to take color theory and turn it on its head.
- We have to get the bridge approved now.<eos> - I'll call Linda.<eos> Bypass her, I don't want her in the meeting.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Meechum, get in touch with the plane have them make ribs for the flight back.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> [door closes] Mr. Vice President, do you have a moment?<eos> I'm sorry, the president asked to see me.<eos> No he didn't, you requested the meeting and I took it off the schedule.
- We can't trust any of the results.<eos> - Are there any infected on this floor?<eos> No.<eos> No one's reported in, but we can't trust that everyone downstairs is a positive.<eos> I'm really sorry I let you down.<eos> - And Walker.<eos> - No...<eos> - I made a mistake.<eos> There's no excuse.<eos> - Right now you get to fix it.
It's called hybristophilia -- monster worship.<eos> These women like to write letters to horrible men.<eos> Those letters can turn into visits and sometimes a prison wedding.<eos> It's prison policy to scan all documents received by inmates.<eos> Any letter Luanne wrote to Luther would be kept in a database.<eos> I'm already in.<eos> Scan for places -- homes, hotels, vacation spots.<eos> Here's something.<eos> Luanne wrote about a farmhouse her grandmother owned.<eos> "She's gonna leave it to me in her will."
Whoo! I'm a little flushed.<eos> We're a good team, aren't we?<eos> Sally...<eos> Hey...<eos> You've been reading that book for 2 days.<eos> Don't you think it's time to come up for air?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can't.<eos> - Get rid of it.<eos> Take it back and bury it in the soup rubble where you found it, because it's bad juju.
Bartholomew!<eos> Good to see you, old sport.<eos> Where's Freedom?<eos> Well, my dad said don't bring home any more dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds.<eos> Okay, in your terms, points are like mice...<eos> Don't interrupt.<eos> I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.<eos> You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.<eos> Fine!<eos> But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
Jailbird, A Snake. That's his real name.<eos> Albert Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake-- has been arrested for a series of thefts and may be put to death under a controversial new statute.<eos> Yeah, we had a law stating<eos> "Three strikes and you're out."<eos> But I thought it was "You're out." So I let people go.<eos> So now it's "Four balls and you walk.<eos> Right to the electric chair."<eos> It's, uh, much clearer, Kent.<eos> Bart, I'm so sorry.<eos> I just wanted to ruin his life, not end it.
Oh, I can't tell you how many mill pigs we get in here who have bumblefoot or the slobbers.<eos> You don't have children, do you?<eos> This one whistled at me!<eos> Ooh, that could be the one.<eos> Oh, but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin.<eos> But this fellow is so fuzzy!<eos> Well, they all have their charms.<eos> This one's nibbling a sunflower seed.<eos> Look at that hair.<eos> Aw, I just want to comb it forever!
Quite valuable.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I expect it to go somewhere between 80 to $100,000.<eos> Nobody touch it!<eos> Bart, stop looking at it!<eos> But I want to see it!<eos> No, you'll wear it out!<eos> Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right.<eos> Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years, and never knew how much it was worth.<eos> Think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them.
Look at the paddles!<eos> Stop the auction!<eos> That painting belongs to me!<eos> Dawn?<eos> Good to see you again, Beef Kirky.<eos> Who is this woman?<eos> While you two were separated, Kirk and used to be friends... with banana-fits.<eos> You told me you didn't see anyone during our separation.<eos> Madam, are you saying this painting belongs to you?<eos> Kirk stole it from me!
I love art!<eos> Art?<eos> What do you know about art?<eos> You don't even know who painted that picture.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It's a Johan Oldenveldt.<eos> Wrong!<eos> It's a me!<eos> A what?<eos> I painted it!
What?<eos> !<eos> You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.<eos> Well, no, but now when I look at it, all I see is a fraud.<eos> Beauty is beauty.<eos> My forgeries give pleasure to people all over the world.<eos> The only real question to ask about art, whether it's in the Louvre or on a freshman's wall at Cal State Fullerton is, "Did it move you?"<eos> But, you still, I mean...<eos> Oh, I suppose you're right.<eos> What if I never liked the painting and only wanted it for money?
Somebody want to tell me what the hell's going on here?<eos> Metatron is trying to play God.<eos> Play God?<eos> Cass, he erased angel warding.<eos> He friggin' blew out Holy Fire.<eos> He is God.<eos> He's powering up with the angel tablet.<eos> How the hell are we supposed to stop this guy?<eos> All right, so what if there is a stairway to heaven?<eos> We find it and get a drop on the guy.
Magic that powerful comes at a price, and right now we don't know what that price is.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm fan-friggin'-tastic.<eos> And I'm glad, honestly.<eos> I-I'm not saying we bury the thing.<eos> I'm saying we just save it for when we really need it.<eos> Crowley.<eos> Metatron.<eos> The big boss fights.<eos> You don't have to have it with you all the time, right?
Someone will die for this.<eos> Remarkably, I don't disagree.<eos> However, I would like to know where they learned such dark magic.<eos> I had hoped never to see that symbol again.<eos> I recall it is the signature of a fool who once stood against us.<eos> Clearly, some upstart witch is salvaging old tricks.<eos> I'll do for him as I did the other.<eos> Diego.<eos> When night falls, I want you to gather every vampire in the quarter.<eos> Get me the head of whoever did this and put it on a stick.
We've no room for slackers of cowards in our kingdom.<eos> Now that you've regained your composure, let's move on to the next item of business, shall we, with a little help from our dear friend Sophie.<eos> I got no reason to help you, and I sure as hell don't have a reason to help him.<eos> Now, now, don't be difficult, luv.<eos> You'll only live as long as you're of use to me, and right now, your best use is to explain why a witch I killed 100 years ago has come back for revenge.<eos> Come on.<eos> Resurrected witches with vast power?<eos> It's the harvest.<eos> 4 girls were meant to die and be reborn.<eos> I don't know how, but someone jacked that power, and they used it to bring back 4 witches, just not the right ones.
Tuesdays are notoriously quiet.<eos> Well, if Tuesdays are quiet, Fridays are...<eos> Do you ever have a busy day in here?<eos> Please.<eos> So... how is every little thing?<eos> Fine.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> Welcome.<eos> These walnuts were grown in the Hunter Valley.<eos> Marcel has taken the meat of the walnut and fused it with Tasmanian truffle oil, shaved fennel grown in his own garden, and an infusion of herbs and aged Benedictine, served on a lime and beetroot smear.
Well, it was fine half an hour ago, so...<eos> Oh. We'll sort it out when we get home from work, hmm?<eos> Alright.<eos> You just relax.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Cleave.<eos> I'm right to come back to work.<eos> The prosecution's case consists of actual footage of Abbott and Costello breaking into the building.<eos> Um... Phil then takes his mask off to catch his breath, and then remembers and pulls it back on again.
Well, there's not much to tell, unfortunately.<eos> She's resisted every move I've made.<eos> She did come to the hospital the moment that she heard you'd been shot.<eos> You should have seen the look on her face.<eos> She was worried.<eos> Yeah, your point is?<eos> Well, you do have a knack for being blind to opportunities, especially when it comes to romance.<eos> Oh, you can talk.<eos> I have opened the window of opportunity to you at least twice.<eos> And I opened it for you probably four times.
He's even talking about redecorating.<eos> Redecorating?<eos> He says he wants to sell that painting of yours.<eos> The big one in the living room.<eos> That's an original.<eos> He can't sell that.<eos> He can do whatever he wants.<eos> With your house, with your bank accounts...<eos> You gave him power of attorney.<eos> Of course, now that you're getting stronger, you can always take it back.
- I can't find it.<eos> - Did you look under the desk?<eos> Why would it be under the desk?<eos> That's where I found your Seaborg medal.<eos> How hard can it be to find a 160-year-old pump handle?<eos> - Depends.<eos> - On what?<eos> On who's doing the finding.<eos> - Where did you...<eos> - Where you left it.
Who can take down 5 opponents.<eos> Express their creativity. Break the rules without actually getting arrested.<eos> All of these reasons are in there somewhere.<eos> The player himself might not even know.<eos> He might not even understand it himself.<eos> But it's there.<eos> Medford, Oregon<eos> Gaming fulfills my competitive need.<eos> I'm a very competitive person. When it comes to sports, I consider gaming a sport.<eos> So I use my competitiveness and I fuel it with Dota.
He's gonna jump out!<eos> He goes for the Dream Coil!<eos> He gets them!<eos> He gets EHOME!<eos> Holds them in the middle lane.<eos> Na'Vi already on their way out of the pit.<eos> They're coming in to help out Dendi.<eos> Then we just went in and demolished them.<eos> Now they're on top of the Tier 3 tower.<eos> They're going to bring it down.
They're saying he's not even human.<eos> - Gary...<eos> - What is he?<eos> That's what I want to know.<eos> What the hell is he, and how come you're not out there looking for him?<eos> I'm doing everything I can.<eos> You're getting coffee!<eos> You need to get outta here.<eos> Now.<eos> Hey, you gonna do your job, Sheriff, or are you gonna let other people do it for you?
Doing it when there's a mass murderer spotted nearby is insane!<eos> If I was four years younger, I'd punch you.<eos> What?<eos> Coach, that doesn't make sense.<eos> Oh, well, it does to me!<eos> There.<eos> We didn't find anything.<eos> Not even a scent.<eos> It's 3:00, so school's over.<eos> If there was a bomb, wouldn't he have set it off by now?
She wants to talk.<eos> She shouldn't have done that.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> It's just the opposite.<eos> Esme probably wanted to be the one to tell you this, but...<eos> She won an audition to the high-school program at the avalon academy of performing arts.<eos> Oh, my God, Joshua, that's fantastic!<eos> I know. It's huge.<eos> And it comes with a scholarship, so if she gets it, you don't have to pay anymore for her fancy private school.
See, Claire and Anna had two issues...<eos> The Capgras and lesbian bed death.<eos> I realized you could use one to solve the other.<eos> Go on.<eos> You know how some people really get off on illicit sex?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, apparently, Claire and Anna have super-hot sexual love when Anna thinks she's cheating on Claire with a stranger.<eos> And voila... no more LBD.<eos> And when Anna hears Claire's voice without actually seeing her face, she recognizes Claire as her loving, devoted wife.<eos> So, they can totally have their cake and eat it, too.
My day at the Cube was amazing.<eos> Don't forget your sheet music.<eos> Uh, mom.<eos> Where'd you get that shirt?<eos> I thought you'd like it.<eos> [Laughs]<eos> Not on you!<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> You can't really pull off that kind of thing at all.<eos> Just take it back.
(CHUCKLING) Okay.<eos> (PATS ARM)<eos> (FLASHLIGHT CLICKS)<eos> I think these things just unscrew.<eos> No, you got to go in through the drain, like a nasoscopy.<eos> Guys, I'm pretty sure it's righty-loosey, lefty-tighty.<eos> Don't you take computers apart and put them back together in your sleep?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's too bad she didn't lose her ring down a hard drive.<eos> We need one of those things that grabs the pipe and... Yanks it in a twisting motion.
Bye.<eos> (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> (LAUGHING) Oh, my God.<eos> Um, I'm working.<eos> I told you to go home.<eos> Chill.<eos> The restaurant's slammed.<eos> I'm just helping out.<eos> If I need help, I'll ask for it.
Scalpel.<eos> All right, clamp.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Hold on. Hold on.<eos> You can't use metal instruments in the live ordnance.<eos> Well, how do you suggest I get it out?<eos> With your fingers...<eos> Very carefully.<eos> The round is impact-detonated.<eos> The slightest excess manual pressure could set it off.
You suffered trauma.<eos> There must be another attending who could do this.<eos> They're all scrubbed on other cases.<eos> - It's me or nobody. - One, two, three, lift.<eos> The hematoma has to be evacuated now.<eos> Bick, you cannot operate on someone who shot you.<eos> I've seen the scan.<eos> The tumor invaded the amygdala.<eos> It's not this kid's fault.<eos> I want to take it out.
Don't try to play me, Catherine.<eos> I know Bickman hangs out at the Mirabella.<eos> Esme told me.<eos> Is this where you were the night you told me you lost your phone?<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't lie to me.<eos> Okay, this is absurd.<eos> I mean, the pen could be Bickman's.<eos> Of course it can.<eos> I mean, I could've picked it up at work.
Could you tell me what brings you here today?<eos> Look at me, okay?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Really look at me. I'm a mess.<eos> I'm not normal right now.<eos> I have these emotions, okay?<eos> I laugh.<eos> I cry.<eos> Right now, I want to throttle you.<eos> I want to... I want to take your head, and I want to pop it right now.
- You're on the wrong side, Remy.<eos> - Yeah, well, one of us sure is.<eos> And when the bumblebee flew home, all his friends were waiting with buckets of honey, right?<eos> And he's got his worm friend, and his mouse friend, and his spider friend, and his snail friend, and they all had tons of honey.<eos> - I like his feet.<eos> - - And he looks happier now, right?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - They're funny, right?<eos> - So they all buzzed with happiness, because life is sweet when you spend it with your friends.
That swamp bitch can't even spell her own name, and now she gets the keys to the kingdom?<eos> I mean, I came back from the dead.<eos> Yeah, Misty brought you back.<eos> I could be the Supreme.<eos> Yeah, the mind reading's a real party trick, Mumbles the Clown.<eos> My powers are growing.<eos> I can do mind control.<eos> Prove it.<eos> Put out that cigarette.<eos> Now stick it in your vagina.
I cannot tell you how playing this instrument soothes my soul in tempestuous times.<eos> Nothing could soothe my soul.<eos> I have nothing to offer this coven anymore.<eos> Who am I?<eos> What do I do?<eos> You buck up, is what you do!<eos> Face reality headlong and carry on. But how?<eos> I have no one, and my powers are gone.<eos> Your salad dressing is absolutely magical.<eos> Maybe you could bottle it.
Over and over, over and over.<eos> It's okay, it's okay, I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here, it's okay.<eos> Are we all back?<eos> Everyone but Misty.<eos> Freak.<eos> You're a freak.<eos> Mr. Kringley, she did it again.<eos> Where's the dissection frog?<eos> It's right there, she brought it back to life.
Not sure.<eos> I saw him at the White House a lot when I was on presidential detail.<eos> I never really knew what he did.<eos> Imagine growing up with that guy, going to bed worried the tooth fairy's gonna slit your throat.<eos> He did something right.<eos> She's incredibly driven.<eos> Or still seeking his approval.<eos> That stuff's hard to shake.<eos> That's why everyone in my family ended up dying on some dusty battlefield somewhere.<eos> I'm the fifth Vaughn to go to war, first one to survive it.
Now there is an internal investigation.<eos> I'm under the microscope.<eos> The Office of the Inspector General has ordered a psych eval to determine my competency to sit in this chair.<eos> Well, what do you want me to do?<eos> If you don't want me to go back, I won't.<eos> We didn't have this conversation.<eos> And... since we didn't have this conversation, I want you to go and do whatever it is you believe it is your job to do.<eos> Do you know what your job is?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Then do it.
She doesn't...<eos> She has a heartbeat.<eos> Something's beating.<eos> I don't want you to see me.<eos> I don't want you to see what I do.<eos> I want to calm you, comfort you.<eos> There's so much comfort in darkness.<eos> But not for one of you.<eos> I took your life...<eos> And then tried to give it back to you.
I believe my brother won't stop.<eos> How does it make you feel?<eos> Angry.<eos> Anger is an energizing emotion, prompts action against threat.<eos> If you're angry, you're optimistic you can stop this from happening again.<eos> I know how to stop it.<eos> If you really want to kill your brother, Margot, wait until you can get away with it.<eos> Or find someone to do it for you.<eos> You said you were worried about the bird.<eos> Thought you might like to see it.
We might have three.<eos> I'm a good fisherman too, Will.<eos> They tell me you were hard to find.<eos> That was the idea.<eos> Thank you for visiting me in the hospital and for what you said.<eos> I didn't say enough.<eos> And now's your chance to say it all.<eos> You've been granted immunity from prosecution by the US Attorney from District 36, and by local authorities in a memorandum attached, sworn and attested.<eos> Let's talk about Hannibal Lecter.<eos> Some psychiatrists are so hungry for insight that they may try to manufacture it.
Mr. Verger, you are a patient of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, isn't that right?<eos> Dr. Lecter, yes, yes.<eos> Have you ever seen or met another patient of Dr. Lecter's, a man called Will Graham?<eos> Will Graham.<eos> The man that didn't kill all those people.<eos> - That Will Graham?<eos> - Yes. Can't say that I've had the pleasure.<eos> Do you find that Dr. Lecter's therapy has been helpful to you?<eos> I've benefited greatly from Dr. Lecter's therapy.<eos> I'm still benefitting from it.
- God, stop talking.<eos> ... re-record my vocals on party fowl.<eos> No, sativa gives me anxiety attacks.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Someone's here.<eos> - Someone has keys?<eos> - Should I hide the weed?<eos> - Yeah, it's my sister.<eos> She's got keys, and yes, hide the pot, or she'll smoke it all.
Mostly 'cause I don't give a crap.<eos> You can beat Michael Rubenstone.<eos> I mean, what has he got that my delicious boy doesn't?<eos> Cookies!<eos> His mom made them, and they're the perfect mix of chewy and crunchy.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Oh, so we're baking political cookies now, huh?<eos> You wanted war?<eos> You've got it, Betsy Rubenstone.
Inshallah.<eos> Oh. Haven't you ever heard,<eos> God helps those who help themselves?<eos> The Koran says,<eos> "Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves."<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Let's change our condition and get the hell out of here.<eos> What do you have in mind?<eos> Take off your clothes.<eos> And throw it in the fire with anything else you think we can use to smoke up this place.
Do you think you're smarter than your old friend Peter Burke?<eos> Yes.<eos> And Peter thinks he's smarter than me.<eos> Well, you can't both be right.<eos> Which has resulted in years of debate.<eos> Now, one for one, truth for truth.<eos> Tell me what happened in Caracas.<eos> May 21, 2009.<eos> An opera at the Teatro Teresa Carreno, tight security--<eos> I snuck in, removed a wire from the orchestra's piano, and slipped it...
No, he thanked me, then proceeded to bolt out of the building.<eos> It looks like he tucked something small in his pocket.<eos> Looks like a thumb drive.<eos> Where was he headed?<eos> Home.<eos> I bet he had a reason.<eos> Like hiding the drive from the FBI.<eos> Firms like DCFI pay a fortune for their trading algorithms.<eos> Yeah, a millisecond means the difference between gaining and losing millions.<eos> If there's an algorithm on that drive, it makes sense that Worth would want to steal it.

Looks like 1,500 private and government intelligence experts attended.<eos> Check the cellphone towers near that hotel.<eos> Maybe she stayed there.<eos> Yeah, she was within range of their towers for all three days.<eos> Maybe something happened at that hotel during the conference.<eos> Or maybe she met someone and decided to leak or sell intelligence.<eos> Senator Bloomfield's giving a press conference.<eos> Some claim that my daughter was about to divulge sensitive intelligence information.<eos> Well, she got out in front of it.<eos> The media must have been about to break it.
Exalting their dignity by showing a little of it ourselves.<eos> - By showing a lot of it.<eos> - Will, they've got to keep...<eos> Don't reach for common ground.<eos> Reach for higher ground.<eos> Am I saying this right?<eos> - He's saying we're the grown-ups.<eos> - Get back to work.<eos> - I think I blew that speech.<eos> - They got some of it.

And I say to myself<eos> ♪ What more could I want... ♪<eos> Come in.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ♪..if I had you?<eos> ♪ 'I was leaving midwifery behind but Nonnatus House 'was where my family lived and I would love it forever.<eos> 'My time there had shaped me as it shaped every life it touched.'<eos> ♪..

Then he took it all away from me.<eos> But I stayed good.<eos> I'm talking too much.<eos> My mother always said,<eos> "Don't burden others with your problems."<eos> Such a pretty shade.<eos> I've done something, Mrs. Steinmetz.<eos> Something very, very bad.<eos> It's opened a door.<eos> And I don't think I can close it again.
I forgot.<eos> You haven't been smoking out here, have you?<eos> Why do you assume I'm a smoker?<eos> 'Cause you grew up in Oswego.<eos> Well, I quit.<eos> More money for whiskey.<eos> I smell smoke.<eos> Is that mascara?<eos> Why do you have mascara?<eos> 'Cause they sell it at commissary.
Look, I got to get back to work.<eos> Has Roy mentioned anything about the man in the skull mask who injected him?<eos> Roy is not the kind of guy who is comfortable discussing his feelings.<eos> Not like you and me.<eos> Don't yell at me, but I really think we need a new plan on how to find this creepy mask guy.<eos> Scaring the crap out of low-lifes isn't yielding results.<eos> Felicity, I am open to any and all suggestions.<eos> Oliver, maybe we're over thinking this.<eos> What if the mask simply got wind that you were after him and decided to skip town?<eos> He didn't go to all the trouble of recreating the serum and testing it on people just to walk away.
I didn't have a choice.<eos> The earthquake--<eos> I needed to see my family, make sure they were safe.<eos> And so they are.<eos> Come home.<eos> I can't.<eos> Look, I can't go back, Nyssa.<eos> I don't have much of a soul left in me, but what there is, it can't take the killing anymore.<eos> You swore an oath.<eos> My father sent me here to make sure you honor it.
She came to see you?<eos> No.<eos> No, because... she's staying with that man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, I told her that she had to face my dad.<eos> How'd he take that?<eos> How did he say he took it, or how did he really take it?<eos> There's this empty part of me.<eos> It's always been there.<eos> I filled it with schoolwork and ambition, but... deep down, I knew... it could never be filled, because... she was gone.
Good call, maybe.<eos> And...<eos> Yep.<eos> That's our bench.<eos> What, you don't know the Latin for "bench"?<eos> No need to be snippy just because I was right.<eos> I said "good call" already.<eos> What now?<eos> Well, it's too late today.<eos> We come back tomorrow at lunchtime, leave the newspaper, see who picks it up.
Yes. Jane?<eos> Ronaldo did not have much of a life outside the Cruz case.<eos> Guess not.<eos> This is weird.<eos> What?<eos> Everything taped to the walls is old except for this map.<eos> Looks brand-new.<eos> What's it doing here?<eos> Got me.<eos> Let's make sure we take it back with us.
Do you have Madison's phone?<eos> Here.<eos> The techs say that there's an audio file recorded at 5:52 the morning of Madison's murder.<eos> Apparently, she recorded a message for herself.<eos> That was around the same time she was killed.<eos> What if she got audio of the -- of the killer?<eos> What's on it?<eos> They don't know.<eos> It's too damaged.<eos> They can repair it, but it'll take weeks.
I know when something's real.<eos> And when it could get serious.<eos> I feel that way about us.<eos> Do you... feel that way?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Look, one thing I know is that when you feel that way about someone, you got to hang on, 'cause...<eos> Because it doesn't happen very often.<eos> Marcus.<eos> You cannot turn down this job.<eos> They are not gonna offer it to you again.
Madeline pratt.<eos> How do we find her?<eos> Finding her is easy.<eos> Catching her is difficult.<eos> Luckily, she has asked me to help her plan a heist.<eos> To steal what?<eos> Novak: The effigy of astarte.<eos> The effigy was thought to be lost. Disappeared from the british museum in 1983.<eos> Two months ago, it pops up at an estate sale in henderson, kentucky.<eos> The feds raided the auction and repatriated it back to the syrians.
Gone with her.<eos> I have what you want.<eos> When you've wired payment, I'll contact you with the location of the effigy.<eos> If I don't hear from you within the hour, it's gone.<eos> Where the hell is reddington?<eos> He told me he was going to try and locate pratt.<eos> For all we know, he set up this whole thing So he could get the identities of the russian spies, Damaging national security.<eos> The syrians know the safe was opened as a distraction, And they're still trying to account for exactly who Was in that panic room with the effigy.<eos> They're attributing the whole heist to reddington.<eos> She knew where the effigy was the entire time And she used us to get it.
That is the last thing I want.<eos> It's not always about what you want, liz.<eos> Want me to rough him up for you?<eos> I hate this job.<eos> How do you know madeline pratt?<eos> She called me last month. Asked about the effigy.<eos> I'd never met her before, And I don't know how she found me.<eos> So why did she call you then?<eos> Because the effigy of astarte once belonged to my father.<eos> He stole it from the british museum.

Asked about the effigy.<eos> I'd never met her before, And I don't know how she found me.<eos> So why did she call you then?<eos> Because the effigy of astarte once belonged to my father.<eos> He stole it from the british museum.<eos> He was a patriot who revered astarte.<eos> He thought it belonged in syria.<eos> Then why put it up for auction?
He was a patriot who revered astarte.<eos> He thought it belonged in syria.<eos> Then why put it up for auction?<eos> He didn't.<eos> Until the americans raided our compound. What were they looking for?<eos> All I remember is opening a door And seeing him holding the statue.<eos> He slipped something in it. A piece of paper.<eos> Ressler: What did it say?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But he placed the effigy in my arms And told me to run and protect it.
You place one of these near a high profile target, The fallout alone guarantees mass casualties.<eos> Get a nest team on standby.<eos> Where are we on kalif?<eos> We confirmed reddington's allegation.<eos> Rasil kalif is an asset working undercover for the russian mafia.<eos> If they get their hands on these nukes,<eos> God knows who they may sell them to.<eos> The syrians aren't getting the effigy back.<eos> It's gone.<eos> I've already sold it to the russians.
"Alan Ray Rifkin."<eos> It's a case folder.<eos> Research, evidence.<eos> Frank was reviewing trial transcripts for The Judge.<eos> ...<eos> Alan Ray Rifkin. American college student. Dropped out, joined the Army.<eos> In 2003, he was tried and convicted as an enemy combatant. Fought alongside the Taliban.<eos> He's scheduled for execution tomorrow.<eos> According to the charges, Rifkin and a few dozen Taliban fighters raided an Afghan village, killing dozens of civilians.<eos> At trial, Rifkin's lawyers claimed it was friendly fire, that the American military destroyed the village from the air, mistaking it for a Taliban outpost.
Uh, Brian.<eos> Examine the injury.<eos> What?<eos> - You wanted to run point.<eos> - Take a look.<eos> Uh, Brian, how's it look?<eos> It's up there.<eos> It's really up there.<eos> I could've told you that.<eos> Can you get it out?
Accidentally, I swear.<eos> I thought no-one will believe this.<eos> I panicked.<eos> And... You put his body into the river.<eos> I nearly called you.<eos> I nearly did.<eos> But, instead, you just carried on as normal.<eos> And the next day, off you went to Berwick.<eos> But not before picking up his car from the restaurant.<eos> And driving it back to his place, so it would look like he'd returned.
I did.<eos> I think so. Mm-hmm.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get this started.<eos> I'm Doug Greathouse, as you all know.<eos> I don't usually emcee these things, but, uh, as my wife says, "There's more to life than the problems between a shapely pair of knees."<eos> Uh, tonight, we tackle rubella.<eos> Rubella, or German measles as it's more commonly called, is a worldwide scourge.<eos> No disrespect to any Germans here tonight, but it's called German measles because it was discovered by a Kraut.<eos> Now, it could have just as easily been discovered by a Jap and then we'd be calling it fried rice.
Of all the gin joints.<eos> Well, I might say the same, Betty, since I would be expected to be at a medical fundraiser.<eos> Oh, I get invited to all these rubber-chicken deals.<eos> It's not 'cause they like me.<eos> It's 'cause they like my money.<eos> And everybody loves my wife.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it is pure luck running into you tonight.<eos> You know, um, well, Bets and I are, uh, we're having a hell of a time getting in a family way, if you catch my drift.<eos> Uh, yeah, he catches it, uh, honey.
Do not give yourself over.<eos> D... do not move.<eos> Do not call anyone.<eos> I am coming to you right now.<eos> [Beep] First, I'm sorry.<eos> You were right.<eos> She's pretty much admitting she murdered her husband.<eos> Where did you get that tape?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> We can't use it... inadmissible.
Where's the bomb? - You must be Eli.<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Exactly as Marie described you.<eos> - Where is the bomb?<eos> - And you must be Olivia.<eos> I haven't seen you since you were... how old were you?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Where is it, Dominic?<eos> I'm an artist.<eos> Just because I sell you a canvas doesn't mean I know where you're planning to hang it.
After you.<eos> I'm telling you, fellas, you need to buy in now before the gas starts flowin' and I up the minimum investment.<eos> Sorry.<eos> All my money's tied up in the yacht.<eos> I've been in that movie.<eos> So is he planning to stick around?<eos> Like, what was he doing in Bali?<eos> And what kind of name is "Tag"?<eos> Mel, I work for Krista now. Did you not get that memo?<eos> Because you wrote it.
We can put the world back to how it was.<eos> Can't go back, Bob. We can!<eos> You don't have to do this!<eos> We saw you go into the woods with a bag and come out without it.<eos> Had to pull my spotters back before we could go look for it.<eos> What was in it?<eos> You hid it, right?<eos> In case things went bad?<eos> Smart.<eos> Still, we'll find it.
Who saw that ad?<eos> Doesn't matter, alright.<eos> At least I am trying.<eos> At least I am not scared and taking a U-turn, like you.<eos> You're a coward.<eos> - Fine. I am a coward.<eos> Happy.<eos> Now get him out of my room.<eos> You know what, my Amitabh Bachchan DVD collection.<eos> Give it back.
I have people who do that for me.<eos> I just want you to take care of it before I arrive.<eos> Just keep in mind how much this will benefit us both, yeah?<eos> Mr. Quinn, plane's waiting for you, sir.<eos> And you can't think of anyone here who'd want to hurt you?<eos> I don't know anyone.<eos> Donnie, I'm gonna have you escorted back to your room.<eos> You get some rest and stay warm.<eos> Sorry I ruined your lecture.<eos> I was really looking forward to it.
Please don't cry<eos> We should wait here<eos> Alright<eos> Send me your address<eos> Okay, bye<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I gotta go to Taichung<eos> You really don't have to come with me<eos> You should go to the exhibition<eos> We were supposed to see it together
There's this guy<eos> His friends gave him a can of soda<eos> Hold on...<eos> So he put it in the refrigerator<eos> After a few weeks He took it out For some reason<eos> The can just kept on swelling<eos> He didn't know what to do<eos> He didn't know how to get rid of it<eos> So he just...<eos> Kept holding it in his hands
Yes, I do. Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay, perfect.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm a Chicago cop with a gun on his ankle, and I'm shaking like a leaf.<eos> It's the adrenaline.<eos> The metal taste in the back of your mouth, it's how you know you're alive.<eos> Who are you?<eos> All right, the maid's almost done.<eos> Get the cart and go around the corner with it.
Sir, don't look at me that way.<eos> I am not a terrorist.<eos> I just move things from one place to another.<eos> I know about you moving things, Bashir.<eos> I know about your remodeled car.<eos> I know about Pendleton.<eos> Pendleton... was a long time ago.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You think that changes who you are?<eos> All this time I have done a job, and I have done it to perfection.
I'm trying to sleep.<eos> There's a woman shacking up in here.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - Come on down.<eos> She hot?<eos> Don't grab your pecker just yet.<eos> She ain't here.<eos> What the hell you hollering about?<eos> Found her shirt.<eos> Must have washed it this morning.
Oh, god Anna.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Tom turned out negative and... Lydia didn't wanna know. But I'm positive.<eos> Baby how are you feeling?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> One good thing, at least I found out now before the next IUI testing.<eos> I guess there's a way they can test the embryo so... they can make sure the baby's gonna be ok.<eos> Anna where are you?<eos> I'm on my way to a lecture... but I can cancel it and I can be right there.
Do you want me out of the office or the building, in general?<eos> 'Cause I... you just got to be clear with me right now.<eos> Get out of here and close the door... behind you.<eos> Okay, I'm going.<eos> I'm not looking.<eos> I'm a gentleman.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> - Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If I catch the bird, you want me to bring it back?
Just checking. Stay with me here.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> No inter-abdominal metastases.<eos> Proximal sigmoid is mobile.<eos> Rectosigmoid's clear.<eos> Okay.<eos> Part of the tumor is stuck to the side of the uterus.<eos> Can you get under it?<eos> I think maybe if I can get my fingers in there... might be able to peel it off.
I dare say that was always their plan.<eos> I dare say it was, Your Ladyship.<eos> I should be glad to accept.<eos> Now, if you can all put your swords away, perhaps we can finish our dinner in a civilised manner.<eos> But I admire it, when young people stand up for their principles.<eos> Principles are like prayers. Noble, of course, but awkward at a party.<eos> James, did my eyes deceive me, or did Lady Anstruther pass you a note during dinner?<eos> Yes, Mr Carson.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> He's thrown it away.
Hi.<eos> Well, that was awkward.<eos> Armageddon can be.<eos> Just ask Ben and Liv.<eos> You have to forgive her, Kenz.<eos> Life is too short.<eos> Yeah, I remember, my boyfriend just died.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And Rainer's also dead.<eos> Which means I have his soul, and a second chance to deliver it where I should have in the first place.
- is for Walker to call him off personally. - Then make that happen.<eos> I cannot force a man who thinks I'm his enemy to suddenly call me his friend.<eos> I've done what I had to do.<eos> Now you do what you have to do.<eos> Seduce him.<eos> Give him your heart.<eos> Cut it out and put it in his fucking hands.<eos> [Frank] Dear Mr. President.<eos> I'm writing you on an Underwood portable my father gave me when I left for the Sentinel.<eos> It was the words my father said when he gave it to me that resonated even more than this 70-year-old machine.
Stuck in an eternity of watching over that hideous creature my children call brother.<eos> You're dead.<eos> How can I be here?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> The baby!<eos> The baby? Aah!<eos> That kid never had a chance!<eos> And as if your bloodline isn't filth enough, you poison it by merging it with Klaus'?

Go to wardrobe, get dressed.<eos> Okay.<eos> No need to write a speech. I wrote it for you.
Ma'am...<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Ma'am!<eos> You didn't sign the back of the check.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, you know, I wasn't sure if there was a special teller I should go to for checks that are this large?<eos> Ooh, 8K, unh!<eos> You know how she got it, dude?<eos> This bitch right here drew this illustration, and a sexy-ass new dating web site bought it for $8,000!
Do I or do I not have herpes?<eos> I do, you don't.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I want to read so many of this books.<eos> This is unreal.<eos> I can't believe I can get a room in Manhattan for 900 bucks a month.<eos> See, I told you you'd find something.<eos> This place is perfect.<eos> Hey, if she doesn't get the room, I might.<eos> No, I'm taking it.
You're still working on that memory thing.<eos> Not just memory.<eos> It's more of a friend.<eos> Maybe one day, this guy will watch over you, learn from you... protect you.<eos> Well, if anyone can do it, it's you.<eos> The world spins on dreamers like you, Harold.<eos> Yeah, I should change, shouldn't I?<eos> You know, I'm gonna tell everybody at The Pines my son is changing the world.<eos> Why does Control want the drives to a broken program?<eos> The program's only broken until somebody smart fixes it.
- Who else has access to the loft?<eos> - Maid comes once a week.<eos> Handyman.<eos> The doormen all have keys.<eos> Is it the same handyman that I had fix the lock on the window?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe someone came in that way.<eos> You can walk right across the roof.<eos> May... Maybe she had someone help her kill herself.<eos> The only way we're gonna know is if we get this cork, bring it to the lab and let them test it for drugs.
Here you go.<eos> One for each of you.<eos> Don't send it all back home, okay?<eos> Thanks, amigos.<eos> Hey, Paco, get a round of half shots for my friends here.<eos> Make sure it's half shots, okay?<eos> - Yo, Kev.<eos> -Yeah? - You clean out that apartment yet?<eos> -Yeah, just got it cleaned out.<eos> I'm gonna set up some flyers and see if I can rent it out.

Yeah.<eos> Good, so regarding the pot...<eos> Mmm-hmm. We can get you that 60 bucks A.S.A.P.<eos> Okay.<eos> Or...<eos> This office warehouse gift card has $135 on it.<eos> Whoa. I know, it's like, what do they even have there?<eos> Only any office supply known to man.<eos> I mean, I think they even have food now.<eos> Oh, yeah... no, I'll take it.

I'm not gonna be a tax expert overnight, you know?<eos> It's a process, we're all going through a process.<eos> You know, last year they got me $600 back, so.<eos> I think they might just be sending you money.<eos> They're just sending you money.<eos> I think you're very wrong.<eos> No, I think I'm right.<eos> I just wanna get home and watch my shows.<eos> I need you to take this pot.<eos> I can't even, like, have it on--
Hey, Bevers, you hear the door knock earlier?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Why didn't you answer it?<eos> I know you don't like me to answer the door because I don't technically live here.<eos> Yeah, you don't technically live here, but when I'm not home, feel free to answer the door.<eos> It could be something important.<eos> Okay, now we've worked that out.<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> Hi, thanks for holding.<eos> So your package is still on the truck, but you can pick it up from the distribution center after 4:30.
You messed up my entire thing today.<eos> I think we should talk.<eos> We're talking right now.<eos> I think what needs to happen is you need to go home 'cause you don't live here.<eos> What?<eos> You need to grab all your little flip flops and all your socks and you need to get out.<eos> Jesus, what?<eos> Whoa. Jeremy.<eos> Okay, I don't have the package.<eos> I don't have it.

Jeremy.<eos> Okay, I don't have the package.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> They came here and then I wasn't here and then I had to go to the island to get it and there was this woman there and she was eating all this yogurt and she wouldn't give it to me 'cause
This sounds like something the one true Morty might say.<eos> I'm sick of being a human shield.<eos> I want to be a gardener!<eos> I want to write really crazy, intense action novels!<eos> I'm more than just a hammer!<eos> He is the one true Morty!<eos> Hooray! The one true Morty!<eos> Hey, keep it down!<eos> You've lived quite a life, Rick.<eos> It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through.
Just what every girl wants to hear from her boyfriend.<eos> So I'm still your boyfriend?<eos> As long as you understand it's not a part-time job.<eos> Understood.<eos> Okay.<eos> Rem, you have to get some rest, okay?<eos> We can't have you sleepwalking again.<eos> I will.<eos> But first I need to find out what's so important about this cameo.<eos> Esther must have put it in that suitcase for a reason.
He'd be dead right now if you wouldn't have stopped me.<eos> But he's not.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I wanted to kill Roy.<eos> Because that's what I do.<eos> That's who I am.<eos> I spent six years in the darkness.<eos> And I looked into the eyes of the devil and I gave him my soul.<eos> Let me help you get it back.
Sara's gone.<eos> Slade must have taken her.<eos> Chert.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's sonar.<eos> I was monitoring the "Amazo."<eos> She's moving.<eos> We have one torpedo left, right?<eos> Da.<eos> Could you rig it to fire in a straight line?
Please, I've made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I fake my orgasms.<eos> Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses?<eos> Really?<eos> How much for three?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, I'll call you back.<eos> Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing.<eos> I didn't mean to call it idiotic.
Yeah?<eos> Well, I fake my orgasms.<eos> Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses?<eos> Really?<eos> How much for three?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, I'll call you back.<eos> Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing.<eos> I didn't mean to call it idiotic.<eos> Well, I don't think you called it idiotic.
What other choice do I have?<eos> Have faith that my plans proceed as they must.<eos> I intend to take my rightful place at the appropriate time.<eos> The Bible has offered me no guidance here.<eos> So you've turned to another book?<eos> Oh, Lupo.<eos> The Book of Leaves is a distraction.<eos> Here my brother and I agree.<eos> Your brother has hidden the page from me.<eos> Locked it away in the bowels of the secret archives, forbidden me from even touching it.
Now you have nothing to eat for lunch.<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> It's nice to get some attention from a man who's not trying to sell me a reverse mortgage.<eos> (groans) So, we cool, Lorna?<eos> Yeah, we cool.<eos> (chuckles) See that?<eos> Everybody's cool.<eos> Everybody is not cool!<eos> Ginny is being so unreasonable.<eos> I scratched her car, then I fixed it, but we're still not cool.
That is sick, man.<eos> Dorian, will you stop punching things?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Low charge again.<eos> Kennex.<eos> What are we dealing with, a victim or a criminal?<eos> Victim, but he definitely robbed the bank.<eos> We found the money.<eos> What about the bomb?<eos> Well, he claims someone attached it to him.
John,<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> There's nothing we can do.<eos> Tell my wife I...<eos> Yeah.<eos> What kind of bomb was it?<eos> Propylene oxide.<eos> The filler is typical, but the wiring is very sophisticated...<eos> multiple decoys.<eos> I'm still trying to reconstruct it.
Troy Megliarino.<eos> He spent a hot sec in jail, but he lives in South Jersey and I know he'd steal a car and come up for the night.<eos> Chris Wazcyleski, he was a nude model in my life drawing class and he, like, always angled himself out to me.<eos> Chad Michael Fong.<eos> We met at a hardware store, he was disgusting.<eos> You know, I'm picking all white dudes right now.<eos> I must be craving pink dick.<eos> I'm gonna go with this.<eos> (Abbi) Okay, who else, who else?<eos> Henry Rowdenbush, had a unibrow all through middle school and then he started waxing it and all of a sudden it was like, glasses off, you're (bleep) gorgeous.
So this is my phone, this is your phone.<eos> My phone, your phone, okay?<eos> There's two.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I must have taken that on incident.<eos> I swear.<eos> Like, that makes sense 'cause I called my mom and she was like, way nicer than usual.<eos> I've been following you, like, all day today, I don't know how you didn't feel this vibrating at all.<eos> This purse is enormous.<eos> I carry it to make me look petite.
Okay, so, we both know that I'm 25, but what Mary doesn't yet know is that my license is expired.<eos> We're gonna need to come up with a plan in the next 20 seconds inside this huddle, 'cause when I created the huddle, I thought by this time I'd have a plan.<eos> I don't.<eos> - I'm gonna keep... - Here's my license and the AMEX should cover insurance.<eos> This isn't a sugar daddy thing.<eos> This is just an old, established "guy paying for his younger friend he has sex with" kind of thing, so just get that right out of your mind, you know?<eos> Well, you're all set.<eos> There's only one vehicle left.<eos> It doesn't have AC, but it's really spacious.<eos> We'll take it.
I like it, that's my frog costume.<eos> You're gonna have to let go of the frog costume, dude.<eos> Did you know that male giraffes will head butt the girl giraffes in the tummy and then it makes them pee and then they smell the pee to check if they're ovulating.<eos> Are giraffes like, your thing?<eos> I just like 'em, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I like, love rabbits, they're my thing.<eos> Yeah, cool.<eos> Now, I think now is the time to eat the ham.<eos> Okay, do you need help?<eos> We can leave it in there for longer if you think people aren't hungry, though.
- No, I wouldn't.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're not really interested in caring about others.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I'm interested in caring about others.<eos> I care about John.<eos> I keep John alive.<eos> His water bowl is always empty.<eos> I fill it.
No.<eos> Can we get Mexican pizza?<eos> No, Mexican pizzas are stupid.<eos> That does not make sense.<eos> I'd love Mexican pizza.<eos> Well, then maybe we should get a delicious Mexican pizza.<eos> Nobody likes you.<eos> I think that we should probably give Tom some pizza.<eos> Okay, Tom, uh, you can have some pizza.<eos> But what you have to do is you have to order it, and when you order it, you have to ask for extra jalapenos... except, instead of saying jalapenos, you have to say "jalapenos."
I dunno.<eos> You didn't tell anyone when you did it.<eos> It's different.<eos> - How?<eos> - I didn't plan it.<eos> She planned it.<eos> Okay.<eos> She left me a note.<eos> Okay.<eos> I haven't read it.
You and him out a deal?<eos> Sorry, son.<eos> Well, one more question before I go.<eos> How did you spend your take of our first hit?<eos> That's what you're asking me?<eos> I invested it.<eos> It's always best to make your money work for you.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I did much the same.<eos> I didn't even take my cut. I split it three ways.
Th-this does not end well for you.<eos> If you just put the remote down, we'll never speak of this ever again.<eos> I surrender.<eos> Hey.<eos> About before, I'm sorry if I was a little prickly.<eos> Yeah, you were.<eos> Without the "-ly."<eos> I know, I know, I know, I know.<eos> I'm just tense because this meeting is so important to me.<eos> Well, you can relax, because Mansfield told me to cancel it.
No!<eos> - Ah! Damn!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - I'm hanging up!<eos> No, you're n...<eos> You just transferred the call.<eos> Do any of you guys know how to use these phones?<eos> Look, you... you cannot cancel that meeting.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll do it without him.
Please advise.<eos> Mario.<eos> This was two weeks before the messenger was murdered.<eos> "Angie's weekly" must be her heroin.<eos> Maybe the rest of the package wasn't drugs.<eos> [Squeals] Oh, this is so freaking exciting.<eos> - What?<eos> - Police stuff.<eos> I feel like I'm in a TV show.<eos> If the note is here, he never sent it.
Oh, this is definitely bigger than mine.<eos> No, don't-don't worry about that.<eos> I am taller than you...<eos> No, the lump is slightly larger than mine and... rounder.<eos> Mine was oblong. Yeah.<eos> Now, texture-wise...<eos> Oh!<eos> Ooh, don't press it like that!<eos> You might dislodge it.<eos> Then we'll never find it in my body.
You're right.<eos> I did say that.<eos> And I'm sorry I lied.<eos> I just wanted a fair shot, and I didn't think you'd see me otherwise.<eos> And you'd be right.<eos> But I believe you will come to find that there is no one else in this town, this county, this state who is better qualified for this job than me.<eos> - Than I.<eos> - And with your consent,<eos> I-I would love to share my dissertation with you.<eos> And I would love to read it as soon as it's completed.
- How can you know that?<eos> - Because I hired someone to pretend to offer money to file a lawsuit.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's just lies.<eos> Everything out of your mouth is lies and lies.<eos> The point is, Clark is better off.<eos> Great.<eos> See?<eos> You want the truth.<eos> Then you punish me for saying it!
! Because I do know what he's capable of.<eos> Lock the door.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> But I just need you to calm down and just look at me.<eos> Okay?<eos> I need you to trust me.<eos> Access my personnel file.<eos> How do I do that?<eos> Gabriel, we used to listen to Mozart's 5th symphony together, okay?<eos> You... you hated it, but in learning to identify a single violin, that taught you how to exclude all but one sensory input.
- Ah!<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Not the face.<eos> Aah!<eos> Fore.<eos> Nice shot.<eos> Mr. Reese, it seems that the ISA took a mutually beneficial financial interest in the Black Market Bazaar, which they could ill afford to have come out.<eos> It still doesn't explain why the machine put me on this plane.<eos> I didn't program the machine to detect national embarrassments, Mr. Reese.<eos> I designed it to prevent a national tragedy.
I was nuts about it.<eos> I was passionate.<eos> Nobody told me yet that adults are supposed to be ashamed of those feelings.<eos> I learned that lesson the night the Colts beat the Giants.<eos> '58 Championship, greatest game ever played, and I didn't see a single snap.<eos> I was hooked up to machines at St. Peter's.<eos> To this day, I don't blame them.<eos> I don't think they meant to chase me off the roof.<eos> After IBM, I went across the country just looking for answers.<eos> I'd read your article and I couldn't stop thinking about it.
You may continue.<eos> April created a new position for herself, and I wanna do the same.<eos> The town could use more private-sector money after the merger.<eos> So as business liaison, I would find companies looking to move or expand, and convince them to do it in Pawnee.<eos> Now this is a good idea.<eos> You've come a long way, son.<eos> And while I got you here... talking tissue.<eos> Go for it.<eos> [Tom's voice] Yo, dog!<eos> Life is what you make of it.
This is really gonna help the campaign, Mr. Hendrie.<eos> I told you, call me Bruce.<eos> Right.<eos> So sorry.<eos> Thank you, Bruce.<eos> The question is, does he know your first name?<eos> I'm betting that he doesn't.<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, Bruce.<eos> You still taking the boat out tomorrow, Leo?<eos> Assuming that your staff remembered to put gas in it this time.
Do I really need to start this entire process right now?<eos> I mean, I feel fine.<eos> I didn't even know I was sick three days ago.<eos> What if I hadn't gone to the blood drive?<eos> I may not have found out about this for months.<eos> Thank God you did, right?<eos> - This is just really bad timing.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> It's never a good time to get that kind of news.<eos> Or to be the one giving it.
If you wanna hook up with someone whose biggest scoop is the impact of skrillex on society, go for it.<eos> What I wanna know is...<eos> Who's Natalie Ortiz?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who is she?<eos> Some girl whose car you took a picture of.<eos> - Why?<eos> - That was in my desk.<eos> Yep, and now it's not.<eos> Natalie Ortiz rented this car two days ago at Logan and returned it today.
Well, it felt like 10.<eos> If I'm not out of there in 15, please press your call button.<eos> There's no way I'm gonna be able to fall asleep in here.<eos> I thought that might happen.<eos> And I came prepared.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> In the attic.<eos> Remember, dad taught you how to read with that book.<eos> And we would read it to you when you couldn't sleep.
- Louisville.<eos> Right.<eos> I was in Louisville at this public pool that my girlfriend Susannah and I liked to go to.<eos> You remember Susannah, don't you?<eos> Looks like Eleanor Roosevelt?<eos> She was one of my bridesmaids.<eos> So, Susannah and I were splashing around like ninnies, trying to get the boys to notice us, when I realized that I had lost an earring.<eos> It was just some dime-store piece of junk, but I had said that it was real, so I had to make a big show of diving down to the bottom to get it.<eos> And then suddenly a shock wave hits.<eos> A man had jumped into the pool to get it, but all he had succeeded in doing was sending it directly down the drain. Oh.
Were there tears when it happened?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> A 12-year-old girl, she cries when she's being penetrated for the first time.<eos> Were you that 12-year-old girl?<eos> Yes, Hold you.<eos> Then why not say "I"?<eos> "I cried."<eos> Well, I did.<eos> And I've cried plenty in telling the story, maybe not tonight, but I have.<eos> To whom have you told it?
That our mother is an alcoholic?<eos> Who's next, Frank? Me?<eos> Of course.<eos> It took spending time with you to see it.<eos> You mask it better than most, but... You have all the signs.<eos> Mood swings, aggression, impulsive decision-making, chronic lying.<eos> Really?<eos> Who am I lying to, Frank?<eos> Yourself.<eos> We are a family with a shared disease, a corrosive disease, and if you view us through that lens, if each of us is able to address our sickness and treat it...
I know.<eos> I-I mean just...sleep.<eos> When we admitted publicly that the U-2 belonged to us...<eos> Looks like someone worked up an appetite.<eos> I missed lunch.<eos> We were doing something that in a modern world... I swear, slap a beard on him, he's a dead ringer for father time.<eos> Come friday, we'll have a president with a full head of hair.<eos> That's a first in my lifetime.<eos> When I first saw a picture of Jackie, I thought, "Now I know what the american dream is." And John Kennedy?<eos> He is living it.
Well, you're still a connected man, Barton,<eos> Because whatever you did, our film is now officially dead.<eos> I thought you'd look happier about that, Bill.<eos> It was what you wanted, wasn't it?<eos> I mean, why you called me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Your work is better than Kaufman's.<eos> You know that.<eos> You just aren't ready to show it to the world yet.
Don't you see what we have here?<eos> It's worth it.<eos> When can I get it?<eos> Soon.<eos> I want to see it work for myself.<eos> Follow me.<eos> We'll use her.<eos> Have to kill her anyway.<eos> So Anton sells his genius tracking software - to arms dealers.<eos> - Who take it and use it to create a guidance system for a new kind of bullet that can track down anyone wherever they are.
We need these guys' help.<eos> They'll create a diversion on the day of the surgery.<eos> I'm told you have a plan already in place.<eos> We can take down the President of the United States.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> Once the President flatlines, we're going to need five minutes alone with the body.<eos> We need to create a crisis inside the hospital, while you're operating on the President.<eos> I left a bag.<eos> Inside there's a smoke grenade.<eos> Stick it inside the fire extinguisher case closest to the operating room.
I just keep forgetting.<eos> PILAF (chuckles): We all pitched in.<eos> Except for Irene, who's still in Reno at the Ferret Nationals, whatever that is.<eos> I hope everyone realizes how important this party is to Kim, and shows up, and aren't disappointed that it's not on a boat.<eos> Michael and I showed up for my Semester at Sea, and it was moved to a double-wide trailer in a parking lot next to the football stadium because of budget reasons.<eos> It was a wonderful four months.<eos> KIM: Check it out, guys!<eos> A piñata!<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> Yes, I made it by hand, and yes, the eyes are inspired by Ginny.
When you gonna tell me what's going on, Ghost?<eos> I ain't no kid.<eos> New phones and shit?<eos> Guessing y'all had a car accident?<eos> We got run off the road.<eos> Your car still running?<eos> Still running, but the repairs might be too expensive to make.<eos> And the other guy's car?<eos> Totaled.<eos> We had to tow it.

Goodweather, what are you doing to me here?<eos> Just tell me what you have.<eos> I'm just getting into it now.<eos> I haven't finished cutting all of them yet.<eos> Just give me anything you can.<eos> Okay, top of the charts... is here.<eos> Can you see this here?<eos> Yeah, what is that?<eos> It's an incision.<eos> Deep enough to puncture one wall of the carotid artery without rupturing it.
Great.<eos> Mr. Kent, here, can take down your information...<eos> Time is of the essence, Doctor.<eos> It certainly is.<eos> Jim...<eos> Eph...<eos> You have to listen to me.<eos> I have seen this disease before.<eos> I have faced it before.<eos> You... you must contain it.
Is that an option?<eos> 'Cause I can do that.<eos> You need to get a new job.<eos> Someone around here needs to get a new job, and it ain't me.<eos> I'm not sure if I understand...<eos> I'm not sure I want to explain it to you again.<eos> - Dan...<eos> - No, too busy.<eos> Load faster, you asshole.<eos> Gary, get your arm out of my airspace before I shoot it down.
No!<eos> Captain, hey.<eos> You're looking stoic today, like a wise old oak.<eos> I'm not gonna give you more cases so you can win your bet with Santiago.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, right, the bet.<eos> Totally forgot about that.<eos> Well, granted, this friendly competition has led to you and Santiago putting in more hours and arresting more perps, especially this last week.<eos> Up by one, Peralta.<eos> Anything you want to say to your car before you never see it again? Hmm?
They're, like, 0% fat.<eos> Jake, that's not true at all.<eos> It's actually the opposite.<eos> What?<eos> That nut vendor lied to me.<eos> I think a pigeon just flew out of your car.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The windows don't exactly roll up.<eos> The car's a piece of crap.<eos> Why do you love it so much?
Yeah.<eos> The windows don't exactly roll up.<eos> The car's a piece of crap.<eos> Why do you love it so much?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> I was two days out of the academy, super nervous.<eos> Saw this guy run out of a bodega, clutching a bunch of cash.<eos> So I pursued him on foot, 11 blocks.<eos> Finally catch him, cuff him, throw him up against that car.<eos> Turned out there was a for sale sign in the window, and, it being the best day of my life, I bought it.
Okay, thank you, April, for that... wonderful lesson in female empowerment.<eos> Amen!<eos> Amen, but... why are we all holding these plastic champagne flutes?<eos> 'Cause we are about to pop the cork with some bubbly.<eos> But don't worry, this Spumante is virgin.<eos> Probably like you will be for a long time.<eos> Anyways... Will and I want you to raise your glass to celebrate the glee club by singing hands down the best song New Directions! ever did.<eos> Wait a second, the New Directions! never sang<eos> "Raise Your Glass." The Warblers did that.<eos> I was wondering why it didn't annoy me every time I heard it in my head.
But you hid the fact the entire time you were in Glee Club so Mr. Shue would allow you to, quote,<eos> "Park and Bark"?<eos> No comment.<eos> Good.<eos> Last question.<eos> Do you know what song you're going to sing for Mr. Shue's last assignment?<eos> Yes. "Defying Gravity."<eos> What?<eos> ! No, you can't sing that song.<eos> Kurt and I are singing it, but we're switching parts so that I can belt out the high note at the end.
- What is it?<eos> - Don't you remember?<eos> You were going to put a proposition for me?<eos> Was I?<eos> Yes!<eos> And I am still waiting!<eos> The thing is, Floki, I'm not entirely sure I can trust you.<eos> Porunn, you are a free woman now.<eos> What will you do with your freedom?<eos> I will use it to choose.
It's not as lame as it sounds.<eos> We also did physics, so...<eos> Right. So, Mitch, what are you up to these days?<eos> I'm still teaching orchestra.<eos> I'm at this public school up in the Bronx.<eos> It's totally underfunded, a lot of the kids can't afford instruments, but I really...<eos> Take my cello.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah, you gotta take it.

Okay.<eos> I just came from the doctor.<eos> Well, not, uh, just.<eos> I've been walking around for a while...<eos> Right, I get it.<eos> Then I headed back to work, and I thought, uh what am I doing?<eos> Well, what did the doctor say?<eos> Well, there's chemo.<eos> You know, I knew that.<eos> Then there's, uh, surgery to remove the radius, replace it with an artificial one, if they... uh, don't have to amputate.
XR2!<eos> XR2i, 16 valve.<eos> 16 valve?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> See, I've gone for the coveted Mk2 eight-valve model.<eos> Eight valve?<eos> Eight valve.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, the comedy stickers.<eos> The thing is, James, what you have to remember is, you know when you look at a car, how has it been treated? Who's owned it?
- Yeah, no, I--<eos> - It's typical of Max that he can't let things go.<eos> So it's irrational, it's frustrating...<eos> - Yeah, no, I know.<eos> - But I just want you to know, don't take it personally.<eos> I mean, you know, to be honest, I did break a promise to him, so- well, that happens.<eos> - Yeah. And he needs to learn how to deal with that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And I brought you this book on asperger's syndrome.<eos> I don't know if you have time to read it, but it might help understand Max a little bit better, because we really want this to work out here.
We need to find another victim.<eos> Setrakian said he knew where the bodies were going.<eos> Back to their loved ones.<eos> - Emma arnot. Her father.<eos> Jesus...<eos> - We'll bring her to the hospital.<eos> Run some tests.<eos> - Then we'll have video of both redfern and her.<eos> - I'll never get used to this car.<eos> - You know I traded my rolex for it back...
They're shooting at them!<eos> And I'd love nothing more than to shoot back, Pam, but somehow I can't find my gun! Huh. For the love of God, just pull over!<eos> Uh, okay! Cyril, do not stop this bus!<eos> Okay!<eos> Let's just give them Cherlene, that is the very definition of a win-win!<eos> Yes!<eos> Why do you always ruin everything for me?<eos> Why do you always never shut up?<eos> Because where the hell is my gun?<eos> Are you, like, sure you brought it?
So what the hell are you doing here?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> I could also ask how long you've known he speaks English, but I won't.<eos> You blew this when your people were hunting us.<eos> You saved our lives.<eos> I have to believe there's more like you.<eos> I stabbed you.<eos> And we tortured you.<eos> If the two of us can get along, the maybe there's hope.<eos> Learn from history instead of repeating it, right?
Ladies and gentlemen, we are cleared for takeoff.<eos> We're all gonna die!<eos> We're all gonna die!<eos> During the flight, I'll admit, I-I had a few... difficult moments, but, you know, by the time we'd landed...<eos> Here already.<eos> Well, I have to say, it wasn't so dreadful after all.<eos> Oh, I do apologize if I caused any distress.<eos> And, oh, I'm terribly sorry about the door.<eos> I had no idea it would fly off like that.<eos> Please, please send me a bill, because I'd like to replace it.
He's the man whose DNA was found at the scene of the Magpie's murder.<eos> And Jerome Thomas.<eos> They collaborated on that book, which is used as the introductory text for almost every entry-level course.<eos> Now, Andrew Donnelly's reputation would be ruined if "Dead Clade Walking" were proven correct.<eos> So what do you think would happen to sales of his textbook?<eos> I'm sure they would plummet.<eos> What do you suppose would happen to the reputation of his close associates?<eos> They'd be tainted, too.<eos> What one earth are you two doing?<eos> You found out there was a fossil that could prove "Dead Clade Walking"" and you killed Doug Newberg to get your hands on it.
Shake your belly!<eos> Keep it moving!<eos> Huh. I always wondered how they made sponges.<eos> Somebody need a hole plugged?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> There's a... old tarp in the shed.<eos> Just cover as much of the roof as you can, and I'll get a roofer out here next week.<eos> A roofer? [laughs]<eos> La-di-dah! When did you get so middle-class?<eos> Can you find the leak, cover it with hot tar, and then reshingle?
the use of drones to listen in on communications.<eos> Now, this is all in the development stages, but definitely something DoD would not want to go public.<eos> All right, but is it serious enough that someone from the government would be willing to stage a fake car crash, murder a woman, just to... keep it a secret?<eos> Just because you're not paranoid doesn't mean they're not following you.<eos> In this case, backseat driving.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> One of the files references--<eos> One of the files refers to Wi-Fi technology, which enables a user to hack a car's onboard CPUs-- specifically, after-market black boxes, like the one that was installed in Merchiston's rental car.<eos> So you're saying that they've developed a software that allows you to take control of a car... remotely.<eos> And remotely crash it.
Come on, J-Ju, get your dance on!<eos> I'm doing it, Zeke.<eos> My little tiny dancer.<eos> I got something new for our act... magic rope.<eos> Cool!<eos> A rope!<eos> No, that's not how it works.<eos> Whoo! No... Giddy up, magic cowboy!<eos> Come on!<eos> Look, you're supposed to cut the rope, then restore it.
And I can't live with that.<eos> And the only way I'm not gonna reopen this case is if he passes that test.<eos> Okay.<eos> You'll be in room nine.<eos> Let me know if you need anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Bates Motel.<eos> - Oh, it's me, Emma.<eos> Would you mind bringing up my book?<eos> I think I left it on the desk in the office.
Okay.<eos> You'll be in room nine.<eos> Let me know if you need anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Bates Motel.<eos> - Oh, it's me, Emma.<eos> Would you mind bringing up my book?<eos> I think I left it on the desk in the office.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's right here.<eos> I'll run it up to you.
Mr. Arnot?<eos> Have any of the personal effects of the deceased been returned to the next of kin, by any chance?<eos> What?<eos> What!<eos> When?<eos> OK, I'm on my way.<eos> This thing was on her pillow. When she woke up,<eos> - bit her in the face. - Hm.<eos> I want this rat found and killed.<eos> I'm not here to rehabilitate it.
- Oh, nice.<eos> - That are also super mandatory.<eos> Uh, we can't use Facebook anymore?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Massive time waster.<eos> Kills productivity.<eos> Hey, sanitation.<eos> Listen, let's talk health insurance.<eos> Your dependents don't have it anymore.
Oh. Seriously, that's just for the rehearsal dinner.<eos> That sounds elaborate.<eos> All we did was punch "jewelry store"<eos> into our car GPS.<eos> You remember that romantic moment, Chris?<eos> I was getting gas.<eos> No, I don't remember it.<eos> Hey, Tom, I don't mean to bug you or anything, but I notice that my super system binder is closed.<eos> Just checking that you had a chance to refamiliarize yourself entirely.<eos> Yeah, flipped through it.
We live on a farm.<eos> I saw the doctor on the second day of school.<eos> They didn't find Marla till my friend Andrew's birthday.<eos> Eight months.<eos> And he shipped us off to Winnipeg, then they tell us it's too late, there's nothing that can be done.<eos> And we're supposed to accept that?<eos> So you've come here for a second opinion?<eos> Second, third, sixth.<eos> And then we found your paper.<eos> You can cut it out, Dr. Reid.
So we need to deliver this bad boy "en bloc," in one piece.<eos> Reycraft and I will free it from the intestines.<eos> Then I can extend the incision and use the perispinal muscles as my posterior medial margin.<eos> We'll go in the front door and start clearing house.<eos> Then I'll come in and clean up after you.<eos> And what is my job?<eos> You are our good-luck charm and our muscle.<eos> - Muscle?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Once we lift up the tumor to start cutting, - you can't put it down.
Maggie, you're gonna have to hold that up, too.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I'm feeling some resistance here.<eos> Uh, could be the presacral plexus.<eos> (sighs) I don't know.<eos> I just... I can't...<eos> There.<eos> There is a monster vein heading right into the tumor.<eos> I c...<eos> I can't visualize it without risking tearing it out.

I can't...<eos> There.<eos> There is a monster vein heading right into the tumor.<eos> I c...<eos> I can't visualize it without risking tearing it out.<eos> (Reycraft sighs) All right.<eos> - You're gonna have to cut it.
Why?<eos> I won 500 bucks on a scratch ticket.<eos> I'd throw it in if that would help.<eos> Walter, you know how we've been discussing your self-esteem and how it's easier for you to stay home with Vallenwe'en and take care of her than to go out and how socially, your experience is feeling withdrawn?<eos> Yeah. And I'm gonna work on that, now that Vallenwe'en has a home.<eos> (exhales) Well, actually, Walter, about that, um...<eos> I've got a good feeling about that doctor.<eos> She's a heart doctor, and she is so beautiful.<eos> Walter, wait. Uh...<eos> I gotta say, I love that guinea pig so much, but I can't believe how nice it feels to give it to the doctor who fixed my heart.
Yeah, not my choice.<eos> And you find yourself drawn to dangerous activities?<eos> - Extremes... like skydiving?<eos> - Gotta stay alert.<eos> - Stay strong.<eos> Gotta stay combat ready.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, the key to resolving traumatizing events is remembering them and telling your story over and over.<eos> They're better out than in.<eos> If you knew what my "unresolved issue" was, you wouldn't ask me to relive it.
You got us milling around out there like a bunch of Frenchmen.<eos> Randy, I'm with someone.<eos> I'll wait in line for a Ferris wheel.<eos> I'll wait in line for a beer.<eos> But damned if I'll wait around till 11:45 to get fired by flipping you or flipping Joe MacMillan.<eos> Wait, you're firing me?<eos> I'm being fired?<eos> - Just calm down.<eos> - My reference letter.<eos> And don't worry, I wrote it myself.
I'll order a pizza.<eos> She took my soda.<eos> Nothing like a bubble bath to make you forget life's little traumas.<eos> - Works for me.<eos> - Oh, we also got them a little something.<eos> Oh, you shouldn't have.<eos> "Bowser"?<eos> It's not exactly a bird's name.<eos> Poor thing's dead by now.<eos> I expect you can call it whatever you like.
- Of course, Joseph.<eos> - Joe MacMillan, Loulu.<eos> Travis, Joe MacMillan here.<eos> So, Joseph, where do you hail from?<eos> - Hudson River Valley.<eos> - Oh, I adore that area.<eos> - You get to the city?<eos> - Yes, often.<eos> Travis and I go annually.<eos> He ignores the opera, I sponsor it.
- Let's just go home.<eos> - No.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> If we go home, the firewall is up, and then you don't have to deal with me anymore.<eos> Instead, fellow employee, I will meet you in the basement conference room at 6:00 P.M., and we will solve this chard issue once and for all.<eos> Don't forget your approval pen.<eos> What?<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> I made it for you last night.
It was so weird...<eos> he was wetting my bread, and then my bread was wet, if you know what I'm saying.<eos> Okay, thank you. I'm finally off bread.<eos> Look, I understand.<eos> You can't always help who you're attracted to.<eos> It's like with me and Nicolas...<eos> This is not the same as you and Frenchie.<eos> I wasn't attracted to Deke before today.<eos> The first time you met Nicolas, your vagina fell on the floor and tried to crawl up his leg.<eos> Yes, but I scooped it up and snapped it back on because I was not born to have sex with a married man.
Um, minimal damage to the clothing.<eos> However, there was a button missing at the top of the trousers, front right-hand side.<eos> And there...<eos> Oh, hang on a second.<eos> Ah, there was also an unusual amount of dust inside the trousers.<eos> Dust?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> The missing button may not mean anything, either.<eos> I'll get Davis to keep an eye out for it.
Hardly qualifies as an affair.<eos> I spent my entire marriage turning a blind eye to this sort of thing.<eos> I just don't want it thrown back in my face in public.<eos> Might there be an angry husband who wanted to hurt Mr Trevorrow?<eos> Maybe.<eos> And what about you, Mrs Trevorrow?<eos> I gave everything to Graham.<eos> People tended to do that, you know?<eos> Now that he's gone, his reputation is all that I have.<eos> Please don't destroy it.
I-I came into my office and she was there.<eos> She knew.<eos> What happened?<eos> I tried to stop her.<eos> She ran out onto the landing.<eos> I grabbed her and she toppled over the rail.<eos> But I couldn't hold her.<eos> And Graham Trevorrow?<eos> We found traces of blood on the bat.<eos> Even though you'd cleaned it and oiled it at some point over the last few days.
One day in London, I saw Mr Krupa coming out of a club.<eos> What did I do?<eos> I followed him.<eos> And as he was getting into a taxi, he dropped his handkerchief on the pavement.<eos> And I picked it up and kept it.<eos> In fact, I probably still have it somewhere.<eos> You just wanted something that was his.<eos> Now, this song.<eos> I'm guessing you don't like it.<eos> No, I love it.
And I picked it up and kept it.<eos> In fact, I probably still have it somewhere.<eos> You just wanted something that was his.<eos> Now, this song.<eos> I'm guessing you don't like it.<eos> No, I love it.<eos> It's their best.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I had a look at the record earlier and that's all scratched out.<eos> Well, I told you, I found it outside the pub.
Sticky tape. Why?<eos> Well, because we're out of ideas.<eos> (Sighs) Alright.<eos> You keep up a fair pace. Yes, well, I have to around here.<eos> Oh, cup of tea, Richard?<eos> Lovely. JEAN:<eos> Lucien? In here!<eos> What's through those doors?<eos> It's his mother's room apparently.<eos> He keeps it locked.
Of course it's his real name.<eos> It's my name now.<eos> Why would you ask that?<eos> Well, no reason, really.<eos> I'm dreadfully sorry.<eos> Forgive me for asking.<eos> At least now I know what happened to him.<eos> Excuse me. Hmm?<eos> I'm looking for a poem.<eos> I'm not entirely sure who wrote it.
He died a couple of days ago, the police are investigating.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Yes.<eos> What happened?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> But if the cops are involved?<eos> I heard he was at Fromelles.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> Bloody terrible, isn't it.<eos> He survives the war and cops it back home in Ballarat.
She was much nicer than I am.<eos> Miss Clasby.<eos> Jean.<eos> Here you are, Agnes.<eos> When are you getting rid of all these tat on the walls?<eos> Tat?<eos> What about your mother's paintings?<eos> Where are they?<eos> You realise the gallery is putting her work into storage?<eos> They bought one solitary painting, then they go and hide it.
No.<eos> We have far more valuable paintings.<eos> So, why steal it?<eos> Mr Baldwin, Dr Lucien Blake.<eos> A little tight of chest?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let's check that pulse of yours to begin with, shall we?<eos> Not much of a gap.<eos> It's obviously big enough.<eos> That's why they took the frame off and passed it out the window.
Agnes Clasby's talking about her, someone tries to steal her painting from the gallery.<eos> And look - I found this in the flat of that girl who was murdered.<eos> That's Agnes Clasby.<eos> Yes.<eos> Isn't that your mother's work?<eos> Certainly appears to be.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> Well... look at you.<eos> - You stole it!
Someone's painted alizarin crimson over that section there.<eos> I think...<eos> I think they may have been trying to hide some damage.<eos> Who?<eos> Virginia Mackay.<eos> She had the very same pigment on her belt buckle.<eos> You think this painting has something to do with her death?<eos> Her boss was complaining about her clumsiness.<eos> So, how does it work?<eos> Her belt buckle catches on the painting, scratching it.

In fact, no-one's been in here for years.<eos> Your mother was a gorgeous girl.<eos> Why don't you take a seat here, Agnes?<eos> I'd like to ask you some questions, if I may?<eos> Did Mother ever mention a painter by the name of David Davies?<eos> All the time - not that your father approved.<eos> He was a jealous man.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did she ever mention anything about a specific painting, one depicting a farmhouse?<eos> He gave it to her.
She lost the painting.<eos> Lost?<eos> Well, apparently, it's fairly easy to lose a painting.<eos> Now, you sat for her while she painted your portrait?<eos> Right here.<eos> You knew what she was doing?<eos> Of course I did!<eos> Michael Tyneman was a philistine.<eos> So was your father.<eos> So she hid the painting where neither of them would ever find it.
Right here.<eos> You knew what she was doing?<eos> Of course I did!<eos> Michael Tyneman was a philistine.<eos> So was your father.<eos> So she hid the painting where neither of them would ever find it.<eos> And good for her, I say!<eos> Your mother was given a painting by a famous artist?<eos> Yes.<eos> And your father sold it to old man Tyneman?
I am just the housekeeper.<eos> Father Morton left that night to meet with a penitent.<eos> That's right.<eos> To be honest, it's been a long time since I...<eos> Anyhow, I can't imagine late-night confessions would be standard practice.<eos> I'd never known anyone to call that late.<eos> And tell me, you worked for Father Morton for a long time?<eos> Yes.<eos> I never really understood the importance of religion before meeting Cyril.<eos> Sometimes it helps to put a face to it.
He's also been shot in both knees.<eos> And here... ..one shot to the back.<eos> Obviously taken by surprise.<eos> But I'll tell you something, Superintendent, he wasn't taken by surprise.<eos> And look here.<eos> I'd say he's raised his hand, trying to shield himself and, again, one shot.<eos> The Dennison family, they... ..they were involved with just about every charity I can think of.<eos> Who would do such a thing?<eos> Are you familiar with the police surgeon brief, Doctor, as per the police handbook?<eos> Yes, I've read it.
I saw my father a week ago.<eos> Mum and the others, not for ages.<eos> What did you discuss with your father?<eos> He told me I was cut out of the will.<eos> I thought he disowned you a long time ago.<eos> He was just making it official.<eos> I thought when he called he wanted to... make things better.<eos> Mr Corrigan, how did you hurt your leg?<eos> It's an old injury.<eos> Yes, but how did you get it?
Ah. Ashby ask why you needed these?<eos> He doesn't know. Hm.<eos> So what's worrying you, Doc?<eos> Lividity, Charlie.<eos> Lividity.<eos> Now, they were at the table.<eos> Someone came in, took them by surprise.<eos> They were reading the newspaper.<eos> Well, the newspaper was on the table.<eos> Whether or not they got around to reading it, I don't know.
Yes. Le Rouge Et Le Noir.<eos> We studied it at school.<eos> Le Rouge Et Le Noir.<eos> It's the story of, um... of a carpenter's son, Julien Sorel.<eos> He rises up through French society in the 19th century.<eos> It's a satire.<eos> Can you think of any reason why that would be of interest to Richard?<eos> No.<eos> And even if it was, he couldn't read French, so the book would have been useless to him.<eos> Then why take it to a party?
Lived together two years before I got pregnant.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah. He was so excited he was gonna be a dad.<eos> He brought me strawberry milkshakes every day.<eos> He made you a crib out of leather.<eos> And then, you surprised us a couple of weeks early at a... at a Blue Oyster Cult concert.<eos> My water broke right in the middle of "Don't Fear the Reaper."<eos> - I never liked that song.<eos> - Uh, understandable.<eos> You were stuck in my pelvis the first time you heard it.
My contractions are nine minutes apart!<eos> (groaning) Just go to the bathroom, Gene.<eos> You made it all the way to Sunday.<eos> It's still heroic.<eos> You just don't understand the pageantry of the Super Bowel.<eos> Oh, my God, it's almost kickoff.<eos> Our commercial is gonna air any minute.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> I can't wait to see it, Bobby.
You copied Pesto! What?<eos> !<eos> No!<eos> I did it first!<eos> Pesto copied me!<eos> Cry-baby copycat!<eos> (laughs): Cry-baby copycat!<eos> No!<eos> The commercial with Sandy was my idea!<eos> And Jimmy Pesto stole it!
Yes.<eos> Ow! Come on!<eos> 36 percent!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> None of this ever should have happened.<eos> I-I made a great commercial with my family.<eos> It was funny and cute.<eos> Well, it wasn't that funny, but it was good.<eos> Well, it wasn't that good, but... but it was us.<eos> And I scrapped it to make a commercial I thought would get more customers.
Besides, no offense... they're after bigger game.<eos> Good night, Agent Beeman.<eos> Good night, sir.<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's very, um...<eos> Actually, I hated it.<eos> I don't know anything about classical music.<eos> Well, you certainly picked it.
Do you copy?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Just a misfire.<eos> Now stop worrying about me and get back to work, all of you...<eos> And tell raven to hurry her ass up.<eos> All right, that's long enough.<eos> Tie those two ends together.<eos> Get that door open.<eos> All right.<eos> Now get up and toss it over.
Come on.<eos> Dad, seriously, I'm okay.<eos> Why were you not headed to lunch like everyone else?<eos> They left their bags.<eos> I was just trying to do something nice.<eos> You do something nice and you make friends.<eos> Or so I've heard.<eos> Scott. I think I know what she was looking for.<eos> You took the doll from the car?<eos> Yeah, I thought you could use it, you know, for like her scent.
And Tate is out there with a rifle.<eos> I want you to stay out of those woods.<eos> You got that?<eos> Stiles?<eos> - It's the doll.<eos> - Stiles?<eos> It's the doll?<eos> All right, but why would it go all the way to the school and then all the way back to the house just for a doll?<eos> One that was in the car wreck in the first place.<eos> We didn't find it in the coyote den.
No, there was something else I found.<eos> If you somehow offend a nogitsune, it can react pretty badly.<eos> How do you offend a nogitsune?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if it's doing something this bad, then someone really, really offended it.<eos> Listen up!<eos> Anybody catches the slightest glimpse of Stilinski, you contact the first available teacher.<eos> - Got it!<eos> - Yes, Coach.<eos> There's a card on my desk for Isaac Lahey, and every one of you losers is not only going to sign it, you're going to write a personal message so profound and deep, it's gonna bring a tear to Coach's eye.
She stays.<eos> Do you actually think I was trying to kill you when I bit you?<eos> You were my backup plan, remember?<eos> Not to mention, the bite is what brought out your nascent abilities.<eos> You think power like that was going to come out on its own?<eos> I'm the spark that lit your fire, sweetheart.<eos> You attacked her and nearly killed her.<eos> Power doesn't come without a little pain and struggle.<eos> I didn't ask for it.<eos> But you're embracing it now, aren't you?
Stop.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Hey, look at me.<eos> You should have done your reading, Scott.<eos> See, a nogitsune feeds off chaos, strife and pain.<eos> This morning, you took it from Isaac, then you took it from Coach.<eos> And then from a dying deputy.<eos> All that pain.<eos> You took it all.

- Dad, it's okay.<eos> - No, no.<eos> You're never going to be able to fall asleep.<eos> We...<eos> We got to go back.<eos> It's fine, Dad.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> I can't believe I forgot it.<eos> I mean, every time that we've ever stayed in a hotel, the first thing you pack is your pillow.<eos> You can bring it tomorrow.
It's, um-- it's Giselle.<eos> Giselle's back. Awesome!<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, Mark.<eos> We're, uh, kind of in the middle of something, you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let me in.<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> We didn't want you to find out this way, but, you know, there's always been that unspoken thing between Giselle and I?<eos> Well, we've been exploring it.
You mean the guard?<eos> No.<eos> Why is that chair moving?<eos> Keep an eye on that group.<eos> What happened to the video?<eos> It's some kind of, uh, interference.<eos> There's a frequency coming through that's just unusual.<eos> Unusual how?<eos> Well it's a frequency that won't be used for decades.<eos> Can you isolate it?
You talk to Marjorie lately?<eos> It scares me, the way your mind works.<eos> - You expecting anybody?<eos> - Nope.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - What do I think of what?<eos> - Your new car.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> No, no.<eos> I got it at a police auction.
Nice girl.<eos> Hard worker.<eos> Well, I'd like to say on behalf of all of us, getting married?<eos> What the hell are you doing, Marty?<eos> Why do you need seven wives?<eos> You can barely get through nine holes of golf!<eos> She's a sweet kid, and I need a little warmth and comfort at the end of the day.<eos> Have you ever considered a nice piece of toast?<eos> Uh, well, I would like to say something.<eos> Uh... I might be in the minority here, but I still believe in love, and it's inspiring to know that even at your age, you can still find it.
- Ordinary?<eos> Ordinary.<eos> Worthless.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Worthless.<eos> - It would be that chair, wouldn't it?<eos> Well, the Tiffany lamps, I saw a Tiffany lamp in a store, in the Kings Road, and I thought, "Oh, it's kind of "a kitschy kind of thing, but it's all right."<eos> And it was like 80 grand or something ludicrous.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> - So you bought it. - They sold a very...
Yes, indeed. And they are a rather wonderful device.<eos> Invented in the 1930s.<eos> You have a disc like this.<eos> You can pull it out, pop it in, and you press a lever and you get a 3-D picture.<eos> And what you have got are the army versions that were used to help members of gunnery crews and various other things to recognise the outlines and shapes of either friendly or enemy aircraft.<eos> - And that is what you will see.<eos> - Thomas the Tank Engine, I have got.<eos> We have given Alan Thomas the Tank Engine.<eos> We thought he would be confused by the aeroplanes.<eos> So what does your card say when you pull it out, Alan?
Do you young people in the audience play Snakes and Ladders?<eos> AUDIENCE MEMBER: No.<eos> That man's taken a survey.<eos> Don't you, of an evening?<eos> That one didn't sound very young.<eos> Is there a Snakes and Ladders app?<eos> No?<eos> Well, while we're in a playful mood, I have one of my knick-knacks to show you.<eos> The great Lord Kelvin in the 1890s was wandering along a beach with a friend called Hugh Blackburn, who was a mathematician.<eos> They found a pebble and a surface on which to spin it and they found it had a peculiar property, not unlike this, which is called a tippe top.
- Tanzania and also Sri Lanka.<eos> - So, that's nutmeg there?<eos> Love that.<eos> And nutmeg is related to mace in which way? What way? How way?<eos> - Cousins. - Well, I think it's that I put mace in my beef stroganoff but not nutmeg, does that work?<eos> Mace and nutmeg are the same plant,<eos> - just different parts of the same plant. - Oh, OK.<eos> - Actually, yeah.<eos> But the one we're talking about is cinnamon.<eos> And the salesman of cinnamon, in order to sell it at the most premium price they could, used to tell of where it came from.
And it's all about to come crashing down unless there's an act of God or something.<eos> Well, I can't do anything about the God part.<eos> But I might have an angle on the, uh,<eos> "or something."<eos> Dr. Breeland?<eos> James Boyd,<eos> Montgomery Press.<eos> Is it true that you're preventing this girl from connecting with her dead father?<eos> What?<eos> I understand that he gave her his practice and you ripped it away from her.

Ripped it away!<eos> And she's gone to extraordinary lengths to get it back, but you're shutting her out.
How about that choir, people?<eos> I thought I saw the box move. Aah!<eos> What can you say about Conrad?<eos> Conrad.<eos> He was a lot of things to a few people.<eos> He was a loud man with strong opinions.<eos> Although I didn't find him attractive, many of our wives did.<eos> He was a good Jew... and even better anti-Semite.<eos> But I never judged, 'cause I thought he had inside information.<eos> Information... there's so much of it out there.
Hey, one question.<eos> Um, where do you think you're gonna stand, in front of the graffiti that says "Pawnee, you suck,"<eos> or "Go home, Eagleton snobs"?<eos> I painted over that graffiti a week ago.<eos> These people are the worst!<eos> I cannot announce a unity concert in front of a picture of a bald eagle giving the middle finger.<eos> Yeah, you probably wanna stand to the side so people can see it.<eos> You know, why do we even have this wall?<eos> We're supposed to be uniting the two towns, and this literally divides them.<eos> - We should just knock it down.
I'm finding it hard to imagine Judge Stone as a killer.<eos> Oh. Easier than imagining her having a sense of humour?<eos> Oh, er, please!<eos> These women hired Carlton, he made them all happy.<eos> How?<eos> Most men struggle to make one woman happy.<eos> Clearly, he was good at his job.<eos> Yes, then there's the mobile.<eos> And the book and...<eos> It makes no sense, I read it from cover to cover.
They did the same thing to me.<eos> Five years ago.<eos> Or was it six?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm you.<eos> Couldn't mix the right serum the way they wanted, so they caged me.<eos> What do you know about this Barnes guy?<eos> He wants to make...<eos> A beast?<eos> That's why they want to make the serum; they want to combine it with beast blood.
Sure.<eos> It's supposed to scare us.<eos> That doesn't work on me.<eos> Hell can't be that bad.<eos> At least it's warm there.<eos> Colonel, we have guests.<eos> Gentlemen, at ease.<eos> Is that how you appreciate punctuality?<eos> We're friends.<eos> Drop the toy, sweetheart, or I'll shove it up your ass and use the silencer.
We need to find this guy.<eos> I think Troy Parker just reached out.<eos> CSI Russell, Jenny Carroll.<eos> Ms. Carroll is in charge of the chess tour.<eos> How do you do?<eos> How can I help you, Ms. Carroll?<eos> We received this package at our reception area an hour ago.<eos> It was sent to our grandmaster- in-residence, Karl Schrute.<eos> Has anyone else touched this besides you?<eos> My assistant and I. He's the one who opened it.
Ripped By mstoll<eos> Ah, very inspirational speech, ma'am.<eos> Oh, come on, you wrote it, you can't review it.
Ripped By mstoll<eos> Ah, very inspirational speech, ma'am.<eos> Oh, come on, you wrote it, you can't review it.<eos> How are you?<eos> I meant that you read it very inspirationally.
It doesn't matter.<eos> - I don't understand what's...<eos> God! Whatever makes me happy?<eos> - It's complicated, isn't it?<eos> - It is, it is.<eos> But my job is to discover how America thinks.<eos> And right now, the public is interested in tax relief for tech firms. Interesting.<eos> Yeah, but they're still deciding.<eos> There is a lot of interest in the Chung torture story.<eos> The public may decide to put it on the Clovis front page after all.
Everything's fine, huh?<eos> We got to get out of here.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait, no, I mean, please let her go.<eos> Uh, it's her birthday for...<eos> Anybody else want to be a hero?<eos> Let's go, let's go, move, move, move.<eos> Keep moving, keep moving...<eos> Get behind the tape, move it.
"Sayonara" or "short stuff"!<eos> I would go with "sayonara," short stuff.<eos> That got off quicker than a 12-year-old looking at Megan Fox.<eos> Quick?<eos> I've been trying to get out of this thing for three years.<eos> This zipper is stuck!<eos> This is like a horror movie!<eos> Help me!<eos> Get this damn thing off me!<eos> Tear it off, cut it off, light it on fire!
- All right!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Don't touch my shin every time there's a big play.<eos> - Yeah, no, I got it. Oh, yes!<eos> - Don't touch it every time!
It gets more interesting.<eos> Look at the investigating officer.<eos> This was your father's case.<eos> The collar of his career.<eos> Right before he was killed.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My dad's case notes are sealed.<eos> It's strange.<eos> John, your father was still under investigation for stealing seized robotic tech from the evidence locker and reselling it on the black market.
He's using a modified organic printer.<eos> He can print the skin with bio-ink... skeleton, musculature...<eos> The old bio-printer couldn't print the organs to scale.<eos> A medical examiner would have noticed right away.<eos> That's why he uses straw.<eos> This wasn't the ritualized need of a serial killer, this was a way to hide that the bodies were bio-printed copies.<eos> That means his victims could still be alive.<eos> Your father was the lead investigator at Costa's trial.<eos> If he knew he was putting an innocent man behind bars...<eos> He knew he made a mistake, and he was gonna own up to it.
- OPTION THREE. UGH!<eos> I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.<eos> WELL, STORMFLY AND I ARE GONNA PROVE WE'RE NOT THE PROBLEM BY WORKING WITH YOU.<eos> - [scoffs] NOT AS WELL AS WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH YOU!<eos> RIGHT, HOOKFANG?<eos> - I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT IF I WASN'T SEEING IT<eos> WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.<eos> - I GUESS MY DAD WAS RIGHT.<eos> THEN AGAIN, I DID PUT MY OWN HICCUP SPIN ON IT.<eos> THAT'S WHAT ALL GREAT LEADERS DO, FISHLEGS, THEY TAKE AN IDEA, THEN THEY SHAPE IT.
- Come on, will.i.am!<eos> # Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth<eos> # But I just stand by and I wait my time<eos> # They say you gotta toe the line<eos> # Want the water not the wine<eos> # When I see the sign I jump on that lightning bolt...<eos> - Come on, Ricky!<eos> - Go on!<eos> # People talking all about fortune<eos> # Do you make it or does it just call you?
You sang the hell out of it.<eos> It's not that you didn't do a good job on it, but it was too much like the original.<eos> There was nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't fresh.<eos> Thanks a lot for your comments, guys, I really appreciate that.<eos> - Well done, John.<eos> To perform in front of the coaches was awesome and obviously to get to speak to all of them and get the advice from them and that's great for me.<eos> I will take that somewhere.<eos> Another style, another sound. It's Melissa.<eos> Today I'm going to be singing an Amy Whitehouse track.<eos> I've listened to it thousands of times over and I really want to do it justice.
We're not gay.<eos> Way to sell it.<eos> ♪ We endlessly creep ♪ What about your girlfriend?<eos> She's not my girlfriend.<eos> What, do I have eye boogers?<eos> We could stop right now if you want.<eos> Aah! What the are you doing?<eos> What the are you doing in my room?<eos> Measuring.<eos> Turns out it's 37 square feet bigger than mine, which means I want it.
- It's not ready.<eos> Since when do you share songs with me when they're ready?<eos> You're JT, I'm Timbaland, we workshop them till they're dope, and then you perform them for your cats.<eos> This one's different.<eos> It's personal.<eos> I'm baring my soul, so I want it to be perfect.<eos> Ooh, is it a power ballad?<eos> Come on, give me a hint.<eos> Nope.<eos> But I promise you'll be the first person to hear it.
Call him and tell him I'll meet him at the lobby bar at 1:00.<eos> What are you doing, arranging a vendor meeting without me?<eos> They were headed back to Tokyo in the morning.<eos> It was now or never.<eos> - Never.<eos> Cancel it.<eos> - What?<eos> No. I don't have time to explain this to you.<eos> - Just cancel it.<eos> - You keep asking me for the moon and I finally get it for you and now you're saying no.
I want it from your nasty place.<eos> - Fuck you. - Ooh.<eos> - Oh, you like it rough.<eos> - Now that's enough.<eos> She's mine.<eos> Now, I'll share her, but only if you treat her with the respect she deserves.<eos> - Jason, come on.<eos> - Yeah, I'm coming.<eos> As I'm sure you can tell, my human friend here is quite special. You will not drink her blood.<eos> You will sip it.
Yeah, not anymore.<eos> He knows exactly what he's doing and why he's doing it.<eos> You just talk to him.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Fuck him if he wants to die.<eos> Who's being a toddler now?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Death is scary.<eos> I've been avoiding it for 1,000 years.
(clears throat) Dad?<eos> (gasps) Oh! Hey, gang.<eos> May I present Ms. Lily Schecter, the author of 90 Dances, 90 Nations.<eos> And I was worried that meeting all of you might be awkward.<eos> (laughter) So you must be Sydney.<eos> I can tell because you look the most horrified.<eos> Uh, no, no, we're just real excited to meet you.<eos> - We loved your book.<eos> - Couldn't put it down.<eos> - Read it in a night.

Does that mean my grandma's coming back?<eos> And my dog?<eos> I'm sorry, boys and girls, but there's no question and answer period after story time.<eos> But these are good issues to discuss with your parents in what I'm sure will be an uncomfortable ride home.<eos> Tough crowd.<eos> Who picked this book?<eos> Yeah, but the moral was so sweet.<eos> If you truly love something, it'll never go away.<eos> Oh, that's ludicrous.<eos> I love this library, and they're taking it away.

Have you got Natasha's bank records?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> Ha!<eos> There!<eos> 10,000 euros?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why is he so much in debt?<eos> It might be something to do with his life-style.<eos> He wears an elastic band around his wrist, it's a classic addicts' device.<eos> They ping it whenever they get a craving, to remind them they're trying to quit.
Considered.<eos> They plan things.<eos> They're very precise. You just described a murderer.<eos> Maybe Natasha spurned him.<eos> She wasn't interested, she wanted to end it, who knows?<eos> We only have Adam's word they were in love.<eos> Even though they were buying a farm?<eos> Again, we only have his word.<eos> Even if his lawyer confirmed the purchase, she may have still tried to end it.<eos> Maybe decided to buy it on her own?
I suppose people have got over worse, people with less than us, if you want to try?<eos> If Adam had accepted your olive branch at that very moment, you may well have got away with this murder.<eos> But he didn't, did he?<eos> I was with Tash because I didn't want to be with you any more.<eos> I loved her, because I didn't love you. I'm sorry.<eos> And at that very moment, you hatched a new plan, didn't you?<eos> To frame Adam for the murder you committed.<eos> Using the missing key, you let yourself in.<eos> You'd already stolen a bottle from Adam's room, knowing it would have his fingerprints on it.<eos> You emptied it, cleaned it and put the poison in.
- ♪ You're never ♪<eos> Hold that out a little.<eos> - You sound really good. - Thank you.<eos> And you will, too, if you do what I said.<eos> Good morning, sleepyhead. Morning.<eos> I didn't hear you come in last night.<eos> Yeah, the count was off, so we stayed to make sure it was right.<eos> And then y'all woke me up with those beautiful voices. You keep singing like that,<eos> I guarantee you'll get the lead.<eos> The fifth graders never get it.
Is this Louis Vuitton?<eos> This thing costs, like, $1,000.<eos> 2,000.<eos> My husband brought it back from his last business trip.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> That is real love.<eos> It's not about the gift.<eos> It's about the fact that he's thinking of you, and he thinks you're worth the money.<eos> I'm sure Tommy will get you anything you ask for.<eos> Tommy wouldn't know that bag if I hit him in the face with it.
A Mr. Brain Jensen here to see you, sir.<eos> It's Brian.<eos> Not according to this note<eos> I wrote on my hand very quickly: "Brain."<eos> Captain Holt, we recently met at the African-American Gay and Lesbian New York City Policeman's Association.<eos> Yes, that name is quite a mouthful.<eos> Just call it the "AAGLNYCPA."<eos> Your organization has meant so much to me.<eos> Well, it's not my organization.<eos> I mean, I did found it and I've been president for the last 25 years and I oversee every detail, but really, it's our organization.
Probably.<eos> That's great.<eos> All right, let's go over our disguise<eos> I am Herbert Goffleman from San Diego.<eos> I came here to stand in the cold outside the today show, holding a sign with a misspelled word on it.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> You win.<eos> That neon green fanny pack screams, "gullible tourist."<eos> It's mine.<eos> I brought it from home.
We've had things moving about by themselves.<eos> We've had, fluctuations in the power bills.<eos> Now, I'm not sure that qualifies as bulletproof evidence.<eos> But, see, I think that's the thing.<eos> I think that's part of it.<eos> And they do that on purpose so that you don't know if you're imagining it or not.<eos> - Yeah, well.<eos> - Having said all that, there was one incident in particular that I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, took place in the real world and not in my imagination.<eos> There was one this night, and I was in the basement getting a chicken out of the freezer.<eos> I was just bending over and getting it out, and all of a sudden, I got what I can only describe as an enormous sense of dread.
This watch was handed down from my great-grandfather.<eos> He was the owner of the St. Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch back in 1914, when he received this watch, and it was handed down to my father and then he gave it to me.<eos> It's a beautiful watch.<eos> It's manufactured by the Patek-Phillipe company of Geneva, Switzerland.<eos> This is a photocopy of the original warranty, depicting some of the complications of this watch.<eos> You let the fire go out.<eos> ...the front of the watch has the hour and minute hand and the second hand.<eos> Kylie, where's that meat loaf?<eos> - I made that for tonight.<eos> - Well, I've eaten it.
Farhad Ghazi, huh?<eos> I never forget a pretty face.<eos> Don't say I never did anything for you.<eos> Aayan.<eos> Is your father here?<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Do you have the bag I gave you?<eos> Kiran?<eos> Kiran, do you have the bag?<eos> Baba found it.
No, it's okay.<eos> Do you have the bag I gave you?<eos> Kiran?<eos> Kiran, do you have the bag?<eos> Baba found it.<eos> Kiran, can I...?<eos> I need the bag, please.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Kiran, tell me.<eos> He destroyed it.
I'm her London Bureau Chief.<eos> Let me go, please.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Please!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Hold on.<eos> No, I thought I heard somebody.<eos> Listen, Aayan.<eos> You are part of an important story.<eos> I want to be the one to tell it.
That's a good point.<eos> You are not destroying it.<eos> You're gonna bring it to my office, place it on my desk, and you're gonna close the door behind you, - today.<eos> - I'll do it today.<eos> And what if Margo found out?<eos> I shot that before she turned me super Christian.<eos> Hey, who's uncomfortable?<eos> Okay, this is great.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll just destroy that tape before anyone important sees it.
Got it.<eos> Small portions.<eos> Thin slice of pie, nothing a la mode.<eos> So, this is the salad bar.<eos> Where's the rest of the all-you-can-eat buffet?<eos> It's an all-you-should-eat buffet.<eos> All the food options are healthy, and the plates are specially designed for portion control.<eos> So it's crappy food that we only get a little of?<eos> Barney, this isn't food.<eos> This is the food they feed to your food before they feed it to you.
What does it fix if I turn off that machine?<eos> You've got a lot of healing to do, and we can't start wrestling with the real issues until you say good-bye.<eos> I don't know if I'm ready for that.<eos> Is it because you're afraid you'll never get the answers you need?<eos> It's because it's my fault.<eos> That's what he told me in the note.<eos> You told everyone he didn't leave a note.<eos> The police...<eos> Me.<eos> Oh, well, he didn't leave it for you.
- I stuck.<eos> And it was so dark.<eos> - Now it is bright, yes?<eos> I get no air.<eos> You Welcome Help me. - But you get ...<eos> Look at me. Now it is bright.<eos> I'll go with you further.<eos> Very slowly.<eos> No Please. I do not get by.<eos> Take my hand and hold it tight.
Anyway, my point is, I've never met a more upstanding, conscientious, and loquacious young woman.<eos> So, you think I'll be okay?<eos> I do. I do. I really do.<eos> But your door is always open, right?<eos> Well, semi-open.<eos> You-- l-limited, uh... office hours.<eos> But, you know, Reverend Timtom is always here, too.<eos> Save some stuff for him.<eos> Okay.<eos> When you borrow my car, put some gas in it!
"Heat" is cold.<eos> "Off" is cold.<eos> Smacking the thing with a hammer-- even more cold.<eos> - Maybe you should call Darrin.<eos> - I did.<eos> He'll be here sometime Friday between 8:00 and 5:00.<eos> Oh, the long window.<eos> I bet that's the first thing they teach him.<eos> How are you doing, Sue?<eos> There was a cousin clothes box out front, and Brick hid it in the laundry room!
We can talk to the consulate in the morning.<eos> Maybe they know something.<eos> Isn't he the head of the consulate?<eos> You know what?<eos> I can pull the front door security video, check for other cameras on the block.<eos> I mean, the guy's pretty brazen.<eos> We might get something.<eos> Anything from the front door?<eos> That video's gone.<eos> The perp must've taken it.
Easy.<eos> That is the reaction for when there's a man behind me with a gun.<eos> All I said is I don't care about wedding dresses.<eos> Because you've never been in one.<eos> I'm gonna pick some for you to try.<eos> Okay, no, no.<eos> No need. Mnh-mnh.<eos> Come on, you'll feel beautiful.<eos> Then you can go back to your... boy clothes.<eos> Hey. I bought this shirt for Luke and I couldn't return it.
Well, it can make you feel kind of crazy.<eos> I understand. I...<eos> But the fastest way to get beat on the battlefield is to let the enemy make you forget who you are.<eos> I had a drill sergeant back in basic training that used to tell us that the true soldier doesn't fight because he hates what's in front of him.<eos> He fights because he loves what's behind him.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what do you do with all the hate?<eos> What do you do...<eos> with all the hate?<eos> I'll tell you what you do with it.
All right, you could say something li.<eos> "I didn't understand that I shouldn't edit those photos "without talking with you.<eos> I thought you would understand exactly what I was thinking."<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> That's great. That's good.<eos> I didn't understand, and then the--say the first part again.<eos> Just slow.<eos> How good is this?<eos> You know, the best part is, this pizza place is, like, two blocks down, so we can order it anytime.
Look at this! All those teeny, tiny, little seeds that you planted are big, beautiful, tasty vegetables now.<eos> Look.<eos> Where did these come form?<eos> - These weren't here yesterday.<eos> - Well- oh, they've been here for-- they've been growing over the last month.<eos> This is all-- this is all your stuff.<eos> All right, let's pluck some vegetables.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Where did the corn come from, daddy?<eos> We plucked it yesterday.

What, you mean that little bit?<eos> It's in the freezer.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> What are you doing home?<eos> Adam had a work meeting, so I decided to come home.<eos> What are you painting?<eos> That little bedroom upstairs.<eos> Lilac.<eos> By that little bedroom, you mean my-- my little bedroom?<eos> You're painting it lilac?
No!<eos> No!<eos> No, this is my mom.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> That was hardly subtle.<eos> - That's Verrat.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Where's your car?<eos> - Downstairs, parking garage.<eos> Get it, meet us out front, and follow me.
Ridley? I can't find Ripley.<eos> We'll have to go. I'm so sorry.<eos> We'll have to go.<eos> Ripley?<eos> Stay there.<eos> What shall we do?<eos> !<eos> We switch the desk. What?<eos> !<eos> We take everything off, turn it round, and then it's done.
Who are Burwick Trading?<eos> They're a local company with no apparent income, no head office, no staff - but they do have one owner.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Jacob Doran - our recently-deceased Minister for Commerce.<eos> It looks like he's been illegally importing goods from South Africa.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Great work, guys.<eos> What's he importing?<eos> We don't know, sir, but the next delivery to Burwick Trading arrives in port today.<eos> And when we impound it, we'll finally find out what this case is really all about.
Flash him the dog, will ya?<eos> - Are you kidding me? - Make him see that you're, you know...<eos> That I'm what?<eos> That I'm with an idiot?<eos> I'll see you around the Dog Park, jackass.<eos> Mel, it's Karee...<eos> With dad out of the apartment, Katie finally got to hang out with the guy of her dreams...<eos> - Was this your card?<eos> - No. Who was a complete nightmare.<eos> Guess I must've... Ate it.
Hey, that's my agent.<eos> If I got the part, it's still the second best thing<eos> I've heard all day. Hello?<eos> Am I a terrible person?<eos> No.<eos> No, it was a mistake.<eos> Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?<eos> Now I think you're flirting with the line.<eos> Good news?<eos> No, I didn't get it.
- Exactly.<eos> Positronic charges.<eos> They scramble arkbrains.<eos> These things should knock those doomsday cultists on their asses long enough for us to get Irisa clear.<eos> You can't have an apocalypse without your key horseman.<eos> What are these for?<eos> I'd put those down and wash your hands.<eos> Ah. A-ha. Memory card.<eos> See what's on it.<eos> I'll take it to the workshop.
Did you threaten him physically?<eos> Ok, I went in, I knocked, I called out and I went in.<eos> He was hiding in the wardrobe.<eos> He ran.<eos> I didn't make him run.<eos> And what about the jacket?<eos> Where did he get the jacket?<eos> Mr lanagas doesn't remember a jacket.<eos> Well, then, he's lying.<eos> I'm sorry, he must have hid it.
What's going on?<eos> We need the head.<eos> He's back?<eos> And he's taken Crane's wife.<eos> The witch?<eos> How did she get out of purgatory?<eos> That's part of the problem.<eos> And why things may go from bad to worse.<eos> But the head?<eos> We're gonna use it against him.
Perhaps you and I have more in common than you think.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I want the machine to be free.<eos> You wanna control it.<eos> I won't bore you with academic theories about competing civilizations.<eos> It's human nature to want to control the means to wealth, hmm?<eos> Whether it be salt or gold or oil.<eos> Or information.<eos> It is the new currency.<eos> And if someone's gonna control it, it might as well be you?
He's a kid.<eos> He doesn't know what he wants.<eos> He doesn't get it.<eos> He's not a kid anymore, Kristina.<eos> He's a teenager.<eos> He is a kid.<eos> [Sighs] I think he just wants some more independence.<eos> We gave him that radius at the beginning of the year, which, for the most part, worked out really well.<eos> I think he just wants a little more.<eos> I say we give it to him.
Just don't--don't cry, 'cause...<eos> The work that you did... Was phenomenal.<eos> You should be proud of it.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> So, no matter what happens, just know that.<eos> ♪ 'cause you say that you do ♪ Don't even think about putting that guitar down.<eos> You're embarrassing.<eos> Drew, you have to play me that song right now.<eos> - I'm not playing you anything.<eos> - It's been in my head ever since I heard it the other day.

But what I've been through today, standing here and seeing you two there so... - soft...<eos> I'm set free of my anger. - Uh, okay!<eos> I ain't gonna lie to you. Dewey Crowe's future ain't what it once was.<eos> - I'm leaving.<eos> - Again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I'm here for my necklace and my turtle dog.<eos> Oh. The ... the turtle thing?<eos> I think I have it.<eos> Where do I have it?

I don't think that concerns you.<eos> Oh, my God, is this some of the money you stole?<eos> No, that's money I earned.<eos> But the Feds will take it if they know I have it.<eos> How'd you earn it?<eos> Selling Mary Kay cosmetics.<eos> Now... are you still good for being my character witness in court tomorrow?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> Should I bring the box of stolen money with me?<eos> No. You can leave it and the sarcasm at home.
I've lost control of my squad.<eos> Should we turn some lights on?<eos> Trying to save electricity, Gina.<eos> Your massage chair is on.<eos> Yeah, I'm poor.<eos> I'm not a savage.<eos> Man, what am I gonna do?<eos> Well, what if I bought the apartment?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> And then I could rent it to you till you find a new place.
"Whoa"?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> What's it look like?<eos> In my bed?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Jerk.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Get a room, you two.<eos> Had a room till you two soiled it.
Not to mention, you have your facts wrong.<eos> You said Peter was wearing his wire when he was killed.<eos> I'm afraid that's not possible.<eos> So you knew about the wire?<eos> You admit you were in on it with him.<eos> Jamie.<eos> It's not illegal to know.<eos> And I guarantee you you will never link me to that payment, so you'll never be able to prove witness tampering.<eos> But, yeah, I knew about the wire.<eos> And Peter wasn't wearing it when he was killed because he had already left it for the feds at the dead drop at Lafayette and Spring.

- Don't lie to me!<eos> Yeah, well, the plane just turned around, for god's sake!<eos> How is this happening, then?<eos> H.Q. can override automated control of the avionics, take us anywhere they want.<eos> Let me check the instrument panel, and I'll be able ...<eos> - No way!<eos> - You're not going anywhere till you explain what ...<eos> It's not me!<eos> Why did you have an encrypted hard line?<eos> And try to shoot me when we found it?
By tomorrow morning, there'll be 100 more.<eos> And you want me to slow down?<eos> Of course not.<eos> We've spent six months in the woodshed living off table scraps.<eos> We both know our design is better than Akley's.<eos> But if you go in there to persuade Oppenheimer half-cocked, it's finished.<eos> Was that Frank Winter?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I submitted my thesis to the Princeton physics journal when he was the editor.<eos> Six peer reviewers backed it for publication.
We can cut 12 weeks off Akley's timeline.<eos> I thought we were going to the airport.<eos> Lamy train depot.<eos> General's seen fit to ground me.<eos> It's too dangerous to fly.<eos> Isn't that right, Tommy?<eos> It's very touching, their concern for my health.<eos> It's been road-tested and triple-checked, Robert.<eos> If you'll just give me some IBM machines and 30 more men, I can have the hydrodynamics worked out in the next month.<eos> This country, the Valles Caldera, we call it a desert, but it's a crematorium.
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> All right, here.<eos> Hold that there.<eos> That.<eos> Now, you got to hit it hard.<eos> This just... it... this feels wrong.<eos> No, hey, look, I told you the bone is misaligned, all right, so we have to complete the break before we can put it back together.
Yeah. Auto shop called after the broadcast.<eos> Driver's side's pretty banged up.<eos> Car's been in the shop for a month.<eos> Obviously hasn't been repaired yet.<eos> A month?<eos> You know, we keep running into this four-week wall.<eos> It's like life just stopped for that entire family in an instant.<eos> Yeah. The mechanic called the Conners with the estimate.<eos> Never heard back, so he put the car on hold.<eos> Hasn't touched it.
Here we go.<eos> Yeah, it's...<eos> Just gonna put this on here.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, this is my long shirt.<eos> Yeah. Oh.<eos> That's why you're laughing.<eos> I had it on the wrong way.<eos> That must have been funny-looking the way it was.<eos> I've never broken it out before you because, you know, we didn't live together, but... it keeps the top really warm and lets my bottom breathe.
I had to.<eos> Also I had a banana on the way over here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I get why you don't want any more to know about Duke Silver, and you don't have to worry.<eos> You secret is safe with me.<eos> To even it out, I'm gonna tell you all of my secrets.<eos> Oh, no, that's not necessary.<eos> I once forgot to brush my teeth for five weeks.<eos> I didn't actually sell my last car.<eos> I just forgot where I parked it.
All right, well, I'm gonna go confuse everyone on Facebook with a, "So sad, terrible day" status and nothing more.<eos> Your mother was a good woman, Peter.<eos> Thanks, Lois.<eos> I just, I just can't believe she's really gone.<eos> And I can't believe this funeral home has a skylight with a sinister clown staring down at us.<eos> Thank you for coming, everyone.<eos> We're here to celebrate the life of Thelma Griffin.<eos> Here to say a few words about Thelma is her son, Peter.<eos> My mother always hoped to be buried with her pet cat, Mittens, so I'd like to thank the Quahog Veterinary Society for putting Mittens down so quickly.<eos> Yeah, just-just go ahead and toss it in there.

Everyone gets what they want.<eos> We all walk out of here alive.<eos> Sorry, pal.<eos> For what it's worth, you were never getting out of here alive.<eos> [Distant gunshots]<eos> Kara?<eos> [Gunshots stop]<eos> I'm fine, John.<eos> [Body thuds]<eos> Caught a little grief from the suicide squad, so I had to give it right back.
- Why is turning that way?<eos> - Can you stop it from turning... - I don't know...<eos> - that way, please?<eos> - Don't!<eos> - I'm going to topple off of the bed, Didi.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> The thing is stuck, Dawn.<eos> - Why is it stuck?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Get your finger off of it, that's what's stuck.
I would, but I'd also like to keep my job.<eos> - Execs at this level...<eos> - Four, please.<eos> ...they want to hear what they want to hear.<eos> Eight, please.<eos> They asked us to present the report, so that's what we're gonna do.<eos> We can play dress-up and then play Cabbage Patch.<eos> A dance party.<eos> Mommy left lasagna in the freezer.<eos> We could put it in the oven and then play Cabbage Patch.
If you or your men take one step towards us, I will cut your throat.<eos> What you went through must have been insane.<eos> It wasn't all bad...<eos> I had a cold beer, and that was nice.<eos> Did you ever think about it?<eos> About... just... staying?<eos> It wasn't real.<eos> It wasn't you.<eos> What is happening?<eos> The nano were absorbing the power, keeping it off.
By lunchtime, I'll officially be the filthiest bastard on the base.<eos> - The jockstrap of joy will be mines.<eos> - Gleaming.<eos> And Bluestone 42 can celebrate a big win for my balls.<eos> Do you not listen to a word I say?<eos> - Not really, no.<eos> - Eh? Roger that.<eos> Boss! Car approaching from the south!<eos> It's coming in quite fast.<eos> Nah, the ANA cordon will stop It.
I would not say that.<eos> People, hands are a documented infection risk.<eos> Thousands of people are... Are dying of infections.<eos> You know what?<eos> A big problem with that was Howie Mandel, and the whole antibiotic soap of it all.<eos> He wouldn't even touch his shoelaces because he thought they had germs.<eos> The man never even ate at a buffet.<eos> - He didn't want to touch nothing.<eos> - And another problem is once you wash, you have to open the door by the unsavory handle.<eos> I push it open with my backside.
Callie, come on. We got to go.<eos> Well, we said we'd each do a box a day.<eos> I'm doing mine, so come do yours.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Sophia's ready to go.<eos> Come on... it'll just take a minute.<eos> - Callie...<eos> - Unpack this box!<eos> You know, the whole world is not going to end if I don't open this box...<eos> Open it.
It's Leonard and Carlton!<eos> You blokes want to join me for one last bit o' noggin' bogging'?<eos> I saved your bowlers.<eos> Hmm? Once again, the glugs was hittin' the streets all slow-motion like-- and just as scarifyin' and intimidato as ever.<eos> Hey, keep up!<eos> We put nasties in a hat and selectoed out one.<eos> Hey, what kind of Whoo-hoo is this?<eos> Welcome to the most frustrating, befuddling and, yes, erotic book release party you've ever attended.<eos> Sir, are you done with my bird mask?<eos> Oh, I don't think you want to wear it now.
So we're not going every Sunday, then?<eos> Oh! Dad!<eos> I learned a new new trick.<eos> Here -- pick a card.<eos> Not today.<eos> Paige!<eos> Here, pick a card.<eos> Any card.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Put it in anywhere.
You really hate this man?<eos> Oh, I hate religion.<eos> I hate the hypocrisy of it, and that man exemplifies precisely that.<eos> Do you even believe in God, Joe?<eos> Please. Whose God?<eos> Heh heh.<eos> You know, there are over 2,000 gods that the sheep of this world have chosen to believe in.<eos> So, no. I do not believe in any god.<eos> No.<eos> I made that mistake once before, and I'm not about to make it again.
Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new?<eos> I mean, why don't you take your time, enjoy your freedom?<eos> Maybe something new to study will find you.<eos> That's actually not bad advice.<eos> You know, I didn't seek out string theory.<eos> It just hit me over the head one day.<eos> How does that happen?<eos> A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.<eos> Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?<eos> Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that's been predigested by a fungus?
It's fine.<eos> She looks a lot better in a suit than all you do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> And I ordered my men directly to the second floor, where the witness heard the children.<eos> Lieutenant Casey, I understand you were the first inside.<eos> Can you tell us what happened after you went in?<eos> [Clears throat] Yes.<eos> Three members of my unit, as well as two from Lieutenant Severide's, entered the main floor and proceeded immediately up the stairs to the second floor.<eos> The door was locked, so we had to take it down.
A little bit, and then it'll be over.<eos> I'm a pro.<eos> I'm gonna put this tube into your nose, and then it is going to go up and around and down.<eos> Slather, slather, slather.<eos> Where do you live?<eos> I used to live in Guatemala and Santa Fe, but now I live here with her for the last seven years.<eos> I was actually born in this hospital, 51 years ago this January.<eos> You do not look 51 at all.<eos> Didi.<eos> I'm putting it in. I'm putting it in.
I feel like you tricked me - into getting you pregnant.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> Yeah, I do, and then I feel like you trapped me into that apartment, and I am only speaking my deepest, most inner truth.<eos> You know what?<eos> Eat me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Get out of my way, Freddie.<eos> Cones are up.<eos> Stairs are wet.<eos> Patsy: I have to say my truth, because it's my truth and I have to say it!
where you work out how to keep the door with a broken lock shut.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's three main schools of it - you've got the Tom Daley, where you lean forward with the arms like that.<eos> Use the fingertips. Yeah.<eos> But I can't BLEEP unless I'm playing Candy Crush, so that doesn't work.<eos> Then you've got the Bowing Monk, where you put your head forward and just use it as a doorstop.<eos> But someone can, like, knock you out if they're too insistent on getting in.<eos> Then your third option, which is the best one, which you should always use, is the Woman In Labour, where you plant two feet onto the door.<eos> But I committed to this recently in a petrol station just outside of Bolton, and I'd fully committed, but you have to be a master of your surroundings, I didn't realise the door in question opened both ways!<eos> This, like, hairy trucker ripped it off and literally thought I was kind of presenting myself to him!
"Well, who are you trying to kid, love?<eos> "You didn't get to that size by eating salads."<eos> No-one would say anything to you.<eos> Not while I was around.<eos> They might not say it, but they'll think it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I can see it behind their eyes.<eos> You know, I used to think that I loved food.<eos> But I don't.<eos> I fucking hate it.
Well, she was so well-spoken that I imagine she... was probably too embarrassed to continue trying.<eos> And I think she's mad at me.<eos> I promised her I would visit her one weekend and I couldn't, and she went into her room and stopped talking to me.<eos> And for the most part she stopped eating as well...<eos> Where are we on a feeding tube?<eos> Is that something you would like to discuss?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Alright, well, I'm gonna make some notes.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> So she followed around behind me, tottled around with this little plastic tiara on, and she just wouldn't take it off.
Is the parking lot possum back?<eos> Why are you going all Uncle Frank on your bag?<eos> Who's Uncle Frank?<eos> He's my uncle from Tallahassee who had a thing for bludgeoning.<eos> You know, there's a documentary about him on Netflix.<eos> Hey, listen, I felt bad that we laughed at your bag, so I came by to apologize.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You guys were right, man.<eos> This thing's too new.<eos> That's why I'm trying to beat it up a little.
Ugh. Fine.<eos> LOUISE: No... no, no!<eos> TAMMY: Why isn't it falling?<eos> Because of your big mouth, Tammy!<eos> Someone's gotta notice I'm missing.<eos> This is my party.<eos> The theme is me.<eos> What are you planning to do with this stupid head after today anyway?<eos> Um, hello?<eos> I'm gonna donate it to charity.
I'm so, so sorry.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You tried.<eos> You-you-you stepped up.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> I don't know what I would do without you.<eos> What do you do for a living?<eos> I'm an orthopedic surgeon.<eos> Do you enjoy your work?<eos> I love it.
Quiet!<eos> Please!<eos> I've got about four hours to get through all their research.<eos> Can you please take the party outside?<eos> San Francisco's fogged in.<eos> They've grounded all commercial flights for at least another couple of hours.<eos> Well, he's getting worse.<eos> I don't think that he has that kind of time.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Ross will transport the kidney once I take it out, and then you'll join me for the transfer.
Vascular clamp.<eos> When Ellis won, it ate at me.<eos> Didn't make me a better surgeon.<eos> Made me a jealous one.<eos> I'm not jealous!<eos> Okay, I'm jealous.<eos> Happy now?<eos> Therapy's over.<eos> Not enough length on the right renal vein.<eos> We'll need to mobilize it.

Bye.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes, fine.<eos> Never better.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Going to the retirement home?<eos> Of course! Of course!<eos> OK, so, the kitchen prepared two room service meals yesterday, both chicken curry.<eos> And Sylvaine took one of them to Judith Musgrove in her room, and the other she delivered to Emma Redding.<eos> Sylvaine doesn't think anyone could have tampered with the food while she was delivering it, and as at least one other guest had the same meal, it couldn't have been tampered with in the kitchen.
A fresh approach.<eos> Your point being?<eos> We've spent our whole time trying to reach down to the water, so why not make the water reach up to us?<eos> One minute.<eos> Let me open the door for you!<eos> Step away from the door!<eos> Are you OK, sir?<eos> So, two men break down a door - that requires a lot of force.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Don't worry, Camille, neither do I, but we've hit a brick wall and I'm trying to come at it from a different angle.
You can't.<eos> How can you take any trace of the pills out of the curry after it's been eaten?<eos> You can't do that either.<eos> Yet if the only explanation is that someone did, then that's what must have happened.<eos> He must be still drunk.<eos> I heard that, Dwayne.<eos> Unless it's different.<eos> What if the door isn't the door, or at least not the door that we thought it was?<eos> What if the curry wasn't the curry?<eos> 'Sylvaine doesn't think anyone could have tampered with her food whilst she was delivering it.'
And you already had her key, so you could let yourself in.<eos> You then made sure you left Emma's empty packet of sleeping pills at her side, and a glass of water.<eos> It was then the work of a moment to replace the incriminating curry with the plate you brought.<eos> And now the scene was set for the final part of the illusion.<eos> You were going to get out of a locked room.<eos> All it took was a little re-enactment to realise how you did it.<eos> See, first you opened the latch lock, but made sure the steel bolt was closed.<eos> It wouldn't have been too hard to break the bolt, not for someone who was already prepared to commit murder.<eos> But then, having smashed only one of the locks, you left, using the other lock to secure the door.<eos> You then placed the plate of poisoned curry on a tray outside your own room, knowing that Sylvaine would carry it away later.
Hey, deetmore.<eos> If you're gonna bag evidence like a five-year-old, You should have the proper tools.<eos> It's a "my first police kit."<eos> The walkie-talkie blows bubbles.<eos> Hope you can handle it.<eos> He mislabeled the weapon, like an idiot.<eos> And it almost got filed with the wrong case.<eos> You humiliated officer deetmore in front of his peers.<eos> He submitted an official complaint against you.<eos> Did he fill it out in crayon?
- Hey, Nick, what's up, man?<eos> - What's up, Winnie?<eos> - Hey, Nick.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Can we talk for a second?<eos> - Can I talk to you?<eos> Schmidt fired me, and now I'll never get to use this briefcase I just bought, and it was $19!<eos> - I think my thing is a little bit more...<eos> - Do you think I'm sexier when I hold it or when it's down?<eos> 'Cause I think it's kind of sexier when I hold it, like this.
- Coolidge!<eos> - Too late, man.<eos> It's too late.<eos> All right, guys, get out there and make me proud!<eos> - Ms. Day?<eos> - What?<eos> What is going on?<eos> I thought you fired Coach.<eos> Look, Coach loves the kids, and the kids love him.<eos> I want this job, but I'm not going to do it your way.
I can't get over HP's touch screen.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Yeah, it's a fad... - Oh, look, look, look.<eos> - ...guaranteed.<eos> High-density floppy disks.<eos> Oh, someone's hot.<eos> - Let's check it out.<eos> - Why?<eos> They'll be down at our booth in, like, 60 seconds.<eos> And so I ask you, what is the point of a revolution if you have to sell your car to afford it?
We're supposed to be partners in this shit, 50-50.<eos> You trust me, right?<eos> You and me were sure it was Anibal.<eos> And then you and me were sure it was Ruiz.<eos> See, Tommy, the problem is, we can't be wrong again.<eos> I'm not wrong.<eos> Not this fucking club or any other bullshit that's been a distraction from what we're doing.<eos> This is gonna happen, one way or another.<eos> One way or another.<eos> If you don't want a war, there's only one way to stop it.
Come with me.<eos> We shall find you something to eat, something to wear that's a bit more...<eos> Well, a bit more.<eos> Well, what about him?<eos> I can fend for myself.<eos> No, you're hurt.<eos> He was shot yesterday.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> I bandaged his shoulder, but I wasn't able to clean it or dress it properly.
"What ails her?"<eos> Oh. Who knows?<eos> Come on, anything can happen.<eos> We can push him down the stairs!<eos> Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.<eos> No problem.<eos> How's your mom feeling?<eos> Okay, but she'd feel better if she took her medicine.<eos> You know, when Cinnamon won't take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.<eos> Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon.
Not just for him, but for... most anybody, really.<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> What is that, polenta?<eos> Amy, get out.<eos> Right.<eos> No.<eos> Hey, Sheldon.<eos> What happened?<eos> I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.<eos> And you couldn't put it out?
We want some answers, Jerry.<eos> What were you doing at the boatyard?<eos> I go there to think sometimes.<eos> He's lying.<eos> Nobody goes somewhere to think.<eos> - Where's the boat?<eos> - What boat?<eos> - Bobby's boat.<eos> - I don't have Bobby's boat.<eos> - So you sold it?

Gumshoe.<eos> Man, Jerry's right.<eos> These crab cakes are great!<eos> Okay, we may have taken this a step too far.<eos> We don't even know if the boat was really stolen.<eos> [ Muffled ] But-- [ Cellphone rings, beeps ]<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah, sure, I can put you on speakerphone.<eos> [ Altered deep voice ] I have your boat.<eos> If you ever want to see it again, come to the boatyard at 10:00 AM tomorrow.
- Uh, Big Daddy Cool, Smooth Dyn--<eos> - Ain't gonna happen.<eos> Okay.<eos> My boat!<eos> It's back!<eos> My boat!<eos> Yo! I missed you, Boat Travis!<eos> Ooh, are you, okay?<eos> Mwah! Did they hurt you?<eos> Jules: They just brought it back?
Well, he didn't drive all the way here without it, so it has to be here somewhere.<eos> When he told you about it, he was trying to get out of bed, like he was gonna show you where it was.<eos> It wouldn't be in that hospital room.<eos> He never got out of the bed.<eos> Maybe he wasn't trying to get up.<eos> - He was asking for his cane.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's had this forever.<eos> He got it from his dad, who got it from his dad.<eos> - Did I break it?
We're in the middle of a crisis, Mom.<eos> Hope's goldfish died.<eos> That's not a crisis.<eos> A crisis is when they move your favorite show to Friday night.<eos> Now I don't know whether Booth and Bones are still boning on Bones.<eos> Or when your granddaughter swallows a marble and you go to the hospital, and then you realize you forgot to VCR your favorite show. Bones.<eos> Wait, did that actually happen to Hope?<eos> Don't change the subject.<eos> So about this dead fish, here's what you do:<eos> don't tell Hope and just replace it with one that looks exactly the same.
She's not dead!<eos> Very well.<eos> If you're right, we'll find an empty grave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I buried her body just over this next rise.<eos> Marked her grave.<eos> Planted a small patch of flowers.<eos> These flowers of yours, they weren't lavender by any chance, were they?<eos> How can Kenya Rosewater possibly be alive?<eos> You assured me she'd been killed when the Votanis Collective raided my facility and burned it to the ground.
You assured me she'd been killed when the Votanis Collective raided my facility and burned it to the ground.<eos> I was told there were no survivors.<eos> Obviously, someone recognized her value as a hostage.<eos> I couldn't have predicted this.<eos> All the same, you better fix it.<eos> There's nothing to fix.<eos> Right now, we need to focus on not getting caught.<eos> I refuse to accept that.<eos> You need to stop thinking like a human and accept what is real.<eos> If Joshua Nolan figures out what you did to Amanda, he will take his great big gun and stuff it in your mouth and pull the trigger, evacuating the contents of your sick little head.
His people are conquerors.<eos> Alak does not want to conquer me.<eos> Well, not personally, no. But it's a struggle against his DNA.<eos> Castithans are better suited for survival than humans and they know it.<eos> They are the next draft of dominant life on Earth.<eos> Yet, how frustrating it must be for these elegant, streamlined creatures that grotesque humanity stubbornly endures.<eos> Well, this is our planet.<eos> A human planet. We were here first.<eos> Well, ask the Irathients how that argument worked out for them.<eos> The Castis conquered their home planet and renamed it "Casti."
I'm sleeping.<eos> I want you awake.<eos> Today is a special day.<eos> What's so great about it?<eos> Open your eyes and find out.<eos> You know, someone could get ahold of that footage.<eos> And do what?<eos> No more Internet.<eos> Let's enjoy it.<eos> Your boss could see it.
- Yes. - Leslie is a spy.<eos> - No.<eos> Tom has something wrong with his butt.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> Did you hear that? They need an encore.<eos> Honey, they want--the kids want an encore, I'm sorry.<eos> What song should we do?<eos> You wanna do Toots?<eos> I hope you don't mind, but I noticed that your right rear tire was a little flat, so I patched it, and I inflated it for you.
What the hell?<eos> They're playing Cones of Dunshire.<eos> Hey, you invented that game.<eos> Are they playing any games I invented?<eos> Are they throwing dirt into a fan?<eos> The key is, you have to throw the dirt - into the back of the fan.<eos> - How the hell did they...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How did you guys get your hands on this game?<eos> Someone sent it to us.
- Yes, yes I was.<eos> Why?<eos> - No reason.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Apparently, and I don't know how, but the game has spread.<eos> I mean, it's all over the Internet...<eos> Austin, Charlotte, San Diego.<eos> I mean, people are playing with my Cones, babe.<eos> That's great.<eos> I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.
Last chance, Ron.<eos> The slots are finalized, but I can squeeze in ten minutes if a certain mister...<eos> Duke Silver wanted to come out.<eos> Come on, Ron, it's gonna be so fun.<eos> Thank you, Andrew, but fun or not, playing music is something I like to keep private, along with my family, my conversations, and my whereabouts at all times.<eos> Okay, everyone, welcome to the very last Unity concert planning meeting.<eos> Andy, you are in charge.<eos> This is your show.<eos> Take it away.<eos> Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to accept the following missions.
You what?<eos> ♪ Just living on a Sunday morning ♪<eos> ♪ got my toast and tea, and I'm warm and ♪<eos> ♪ I just thought I'd think about ♪<eos> ♪ and it might be ♪<eos> ♪ the comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky ♪<eos> ♪ could never parallel the challenge of an acquion ♪<eos> ♪ in the here and now, here and now ♪<eos> I love you, Kay Hanley!<eos> I hope you like deep-dish pizza, because there's gonna be a lot more of it in Chicago, where we're all gonna be moving.
No, I didn't.<eos> And you are blocked.<eos> ♪ La-la-la-la-la-la-la- la-la-la-la-la-la-la. ♪ A nice thick layer of chocolate squares make up the base.<eos> A couple of handfuls of crushed pretzels.<eos> Top it all off with marshmallows, and...<eos> Whoa! Voila!<eos> Teddy Brulee.<eos> Finally, arson and food together!<eos> Hey, Teddy, can I play with that blowtorch?<eos> I just want to inspect it, you know, learn about it.
I'm not sure. I just woke up.<eos> ...work that is extremely difficult.<eos> ...rock formations...<eos> The bark beetle carries the wood to its nest on the way to Kessel.<eos> He shoots, he scores!<eos> Gophers are playing.<eos> If that's what you wanna watch.<eos> Forcing a turnover and the assist to Kessel.<eos> Ben Schmidt says you put down a guy with an assault rifle.<eos> Well, he was pointing it at me.
I need to see you, Mick.<eos> It's important.<eos> Honey, I don't want you to see me living like this.<eos> I don't care.<eos> What's the address?<eos> Look, if Pop and Sully had ever met, I'm sure I'd have known about it.<eos> Sounds like you two are close.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He's my father.<eos> Well, if there's any way I could talk to him, even if there's one Sully story, I'd like to hear it.
Check every shelf in that house for a wooden box.<eos> What's in the box?<eos> The answer to this case.<eos> So I had Blake search that house for that ice pick in a box, and then I presented that box to you.<eos> Is that coming back to you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> We found it in Joe's bedroom.
Tell them when you're ready.<eos> Don't do it for me.<eos> Do it for yourself.<eos> See?<eos> You are my super-awesome best friend.<eos> My homework packet is not where it usually is.<eos> Max, get out!<eos> And the only thing that's changed is that you're home.<eos> Get out!<eos> So the only thing I can assume is that you or Lauren moved it.
Well, it's good to see you.<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> - All right, have a--<eos> - Have a--oh. Ah, jinx.<eos> Bye, Mr. mark. What the...<eos> What's going on here, slinky robe?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Got a little- that's my favorite robe.<eos> - I know. That's why I wore it.
It's not eharmony.<eos> It's children.<eos> Play a game with them.<eos> I'm not doing it. - Drew, you're doing it.<eos> 4:00.<eos> - Beautiful framing job.<eos> - Yeah, there you go.<eos> - I love it.<eos> - I don't know. Hanging a picture of a brochure is a little weird, but all right.<eos> Don't call it a brochure.
Oh, no, no, no.<eos> No, it can't be.<eos> I mean, it's too late.<eos> I mean, because I drove up here from Berkeley, California 'cause, you know,<eos> Paulie and I had agreed on a price and talked about it- well, this is not Paulie's place!<eos> Do you see Paulie's name anywhere up there?<eos> No, it says, "Ernie's salvage yard."<eos> Okay, we're getting off to a bad start.<eos> Maybe we could just look at the grill.<eos> You might not even want it.

She's really good.<eos> I'm glad you've still got pink hair.<eos> I'd miss that if you had dyed it another colour.<eos> - It's not going to happen.<eos> - Pink, pink!<eos> What song have you picked?<eos> I've chosen to do I Love Rock'n'Roll by Joan Jett amp; The Blackhearts.<eos> Ah! I love that song.<eos> Everybody knows it as this hardcore rock, you know, anthem.<eos> I thought, "I want to strip it back and turn it into a Melissa song."
The security guard is a liar.<eos> You know why we're in here, Todd?<eos> 'Cause the only real thing about your story is a severed human hand.<eos> Whose hand is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You killed somebody.<eos> You took their hand to fake a story, to make yourself look like a hero.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't hurt anyone.<eos> He gave it to me.

I've got one living in my closet.<eos> You people can believe whatever you want.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Apparently she's also stopped believing in cleaning up her own messes.<eos> ♪ Whoo!<eos> ♪ Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! ♪<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Huh? Nothing.<eos> You're not trying to put that stupid pigurine back together, are you?<eos> Well, I was hoping when you cooled off, you might want it again.
♪ Whoo!<eos> ♪ Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! ♪<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Huh? Nothing.<eos> You're not trying to put that stupid pigurine back together, are you?<eos> Well, I was hoping when you cooled off, you might want it again.<eos> I tried to buy you one, but it turns out they're not selling them anymore 'cause apparently they're made out of asbestos.<eos> I tried to fix it, but it's impossible.<eos> Now I see why God never actually made a pig Sasquatch-- it's-it's very time-consuming.<eos> Don't bother trying to fix it.
I can barely see.<eos> I'm wearing giant sunglasses and a girly hat.<eos> Alex and I are having a blast.<eos> But you got the gift, right?<eos> That's what people tell me.<eos> Honey, the bowl.<eos> I have the bowl.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I'll-- I'll see you at home.<eos> Hey, here's a thought-- now that you told mom you got the bowl, how about we actually go get it?
Go!<eos> Figured I'd find you out here.<eos> Hey, you saved all those men's lives today.<eos> Unfortunately, the evidence didn't fair so well.<eos> We lost DNA, prints.<eos> All the hardware was incinerated.<eos> Oh. Is that right, D.B.?<eos> Well, yes, Avery, it is.<eos> I found a photo of Susan's house on her phone.<eos> She never posted it to Friend Agenda.

Help!<eos> That's an alarm clock, isn't it?<eos> ! Oh, sorry, James!<eos> The bottom of this river's made out of turds.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Try not to drink more than a pint.<eos> As I was carried away by the current, I noticed that the end of the bridge was now beyond the reach of our cranes.<eos> So when I returned, we built a home-made piledriver.<eos> Mounted it to a home-made barge...
Vicki what's-her-name from Real Housewives of Orange County.<eos> Is that the one with all the face work?<eos> You're gonna have to be more specific.<eos> Welcome, welcome.<eos> Wipe your feet on the way out.<eos> Deke, I'm warning you right now, I am not in a partying mood.<eos> Ain't no party like a Caroline party, 'cause a Caroline party don't start.<eos> I'm heavy with guilt, and that cheese omelet we just split.<eos> We're not partying, but I did snatch back the weed, 'cause I's perfect.<eos> I got it from Earl, and he says it knocks you out so hard, he once used it and faked death to cash in a life insurance policy.
You eschew the electronic age, because if you knew...<eos> Love that word. "Eschew."<eos> [*]<eos> You reject it all, because if you knew how to Google and Skype and tweet and that stuff, you would no longer have an excuse for not facing the truth.<eos> Please don't psychoanalyze the section leader.<eos> Besides, you're one to talk.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, why haven't you opened your card yet?<eos> Hmm?<eos> You should open it.
Rainbow Trout.<eos> One of the biggest ever taken out of the lake.<eos> July 1971.<eos> You remember.<eos> Twenty nine inches, eight and a half pounds.<eos> Wow, what a memory.<eos> Not me, can't remember what I had for breakfast.<eos> But this fish is right here.<eos> Right up there.<eos> I see it every day.

Wow, what a memory.<eos> Not me, can't remember what I had for breakfast.<eos> But this fish is right here.<eos> Right up there.<eos> I see it every day.<eos> You'd remember it, too.<eos> Who caught it?<eos> Is there a name?<eos> Well, there was a name plate on it, fell off back some time around Reagan.<eos> So you don't know who caught it?
I don't know, sir.<eos> We're both off-roading it here.<eos> My internal GPS has been recalculating for a week.<eos> This is Isaac.<eos> He used to be a pusher for the bay Ridge boys.<eos> Dude, drugs don't need pushing.<eos> They push themselves.<eos> People love drugs.<eos> Tell him about the donations.<eos> All right, look, every friday, I put cash into a duffel bag and bring it to Wint community center, room 265, and they mark it down as a charitable donation in their account book.
Sorry to hear about your hand.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It makes it really hard to manipulate my egg sack.<eos> Look.<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> I did my Junior year abroad in Tokyo.<eos> And my girlfriend Chiaki?<eos> She broke my heart.<eos> I stared at the paper walls for weeks until my roommates showed me how to vent my feelings.<eos> Take a plate and smash it.
Always the hardest to kick.<eos> I got a "niece" special right over here.<eos> One owner.<eos> Little old lady?<eos> Drove it to church?<eos> To atlantic city, actually.<eos> Back and forth a lot.<eos> She had a gambling problem.<eos> Another bad habit.<eos> Had to sell it for beans.
I don't know how long this stitch is gonna hold.<eos> - pH and bicarb? - Man: 7.0 and 14.<eos> Dr. Yang, now she's oozing from the IVC.<eos> - I see it, Shane.<eos> - Aren't we gonna put in a suture?<eos> If we just keep throwing in stitches, she'll dissect all over the place.<eos> We have to get Frankie off this table.<eos> How?<eos> She's getting a transplant.<eos> In this state, she'll never survive it.
What do we got?<eos> It's cleared out.<eos> Every box.<eos> CSU's dusting for prints.<eos> What about Martinez?<eos> She was shot execution-style, in the back of the head.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> New York Times just ran a piece on the Stapleton case.<eos> I'll get this out momentarily.<eos> Do I want to read it?
Kris and Kim are in Vienna and someone stole Kris's Bottega bag and her Chanel clutch with the matching pumps that she bought in Paris.<eos> All right, well, I have to go take my morning tinkle.<eos> But when I come back, I want you two to be out of here because I need that swing for my exercises.<eos> We have to do this show.<eos> It'll be so great for our business.<eos> The only way we'd get more exposure is if Orlando Bloom and Bieber bitchslapped each other in front of our shop.<eos> Who cares about our business?<eos> I want that mother to adopt me!<eos> Her kid makes a sex tape, she turns it into millions.<eos> The only thing my mother ever did with my sex tape was copy it and give it to her boyfriend.
We should use the money to pay down our debt.<eos> - See?<eos> Mike, I was trying... - Oh. To do something nice for you that you wouldn't do for yourself.<eos> Come on, sit in it.<eos> No.<eos> Come on, sit in it.<eos> No.<eos> I'll sit in it.<eos> No!<eos> Nobody is sitting in this car except Molly to take it back.

No!<eos> Nobody is sitting in this car except Molly to take it back.<eos> I'm not taking it back.<eos> You're taking this back.<eos> Mike, don't be a jerk.<eos> I love you.<eos> Take the damn car.<eos> Molly, I love you, too.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Take it back.
She did in chapter three.<eos> Speed bump!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hello, dummy.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> On behalf of every man in this country, I should kick you in the potatoes.<eos> Good luck.<eos> They've already been peeled and mashed.<eos> She wanted to give you a car.<eos> Why couldn't you just take it like a good little husband?
That's the world I want to live in.<eos> Well, if it includes you in a red hat with bare shoulders, I'm going to stay here with my swollen prostate.<eos> So what if you're a little rusty around the edges.<eos> You still got a couple of good years left, don't you, girl?<eos> MOLLY (playfully): Kill me.<eos> Kill me.<eos> That's very funny.<eos> So, how's the old bucket of bolts doing?<eos> If you remember correctly, this bucket of bolts was good enough for you when we first started dating.<eos> No, I hated it from the beginning.
COM-Third-Fleet, this is Talon Five-Five.<eos> Roger, out.<eos> Lord have mercy.<eos> Kill them.<eos> Ali.<eos> Can we get this thing to the surface?<eos> Ah. It took on too much water and the power's out.<eos> Our only hope is a free ascent.<eos> We're not gonna be able to open that hatch till the sub fills with water, the pressure equalizes.<eos> We got to flood it.
Lewis was discovered missing at 8:45 this morning.<eos> But how'd he get out of that ward?<eos> Still don't know.<eos> This nurse was found raped, hanging in the closet.<eos> Still hasn't regained consciousness.<eos> Her cell phone, purse, car keys... all missing.<eos> We have an alert out on her vehicle.<eos> Which is a white camry, New York plates. N-S...<eos> Don't even bother.<eos> He'll ditch it before he escapes Manhattan.
Maybe I misread you.<eos> Unlike dogs, I can't lick your hand and know what's in your heart.<eos> So you'll let us adopt a dog.<eos> Not yet.<eos> In order to get you off the no-dog list, I have to put you through a three-day trial period, but then... you'll be dog owners.<eos> We're so gonna kill it.<eos> Not the dog, we're gonna love it to death.<eos> (laughing): Oh, yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... here's what I think, if it's a girl, we should name it Puppy Dogstocking.
It's two days in a row now that girl owes her life to you and that Sam guy.<eos> It's good you made it to the cell in time.<eos> I don't think Joe would've done it.<eos> I'm really glad we didn't have to find out.<eos> Jim will probably tell people he saved your life today.<eos> He didn't have to tell me about that reserve tank. But he did.<eos> Yesterday, we save his life, he can barely utter a thank-you.<eos> I think in some strange way he tried.<eos> A few words does not change the fact that all he cares about is his folklore status.<eos> And he's not the only one fueling it.
No.<eos> I can't afford the gas or insurance.<eos> But I slept in it.<eos> I think the leather is made from clouds.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm looking for the guy who bought my Rolls-Royce.<eos> I recently purchased a Rolls.<eos> Perhaps I can help you.<eos> Give me my car back now.<eos> Excuse me, but he bought it fair and square.

Oh, hey, Brian.<eos> And who's your date?<eos> Wow, you must be such a good person to knowingly go out with a herpes-riddled dirtbag.<eos> Ew! I'm sorry, Brian. I-I've got to go.<eos> Damn it, you guys!<eos> Her dad's really rich!<eos> Wow, you weren't kidding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, you bums!<eos> If you bastards want our booth, you got to go through us to get it.
On behalf of the United States armed forces,<eos> I order you to stand down.<eos> I repeat, stand down.<eos> Colonel Talbot?<eos> There have to be better things for you to do than chase four S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<eos> I wasn't a huge fan before chasing you to the damn tundra, Coulson.<eos> - I wouldn't push it.<eos> - I'm flattered you came in person.<eos> Fury's private base on North American soil?<eos> I just had to see it for myself.
I wasn't a huge fan before chasing you to the damn tundra, Coulson.<eos> - I wouldn't push it.<eos> - I'm flattered you came in person.<eos> Fury's private base on North American soil?<eos> I just had to see it for myself.<eos> If I come out, will you shoot me?<eos> 'Cause then I won't come out.<eos> Hold your fire, soldiers.<eos> This is one of the most classified facilities on the planet, Colonel.<eos> How the hell did you find it?
What's that for?<eos> Your next lesson.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Stick with me, kid.<eos> In a couple years, you'll shoot better than that.<eos> Something about that woman unnerves me.<eos> It's those eyes.<eos> No, it's what's behind those eyes.<eos> What did she text you about earlier?<eos> She had questions about your decision to pack up the lab and move it to the States.
You have to fight that weakness in you.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> Now take care of Buddy, and we'll get out of here.<eos> That's not a weakness, is it?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll be at the truck.<eos> Internal battery must have fried.<eos> I'm gonna have to open it up, see if there's a mechanical fix.
He's got a tip on some armored van thing.<eos> Sarge, why aren't we looking into Jin's murder on our own?<eos> For the same reason I told you last time you asked.<eos> They don't want us anywhere near it since we has in our unit, okay?<eos> He was a police officer.<eos> Area central is all over it.<eos> So they had no updates this morning?<eos> The update...<eos> The update is they're coming after my badge!<eos> So when there is another update I will convey it, okay?
And don't call me again until it's done.<eos> And get rid of that car.<eos> Sir, stop where you are.<eos> Keep your hands where we can see them.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> We need to see your I.D.<eos> You the owner of this vehicle?<eos> No, no, it belongs to a friend of mine...<eos> Henry Slocombe.<eos> He loaned it to me for the weekend.
I thought...<eos> I could prove, at least to myself, that I was... more than what they thought.<eos> Idiocy.<eos> Took your time.<eos> Oh, that's the store that Julian Afkhami owns.<eos> The man who Arthur West thought was an Iranian spy.<eos> The same man he thought was corresponding with the mole.<eos> Well, I get why you'd want to surveil it;<eos> what I don't get is why you thought you needed to rent a car.<eos> I didn't rent it.
Let's say he disappeared some other way and someone out there a and this is about revenge.<eos> Okay, or it could be that Alan and Laura were simply witnesses to what happened, and our killer tried to silence them.<eos> Okay, but either way, why wait 25 years?<eos> I got that case file you asked for.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> I was a rookie back then, but I remember the case.<eos> Corey Johnson was a strong swimmer.<eos> The night he disappeared, the surf was calm-- ankle slappers at the most.<eos> Was foul play ever suspected?<eos> There was no evidence to support it at the time.
They must've shaken hands.<eos> That's how she got the chemical on her.<eos> Right.<eos> All right, so where's the film?<eos> She told the owner that she didn't have it on her, and that she would come back later.<eos> He kept the shop open, but she never showed up.<eos> Whatever's on that film got Laura killed.<eos> Okay, but we didn't find any film on her.<eos> Killer could have taken it.<eos> Or maybe Laura was killed before she could get her hands on it.
Hey.<eos> I got you, buddy.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I got you.<eos> My leg's pinned.<eos> I think I broke a rib.<eos> Where's the other guy? Huh?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Okay, listen to me, this thing's too heavy.<eos> I can't lift it.
Previously on "Manhattan"...<eos> - We're waging a war of ideas.<eos> - You're building an atomic bomb.<eos> We prefer to call it a gadget.
And is there anybody else there?<eos> An immigrant family from Syria who had a horrific time getting to America.<eos> - They're gonna be good to talk to.<eos> - SUE: Ma'am. Ma'am.<eos> Oliveri Systems just withdrew its donations and so has Dugdale Recycling. - Just now.<eos> - (PHONE CHIMES) Yeah, it's out there.<eos> Quincy ran an online piece about the GUMMI code.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - MIKE: No.<eos> You're kidding... DAN: I've got it right here.
I don't know.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine, but you built it, and I trust you.<eos> You're the one who said we can't underestimate the threat of Samaritan.<eos> Mr. McCourt, you have to call off your deal with Decima.<eos> Their surveillance program cannot be approved.<eos> What... what are you, one of those privacy nut jobs?<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> With access to the government's surveillance feeds,<eos> Decima will be able to acquire any information, any secret it desires, and sell it to the highest bidder.
Hold here until the light changes.<eos> The camera angle switches with oncoming traffic.<eos> Come on!<eos> John.<eos> When that light switches, we're screwed!<eos> We can't worry about irrelevant numbers now.<eos> What is it thinking...?<eos> - There's no time!<eos> - This is a life.<eos> And Finch would tell us to save it.
$320, tucked away in a heater vent.<eos> I thought Paw Paw must've put it in there, but when I asked Maw Maw about it, she said "Who's Paw Paw?"<eos> So I think we're good.<eos> Burt, I put that money in there.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> If you found money, you were supposed to buy me a gift.<eos> Does that mean I get the chair?<eos> No, Burt...<eos> I didn't find the money.<eos> I got a raise and I've been hiding the cash 'cause I didn't want you to see it and feel bad.
We... we'd love to drive up there.<eos> Or down there.<eos> Or fly, or sail...<eos> All right, we don't know where Sedona is.<eos> But we'd still love to come stay there.<eos> Yeah, that, uh... that, uh, that would be, uh... great, at some point.<eos> What do you mean, "at some point"?<eos> Well... the condo is, uh... sort of out of my hands, at this point.<eos> And whose hands would the condo that's supposed to pay for Hope's college be in?<eos> The people I sold... it to... t... to pay for this wedding.
[fast tempo acoustic intro playing]<eos> Previously on Reign:<eos> - Is that my husband's child?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I just lied to Francis for you!<eos> You made a mistake and now you have to fix it before it destroys my marriage.
If you two didn't live in this building, then we'd drift apart and we'd only see each other on saturdays for coffee.<eos> Well... I'd probably only go once.<eos> Look, just give me 90 seconds.<eos> I mean, he's got a pump.<eos> How hard could it be?<eos> She's amazing.<eos> We should probably get her something for this.<eos> What would be appropriate?<eos> That good candle under the sink?<eos> We've only used it once.
Please, would you take some?<eos> Because I have to get it out of my house.<eos> The lieutenant was a good man.<eos> Smart guy.<eos> Top of his class at Stanford.<eos> He always committed 100% to everything he did.<eos> He like his job?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, y-yes, of course he did.<eos> He... he died doing it.
What is the problem, Tim?<eos> That you getting in trouble hits home for me.<eos> That's all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you into the PX's Tor protocols?<eos> Funny that a program developed by the Naval Research Lab now makes hidden Web sites possible.<eos> I wrote a layman's summary for Gibbs.<eos> "There are 500 times as many hidden sites "as there are public ones.<eos> They are called the Deep Web, or Dark Web."<eos> Well, ow Gibbs; he probably wouldn't have read it anyway.
All of our last names are Reagan and we all got careers to worry about, but family comes first.<eos> How's it going, Jamie?<eos> Oh, hey, you guys.<eos> Uh, this is my brother, Danny.<eos> Hey.<eos> Word is your sister's going pretty hard after Cutter.<eos> Can't talk about that.<eos> He's a good cop.<eos> She should cut him some slack.<eos> Hey, how about I buy the next round, okay, and you guys take it back from where you came from?
Plus, living in the state where it happened.<eos> Might make a good story for your next book.<eos> You do have investigative experience.<eos> You know, I was never going to make detective there.<eos> Not after what happened.<eos> Is that your way of telling me you somehow got access to my personnel records?<eos> Jack, look, I just heard about it, thought you might be interested in it as a cop.<eos> This Bill Anderson guy either kills himself in a week or gets caught in 18 months with some waitress in pig's knuckle, Iowa.<eos> Always ends the same.<eos> They have one life to live, and they can't help blowing it.
So does the camera.<eos> Well... you're really hot, so there's that.<eos> There's definitely that.<eos> But I... I love my girlfriend.<eos> The one who doesn't have sex with you?<eos> I-I'm also feeling kind of scared.<eos> Of me?<eos> Well, it's just that this job is really important to me.<eos> It's a dream come true.<eos> I'm just worried that if I don't give you what you want I-I might lose it.
Well, I mean, I know it's gonna come back to haunt my nightmares In a year or two but I'm just gonna make light of it until then.<eos> Nick, seriously, you don't sound OK.<eos> - No, I do have some residual tension. - Mm-hm?<eos> Some...unrelieved residual tension.<eos> - I'm not sure I like where this is going.<eos> - Where do you think this ls going?<eos> I think you're probably going to ask for a handjob... - Mm. - ...<eos> Or something. Before I choose, what's the something?<eos> Do you know I do actually quite like my job?<eos> So I'm not going to throw it away just so I can touch your penis.
Weapons Intelligence ls here. WISWO!<eos> I've come about your special bomb-making friend.<eos> - You've got someone?<eos> Awesome.<eos> - No, actually. - We've had a bit of a setback. - Oh.<eos> We thought we had someone from a partial print, but he was just being paid to stick the things In the ground.<eos> - Ten-dollar Taliban.<eos> - Shit. Then we saw a device with the orange wire here, and Bluestone 44 found another here, completely fucking our location profiling.<eos> So, we've had to widen the search to this area here.<eos> We're referring to it as Area A.
"it comes from the lord, "the maker of heaven and earth.<eos> "he will not let your foot slip. "he who watches over you will not slumber.<eos> Indeed, he..."<eos> Disarm system now.<eos> Disarm system now.<eos> System deactivated.<eos> Hey.<eos> I heard the alarm.<eos> I just wanted to make sure it was you.<eos> Oh, thanks for setting it.
Be patient."<eos> That someday, something will click, but it never has, and he just keeps getting sadder and more lost.<eos> The other day, he even looked at me and asked if he had ever been in love, and it just broke my heart, because I think he had.<eos> We are very sorry to have upset him.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It happens a lot.<eos> They say it's part of the healing process, but I just can't help wondering if he'll realize how much he's lost... the music, the girl...<eos> Even the guitar.<eos> What did you say, Rita?<eos> She kept it in a special cabinet.
I know it all happened very quickly, but that's where we are.<eos> Together.<eos> With our secrets.<eos> With our pasts.<eos> I swear, if I believed knowing every single thing about one another could protect us from future troubles, I would tell you every moment of my past.<eos> But... my life... this... wonderful life, began the day you agreed to be my bride.<eos> Then why do I feel afraid?<eos> Because life is full of uncertainty.<eos> That's why we love.<eos> To face it with someone.
- Boston police.<eos> - What the hell's going on?<eos> !<eos> - Are you John Brooks?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm Ralph Comstock.<eos> That's what his license says.<eos> Why are you driving Brooks' car?<eos> We were roommates.<eos> I bought it from him.
I've told him.<eos> It makes absolutely no difference.<eos> Talk to me about the boat.<eos> Well, it was doused in gasoline.<eos> The seawater eventually put out the fire.<eos> But if they took it out at, say, 4:00 a.M. To burn it, How did they get back?<eos> Rear section has marks where a motor might've been.<eos> Could've used that to get back on another boat.<eos> Or could be they just towed it.<eos> Any hint why they burned it?
It has a rare production defect.<eos> It has camel toe.<eos> It has camel toes?<eos> No.<eos> Camel toe.<eos> Oh...<eos> Well, this is ridiculous. She's just a kid.<eos> And I bought that the night before your fifth birthday when your mom remembered we didn't have anything else for you.<eos> I'm going down to that convention and I'm getting that doll back.<eos> Bronconius isn't gonna just give it back, Dad.
- Yeah, yeah, rub it in.<eos> Everything changes. Everything.<eos> - Tough time to be a cyborg.<eos> - Tough time to be anybody.<eos> Here.<eos> This might hurt a little.<eos> I swear that's your favorite part.<eos> My job has its perks.<eos> Hey, whatever happened with that?<eos> You know, I've been trying to fix that thing ever since the day you brought it in.
It's too late, Talos.<eos> Nothing can stop it now. Hull breach verified. I'm on top.<eos> I think I like you.<eos> You're too late.<eos> She's already dead.<eos> No.<eos> But you are.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> That thing is a monster.<eos> No wonder Talos wanted it.
Did you really think it would be so easy to escape us, Mr. Sibley?<eos> There, up ahead!<eos> George?<eos> George?<eos> You're the servant?<eos> Yes, sir, sent by Mrs. Sibley to retrieve her ailing husband.<eos> This is worse than I had feared.<eos> Which is why he needs to be taken to hospital at once.<eos> No.<eos> It is not the injury that troubles me, but how he came by it.
Maybe the Volm can help, okay?<eos> I'll talk to Cochise.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> A hatch door that does not open.<eos> We'll get it open.<eos> We just haven't figured out how yet.<eos> What is that?<eos> Bioelectrical wiring.<eos> We should be able to follow that to a control panel and open it.
How's it looking out there?<eos> Not good.<eos> Poor guy.<eos> He loved that car.<eos> You know you're smiling, right?<eos> I can't help it;<eos> I hate that piece of crap.<eos> Is there any hope?<eos> None.<eos> It's gonna cost two times what it's worth to fix it.
It's tearing us apart!<eos> Why couldn't that whale have pooped three equally sized poops like I do!<eos> This isn't like you, Louise.<eos> You used to be nice, sort of.<eos> If you're gonna sell that thing, then you're doing it alone.<eos> Yes, that's the plan.<eos> That's exactly what I'm doing.<eos> Wh-What are you doing?<eos> You don't walk into a deal just holding the stuff.<eos> You tape it to your back.
From a private residence to a zoological garden.<eos> That's a bloody ridiculous idea.<eos> Well, I think we need a lunch meeting to discuss it, don't you?<eos> Change of use, you say?<eos> It's you again.<eos> Yes. Please.<eos> Frankie can get the forms for you.<eos> Get your husband to fill them out and get them back to us sharpish.<eos> Planning committee meets quarterly, so if he doesn't hit the deadline then he'll have to hold fire for three months.<eos> You can stick that in your pipe and smoke it.
But he'll make a mistake.<eos> Men like him always do.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, it's good as new, son.<eos> I told you, Dad, not to go in there!<eos> It was too much work to fix the small one up in the time we had.<eos> Well, this was all your idea, I suppose, is it?<eos> Excuse me? Eh?<eos> As well as ignoring my telegram.<eos> I didn't ignore it, I ripped the bloody thing up, if you must know.
Doesn't stop him being a slimy devil.<eos> "In formal dining, the fabric of the napkins should be compatible "with the fine, smooth texture of the formal table cloth."<eos> Are you planning a sit-down supper?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I suppose canapes could work for an event like this.<eos> And a clear soup, maybe?<eos> People do like something warming.<eos> Yes, they do, don't they?<eos> What drinks will you be serving?<eos> I would lend you Lord Ainslie's punch bowl but he's a bit touchy about it.
I hadn't heard that.<eos> She hates her because she got a c in Western civ.<eos> She corrects my English.<eos> I went to school in England.<eos> Are we going to walk into school with these?<eos> We'll say they're Sarah's.<eos> Is my purse in your bag?<eos> The senior class sent her flowers because they're all so concerned.<eos> Half of them think her name is Sally.<eos> Shit, I must have left it at the coffee shop.
Did you?<eos> Because there's still a dead girl in Alison's grave that the police...<eos> I don't know who that is. And I had nothing to do with it, and whether you believe me or not, Mom, that is the truth.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm not accusing you of anything right now but poor judgment.<eos> While you were gone, your father and I were dragged down to that precinct.<eos> What?<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> In Philly.<eos> They found your car and impounded it.

Yes, you do.<eos> Why?<eos> How did Carnivore get that story about Will?<eos> - Did you see my byline on it?<eos> - No.<eos> No. 2,000 reporters and he thought he was going to get away with it?<eos> He didn't knock over a bank.<eos> He sang an aria about how messed up the Correspondents' Dinner was, said ACN wasn't going and then showed up.<eos> You weren't aware of the aria until I told you about it.<eos> That story was waiting and ready to go and I'm the one who leaked it.
Will may have been at his best when you were his EP. But I'd remind you that you were at your best when he was your anchor.<eos> I'm offering you a fast car.<eos> It's a bit of a fixer-upper.<eos> All of us are.<eos> What happens to Don Keefer?<eos> He moves to 10:00 where Elliot Hirsch is taking over.<eos> Don's a smart guy and from what I hear a good EP. What makes you think I'll have better luck than Don making your car go fast?<eos> Because Will doesn't care about impressing Don.<eos> You're not offering me the job in spite of my history with Will, you're offering it to me because of it.<eos> I'm offering it to you because you're my best hope of turning our flagship news hour into something we're proud of.
You embarrass me.<eos> Build a page that says the site's down for repair.<eos> - For an hour?<eos> - For a week.<eos> We're gonna rebuild the whole thing.<eos> I'm sorry about Charlie Skinner.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm just looking at the bedroom of a small boy.<eos> We've got to finish the renovation on the apartment and then sell it. We need a house with a pile of leaves in front on a flat street where he can ride a bike.
You sent that photo to my dad.<eos> You know about that?<eos> You ruined my relationship with him.<eos> You baited him and covered your tracks.<eos> You lined everything up that day so he'd die!<eos> Ryan, how could I have known... any of that was gonna happen?<eos> The car?<eos> The accident?<eos> What, so you just messed with my life for no reason?<eos> I sent it because I was afraid.
Whether I'm an evil god or not, rehashing the past isn't gonna do you any good, Ryan.<eos> You've got to move on.<eos> "Move on"?<eos> You destroyed the best relationship I've ever had.<eos> All right.<eos> If that's how you're gonna be, then you've got to realize there are two sides to every story.<eos> You want to know what really happened today?<eos> Goldsmith's been such a bitch lately.<eos> Come on, no way, dude!<eos> Like you said, you were going off on your boss, so we drew that cartoon, and you put it in the envelope.
You're behaving like a fucking child.<eos> This is a man's world.<eos> Take your apron off, and sit in the corner like a little boy.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Now.<eos> - Four minutes.<eos> -All right, four minutes.<eos> --Talk to me about hand grenades.<eos> The chalk mark on the barrel, at knee height. It's a Hamilton Christmas.<eos> I took out the pin and put it on the wire.
The only reaction I got was from my colleagues wondering if I'm working for the National Inquirer.<eos> Look, Beth, I know there's been a lot of back and forth on this, but...<eos> Can you hang on a minute?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rewiring your neighbors, I just want to...<eos> I have proof-- a serum, that corrupts DNA.<eos> A serum?<eos> Back when I was running the precinct, we arrested a-a deranged scientist, Sam Landon.<eos> He developed it based on research the government used...
- That was almost a tragedy.<eos> So, Manny comes up and he's like, hey, Mike, let me get two bags.<eos> So I hear he goes, here you go, two bags.<eos> He hands me a little stack of singles, and as soon as I look at it I know it's not 20 bucks.<eos> I don't even flip through it, I just kind of like take it and like spread it apart a little bit and I'm like, dude, this is not 20 bucks, and he's like, yeah, yeah, there's a 10 in the middle<eos> And I'm like, look, bro, one, two, three, four, five, seven, nine, ten.<eos> No, $10 bill.<eos> Where's $10 bill?<eos> He's like, oh, dude, yo, yo, come on, man.<eos> Yo, you probably pocketed it.

Yo.<eos> Fucking jackpot, Mike.<eos> What happened?<eos> What'd you find?<eos> 500 bucks.<eos> What?<eos> Banana Republic?<eos> We got to pick this shit up.<eos> We got to pick this up.<eos> Don't leave it here.
How far do you think we're gonna get?<eos> I thought you wanted to escape.<eos> I do.<eos> But we got to play along right now.<eos> Okay?<eos> Listen.<eos> We graduate from the camp with honors, and then they set us free to go round up terrorists.<eos> But when we're out, we're gonna warn everyone about the sick crap that's going on here.<eos> The earth is a gift.<eos> The new coalition must protect it with our Espheni brothers.
Josh!<eos> Funny story... _<eos> Do you know the definition of funny story?<eos> Hey, Sofia!<eos> Did Gabi tell you about my little party?<eos> She's going to a happy hour.<eos> Caroline went to NY to see the wedding dress...<eos> With her friend...<eos> While she's gone I'm gonna have a party.<eos> Guess how I'm gonna call it.
You're right.<eos> I have made you wait an unreasonable time.<eos> I just feel I need to plan if you've come to a decision.<eos> I have.<eos> I think I have.<eos> Tomorrow I want you tell me the missing element of your story.<eos> If you do, I'll give you a decision.<eos> Is everything planned for the trip?<eos> It is.<eos> I'm looking forward to it.
Have you set the date? For the wedding, M'Lady.<eos> No.<eos> He's not trying to get out of it? No.<eos> But there's no hurry.<eos> We don't have to rush into it.<eos> By the way, would you do me the greatest possible favour?<eos> I will if I can.<eos> Would you hide this in the cottage?<eos> You mean the thing.<eos> Well, I can't leave it here.
No.<eos> He's not trying to get out of it? No.<eos> But there's no hurry.<eos> We don't have to rush into it.<eos> By the way, would you do me the greatest possible favour?<eos> I will if I can.<eos> Would you hide this in the cottage?<eos> You mean the thing.<eos> Well, I can't leave it here.<eos> Suppose Mrs Hughes found it.
They've run the comparisons again - both bullets are definitely a match for Tom's rifle.<eos> No, that can't be right.<eos> Where is his rifle now?<eos> In the evidence room at the police station.<eos> ~ I followed procedure. ~ OK.<eos> No, seriously, sir, I did.<eos> I logged it out for Ballistics on Friday.<eos> I logged it back in again yesterday.<eos> I'm not doubting you.<eos> We just need to see it.
The results are the same.<eos> I'm not questioning your expertise here.<eos> Anybody who says they're not questioning my expertise is doing precisely that.<eos> The barrel of every rifle leaves a set of unique marks on the bullets it fires, like a fingerprint.<eos> ~ OK?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> So this is the bullet from your crime scene this morning.<eos> And I've just fired a bullet out of that rifle to see what the rifling marks look like.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Firing it into gelatine means we can keep it intact and have a good look at it.
(Mock offended) And then you just stopped!<eos> Well, I'm only trying to help.<eos> No need to get your knickers in a twist.<eos> Why go to all the trouble to frame Tom and then kill him with one of the same bullets?<eos> It doesn't make any sense, it ruins the plan.<eos> Maybe his death wasn't part of the original plan, it's why they were interested in the exit wound.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Perhaps the killer wanted to reassure themselves the bullet had gone right through Tom's body and there was at least a sporting chance that it would never be found.<eos> They must still be worrying about the bullet in the tile, though.<eos> They've got to weigh it up: the risk of leaving it in the pool versus the risk of being caught trying to get it out.
So do we leave it on or turn it off?<eos> Okay, then.<eos> - We're counting on you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, they're not talking about trial strategy, they're talking about moving Diane out.<eos> Has nothing to do with us.<eos> - So we turn it off?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This is such a mistake.<eos> We can't turn their side off, we can only tell them they left it on.
Don't use that word.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Partially Deceased Buddha.<eos> That's even worse.<eos> That's the name the living gave us.<eos> We are the Undead.<eos> We are the redeemed.<eos> Got it?<eos> Aw! Look at that face!<eos> So nice to squeeze it again.
Check again.<eos> Derek Pearce.<eos> Grand Avenue. Penthouse A.<eos> He bought it for one dollar.<eos> Multiple property records confirm.<eos> From who?<eos> Previous owner was Claypool Industries.<eos> Sending you a full purchase history now.<eos> Okay, well, according to this,<eos> Claypool Industries bought the property for $5.2 million, and then six days later, Pearce bought it for one dollar.
- Yeah, a long time ago.<eos> - Hey, easy with that.<eos> Okay, you're not my dad.<eos> I am not your dad.<eos> You're right.<eos> Why does Marshall have the flash drive?<eos> I help him with his homework sometimes.<eos> Ah, you do his homework.<eos> You put it on the flash drive.<eos> He takes it from your locker.
Saturday, you say?<eos> Look at this one.<eos> It's black and huge.<eos> Wow, where would you even put something so big?<eos> I'd make room for that.<eos> Guys, put the bathtub catalog down.<eos> I've already picked out the tub for upstairs and before you ask, no, you may not.<eos> It's a surprise for Caroline, she's gonna be the first one to use it.<eos> Don't worry, Yolanda.<eos> You'll be the first one to clean it.
Hey, thanks for the iced tea.<eos> It's not for you.<eos> I'm working on the man working on your tub.<eos> Hey, Josh, I made you my patented hangover helper.<eos> Ugh, just looking at it makes me sick.<eos> Good, I'm starving.<eos> So in regards to what happened last night,<eos> Gabi made these cute "Star Wars" apology treats for Cooper.<eos> Just something for him to Chewbacca on.<eos> All you have to do is sign this card, and we can send it right over.
Why are you telling me this?<eos> Josh, where are you?<eos> Come on.<eos> Josh?<eos> Yolanda, are you getting in that tub?<eos> Josh, what are you doing in your bathroom?<eos> What are you doing in my bathroom?<eos> There is a real good reason why I'm in here.<eos> I was...<eos> About to clean it for Caroline.
Did you park your white horse outside?<eos> Spare me the suspense and tell me what your "save the day" plan is.<eos> I don't have anything yet.<eos> The idea I had wasn't great.<eos> It wasn't great. It was terrible.<eos> I want to hear the real one.<eos> Or are you just going to pull it out during the presentation?<eos> This idea is good.<eos> I think we can get the client to buy it.<eos> No, you don't, or you wouldn't have questioned it.
And what do you suggest?<eos> Let me trade them and I'll bring you somebody I know that you want.<eos> Liber8?<eos> Better.<eos> A soldier from the alternate future Alec created.<eos> You give me Alec Sadler, Brad Tonkin is yours.<eos> It's evidence.<eos> It's my property, I want it back.<eos> Until the case is heard it stays there.<eos> Great, so Jason the perpetrator is out but my property is not and you're unable to change it.
There's no sign that anyone else has been here.<eos> 'cause no one comes here but me.<eos> This is my weekend place.<eos> This is your boat, correct?<eos> It would appear to be.<eos> If you don't know mr. Castle, Then how did he end up in this boat<eos> In the middle of the ocean? But I did notice that it was missing<eos> So your boat was missing, but you didn't report that?<eos> I mean, I don't -<eos> - I don't even know why I bought it.
He drank from the poisoned cup and when he died...<eos> ÃgÃ♪dei rose from his bed.<eos> That, son, was a tale conjured to save Tolui's face.<eos> Losing face.<eos> Chinese concept you've been taught... and have experienced.<eos> Truth is... Father was a weak man.<eos> Screwing whores and drinking airag till his liver burst.<eos> He never deserved to occupy the Mongol throne.<eos> Honor... he had none.<eos> Courage... he spent it at the gaming houses.
- You got it.<eos> - Cut it off.<eos> - What?<eos> N-no.<eos> Okay?<eos> We'll get you to a hospital.<eos> They'll fix this.<eos> This thing is killing me.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> I need you to cut it off, or I won't make it to the hospital.
Gonna help her brother.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> What came next was a classic Murray Goldberg golden rule... one he said every day.<eos> Okay, whatever you two are up to, I'm not bailing you out.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - Understood.<eos> Yeah. Guess I'm downstairs for the rest of the day.<eos> While Barry's year was looking up, I was about to lock it down with Dana.<eos> So, do you want to ride our bikes later?<eos> I found a dead snake and I was wondering if you wanted to poke it with a stick or something.
- Yo!<eos> You look nice.<eos> Today's my interview.<eos> Today's your interview.<eos> You said you could take the kids to school.<eos> Of course I'm taking the kids to school, right, kids?<eos> Jeremy: What's an interview?<eos> - Mommy's getting a job.<eos> - Trying to get a job.<eos> Do you want it? [Sets down coffee pot]

It was the other soul that was inside of her that did.<eos> Donna's suicide note.<eos> It's all in the third person.<eos> You think this is proof?<eos> A suicide note... written by someone who was... out of her mind?<eos> Donna is back... to warn me about them.<eos> "In the beginning, there was death."<eos> blah, blah, blah.<eos> I know this stupid book is trying to tell me something, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what.<eos> Well, it would make more sense if you were reading it when you were older, a little more in control.
- Last night.<eos> - Of course I remember.<eos> This whistle blew three years ago.<eos> Your services are being requested.<eos> I'm not gonna leave my family.<eos> - Don't wake up.<eos> - Go to sleep!<eos> I've seen a gun in her purse.<eos> You believe that you will always feel that pain.<eos> And if it starts to slip away you'll seek it out again.

We import 30,000 pounds of mayonnaise a month.<eos> You know how many sandwiches that is?<eos> Mr. Ellis, how much product do you think you'll turn out by the end of the year?<eos> And, of course, our most precious resource, these talented young ladies.<eos> Most of them came straight from high school to serve their nation.<eos> Pretty little patriots, aren't they?<eos> What's the evacuation protocol in case of radiologic accident?<eos> Expect they can find the front door.<eos> We received the War Department's R-23 directive a month ago.<eos> I put it on your desk.
Is this really happening?<eos> You're gonna be the most beautiful bride to ever walk down the aisle.<eos> How will I know I'm making the right decision?<eos> You can't know anything for sure.<eos> Being a doctor must have taught you that, no?<eos> It's like how you call medicine?<eos> An imperfect science.<eos> Exactement.<eos> Love is the same.<eos> You cannot see it, touch it, measure it.
- No, no, no.<eos> - Don't... don't do anything.<eos> - I got it for you.<eos> When you get to my age, your skin is like Kleenex.<eos> The legend of Tante Gittel's ring.<eos> Will you come blow this thing up, please?<eos> What's the story with this thing again?<eos> Is that Grandma Rose's sister who was in Treblinka?<eos> Did we really have somebody in Treblinka?<eos> Wasn't it she was, like, waiting in line, going to her death, and handed it to somebody right before she walked into the gas chamber?
The only problem is, whatever American had this dream probably wasn't where I'm from.<eos> And if he was, he should've mentioned the part about how when brothers start getting a little money, stuff starts getting a little weird... like in my neighborhood.<eos> Sometimes I feel like a bit of an oddity.<eos> And if you look to your left, you'll see the mythical and majestic Black Family out of their natural habitat and yet still thriving.<eos> Go ahead and wave. They'll wave right back.<eos> - They're smiling.<eos> Hi. Hello.<eos> - The little ones are cute.<eos> They're just... just amazing.<eos> Sometimes I worry that, in an effort to make it, black folks have dropped a little bit of their culture and the rest of the world has picked it up.

First order of business,<eos> I intend to build a courthouse, statehouse, a jailhouse, and a treasury.<eos> Ah.<eos> The four horsemen of civilization, hmm?<eos> A lawyer, a politician, a policeman and a tax collector.<eos> I will need to buy land upon which to build.<eos> I will gladly accept cash.<eos> I have plenty of land for sale.<eos> General Grant sent authorization to Levy Taxes.<eos> If you are proposing to tax me in order to pay me for my land, why don't I just give it to you?
Chloe knows something's up.<eos> She keeps asking me what's going on.<eos> She knows I've been avoiding her.<eos> You can't control what comes out of Chloe's mouth.<eos> Okay, could you please just not tell her?<eos> I won't.<eos> If you can keep our stuff between us, that'd be great.<eos> So, what was Oliver talking about at parade... you missed some sort of meeting?<eos> Aw, yeah, I was supposed to sit down with this guy from Intelligence, buy him a coffee, see what the job entails.<eos> But you missed it 'cause you were chaperoning me.
- You got him to lie on the stand.<eos> - Is that why I picked you?<eos> Because I thought I picked you because your self-defense argument showed you think well on your feet.<eos> But now that you exposed what you really think of yourself and that you really don't believe you deserve this job...<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> That's exactly what you said, right before you accused me of illegal acts to win this case.<eos> We won because I did my job.<eos> You think carefully.<eos> Everything after this moment will not only determine your career but life.<eos> You can spend it in a corporate office drafting contracts and hitting on chubby paralegals before finally putting a gun in your mouth, or you can join my firm and become someone you actually like.
So why don't you break it down to me, man to man?<eos> Okay, the timing belt snapped, sent the valves through the pistons, the transmission bands are shot, and the camshaft bearings are dust.<eos> That's what I-I figured.<eos> Yeah, I-I thought that was the problem.<eos> So how much is it gonna cost to fix?<eos> [Sighs] Look, man, can I be honest with you?<eos> That car is a coffin on wheels, okay?<eos> I would not let my mother drive it.<eos> Now, my mother-in-law, I'd give it to her with a big bow on top.<eos> But guess what I'm gonna do for you, I'll scrap it and give you 500 bucks towards any of my fine pre-owned automobiles in my showroom-slash-sidewalk.
- What?<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Wait, you bought me a car?<eos> Oh, here come the tears.<eos> Why would you buy me a car?<eos> I already have a car.<eos> Not anymore you don't! I traded it in for that guy.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Where's my car?<eos> I had 'em scrap it.
Who's excited for power windows? !<eos> Not me!<eos> You scrapped my car? !<eos> How could you?<eos> Wait, you're mad at me?<eos> I don't get it. Everybody loves Oprah when she gives out free cars.<eos> - You had no right to do that. - [Snickers]<eos> Look, Gabi, there's nothing you can say that's gonna make me feel bad about getting you a car and getting rid of that trash heap.<eos> [Sighs] That was my mom's car.<eos> She gave it to me as a present before she died.
I just want to say I'm sorry about last night.<eos> I did get caught up in all of the attention.<eos> I was just mainly frustrated 'cause I feel like moms do everything and no one ever notices and then Dads do one little thing - and people go crazy. - Mm.<eos> But you know what I realized last night?<eos> That you can't drink a half a bottle of wine in the tub and get out without help?<eos> And that I have a very helpful husband.<eos> And now I have a lot more time to enjoy myself.<eos> Maybe a little bit of you later.<eos> I was enjoying my breakfast over here.<eos> By the way, these health forms need to go in today, and if you want, I can fill it out 'cause I've got it down to a science.
But not telling the agency doesn't solve the problem.<eos> They won't let me continue to be an operative.<eos> Will you stop thinking about work for a second?<eos> This is your life.<eos> It's not gonna matter, anyway, come tomorrow.<eos> Why?<eos> The doctor took a blood sample after the crash.<eos> And as soon as Langley reviews my records, they will pull me from active field duty.<eos> And you want to go out with a win.<eos> I want to do my job until they take it away from me.
I keep my personal life and my business separate.<eos> This job requires us to compartmentalize our lives.<eos> Is a coat closet one of those compartments?<eos> You got what you got.<eos> Now, how are you going to play it?<eos> I'm the least of your worries.<eos> If I saw you, someone else might have seen you too.<eos> And this could ruin you.<eos> I know how hard you worked to get this job.<eos> If you want to keep it, you can't have secrets anymore.
How did you do that?<eos> Oh, I've got my own secret ways.<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company.<eos> Hayley came by after the event last night.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> Is this weird?<eos> No. It's fine.<eos> Um... Why did you change my medical records?<eos> Well, it's your life.<eos> No one should be deciding how you spend it.
Oh, come on. Bob.<eos> Don't hurt me.<eos> I'm protecting her.<eos> Give me the camera, Bob.<eos> Come on.<eos> He's the bad guy, Ray, not me.<eos> I don't go in her house.<eos> I don't try to hurt her.<eos> The worst thing I ever did was jerk off in her car.<eos> She left it open.
We're not waiting on Re-Kon?<eos> No. I got this.<eos> And turn my headphones on.<eos> Cut it.<eos> Damn.<eos> Wait. Why'd you stop?<eos> Something ain't right.<eos> It sounded beautiful.<eos> Where'd you find the song?<eos> My mama used to sing it to me.
Something happened here.<eos> How much longer is this gonna take, Detectives?<eos> Has it spread any further?<eos> It's up to my chest now.<eos> - It's hard to breathe.<eos> - Dude...<eos> - We have to get him out of here.<eos> - How do we do that?<eos> So, Andy, he steals the bag, and then he hightails it out of here...<eos> He didn't STEAL it.
Hey, I'm gonna need one of you for the interrogation.<eos> You stay.<eos> Take a break from the rookie.<eos> I got to get him to Fite Nite, anyway.<eos> I bet it's guns.<eos> Or drugs.<eos> It's always drugs with these Dowling guys.<eos> Gail: I bet it's a severed head.<eos> Why would there be a severed head in a safe, Gail?<eos> Where else would you keep it?
Still, it's a nice reminder.<eos> Of what?<eos> Why we avoid each other for the rest of the year.<eos> I'm gonna start charging a penny for every moan.<eos> Four sisters.<eos> It's like a quintet of Cathys.<eos> Actually, let's just save time.<eos> Give me your wallet.<eos> Have you thought about giving the Nativity a modern twist?<eos> As Brecht tells us, art is not a mirror with which to reflect reality but a hammer with which to shape it.
Don't feel the cold.<eos> Can you feel that?<eos> Can't feel a bloody thing.<eos> I'm sorry. It's ok.<eos> I forget meself.<eos> What's the rush? - You're really good at this, and if you take that shot then you're going to win... and the game's over.<eos> Isn't that the point?<eos> The point of a game is to keep on playing.<eos> Well, yeah, maybe.<eos> But if we don't finish it, it sort of becomes pointless, doesn't it?
Right, where we headed?<eos> What's the address?<eos> But you got his name?<eos> Erm... erm... he used to be a choir boy, if that's any use?<eos> ~ It's no use at all.<eos> ~ No.<eos> ~ Feet!<eos> ~ I know!<eos> I've neglected my duties, my standards are slipping.<eos> ~ Can I just have a cup of tea and drink it in peace?
We could take a boat out on the Cam.<eos> I'd like that very much.'<eos> ~ Shall I take him in, sir?<eos> ~ Go ahead.<eos> ~ Geordie, he didn't do anything.<eos> ~ It was no accident, Mr Chambers.<eos> ~ Please don't let my dad find out.<eos> ~ It will destroy him.<eos> You hate your life.<eos> You hate it so much, you have to screw up everyone else's.
It was early.<eos> ~ I couldn't sleep.<eos> ~ What time?<eos> ~ I don't know. ~ (TUTS)<eos> Four, possibly. I... I don't know.<eos> You couldn't sleep?<eos> Went downstairs and... .. someone had put a note under the door.<eos> 'That was the gist of it.'<eos> 'It was all lies.'<eos> I only intended to destroy it.
How's David, Geordie?<eos> Have you got in her knickers yet, the German?<eos> If he dies and you're not there, how will you live with yourself?<eos> I have work to do.<eos> Got a dead pansy, no leads.<eos> He's your son, Geordie.<eos> You should be there.<eos> (SIGHS) And you... .. should stop pissing about.<eos> You hate your life.<eos> You hate it so much, you have to screw up everyone else's.
I owe you that.<eos> There's no sense looking back.<eos> The only think you can do is start again.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> We ain't schoolboys no more.<eos> We're not dead either.<eos> That leaves a lot of road in the middle.<eos> Maybe you just don't see the end of it.<eos> I have an appointment in New York.<eos> I can't put it off.
Next time you see the Commodore...<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Well, maybe one of the firehouses...<eos> Eli, you need to trust me, okay?<eos> Nuck.<eos> - Hey, Nuck.<eos> - What?<eos> Last Sunday, I went with June and her parents up to Brigantine.<eos> We're all walking along the shore and she goes, "I lost my hair ribbon.<eos> Help me find it."
Where did you learn what's proper?<eos> 915 Haddon Avenue.<eos> There's no Haddon Avenue in Atlantic City.<eos> It's in Trenton.<eos> Whose house is that?<eos> Nobody's house.<eos> Is it a school?<eos> Is it an orphanage?<eos> My name is in that book.<eos> If you take it, you're stealing from me and you're certainly no gentleman.
Sidney?<eos> I can manage!<eos> I can manage!<eos> Mr Chambers?<eos> A word, please?<eos> What, Mr Brant?<eos> What could possibly be so important?<eos> Mr Brant, is this about the wisteria in the churchyard?<eos> It's a menace.<eos> I don't suppose you could help us cut it back, could you?
Someone, help!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Get him off me!<eos> Help!<eos> Woman: Call 911!<eos> There is a whole litany of things we can do to keep death at bay...<eos> Exercise, eat well, put on sunscreen.<eos> And though you might try to bargain with death, bear no delusions.<eos> It will find you.<eos> So if you spend all your time hiding from death, or, in my case, searching for it,
He told me how he'd found out and threatened to ruin this young painter.<eos> And mother relented and stayed.<eos> Father took pride in having won her back.<eos> He said it was just a dalliance that she'd forgotten.<eos> But he was wrong.<eos> She never forgave him.<eos> And I never forgave her.<eos> She donated millions of dollars to secretly keep this painting on display...<eos> And one day die in front of it.<eos> I hope she saw it.
- Okay.<eos> 12 patriots were murdered three days ago in Chicago.<eos> Now, I didn't know them all, but the one I did know I knew well.<eos> Charlie Schinderman.<eos> So you will forgive me if I take offense when some paper pusher who's in charge of "coordinating a response" comes in, questioning my colleague's commitment and allegiances.<eos> Mr. Anderson, please sit down.<eos> We're not done yet.<eos> - Well, I'm done.<eos> - But I'm not.<eos> Look, I'm sympathetic to the grief you must be feeling, but I'm not going to let you use it to bully me out of doing my job.
Don't use phones much these days.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Did anyone see you come here?<eos> Were you followed?<eos> I really couldn't tell you, buddy.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hey, uh, your dog sounds territorial.<eos> You want to put it somewhere?
And as you grow weaker, you will be ripped of your strength, your will, your hope.<eos> And as you rot here alone, you will reconsider my offer...<eos> A new life, a way to be freed of your demons, a chance at peace.<eos> Oh. That's about enough of that, don't you think?<eos> I would have ripped her heart out, but she would have just body-jumped me.<eos> How do I get these off?<eos> The doll.<eos> There.<eos> Break it.<eos> She's using it to bind me.

You're suspended... effective immediately.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Here's your stuff.<eos> It's not a very big bag, because we weren't together for very long.<eos> No, I guess not.<eos> You know what really bugs me?<eos> Is that in your version of this story, you're the good guy.<eos> All I wanted to do was find out the truth.<eos> Yeah, well, you found it.

- Buzz, ask Agent Howard to join us.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> And there goes Cooper.<eos> And if the mother astill isn't there?<eos> Cooper has to find out what we need without alarming anyone.<eos> Hello.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Hey.<eos> I have a package for Linda Lanier.<eos> Oh, I'll take it for you.
There's the BMW...<eos> Eight miles from the mother's workplace.<eos> Why aren't we inside that car already?<eos> We can't burn that car, chief.<eos> What if the killer's watching?<eos> What if the kids are tied up in the trunk - and we're just sitting here?<eos> - We're not just sitting.<eos> We've put an S.I.S. surveillance van at major crimes' disposal right here.<eos> I've got two SWAT officers on the roof of this building, right here, with a clear view of the BMW across the street.<eos> Lieutenant Cooper is driving across town with his truck, which is large enough to double-park in front of the target vehicle and block it from the street so we can search the BMW without being seen from the surrounding buildings or passing traffic.
!<eos> No, I don't want any ice cream!<eos> Okay, okay, you call me if you change your mind, sir.<eos> N-no.<eos> I'd like an orange snow cone.<eos> What?<eos> It's hot in here.<eos> Where's Julio going?<eos> I'm Detective Julio Sanchez, L.A.P.D.<eos> Would you take your jacket off and give it to me sir?
No, I'm just not the kind of woman you're used to.<eos> Besides, I had an early plane, and I left a note.<eos> What can I do for you, miss Miller?<eos> You can start by not calling me Miss Miller.<eos> Ah, but in Paris, this is treating you like a lady.<eos> I just flew into De Gaulle an hour ago.<eos> We could discuss this in person.<eos> But maybe you're busy, and I can try you next time I'm in town.<eos> Are you tied up this afternoon?<eos> I have a meeting, but I could move it.
You got a problem with that, that's too bad.<eos> To be honest, I really don't care one way or another.<eos> This isn't about marijuana for me.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You know this woman?<eos> That's Allison Ball.<eos> Strange thing-- she had molasses on the soles of her shoes when she was shot dead this morning.<eos> Well, molasses is used in the cultivation of cannabis, right?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Lot of the growers use it.
Tonight is gonna be a heezy, fo' sheezy...<eos> Rebecca, let me in!<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> Are you crying?<eos> No, it's just... really cold outside.<eos> Rebecca!<eos> Wes, how do you even know she's inside?<eos> I mean, maybe she just turned on music to throw you off.<eos> She took it.
Who is this?<eos> Sasha... His girlfriend.<eos> I know you didn't kill Lila Stangard.<eos> And we both know who did...<eos> Help me catch him.<eos> Lila was pregnant.<eos> That's the evidence we need to tie Sam to her?<eos> Plug it into his computer.<eos> It'll download all his phone information.<eos> She took it.
No.<eos> Think.<eos> No one knows we were here.<eos> Annalise could be home any minute.<eos> Which is why we should leave.<eos> You want to run?<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> he fell after drinking too much.<eos> My car is outside.<eos> Anyone could've seen it.

May I have your gun and your shield, please?<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> You know the rules, Melvin.<eos> Any action against my team, you notify me personally in advance.<eos> Don't blame me if you don't know what's going on with your team.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Maybe the board should have installed an actual police officer to run Major Crimes instead of a...

Hi, Jo. (clears throat)<eos> I was just leaving.<eos> Did you... find out anything new?<eos> Not really.<eos> Except, uh, however he sustained that wound to his carotid is definitely what killed him.<eos> Oh, and this might be interesting.<eos> I found makeup on Dave's thumb.<eos> - "Makeup"?<eos> - Yeah. I don't know what kind.<eos> I'll send it out to be analyzed.
When do you want to meet?<eos> Now.<eos> Fauzi, it's 10:00 at night.<eos> I'm not gonna see Molly and the kids for a while.<eos> Can't this hold?<eos> Well, I'm not sure if it matters to you, but you're about to execute the wrong man.<eos> Well, that... that's the first I've heard of it, but...<eos> Yeah, of course it matters, if it's true.<eos> Yeah, I've been working on this story ever since Jamal was first ambushed.<eos> Not that anybody's going to read it; no one can.
Never forget!<eos> Down with the tyrant!<eos> Like father, like son!<eos> Down with the tyrant!<eos> Never forget Ma'an!<eos> Never forget!<eos> Put that down.<eos> Put it down!<eos> Do you know what I went through to get you this job?<eos> You will lose it, or worse.
I... I didn't do anything.<eos> [Electronic chittering]<eos> Okay.<eos> Weird.<eos> Might be worth something.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Careful.<eos> You'll cut your arm off.<eos> [Droid language]<eos> Look, I know you're not gonna believe me, but it's like this thing wanted me to take it.
Yeah, but that's here in Zenith.<eos> And this is the last card I got.<eos> So, these postcards don't really tell us anything we don't know.<eos> There's nothing that comes next.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> The Obelisk wasn't the last postcard that I drew.<eos> There was one more, but the dome came down before I could send it.<eos> Red door.<eos> Why'd you draw this, Pauline?<eos> I don't know... but we'd better find it.
The only wrong move I made was when my eyes lingered in your upper torso area for a second too long it triggered an instant dislike for me.<eos> How do I fix that?<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> You're wearing a silk blouse, hint of a bra, red fingernail Polish.<eos> I took the male leap that it was meant to be noticed and let my eyes linger in hopes that you would be flattered.<eos> I miscalculated.<eos> And it just got worse.<eos> This was uploaded on the university's student web site.<eos> You familiar with this video?<eos> Yeah. I've seen it.

Please tell me I'm smelling cookies and not some new air freshener.<eos> These cookies are for Grant's bake sale at school, - and those just came out of the oven.<eos> - I'm heaven right now.<eos> You just got back from your editor?<eos> - How did it go?<eos> - Notes.<eos> More notes.<eos> Endless notes.<eos> This book will get published, and I'll still be getting notes.<eos> Please tell me that I don't have to wait that long before I can read it.
I don't ware what that is.<eos> I promise to give you that.<eos> So you weren't like... like, punishing me for not letting you write your book?<eos> No, I was trying to simplify your life.<eos> I just thought maybe that would give you some closure.<eos> My attention were good, but my methods sucked ass.<eos> Did I use that right?<eos> Yeah, you used it right, just please never say it again.<eos> About your book...<eos> I was going to tell you that I changed my mind, and that you couldn't write it anymore.

Previously on "Finding Carter"...<eos> We know you've been sleeping with Gabe's dad.<eos> If you don't divorce Elizabeth, then I will let you write your book.<eos> So you'd already written it.
And he's still doing it.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> I'm happy to take you to work.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car.<eos> I can't have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.<eos> It's nice they're getting exercise.<eos> Although now that I think about it,<eos> Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.<eos> I'm sure he brought it.
You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that's left are some papers in a box.<eos> Makes you think.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, we're supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it's important.<eos> I-I did.<eos> It's all outdated or disproved.<eos> I don't know.<eos> This old pen kind of proves gravity.<eos> When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.
I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Even though your dress is ugly.<eos> Well, my little Flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end.<eos> If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you.<eos> And if you touched the ground, burn you.<eos> I'd like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.<eos> Take that, glass ceiling.<eos> And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been... one crazy ride.<eos> With all its ups and downs, I wouldn't give it up for the world.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> Relax, it wasn't your fault.<eos> Uh, maybe it's just stunned.<eos> Dude, i-it's not breathing.<eos> Oh, no. I killed it.<eos> Oh, not again.<eos> What do you mean, not again?<eos> When I was ten,<eos> I was playing in my backyard and... sat on a blue jay.<eos> I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just... caught on fire.
Oh, he blinked his eyes!<eos> He's alive!<eos> It's a Christmas miracle!<eos> I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I'll take it.<eos> Come on, little guy, let's get you outside.<eos> Get the curtain.<eos> Someone should really close that loading door.<eos> Well, that's that.<eos> The room's compromised.<eos> They'll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.
Look, when I first came out of the cocoon, I was so confused.<eos> I thought I was helping Lourdes, freeing her from the pain she'd suffer when the attack came.<eos> This isn't just about her.<eos> Look around you.<eos> We were devastated by that attack!<eos> Those of us who survived hold you responsible.<eos> I am, so, please, please, let me make it up to you.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> What Mason doesn't have the guts to do himself.<eos> You're gonna put that rifle down, or I'm gonna take it from you.
Wouldn't be the same?<eos> Is that our target?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's a mining platform, refinery, and energy plant all in one.<eos> To deploy helium-3.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> So that's it, huh?<eos> So they extract the helium-3 from the lunar rock and then use the ore as a fuel source.<eos> Exactly.<eos> They refine the ore into energy and deliver it to the power core, which converts it into wireless electricity and beams it to the Earth.
- And I need an old man to be my partner.<eos> Someone who wants nothing for himself.<eos> Sheik Rashid: You think that's me?<eos> Well, I think we both have a second chance here to make this right.<eos> You and I both know history.<eos> If we don't try, then your son or my brother and so many people along with them will be consumed by this.<eos> Imprisoned, exiled... or dead within a year.<eos> Sheik Rashid: Death doesn't scare me...<eos> Bassam Al Fayeed.<eos> I've seen too much of it.
I spent the last two weeks checking the alpha neutron reaction of every element on the periodic table.<eos> - You want a gold star?<eos> - Beryllium, fluorine, boron... they're all fine.<eos> Then I started to wonder, how much plutonium-240 is mixed in with the 239?<eos> Maybe we got a problem with spontaneous fission?<eos> It's 5:00 A.M.<eos> I read a paper on the nuclear shell model.<eos> It theorized that even-numbered isotopes have a higher spontaneous fission rate than odd.<eos> I read that paper.<eos> I know the guy who wrote it.
If we fall short with the combined brain power of all the Allies and a floating line of credit from the United States government, isn't there a chance that Werner Heisenberg - will fall short, too?<eos> - Of course.<eos> And if we fail and Heisenberg fails, it'll never get built.<eos> We could all go home.<eos> You could have kept quiet.<eos> But instead... you walked into my office and you sounded the alarm.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> And now I do.<eos> And now we'll reorganize all of our resources toward finding a solution.<eos> And when we do drop the bomb... and make no mistake, we will drop it... all those lives will be on your head, Charlie.
Even if your group weren't full of misfits and liars, Dr. Winter, a thousand geniuses couldn't master implosion in a thousand millennia.<eos> Get this limey prick out of here.<eos> So, you traded away the afternoon shift?<eos> - I thought you and Frenchy were attached at the hip.<eos> I prefer to spend afternoons with my son.<eos> Well, she asked me to give this back to you.<eos> Dr. Hogarth is right about me.<eos> None of that's my business.<eos> Doesn't mean he's right about implosion.<eos> Just because they couldn't do it, Frank, doesn't mean you can't.
The journalist was waiting for you in your office.<eos> Funny guy.<eos> "The young and ambitious prosecutor Radmann investigated the past of the teacher Schulz.<eos> The ministry of education received the report on march 25 but ignoring his membership in the Waffen-SS."<eos> And so on. "Intolerable scandal."<eos> Oh boy.<eos> I would not like to be you right now.<eos> The general wants to see you.<eos> Sr. Radmann, the article contains internal information.<eos> Did you leak it?
They are nice people, aren't they?<eos> I saw it right away.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Pretty young lady, lovely cutie, sweetheart, sugarpants.<eos> And Marlene likes you.<eos> He really was in the camp?<eos> Yes, but doesn't talk about it.<eos> "The angel of death."<eos> The first picture he painted after Auschwitz.<eos> Incredible, he's eligible for compensation, but he does not want it.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, But secretly I use my speed To fight crime and find others like me.<eos> And one day, I'll find who killed my mother And get justice for my father.<eos> I am...<eos> The flash.<eos> Previously on the flash...<eos> - I'm sorry I didn't believe you.<eos> But you really did see something that night your mom died And your dad is innocent.<eos> - The explosion that put you in a coma also killed my fiance.<eos> - Can you imagine if you could control his power?<eos> If you could harness it, You could change what it means to be human.
- I'll come with. - Ronnie, no.<eos> - I'm the lead engineer.<eos> I know how to operate the shutdown valve.<eos> - It's not safe.<eos> - Cait, I have to go.<eos> Okay, you stay here.<eos> We've only got a few minutes before this thing blows, And if I'm not back in time, you need to initiate lockdown.<eos> - No way.<eos> I am not closing this door.<eos> I won't be able to open it again.
Also, really sad.<eos> But thank you.<eos> Hey, Carter, Carter.<eos> What?<eos> Don't you remember I said we had some other things to discuss?<eos> Yes but does it have to be right now?<eos> My friends are waiting for me.<eos> Look, I know that you've had to make some huge adjustments in your life, and your dad and I have tried to give you a long leash.<eos> I'm on a leash?<eos> Well, you chewed through it.
Insurance, leverage.<eos> - A means to check power.<eos> - Or escalate the war?<eos> Isn't that what you wanted?<eos> War means profit.<eos> Chaos means profit.<eos> But it wasn't just about the money.<eos> Then what?<eos> This country's falling apart, Martin.<eos> Who's gonna save it?
That shithead was working narcotics and saw that dead methhead as his chance to force his way into a better job in homicide.<eos> So, you were still on the case when Miller Beck's body was found?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fales is ambitious, and I think he's more interested in closing cases than solving them correctly.<eos> I think Fales is trying to railroad an innocent man.<eos> Now, you want to help me try and prove he's got the wrong guy?<eos> You do that, I'll send you a thank-you note.<eos> But I'm not getting involved.<eos> Last time I messed with Fales, he screwed my career.<eos> I do it again, he's gonna end it.
Why do you want to do that?<eos> Just go, OK?<eos> Let me do this.<eos> OK, fine, yeah.<eos> And I'll always remember you. Fine.<eos> Great...<eos> Cos I was just going to do this.<eos> No driver required.<eos> And I really like that hair band.<eos> But I suppose I'll just take it, will I?

Do not recover the ship.<eos> You covered up your own daughter's death. And sent our people into harm's way.<eos> You have to understand how powerful that being is.<eos> This is the Triomphe.<eos> We just performed a retrieval.<eos> It appears to be an ISEA-issue craft.<eos> Sean Glass?<eos> You found an escape pod?<eos> There was only a faint signal.<eos> No signs of life... until we opened it.
Why were the Chinese here?<eos> Same reason you're here, August.<eos> Chinese gun-buy down in Selma got ambushed.<eos> We're the likely suspects.<eos> I gave Lin proof that we had nothing to do with it.<eos> There's not gonna be a war.<eos> I'll need that proof as well.<eos> It was local peckerwoods.<eos> One of our NV charters got the intel.<eos> I gave it to Lin.
What happened?<eos> Where am I?<eos> No, no.<eos> Lay down.<eos> Mona, you fainted.<eos> You were out for almost a minute.<eos> Where's my bag?<eos> It's over there.<eos> Ms. Adinolfi is on the phone with your mom.<eos> Give it to me.
Yes.<eos> Your room.<eos> Okay, it's been half frosted.<eos> Hello.<eos> May I take your coat?<eos> Hey, whoa.<eos> That shirt looks great on you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Better than it does on me.<eos> Keep it.

Are we really having this party?<eos> Man, it's on. - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> There's a party tonight on the roof.<eos> And this concerns me why?<eos> You can't study all the time.<eos> Emma, this is Jordi, my new roommate.

Hey. C.S.U. Got us a lead.<eos> See how this cabinet door is open?<eos> Just like in these crime scene photos.<eos> Okay. So?<eos> So when the cabinet door is closed...<eos> There's blood spatter on the door panel behind it.<eos> Which means the door was closed when Anton was shot.<eos> Yep.<eos> Now, see this smear of blood on the inside edge of the door?<eos> C.S.U. Said that this came from a finger, so somebody grabbed the door from the inside, pulling it open.

Congratulations.<eos> Thank you, General.<eos> Where's Claire?<eos> Yeah, where is the blushing bride?<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm sorry, Miss Riesen, but... there's a rumor Consul Whele turned one of his maids into lion chow for stealing his silverware.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> No one's turning you into lion chow just yet.<eos> I'm not stealing silver.<eos> William left his speech up here somewhere, so, you know, I said I'd get it for him.
Mom's in St. Louis.<eos> Dad's in Jefferson City.<eos> Inmate 7297 at the state penitentiary last time I checked.<eos> Why am I telling you that?<eos> My wife doesn't even know.<eos> What are the odds that we charbroil the state of Tennessee tonight?<eos> We're just cogs in the machine.<eos> But say you're Oppenheimer.<eos> You have power to redraw the map of civilization forever.<eos> Or put a match to it.
Thin Man will predetonate.<eos> It is doomed to fail.<eos> And then they will be forced to help us overcome the shockwave problem.<eos> No.<eos> No, the minute the Army discovers that Thin Man is useless, they'll shut us down and throw all their manpower into trying to fix it.<eos> So the plan is to put everybody around you in jeopardy?<eos> The plan is to prove implosion works before the plutonium arrives.<eos> And when I do that, no one's gonna give a shit how I got there.<eos> We hit the wall.<eos> It's a mile high, but you're not gonna scale it by standing on the shoulders of Thin Man.
Oh, see, now I don't think that's true.<eos> What's the game?<eos> It doesn't look like Egyptian Ratscrew.<eos> Hold 'Em.<eos> Local delicacy.<eos> Betting structure's like a chain reaction.<eos> It's a dangerous game for a guy who doesn't know when to quit.<eos> Teach me.<eos> About five minutes later, Frank comes out of his office with the pig and Meeks and I are barely keeping it together.<eos> He puts it on Crosley's desk and says, dead serious,
You don't have the clearance for that information anymore.<eos> Then get Secretary Stimson on the phone.<eos> It was his office that downgraded your clearance.<eos> Apparently you pissed on the wrong fire hydrant this time, Dr. Winter.<eos> I know that plutonium is ready.<eos> I talked to Tennessee weeks ago.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Thin Man won't work.<eos> What?<eos> Twenty years from now, every government on this planet will know how to design a bomb, but they won't be able to build it because purifying plutonium to a base level takes more manpower and resources than building the pyramids.
You're welcome.<eos> You could've left him in the building, you know.<eos> I'd be tempted.<eos> Can you get anything from your computer?<eos> No, it's ruined.<eos> Blast destroyed and shredded the hard drive.<eos> Thumb drive is dust.<eos> So he erased all the evidence that could tie Keeler to these bombings.<eos> He might be in custody now, but he'll be gone by morning.<eos> What if someone knew that on December 17 Keeler and the U.S. Secretary of Defense had a meeting about illegal drone strikes in Pakistan and Keeler recorded it to use as blackmail?
I told you. Landing is hard.<eos> Spirits.<eos> Okay, guys, we think Korra found her way back here.<eos> Now let's split off into teams and scour the town.<eos> Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu. Now just give me a second while I<eos> Wait.<eos> Pabu?<eos> Pabu!<eos> Why is Bolin hugging that big rat?<eos> Ew. Now he's kissing it.
I found your gift.<eos> Must have fallen off the night stand.<eos> It was next to my bed.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> I was surprised you didn't mention it last night at the engagement dinner.<eos> Now I know why.<eos> Aw, were you sitting there the whole time thinking I hated it?<eos> Not the whole time.<eos> All right, the whole time.<eos> This song... mom used to sing it to me, didn't she?
- Thank you very much.<eos> ...of a new wasp...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And thank you for asking me to the studio.<eos> Next week sees the opening of a of a new wasp farm near Redditch that is going to...<eos> Next week sees the opening...<eos> I have another theory.<eos> Really?<eos> Called, "My Second Theory" or "Miss Anne Elk, "bracket, Miss, second theory, number two."<eos> - Would you like to hear it?
But you just said I saved the day.<eos> You just said you saved the day.<eos> I said we wanted to show our gratitude.<eos> By telling me I get to choose whatever I want, except for the one thing I really want.<eos> Maybe I should have been more clear.<eos> Maybe you should have.<eos> I mean, you're a goddamn lawyer, after all.<eos> Louis, then let me be clear right now.<eos> I am giving you an opportunity to accept a well-deserved thank-you with grace.<eos> You can either take it, or you can turn it into a personal snub and ruin all the goodwill that you've just earned with me and Harvey.
Deep Valley, here I come.<eos> Great, I'll, uh... I'll text you the address.<eos> All right, cool.<eos> Peace. Not today.<eos> Nice place you got here, Doc.<eos> Yeah, yeah. It's, uh... it's not bad.<eos> I mean, I'm no rock star, but the view's okay.<eos> So... Where'd you get this stuff anyway?<eos> I got a guy in the Amazon...<eos> Chad. He, uh, brews it up for me.
I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We're building an atomic bomb.<eos> It'll set off a chain reaction that will explode with the power of 20,000 tons of TNT.<eos> Twenty thousand tons?<eos> Powerful enough to wipe cities off the map.<eos> Cities full of people.<eos> Children.<eos> No, the Army will detonate it someplace where it can't hurt anyone.
__<eos> __<eos> - This is Neil.<eos> - Hey, babe.<eos> Hi.<eos> So I had a meeting with that startup company today, and guess what.<eos> I got the job.<eos> - The design thing?<eos> - For the lobby.<eos> I mean, technically, I have to put together a presentation, they have to approve it, but they're really eager for me to get started.
Hello?<eos> Sir?<eos> Mr. Woodley...<eos> Who is it?<eos> What?<eos> Jesus, Steph, it's noon.<eos> What, are you still sleeping?<eos> - How did you...<eos> - The patio door.<eos> You leave it open.
He's in the locker room.<eos> You have a very nice place here.<eos> Mickey speaks very highly of you.<eos> Shorty, this is my son Daryll.<eos> Daryll, meet my buddy Shorty.<eos> Hey. What do you want?<eos> Listen.<eos> I know that you always wanted that car.<eos> It was wrong for me to give that to Conor.<eos> You take it.

What do you want?<eos> Listen.<eos> I know that you always wanted that car.<eos> It was wrong for me to give that to Conor.<eos> You take it.<eos> You know, fix it up a little bit.
-The teacher?<eos> She gets annoyed and doesn't care at all.<eos> Other kids like it when I'm bullied. It makes them feel safe.<eos> Nobody's ever taken my side!<eos> What do you know, dad?<eos> What do you know? What?<eos> Wearing that mask everyday...<eos> Is it some kind of a costume play?<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'm confiscating it!
They believed if you kept hold of the dead person's things, they might come back to haunt you.<eos> But we didn't burn this, did we?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Police!<eos> Police!<eos> You're shitting me.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Not a lot of people know this, but I'm quite the fucking Jamie Oliver.<eos> And today, today, I'll be teaching you how to make the perfect poached egg.<eos> Sometimes you get a bit of shell in the pan, but it's not a problem, you can just pick it out. Ah!
I'm sure I have the address in my appointment book.<eos> We're gonna need that address.<eos> Please.<eos> I will help you because I am fond of you.<eos> I am fond of you all.<eos> I feel we are connected on a deeper vibration.<eos> Do you feel that?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> I feel it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, well, you should've got it fixed.<eos> Well, I would have, but you've been M.I.A. for three days, so...<eos> Back to work.<eos> Upsy-daisy.<eos> Here we go. All right, all right, I got it, I got it.<eos> - I need this car fixed today.<eos> - Yes, I will take it<eos> - to the regular place.<eos> - Your keys. No, take it to Kiko.
Why wouldn't we?<eos> It's all good.<eos> Not my real name.<eos> You want O negative?<eos> Yeah.<eos> O negative.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> - This blood is clean, right?<eos> - Of course.<eos> We test it for hepatitis, HIV, all the usual suspects, and then we treat it with a citrate solution.
I finally had an opportunity to prove to someone that I could be there for them.<eos> And, uh, things got complicated and I screwed it up.<eos> End of story.<eos> I have a little saying about complications.<eos> Oh, I can't wait to hear it.<eos> The only complications are the ones we create.<eos> Yeah? Well, I didn't create this one.<eos> Ah, but you chose to let it divert you.<eos> My guess is you wanted to disappoint her.<eos> You saw your opportunity and you went for it, Doctor.
Right? What's up, what's up, mija?<eos> You know?<eos> And I don't know you very well.<eos> But I don't think I like you.<eos> Can you believe this guy?<eos> Why do you bring these people into my home, ese?<eos> It makes me very angry.<eos> Hey, I didn't really have a choice, okay?<eos> Look, ese, I paid you for that painting out of my own pocket, all right?<eos> We kept it because we liked it.
Have a good one.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I've been suspended, pending an investigation.<eos> Seriously?<eos> It sound like the sort of thing I shit you about?<eos> I... I told you what to do.<eos> - To get the blood...<eos> - I got caught putting it back.
Mm, Jesus, this is all bad.<eos> Just drink it; it's edifying.<eos> That's what Isabel says, at least.<eos> It's lacking a certain je ne sais vod-quoi.<eos> And, uh... Oh. Much better.<eos> - Uh, my car?<eos> - Is downstairs.<eos> - And mine?<eos> - Is with the valet.<eos> - I will have him wash it.
Bull!<eos> All you do is eat candy and play video games.<eos> You're grounded for two weeks and you're not going to the ballgame on Saturday.<eos> Where are we?<eos> The victims' automobiles were found right here.<eos> And that is where all the victims were last seen prior to the abductions.<eos> So he's able to move around freely.<eos> All right, we need to get back to the poem.<eos> An unsub this committed to a body of work isn't killing out of the blue.<eos> Maybe he'd obsess over the poem, maybe even write about it before acting it out.
Right.<eos> All right.<eos> You bring a sample of the H to Leland.<eos> If he's cool with it, I'll make it work.<eos> I'm gonna want something in return.<eos> Lin will most likely start his sentence here.<eos> Parole violations.<eos> I'm gonna need access to him.<eos> I'm not asking you to take him out, just to facilitate.<eos> Why don't we burn that cross when we get to it.
Well, there's only one move to Prove that.<eos> You deliver teller to me.<eos> I'll handle the payback.<eos> There's gotta be an Explanation for...<eos> Let me be more specific.<eos> You deliver teller or I kill You.<eos> End of the day, nero.<eos> And in case you got any ideas About taking a road trip... Security at the cripple home<eos> Save that rage for your biker Pal.<eos> He's the one who should catch It.
Grab your passport.<eos> I'll get the tickets.<eos> Beckett.<eos> Hey, so uniforms re-canvassed at that coffee shop using the geezer photo.<eos> They got a hit.<eos> A patron identified old-man Wally as a tenant at a nearby building.<eos> Okay. I'll be right there.<eos> Now we know what Wally's keys were to.<eos> How long has he had this place?<eos> Super said he rented it three weeks ago.
This is the first time we've seen each other outside the house in, like, six months.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Erasing the evidence.<eos> Do whatever feels right for you.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> I was sure I got all their phones and erased all the evidence that night.<eos> You know what I love about this picture?<eos> I think you look really happy...<eos> Free.<eos> It made me smile when I saw it.
It's for you.<eos> My father made it.<eos> He was a leatherworker.<eos> A trespasser and a squatter hiding in the same hall.<eos> Get them out of here.<eos> Can't you see that this boy is ill?<eos> All the more reason to get him off my property.<eos> This child is an orphan because of you, because of the squalid conditions of your tenement.<eos> Did I force these people onto boats, doctor?<eos> They came here for a better life, and they found it.
Bought a ticket that day.<eos> Damn.<eos> Talk about your bad luck.<eos> We heard there was bad blood between Raul and some real-estate developer,<eos> Tommy Delgros?<eos> Oh, if you say so.<eos> Raul was trying to rally business owners not to sell.<eos> Three generations...<eos> This bodega's been open 24/7 every day of the year, including Christmas.<eos> All night, I got junkies trying to steal baby formula so they can trade it in for smack.
Look, if I'd have known that bag was so special, I guess I...<eos> Of course.<eos> It's probably for the best that I learn to let go of all this junk.<eos> You okay?<eos> You know what the worst part about living for 200 years is?<eos> Having to renew your driver's license every seven years?<eos> Fair point.<eos> Second worst... Watching the same misdeeds happen over and over, history destined to repeat itself.<eos> You know, I don't believe that.<eos> I mean, not that history doesn't repeat itself, but that we don't have any ability to change it.
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Ah, here it is.<eos> - That's him.<eos> - Your grandfather? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Wow. How old is he there?<eos> I'm not sure, like, 25, 26?<eos> Great fisherman, huh?<eos> Well, we don't think he actually caught that fish.<eos> He said he did, but my grandmother always thought that he found it on the docks and then asked someone to take his picture next to it.
I didn't mean to upset you.<eos> But it's just, something about you drives me fucking insane.<eos> I don't think we should see each other anymore, okay?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Look, I need your help with the book.<eos> You're my insider.<eos> Okay, from now on, this is just a strictly professional relationship, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> If your hand just happens to find its way into my pants, then I will remove it promptly and admonish you for your vulgarity.
But your characters don't even end up together!<eos> We're all allowed to interpret the movie differently.<eos> No, they definitely don't end up together.<eos> Eh, to each his own.<eos> No, they really don't.<eos> Well, comme ci comme Ã§a.<eos> All right, well, now you're just saying words.<eos> C'est la vie. Anyway, it was the day before the big show.<eos> Some of you might call it yesterday...<eos> See you at my play tomorrow night. I wrote a play, we're doing it tomorrow, see you there.
And two eyes?<eos> This thing's deluxe!<eos> I don't understand!<eos> Why are you doing this? I thought we had a deal!<eos> Look kid, you've been getting way too close to figuring out some major answers.<eos> I've got big plans coming and I don't need you getting in my way!<eos> Destroying that laptop was a cinch, now I just need to destroy your journal!<eos> Race you to the bottom of the stairs!<eos> Hey. Human soda.<eos> I'm gonna drink it like a person.
It's come to life! The puppet books didn't warn me about this.<eos> Mabel, it's me, Dipper.<eos> You need to help me.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Dipper?<eos> But you're so much more of a sock than usual.<eos> Mabel, you have to listen.<eos> Bill tricked me.<eos> He stole my body and now he's after the journal.<eos> You have to find the journal before Bill destroys it.
Thanks for the ride.<eos> Tag me in those pics.<eos> Ah, hi there.<eos> I'm Jake Peralta, NYPD.<eos> You guys towed my car, and I really need it back.<eos> Mm-hmm. Got a badge?<eos> Yeah, I sure do.<eos> What?<eos> D'oh, my badge! Those demons on the party bus must have stolen it.<eos> If you got a license and credit card, just pay to get it out.
The solution is just to get rid of me.<eos> I don't want that to happen, so I need to solve an even bigger problem.<eos> And you want me to give you a bigger problem.<eos> I just got back.<eos> I need you to give me the biggest problem you've got.<eos> Fine.<eos> Sterling Pharmaceuticals is merging with Pfizer.<eos> Come on, smart guy.<eos> You want to solve the problem?<eos> You better be able to identify it.
I did it because Louis was desperate, all right?<eos> I went to see him the other day to bring him his stuff, it was just...<eos> The other day?<eos> You're telling me when you were supposed to be helping us keep our client, you were busy giving them to Louis on a silver platter?<eos> I was, but I also figured out how to get them back.<eos> - 'Cause I was trying to think of a better option.<eos> What the hell's wrong with this option?<eos> It involves going to Walter Gillis.<eos> Well, look who decided to drop by.<eos> The man who lost me my company and his partner who tore it to shreds.
Here.<eos> She posed in our suite.<eos> Our floor was perfectly aligned with the tiger's eyes on the casino across the street.<eos> The angle on this footage is by its mouth.<eos> This camera was on another floor.<eos> Someone spliced these tapes.<eos> I'm gonna have to look into this.<eos> You do that.<eos> That was so badass.<eos> Whoever framed Walter is desperate enough to fudge film and then give it to the cops.
Not about you, it's about myself.<eos> Seriously?<eos> How old is she, 22?<eos> Come on, what are you saying?<eos> What, if she'd been a 50-year-old English professor, would that make this better? Fuck you.<eos> She was in a very dark place, and she came after me pretty hard.<eos> Oh, my God, this is disgusting.<eos> I was feeling weak, I guess.<eos> I'd finally had a book published, took ten years, and it was just nothing.<eos> Nobody read it. - People read it.

You will die over there!<eos> You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.<eos> There are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been.<eos> God!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I have to say good-bye now.<eos> Just for a few more seconds.<eos> His razor.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can't throw it out.
Wasn't his last wife half his age?<eos> Yeah, but she got older.<eos> Regards back to him.<eos> Makes me the last active member of our old squad at the 2-1.<eos> Last and best.<eos> Yeah, if I'd been half the cop you were...<eos> Yeah, well, that medal of honor you earned says otherwise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You ever go by the marina, see if our old fishing boat's still there?<eos> Well, not since we sold it. Mmm.
I take back every mean thing I ever said about you.<eos> It doesn't mean we're gonna charge him.<eos> It's still very difficult to prove.<eos> And you're gonna prove it, sis.<eos> Dan...<eos> That's why you get the big bucks. Right?<eos> I know you can prove it.<eos> Ooh. Seriously, Pop?<eos> Whoa, you're not sending my lucky shirt to Goodwill.<eos> The only thing lucky about that shirt is that Grandma never saw you in it.
If I take the job, my first official act will be to demote you to arraignment court.<eos> I'd like to see you try.<eos> I asked the harbormaster about our boat.<eos> Queen Mary never made it through Hurricane Sandy.<eos> Damn shame.<eos> Lot of good memories.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everyone... wants this incident to go away.<eos> Especially me.<eos> But I got a problem, and I'm hoping you could help me with it.
You are going to help me put him in a chair.<eos> Okay, but if this guy leaks dead-guy juice on me, I'm gonna freak out.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> I think we should use your... your shirt.<eos> What?<eos> You want me to give you...?<eos> No, no.<eos> No.<eos> This is my favorite shirt.<eos> You're not putting it on a dead guy.
Actually, you know what?<eos> I think we should use your... your shirt.<eos> What?<eos> You want me to give you...?<eos> No, no.<eos> No.<eos> This is my favorite shirt.<eos> You're not putting it on a dead guy.<eos> Hey, relax, princess.<eos> I'll dry-clean it.
It was fine. Listen, we all have things about our wedding<eos> That we'd like to redo, right? That's why the hubby and I decided To renew our vows last year.<eos> You what, now?<eos> Just an intimate ceremony.<eos> You know, some friends and family<eos> And a band, some cake.<eos> You can have a second wedding?<eos> No! Come on. It'll just be a little ceremony.<eos> Marriage is not like a magazine subscription.<eos> You don't have to keep renewing it.
I'd still be there if it weren't for Walter.<eos> He's pretty exceptional.<eos> Don't tell him I said that.<eos> You spooked him.<eos> He won't talk.<eos> The FBI gave us one hour with him and we're at zero.<eos> That's what happens when a guy gets chased by a bunch of weirdos in a van covered in chicken feathers.<eos> The FBI searched his house, his storage locker, his records, everything, turned up nothing.<eos> The painting's worth $100 mil.<eos> If he doesn't talk fast, we'll never see it again.
We're talking wine, one of my specialties.<eos> Doesn't really matter right now.<eos> All we have is the word of an admitted forger.<eos> We'll never get a search warrant with that alone.<eos> I'll call in some favors and see if I can't get a wiretap, but that'll take some time.<eos> You hang tight until you receive further orders.<eos> I'll update you as soon as I have something.<eos> Okay.<eos> So Labeaux commissioned the fake, so we have to assume he has a real painting.<eos> Chances are he's trying to move it.
How could I have possibly known that was a wine cellar?<eos> The painting could be somewhere else in the house.<eos> No, not anymore.<eos> By now, Labeaux's found the broken wine bottles, he knows someone's hacked into the power.<eos> He knows we're onto him.<eos> He's gonna try and move that painting fast.<eos> Sylvester?<eos> You search his call history?<eos> Art world's supposed to be rarified air, but instead it's full of thieves.<eos> This guy stole it from the museum, who stole it from the Mueller family.
Sounds awfully real.<eos> Somewhere along the line, you had a breakthrough. You're improving.<eos> SYLVESTER: Okay, Labeaux made half a dozen calls to one number in the 48 hours before the original painting disappeared.<eos> The name is encrypted, but I think I can break it.<eos> In how long?<eos> That long.<eos> And I thought I didn't like him 'cause he was a know-it-all art jerk.<eos> Here's an e-mail from Labeaux to Paulson with his bank's routing and account numbers.<eos> Labeaux provides access to the fake, Paulson provides access to the original.<eos> We didn't find the painting at Labeaux's because he never had it. Paulson does.
What, like...?<eos> Handed in her notice.<eos> No-one knows where she is.<eos> Joe?<eos> - Joe!<eos> - No, leave him.<eos> I was still hopeful that she would get in touch, or at least remove the block so that I could contact her.<eos> But no.<eos> When there's a block, you can't even wallow properly.<eos> You can't switch it off.
You think that semicolon was a mistake?<eos> No, it was a juicy piece of bait and she unhinged her jaw and swallowed it whole.<eos> So, you wanted her to say no to us?<eos> Rejecting a valid request for such a petty reason? That's all the ammunition I need to go over her head.<eos> I secretly scheduled us a one-on-one with Madeline's boss, Chief Fisker.<eos> You want to hear the funniest thing ever?<eos> I also split an infinitive and she didn't notice.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Did you check out the department video camera by any chance?<eos> Yeah, I was going to take it home and videotape the top of my head.

Cool.<eos> So, I accidentally left a tape in there, and I... I want it back.
Thank you.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Are you okay, sir?<eos> I don't want to sound dramatic, but today has been sub-optimal.<eos> That doesn't leave this office.<eos> Wuntch beat me, the squad was a disaster, and in the end, do you know who I'm angriest with?<eos> Yourself?<eos> No.<eos> Wuntch.<eos> I need this task force to succeed, and there's not a detective here who is adult enough to lead it.
So, what now?<eos> Are we done?<eos> I'd like to go to the hospital.<eos> You sit tight.<eos> We're gonna check out your story.<eos> Okay? Get out of here!<eos> You're drunk!<eos> Go home!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Buzz, would you make a copy of this and send it to Lieutenant Provenza, see if anyone in Keisha's family knows this young man?
You're a good boy.<eos> Your mother, she'd be proud of the man you're growing up to be.<eos> Give me another puff.<eos> Will ya?<eos> Ya know, now don't take offense.<eos> But the only thing worse than that mug of yours is your breath.<eos> Not my fingers, you animal!<eos> I was offering you the last hit.<eos> Well, fine.<eos> I'll bogart it myself then.
Okay, just an FYI, words like that make my eye twitch.<eos> Look, we're trying to articulate U.S. policy on a broad variety of topics, so the speech has been vetted...<eos> By various departments and agencies.<eos> I know.<eos> I...<eos> Not to mention, we have to factor in the positions of our allies to avoid offending them.<eos> And trying to fit that all in one speech is, like... super hard.<eos> Well put.<eos> Ma'am, this speech is in two days.<eos> We need to finalize it.
And he's one failed test away from flunking out.<eos> Ooh, but don't take my word for it.<eos> Hey, Turk.<eos> 70 yards passing, not bad!<eos> Oh, Chugga-Brew.<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> Uh, I'm busy, Turk.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> This vertex of the para-boola is driving me nuts.<eos> You're the only one who can explain it to me.
And Turk's.<eos> You needed it to save Mason.<eos> You're the one who killed Turk and Messner.<eos> Your original plan wasn't too bad.<eos> I mean, you heard the rumblings around school that Turk was looking for the Chem IV test answers.<eos> It's pretty easy, setting him up.<eos> This is you entering the school library at 1:16. That's the same day that Chet Messner was killed.<eos> And at 1:19, you logged on to a computer using Hannah Hunt's password.<eos> You logged on to VidTree, and you sent a message to Rob Turkla.<eos> Telling him where to find the cheat sheet, but Messner found it instead.
We've been trying to reach you.<eos> Where the hell were you?<eos> I waited at the drop site for an hour.<eos> Calm down, Mr. Creel.<eos> There's no need to panic.<eos> We're being cautious now that S.H.I.E.L.D. is a factor.<eos> Forget them.<eos> I got a real problem.<eos> That thing really messed me up.<eos> I turned to rubber when I touched it.
I'm not gonna throw my life away.<eos> I'm... sorry.<eos> The bathtub in Daycia's room was already full, so I thought, why not... why not just make it look like an accident?<eos> Make it look like she just... slipped away.<eos> I put her in the water.<eos> I got the piece of tubing from the fish tank, and I made it look like she drowned.<eos> Insane part of this whole thing is, I made it, you know that?<eos> I didn't drink.<eos> Even after she was dead and it was quiet in that room.<eos> I took that bottle, and I poured it in the toil... toilet.
But for me...<eos> So I need something to be good.<eos> I need a reason to get up every morning, to not crawl back to that cave that I was in before I met her.<eos> I mean, you know she saved me?<eos> You were there.<eos> You remember how I was.<eos> I was... dark.<eos> That war made me dark.<eos> And that darkness... it is still in me.<eos> She just lit it up.
Joe gravano,<eos> Local mob boss, wanted for 39 counts of murder, Racketeering, and drug smuggling.<eos> One of the most heavily protected men in starling city.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> What's "n.P.P.?"<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can definitely find out.<eos> Where are we with the cell phone from her apartment?<eos> Crazy pants encrypted the sim card.<eos> I can crack it, but it's going to take some time.
They describe him?<eos> Young, male, Caucasian.<eos> Wearing a backpack.<eos> Nothing more than that.<eos> Think they were staring at the knife and not his face.<eos> We do have a photograph of him fleeing one of the thefts, but... it is useless.<eos> Why?<eos> It was taken by a tourist near the Vietnam Memorial.<eos> Unfortunately, it only shows the back of his head.<eos> I'd get it to NCIS.
The results may surprise you it appears Lucie is not your daughter<eos> Whose daughter is she?<eos> Zacharie Gabaï's<eos> - Did you never suspect?<eos> - No<eos> But why would he kill them?<eos> There's a lot we still don't know<eos> Did you want to say something?<eos> When Lucie was little... a parcel arrived on her birthday<eos> When Sandrine saw where it came from... she threw it in the bin
I told you, it was stolen<eos> What do you know about the car?<eos> I lost my job two years ago<eos> I didn't need a car... and I couldn't afford the petrol anyway<eos> I advertised, but couldn't find a buyer<eos> So... I reported it and said it was stolen<eos> I got 600 Euros from the insurance<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> In the car park<eos> - I still use it sometimes
Move!<eos> I'm gonna make this simple:<eos> give us the acetate, or everyone dies.<eos> What acetate?<eos> Don't waste my time.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> It's very dangerous.<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> - Give it to us!
Midnite's men.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> That recording... it's got a demonic energy. It wants to be played.<eos> Once it gets in their heads, they won't be able to resist.<eos> - You bring my bag?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's in the back of the truck.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Bastards.<eos> They took it to a club, gave it a spin.
Ian, no.<eos> I won't let you do this.<eos> What?<eos> Cancer?<eos> Yeah, sure, 20 years ago I didn't have a shot.<eos> But they have better treatments today.<eos> And now I got a lot more to fight for.<eos> All right, rat boy, you're up.<eos> You're the one that brokered this deal.<eos> You're the only one who can break it.
I'd like to report a murder.<eos> Please!<eos> Stop! Don't!<eos> No!<eos> No...!<eos> He's killing her right now.<eos> He wants us to hear him do it.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Got a cell tower.<eos> Phone's pinging off it.
I've got all the last guy's caseload, plus new patients.<eos> There's almost no time for research.<eos> Yes, I've made friends.<eos> "What are their names," mom?<eos> My record for the Friday New York Times crossword Is 11 minutes... when I was 13.<eos> I'm still trying to beat that.<eos> Why do I need to make friends?<eos> I'm here to run a department.<eos> Okay, that sounds braggy.<eos> I just mean once I pick a puzzle up, I can't put it down until it's solved.
Ah... my office.<eos> Either that or, Martin, can your car fit two?<eos> Post-divorce, I had a rebound fling with a 16-stone lady trucker called Fat Pat.<eos> Romancing a woman of that size in the back of the flame-red Tigo could prove taxing.<eos> Getting her bra and truss off alone was a three-man job.<eos> Luckily she had a friend - Mick, her husband.<eos> Dark days!<eos> I'll probably just rent.<eos> Dad! About your car...<eos> Before you see it, can you just remember that I was really, really angry.
I apologize.<eos> It's a recent development.<eos> Abe sort of absconded with this ledger.<eos> Problem is, the customers are written in some sort of code.<eos> You're saying he stole it?<eos> "Borrowed."<eos> The antique weaponry game is a cutthroat business.<eos> But I'm sure I can crack the code, given enough time.<eos> If Devin Bentley's name is in here, that's all the evidence we need to arrest him.<eos> Yeah, until the court finds out that you obtained this evidence illegally, and they throw it out... Devin will walk.
Honey, it doesn't seem like the Griffins are leaving anytime too soon!<eos> Oh. Hey, Peter.<eos> Hey, Joe. What are all these pictures?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> They're just some stupid scribbles I've been working on for a children's book.<eos> I don't think that's stupid.<eos> I think that's awesome!<eos> I mean, my one note on these would be to hide a bunch of dongs in the backgrounds, but, otherwise, I think they're great!<eos> Wow. Well, that really means a lot to me, Peter.<eos> I've been working on this book for nine years, but I've been too afraid to show it to anybody.
And?<eos> Mrs. Wilcox, do you remember anything unusual about the night Tommy disappeared?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> Are you absolutely sure?<eos> There's nothing.<eos> Anything might help.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Toilet paper maybe.<eos> Sorry, ma'am?<eos> I went to the store to buy toilet paper and when I got back I couldn't find it.
Yeah, well, you got to go to Boston to get it...<eos> I know you can't feel, but you were shot in the chest.<eos> You need to get to a hospital.<eos> Bullet missed my lungs, went through.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> And you know too much about getting shot.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Slow down, tiger.<eos> Remember that black blob you saw floating out of the police station?<eos> Mara called it aether.

This television program is the comprehensive account of their relationship... From A to Z.<eos> Stu: I don't believe it.<eos> What?<eos> Is that tea?<eos> Yeah, Zelda got me into it.<eos> Oh! Did she?<eos> So, you're a tea drinker now, huh?<eos> Drinking tea?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> There was, but we fixed it with the Revolutionary War.
Zelda's song had already been listened to by 11 Wallflower employees, including Silent Arnold, who secretly ripped every song...<eos> Minus the Kate Hudson album.<eos> Silent Arnold shares his library with the entire office park, which is how it was heard by...<eos> Cool song, Zelda.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Hey.<eos> There's the rock star.<eos> Yes!<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Somebody must have yanked it from my computer...
Kind person.<eos> Get the hell out of my office.<eos> Okay.<eos> This traffic, huh?<eos> Like the Lakers are playing the Dodgers.<eos> I don't really feel like talking right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> My phone is linked up to my stereo, so...<eos> It says you played it 53 times?
Well, for starters, it turns out it is world pneumonia day.<eos> But we're also checking into any news events, births, deaths that occurred on that day.<eos> If it even is a date.<eos> 11, 12, 13 could be part of a number sequence.<eos> Yes, Castle, we're also looking into that, as well as anyone Garrett put away while he was in cyber.<eos> Detective Beckett?<eos> I was able to identify one of the images.<eos> It was cropped from this photo of a food blogger named Mary Fuchs.<eos> Where did you find that photo?<eos> She posted it on her Snappamatic feed a few days ago.
That's okay.<eos> Try again.<eos> Wow!<eos> I'm learning.<eos> And games are making it fun.<eos> What would you like to talk about?<eos> I'd rather just click your face.<eos> You are so funny!<eos> Man, this game is amazing.<eos> I don't know why anyone abandoned it.
Soos!<eos> We saw the whole thing, Soos.<eos> That was amazing! You talked to a real girl.<eos> - And you got a date!<eos> Ah! This is the best day of my life!<eos> You were in the zone, you made eye contact.<eos> It was like you'd done this a million times before!<eos> Don't you see? That game really worked!<eos> You don't need it anymore!<eos> - You can toss it out!
I could have you...<eos> That won't stick, and you know it.<eos> Hasn't this office been embarrassed enough?<eos> I didn't hear you deny it.<eos> I didn't come here to negotiate.<eos> I came to say good-bye.<eos> Who knows-- could be another 15 years until we see each other again.<eos> Take care, Erin.<eos> The tape.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
Oh.<eos> I have some ice for that at home.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hi, everybody.<eos> So, what you're about to see is a work in progress.<eos> Emphasis on the word progress.<eos> Which, uh, on my note card here is written in capital letters and underlined.<eos> I helped him come up with that.<eos> Okay, so a couple years back Addison introduced me to a little book called Moby Dick.<eos> I... I just, I loved it, and I wanted to see if there was a way we could bring its epic scale to a more intimate dimension with our bodies, and we're just now at a place where we're looking to get some feedback.
I guess there's somebody around here She's not ready to say goodbye to.<eos> He friended me!<eos> Okay, come on. We have something to show you.<eos> Is it dinner, or is my mouth too ugly to put food in?<eos> Okay, no.<eos> And please don't say things like that about yourself.<eos> You picked one?<eos> We sure did, and we're sorry we made you feel bad.<eos> We just weren't used to your new smile,<eos> But now we are, and we love it!
Ben: It's a hoodoo spiritual trap used in ritual.<eos> The iron in the nails attracts evil spirits, and the moss and the leaves grabs a hold of them.<eos> Yeah, but what about the white powder, and what's this?<eos> That's the talisman which marks the trap, and the powder creates a trail to lead the evil spirits to it.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> My grandmother practiced brujeria.<eos> Janice:<eos> Refers to Latin American witchcraft.<eos> Beth: It had been there a while untouched, and the house does have a history.<eos> So somebody could've left it there for protection.
- It's fru...<eos> It's frustrating.<eos> - So frustrating.<eos> Let me ask you something, guys, haveou er considered modeling?<eos> Now, that would be a great way to share your beauty with the world.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> - What?<eos> Winston, we're grown men with real jobs.<eos> Modeling is a real job and, trust me,<eos> - neither one of you could do it.
You're just gonna make them worry.<eos> I was thinking of doing a colonic interposition.<eos> I fix the kid in one surgery, he can go home sooner.<eos> No, using the native esophagus is better.<eos> It's a prolonged hospital stay, but...<eos> We could have him in a coma for weeks, maybe months.<eos> I mean, that'll put the parents through hell.<eos> Using the colon has increased risks of stricture, anastomotic leaks, GERD.<eos> I mean, it's not fun to watch your kid go through that, either.<eos> Are you gonna let me do my job, or are you gonna do it for me the whole time?
Thank you.<eos> And no, I will not hold a press conference.<eos> But the story's out there.<eos> And the usual anti-cop suspects are already making noise.<eos> Ask the mayor's staff to field it.<eos> They won't; you know that.<eos> Ask the manufacturer of the camera to stand up there.<eos> Oh, now you're just being...<eos> Did the camera malfunction?<eos> Did our officer turn it off?
He must've hit his head.<eos> To me, sounds like a clean arrest with an unfortunate outcome.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt him.<eos> He escalated the situation.<eos> I mean, you hit a cop, all bets are off.<eos> Sure would be nice if we had the rest of the incident on video.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I've been wearing that camera for almost three weeks.<eos> I've never had a problem before.<eos> And you didn't turn it off so you could tune up James Prince without an audience?
Yeah.<eos> Hannah had reached out to her.<eos> The dean asked me to collect physical evidence from the girl's dorm room.<eos> Wait.<eos> What evidence?<eos> Hannah still had the skirt she wore that night.<eos> It was torn up pretty good.<eos> Had what looked like bloodstains on it.<eos> Where's that skirt now?<eos> I delivered it to the dean's office.
Who she had only known for a few hours.<eos> That doesn't excuse what he did.<eos> Not in a million years.<eos> But in the end the only one who can keep you safe is you.<eos> You're not listening.<eos> I'm saying it's over.<eos> The manufacturer found a faulty sensor in Officer Taylor's body camera.<eos> I am listening, but how does that make it over?<eos> The camera malfunctioned.<eos> Taylor didn't turn it off.
Is there a problem?<eos> I still don't have anyone to go with me to the mayor's reception for the AG.<eos> That is a problem.<eos> You sure you won't reconsider?<eos> Who have you asked?<eos> A few people.<eos> Name two.<eos> How's your case going?<eos> My investigator just delivered Hannah's torn skirt from the night of the attack.<eos> The dean of students apologized for not turning it over right away.
You studied the mysteries of this town and wrote this book.<eos> Dude, you're the genius Dipper's been searching for all summer.<eos> Uh, genius?<eos> I'm no genius.<eos> I never done nothin' worthwhile in my life.<eos> Everyone knows I'm no good to nobody.<eos> I can't remember what I used to be, but I must've been a big failure to end up like this.<eos> But the laptop has your name on it.<eos> What about this book?<eos> Are you sure you didn't write it?
Ah. The bodies just disintegrate.<eos> I saw references to this weapon in HYDRA's lab.<eos> Yeah, sent from their demolitions expert,<eos> - uh, Toshiro...<eos> - Toshiro Mori.<eos> I've crossed paths with him before.<eos> He has a lab in Okinawa.<eos> Good.<eos> Then that's where you're going.<eos> We need to find the location of the next attack and stop it before it happens.
I've been better.<eos> It's one thing for your girlfriend to get you into a gallery show, another to get people to buy.<eos> Is that why you asked David to sell your pieces to Bridget Michaels?<eos> I'm sorry, who?<eos> - Will? - Problem was, in order to launder the money<eos> David could only sell Bridget pieces that she could resell later.<eos> David told you he was only going to sell to Bridget one more time, so you went to that poker game in order to convince him that his last sale should be one of your pieces.<eos> We even know which one.<eos> I bet that you used framer's glue to attach those crystals.<eos> You showed David this piece, he refused to take it, you lost your temper, and you took a swing.
- Let's walk before we can run, huh, pal?<eos> Hey, Winston, he's asking about bleach!<eos> Man, that is way too soon.<eos> - Warm-warm, warm-cold...<eos> - You got this, don't get flustered!<eos> Cold-cold, hot-cold, hot-hot?<eos> It's hot-hot!<eos> - It's always warm-cold.<eos> - Well, what's "permanent press"?<eos> - Fake button, nobody uses it.
Man, that is way too soon.<eos> - Warm-warm, warm-cold...<eos> - You got this, don't get flustered!<eos> Cold-cold, hot-cold, hot-hot?<eos> It's hot-hot!<eos> - It's always warm-cold.<eos> - Well, what's "permanent press"?<eos> - Fake button, nobody uses it.<eos> - Yeah, don't press that one.<eos> The machine is buzzing, you didn't close it!

The...<eos> Everybody here is a roofer.<eos> Look, the last time I saw you, I kissed you.<eos> I know that.<eos> We both know that.<eos> But this can't happen.<eos> Are we attracted to each other? Yes!<eos> Do I sing Oasis songs to myself, and pretend that they were inspired by your love for me?<eos> But my job is to enforce the rules.<eos> And I love my job, and I worked hard to get it.
Well, congratulations on having sisters, but I know women.<eos> You blindfold me, spin me around and drop me into a rainstorm, and I'll still find the G-spot.<eos> - Let us not forget that I had boobs for the first 19 years of my life.<eos> I grew up as a fat, asexual friend-zoner.<eos> You can't buy that kind of access.<eos> Schmidt, I'm talking about how women act towards other women.<eos> - You don't want to get in the middle of that.<eos> - Coach...<eos> Jess has the purse.<eos> I saw it in her closet when it was rainy and I was bored and I was feeling snoopy.
If she's worth it.<eos> I mean, when she comes in, she comes in and just goes,<eos> "Well, you've done that all wrong.<eos> "Been waiting six months for you to get that finished and it's wrong.<eos> "Do it again.<eos> I should have got somebody in to do it."<eos> LAUGHTER Anyway, the male puffer fish attracts his lady with a heart exhibition.<eos> Now, what do we call a fish that drives a tank?<eos> Tank fish.<eos> You might call it tank fish, but when I say "we", I mean WE.
So they only needed a minute to get through that wall.<eos> They attach a transmitter to catch a signal to open the gate, which is then sent to a cell phone.<eos> A transmitter is small.<eos> But a cell phone?<eos> Nothing that big could get in or out of my prison.<eos> Except convicts.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Hey, has this door been opened anytime over the last few days?<eos> Antonovich dropped a can of cleanser through the bars, and we opened it to let him get it.
If there's a bigger plan at play here, what is it?<eos> HAPPY: Hold on.<eos> Rewind that.<eos> Look at Percy's hands.<eos> He's messing with something behind his back.<eos> He took this number five from the price sign and stuck it next to the "X."<eos> And he pushed it all the way to the right from the middle of the rack.<eos> Why?<eos> Okay, the "X" is Roman for ten, plus five is 15.<eos> He wasn't pushing it right, he was pushing it east.
PT repeated.<eos> It's got to be initials.<eos> Peyton Temple.<eos> Peyton Temple was a name found on Reid's phone records.<eos> Well, if he wrote this, I'd like to ask him what he was using the equation to optimize.<eos> You... you'd like to ask him?<eos> This could be the killer.<eos> This could be anyone.<eos> How's your handle on Frame Invocation Theory?<eos> Because he used it in this equationC#, and it might be helpful to understand it fully.
The death of William's parents probably triggered a psychosis.<eos> Idolization of a dominant role model in the wake of tragedy could often blur the lines between right and wrong.<eos> Like Slenderman.<eos> Childhood imagination took precedence over social norms.<eos> I'll tell Hotch.<eos> I'll tell Garcia.<eos> Agent Morgan.<eos> Is this my fault?<eos> He looked up to you when there was no one else to look up to.<eos> I think he probably saw your obsession with the Mirror Man legend and just decided to bring it to life.
Yes, you did.<eos> You hit her and you killed her friend.<eos> Mom, she's telling the truth.<eos> No. Had she been paying attention, none of this would have happened.<eos> I had the right of way.<eos> The ground was wet.<eos> Mom, please-- Shut up!<eos> Whose side are you on?<eos> You ruined my life.<eos> Washed it into the gutter.
Ok.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> ♪ Gone forever, we don't know ♪<eos> ♪ like a prayer ♪<eos> ♪ the circle lost somehow along the way ♪<eos> ♪ why are you gone? ♪ ♪ Lost me ♪<eos> It's not that I don't want to be married.<eos> I just don't want to stay here.<eos> My job is here, David.<eos> And I'm not asking you to leave it.
Worst party ever, by the way.<eos> Uh, worse than being at a dance club That has a price club?<eos> Max Black in the house of grain.<eos> And now he saw me.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go hide before she sees me.<eos> I'll be in Tom's Shoes.<eos> Nobody's ever over there.<eos> I'm bustin' out some free range electronic dance music.<eos> That's right!<eos> I'm bringing it in my own bag.
That'll be $28.<eos> There's only $14 here.<eos> $28 for a salad?<eos> Well, that's dinosaur kale.<eos> Oh!<eos> Mistake.<eos> Didn't want the Dinosaur kale.<eos> Never liked dinosaurs and really don't like them in my kale.<eos> Dinosaur kale gone.<eos> You're just putting it on the counter?
He needs to take accountability.<eos> Moving on.<eos> (thumps coffeepot on table)<eos> So... nothing on Tina's cell phone? No. No threatening voice mails or text messages and every outside call came from a disposable.<eos> Well, Little G did say this nutjob preferred to scare her in public. Yeah.<eos> Stalking with a personal touch.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> He knows Jamie from the business card.<eos> Then he would have to touch it or put his hands on it to read the name, right?<eos> So if we get the card from the property clerk and we run it for prints...
Nah, I was at work until midnight.<eos> You can ask my employees.<eos> Yeah, they'll alibi for you.<eos> You're their boss.<eos> Yeah, and of course you're gonna try to railroad somebody 'cause you're the cop's brother.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard her call you Reagan.<eos> Same name that's on that card.<eos> So, you admit you saw it.<eos> Yeah, Tina showed it to me. So what?
We do have something in common here, Pop.<eos> We do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Our obituaries are gonna start the same way...<eos> Whoa, Dad!<eos> "Former New York City Police Commissioner."<eos> So? So?<eos> !<eos> For better or worse, it defines us.<eos> So, respect the office, even if you're not in it anymore.
You still at it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cars can be stubborn.<eos> That ain't the only thing.<eos> I've been thinking why you haven't fixed the car yet.<eos> What'd you come up with?<eos> Well, if the car doesn't work, Linda's gonna keep calling.<eos> Keeps her in your life.<eos> Once it's fixed, less reason to call. Ah. Not going to Linda.<eos> I'm selling it.
Wait.<eos> You met my mother?<eos> And your dear papa as well.<eos> A very regal couple.<eos> The fact they thought I wouldn't recognize royalty was charmingly naive of them.<eos> Honestly, I liked them.<eos> Sold them the star at cost, actually.<eos> The Wishing Star?<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> If they had it, they would've used it to take away Elsa's magic.
It's tiny!<eos> How am I supposed to feed eleven people with this pigeon!<eos> Hey dad.<eos> How is it coming?<eos> Great!<eos> Just some last-minute touches, and we're good to go.<eos> Great.<eos> Panic in Turkey Town.<eos> The back-up turkey is in Lily's book bag.<eos> Bring it to me.
There was gunshot residue on his right hand, his gun was found beside him, and he had a blood tox level of .23.<eos> Tell me, please, what is it about this that doesn't indicate suicide?<eos> In the tox report, Sara found a peak from the GC that was never analyzed.<eos> Got that tox report right here.<eos> What peak are we talking about?<eos> That one.<eos> That's minor.<eos> It has the same retention time as ibuprofen.<eos> That's why it wasn't analyzed.<eos> Could be, but you can't be sure unless you do a Mass Spec, so please, Doc, just pull the blood for me. Retest it.
- He's perfectly fine.<eos> Aren't you, archie?<eos> - [weakly] yeah.<eos> - Ma'am, given that he's a minor, I'm making the call to transport your son to the hospital.<eos> Now, you're welcome to ride with us if you like.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Can i have a word?<eos> - Sure. What's up, candidate?<eos> - I trained on sledge at the academy.<eos> You didn't have to yank it out of my hands.
OK. Copy<eos> Come on<eos> OK?<eos> Yeah<eos> Nothing to report<eos> Bugger all<eos> We've lost him.<eos> Shit<eos> Why didn't you take your car?<eos> Christine took it
Look.<eos> Color is consistent with Reed's uniform.<eos> I think we found our point of entry.<eos> Well, if we did, we didn't just stumble upon it.<eos> You don't just dump a body here by chance.<eos> Whoever did this knows the area.<eos> I wonder who owns the property.<eos> Let's find out.<eos> Here's the information on that property.<eos> Oliver financed it through the trust, purchased a year ago, recently rented to the moonshiner.
Thanks.<eos> I kind of have a headache now.<eos> Excuse me, spirit?<eos> Can I talk to... And you're gone.<eos> Just like all the other spirits.<eos> They're abandoning the city.<eos> So let me ask you about metalbending.<eos> Su tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it.<eos> I used to have an academy to train metalbending.<eos> Even blockheads like you can figure it out with the right instruction.
You ask me every time you throw my trust issues in my face.<eos> You did it this morning and you did it 20 years ago.<eos> I sat 10 years in jail alone.<eos> What were you proving then?<eos> Or did you not know that I was innocent?<eos> Of course I knew.<eos> Then where the hell were you?<eos> September 1st, 1993.<eos> That date is etched in my memory.<eos> I said it over and over, even after it passed and you were in prison.
Which else...?<eos> Oh, yes, Ted Sorensen was JFK's speech writer, who came up with perhaps his most famous phrase that he used in his inauguration.<eos> "Ask not what you can do for your..." No...<eos> "Ask not what your country can do for you..."<eos> Have a kebab.<eos> "..but what you can do for your country."<eos> Known as a chiasmus, exactly, and a fine example of one.<eos> And that was written by Sorensen.<eos> And Ronald Reagan said of his autobiography, do you know what he said?<eos> He looked forward to reading it.

Don't be ridiculous, dearie.<eos> When Belle and Henry wake up tomorrow morning in New York City, they won't remember a thing about tonight.<eos> I'll tell then the Snow Queen destroyed Storybrooke, whilst I saved everyone I could.<eos> I won't be a villain.<eos> I'll be a hero.<eos> _<eos> Stop.<eos> This must end, Ingrid.<eos> Our magic is a part of us now.<eos> We control it, and we control it really well.
When in Rome.<eos> Claudine Bouchard.<eos> Wanted for murder in Colombia.<eos> Suspected of killing heavily protected witnesses and five innocent bystanders.<eos> Collateral damage doesn't seem to be an issue with her.<eos> Witness was supposed to testify against the cartel.<eos> After that, Claudine left Colombia, flew to Amsterdam, then vanished.<eos> Well, now she's un-vanished.<eos> So this Claudine Bouchard... hires Drayer... to break into Bell's computer, steal some kind of information about Admiral Hume.<eos> Once she gets it...
Some of the subjects were quite traumatized and resentful.<eos> And... maybe vengeful?<eos> Some.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm gonna need those video files, along with the names of those subjects.<eos> I'm sorry, but that information falls under doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> Okay, Skinner.<eos> My simulated sun is shining.<eos> My blood is in the soil pack.<eos> Now let us see how these plants absorb it.
- She'll love it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hello.<eos> Madame?<eos> We have a lovely new collection of lingerie.<eos> It's over in intimate apparel.<eos> I'm not interested in lingerie today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If I may, our line is conservative with just a touch of naughty.<eos> We call it the Judi Fench collection.
I don't know if he owned the place, but I'm pretty sure he owned the box.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> My guess, halfway to Chicago Med.<eos> He was pretty banged up when they loaded him into the ambo.<eos> Hey, call dispatch, get a twenty on that ambulance.<eos> I want somebody with that guy when they roll into Chicago Med.<eos> So you didn't touch the box or its contents?<eos> No.<eos> Didn't open it?<eos> Pretty hard to do without touching it.
I take a spin class.<eos> I thought I could get some fresh air for a change.<eos> It's a gorgeous morning, isn't it?<eos> You know, I was only gonna go like another 3 miles, but I can stretch it out if you want to join.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I mean, uh, thank you.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just picked up a new audiobook.<eos> - Oprah recommended it.
Can't you see that?<eos> I mean, ugh!<eos> Why didn't anybody stop him?<eos> !<eos> All right, listen... call Hunt or any trauma surgeon that's on call.<eos> - On it.<eos> - Graham, move.<eos> Move!<eos> Your mother had a spinal-fluid leak.<eos> I was able to stop it without opening up her skull.
It's like working inside a beaver dam.<eos> Oh no, a next-to-desk-sit-down.<eos> Santiago, you're putting yourself under too much pressure.<eos> And that stress is making it even harder for you to quit.<eos> Some things might come easier to you if you stop being such a perfectionist.<eos> A concept you should become familiar with.<eos> "Familiar with?"<eos> Mm. A dangling preposition?<eos> I'm setting an example.<eos> I made an error and I'm not going to correct it.
Did anybody hear me screaming?<eos> There was a crazy amount of bugs flying at my face.<eos> Bobby, calm down.<eos> We caught the ghost.<eos> His name is Jeff.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> Everything is not fine, Lin.<eos> We have a horrible bug problem in there, and I'm sick of all this ghost stuff.<eos> Ghost stuff is over.<eos> Now we do the ceremonial throwing it away in the trash.
I found him on the ground.<eos> You should really be more careful.<eos> Great.<eos> Now he's got ground on him.<eos> Sorry the candle smells like lavender.<eos> Kind of changes the vibe a little bit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm feeling really relaxed all of a sudden.<eos> The door slammed shut!<eos> Well, somebody open it!
Anyway, ignore her.<eos> Everyone's on edge with the contagion spreading throughout town.<eos> But it only targets troubled people, Rebecca has a free pass.<eos> Well, the disease sets off troubles without needing any emotional prompting.<eos> Every troubled person could go off soon.<eos> So no one in Haven is safe.<eos> Over 15 people already have the first stage of the contagion.<eos> Pete's over at the morgue right now keeping an eye on them.<eos> Soon, all their troubles will be activated and any one of those could claim multiple lives.<eos> So it's a race, stop the contagion and find the troubled person causing it before all the troubles go off.
Oh, hey, and look!<eos> I also got this rock.<eos> Hey, Wirt, want to learn some rock facts?<eos> So, you want to go look for frogs with me like you said you would awhile ago and haven't done it yet?<eos> - Nah.<eos> Nah, I'm busy.<eos> - Is that bee named Sara?<eos> - W-What?<eos> - Your tape says "for Sara."<eos> Are you gonna give it to Sara the bee?
- That tape has got poetry and clarinet on it, Greg.<eos> Poetry and clarinet! Sara and Jason Funderberker are gonna start dating, and then they'll hear that tape, and then they'll just sit and listen to it and laugh and laugh - and laugh and laugh.<eos> - Why don't you ask Sara out first? - That way ...<eos> - No, no!<eos> Ugh!<eos> Why did you have to take the tape?<eos> - My life is crumbling all around me!<eos> - Okay, I think we should put our frog hunt on hold and go get that tape back.<eos> - Guys, where's the tape?<eos> - We put it in Sara's jacket for you.
Didn't it, Rudy?<eos> So you killed him and took the only thing that was worth something.<eos> Look, I wasn't the only one whose face Izzy was in that night.<eos> Did he happen to tell you where all this money was coming from?<eos> Ever since I've known him, Izzy claimed that his pops was the one who really wrote "6 A.M.," that Lionel Hubbard, jazz legend, cheated him out of a single.<eos> Can you imagine that?<eos> Killing someone literally for a song?<eos> It's not just a song.<eos> "6 A.M." changed everything.<eos> That track broke all the rules, changing keys and time signatures as if the person who wrote it had so much joy inside his heart he couldn't pick just one way to let it out.
Came back three days later.<eos> They had written me out of everything.<eos> Why didn't you fight it?<eos> Take Al to court.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> My son's dead.<eos> I never should have told him that story.<eos> Um... Where did you find that?<eos> In your son's car.<eos> You recognize it?
Bud Gray had a record deal, whole career ahead of him.<eos> Why would he kill a guy over royalties of one song?<eos> He didn't want his father, the great Lionel Hubbard, to go down in jazz history as a fraud.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> I thought you should have this.<eos> I don't care about the money.<eos> Whatever's on it has caused my family a lot of pain.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just...<eos> I thought you should know that he wrote it for you.
- Fucking pensioners<eos> They'll brag that they used to foster kids and can take care of Léo<eos> No one cares that they were a foster family<eos> This is about you and your ability to care for Léo<eos> These accusations of multiple partners - are they true?<eos> Of course not!<eos> This is rubbish.<eos> They're gunning for me<eos> They say it wasn't the first time you'd taken Sandrine's bank card<eos> I didn't take it.
- A pretty black girl of about 20<eos> Now that things have died down, maybe she'll come back<eos> - And the robbers?<eos> - No.<eos> We don't know them it's the third time they've raided cash points here it's often for small change<eos> They've taken about 30,000 Euros.<eos> Not much, considering the risks<eos> The hooded guy on fire...<eos> The picture isn't very clear but if you enlarge it...<eos> The judge has sent it to the lab.
- Please Mrs. Dewar.<eos> Mr. Hume, you reported the fictitious Randolph Sampson missing.<eos> Mr. Sampson is my employer, sir.<eos> He is away on business.<eos> I borrowed his office.<eos> And his good name.<eos> The torn pages from the novel led me to your bookshop, Mrs. Dewar, And you in turn led me to Ruby Rosevear and Annie Cranston, who furthered the myth of the Bearded Man.<eos> I was led to a series of clues including Blue Sky, and the photograph which featured you, Miss Cranston, and the mysterious Mr. Maxwell, which was in fact, you, Mr. Barnes, with a false beard.<eos> It wasn't false.<eos> - I grew it especially for the part.
I need to see you<eos> Now isn't a good time<eos> Come on, it won't take long<eos> Have I ever let you down?<eos> OK.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I knew we were mates<eos> What's this car?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Just help me shift it
I promise<eos> That kid means nothing to me if she dies, it'll be your fault<eos> This is all your fault<eos> You told me not to pay<eos> That's why we're in this mess<eos> Where's her bag?<eos> You want to help with her homework?<eos> Where is it?<eos> - In the van<eos> - Go and get it

Leave me.<eos> Leave France.<eos> You're listed here as a Catholic,<eos> - self-declared.<eos> - I am that.<eos> A believer good and true, I swore it.<eos> Then why are there witnesses, your brethren, who swear they've seen you attending Protestant services?<eos> It's not true; they're lying!<eos> The only liar here is you.<eos> The Bible says, "If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off.
What is it?<eos> It's Kitty.<eos> The police have indeed found Mr. Zupko.<eos> Oh, that's a good thing, isn't it?<eos> The good news is it looks like Zupko was our guy.<eos> We found all the maps that were taken from the library. Including the Bray map.<eos> It was the only one that was laid out.<eos> Zupko must have been standing here.<eos> Obviously, he was examining the map when he was killed.<eos> Or displaying it for a buyer.
You wanted to roll a one-day story into a fight.<eos> I didn't know you threatened to stab a teacher.<eos> The story was already out. Well, so?<eos> They didn't offer me any context.<eos> They just asked me if I would prosecute a woman for threatening to stab a teacher, and, yes, oddly enough,<eos> I said yes. I...<eos> I didn't know it was about you.<eos> Then correct it.<eos> - Correct what?<eos> - Tell the Correspondent that you know what I wrote was a joke, and that they were wrong to take it out of context.
Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock magic.<eos> Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for gadnuk's six move.<eos> Gadnuk, Breaker of worlds, plays a creature card.<eos> Jesus, paragon of fierce defiance.<eos> Now every red creature gadnuk plays will have a plus-one attack.<eos> Come on, Kenny.<eos> What did he play?<eos> - Did he tap all his mana? - Dude, he just cast psychogenic probe.<eos> Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.<eos> He just had to shuffle it. - Did you hear that?
My theory is that it was moved.<eos> In certain cultures, rebel factions will display corpses as a show of power.<eos> U.S. serviceman would offer the ultimate bragging right.<eos> Question is: where did they move it to?<eos> Hey.<eos> Been looking for you.<eos> Oh, just had to get some air.<eos> Heard we got a lead on the jacket.<eos> Barely.<eos> Len Bowers said he bought it from some rug importer named Hameed.
Where'd you get it?<eos> At the port.<eos> Here in New Orleans?<eos> In Karachi.<eos> I visit a few times a year to get rugs to sell.<eos> There is a boy, Sami-- he helps me load cargo.<eos> He was wearing the coat.<eos> Why'd you want it?<eos> There's a market for these things, and I'm a businessman.<eos> This boy, Sami-- where'd he get it?
It's a province about 100 klicks south of Daykundi, which is where the explosion occurred.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Navy LNO in Ghazni located the boy.<eos> They're patching him through right now.<eos> Agent Pride, Lieutenant Commander Blake Conner.<eos> We located the child wrangling odd jobs at the port.<eos> Hi, Sami.<eos> Wanted to ask you a few questions.<eos> Sami... do you remember this jacket?<eos> Can you tell me where you got it?
Gay Jim upstairs, and straight Jim across the hall who's only gay when he's drunk.<eos> "When is your space available?<eos> Always, sometimes, one time."<eos> Oh, just like our sex lives.<eos> Always for me, sometimes out of boredom, and one time for you.<eos> Earl, guess what Max and I did. I know what you didn't do.<eos> Clean this dessert carousel.<eos> There's a Napoleon in here since Napoleon.<eos> We rented our apartment on Airbnb.<eos> You rented to Arabs? Well, good luck getting it back.
- So does it then say, "Are you sure?" - On the third screen... - Are you sure?<eos> Come on now.<eos> - In 15 seconds...<eos> Have you seen the word "die"?<eos> ..you will be given a lethal injection.<eos> Press yes to proceed.<eos> - It's that simple.<eos> - That's heavy, man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> SANDI: And where do you get it, Amazon?
- is obviously illegal.<eos> - It is frowned upon.<eos> Dealt with by magistrates.<eos> - If I had to lose a liver, I mean, sorry, not a liver...<eos> - A kidney.<eos> - A kidney, yeah.<eos> - Don't lose your liver.<eos> How many livers have you got?<eos> A liver transplant, maybe.<eos> I might give my old liver to someone and say, "By all means fry it up with some onions if you want to."
Oh, sorry.<eos> Did you read Terry's book about us? No.<eos> He said not to read it.<eos> Okay, fine, I read it.<eos> My character, Cricket, is such a pushover.<eos> She just lets all the forest folk take her magic moose wishes.<eos> Well, June Bug is a stone-cold bitch.<eos> She told all the baby platy-pups they had weird feet.<eos> Is that how people see us?<eos> Well, you did just steal that danish out of my hand and start eating it.
We're not friends anymore.<eos> "Friends?"<eos> I don't care if you're friends.<eos> This is not a playdate.<eos> This is your commanding officer ordering you to do your job.<eos> Fine, but I hope you can live with the fact that you're forcing people to spend time together who would rather not.<eos> I'm fine with that.<eos> Sarge, I need to talk to you about the kid's book.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I'm wrapping it right now, and I need to focus.
And if we see him close up, you might notice...<eos> He's Tom Cruise.<eos> It's quite hard to see, but the front two, the left one is curled inwards a bit, but the right one is straight up, are actually penis legs.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What?<eos> He has eight legs like any spider, but the front two are penises and are charged with his seed.<eos> I've got a couple of them down under here.<eos> The old penis leg there.<eos> They're called pedipalps.<eos> And the thing he does, in order to get a better chance of shagging that enormous female, is he actually spins some silk and ties it round one of his penis legs and pulls, so that it basically pulls it off.
Doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would Flynn replace his own gun with a toy?<eos> As you know, it's not uncommon for opioid addicts to spend thousands of dollars a week on pills.<eos> Or, roughly, the entire weekly salary of an NYPD patrolman.<eos> Flynn sold everything he had to fuel his addiction.<eos> His wife's jewelry, his TV, his computer...<eos> We believe that, finally, he reached the point where his only possession of any value was his service pistol.<eos> So he sells his Glock, then he gets clean.<eos> He's called back to full duty, but he doesn't have a sidearm anymore, or the money to buy one.<eos> So he buys a replica to make it look like he's armed and prays he's not gonna have to use it?
- There you go.<eos> I am cutting off my legs this evening.<eos> Oh! Oh, goodness me.<eos> But the point is, the brain has a mental map of the body from birth and even if that map is distorted by an amputation, it takes a lot for the brain to lose its sense of where everything is.<eos> It can be fooled, as the rubber hand showed you.<eos> I remember once being in bed with my girlfriend and doing that thing where I fell asleep on my arm.<eos> And of course your arm goes numb.<eos> And I rolled then over onto my back and my arm fell across my stomach.<eos> But because it was numb, I actually thought it was her arm on my stomach.<eos> And I actually started stroking it.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Now, before we even begin with the first question, one of your buzzers has been investigated by the FBI.<eos> Let's listen to all of them and see if you can get some early points by guessing which one.<eos> Jimmy goes... ♪ Lola, la-la-la-la, Lola... ♪<eos> Ronni goes...<eos> # Lay, lady, lay ♪ Lay across my big brass bed... ♪<eos> David goes...<eos> # Louie Louie, oh, no ♪ Gotta go Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi... ♪<eos> And Alan goes... ♪ Little Willy really won't go home... ♪<eos> So, we've got Little Willy really won't go home.<eos> Your song, do you recognise it?
- Look at that!<eos> - Look at your bullshit lava lamp.<eos> - Mine has dried.<eos> Ours is so brilliant.<eos> Look at that!<eos> - Your lava lamp is... - Hey!<eos> - Give...<eos> Steal another one of the...<eos> - RONNI: - It's happening. It's all happening in our corner.<eos> - I can feed it.
I mean, think of Oedipus and...<eos> - RONNI: - They don't listen.<eos> Well, sometimes, the Oracle is quite enigmatic and difficult.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But if he said, "Don't go to Ios..."<eos> - That's really straightforward.<eos> - ..and he goes, you know...<eos> Anyway, Homer went to Ios and he encountered a group of fisher boys.<eos> He asked them what they'd caught and they gave him this riddle.<eos> And I'll repeat it again. "All that we caught, we left behind, "and carry away all that we did not catch."
Have they not done it now...?<eos> You get these Ironmen that do these swims.<eos> Someone must've done it.<eos> But some of the prisoners who did escape were never found, so...<eos> It was assumed, I think, to keep the reputation.<eos> - Assumed dead, but they may have escaped.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It probably suited everyone.<eos> Yeah, because they didn't want the myth of Alcatraz to die.<eos> Who was the first person to put stuff between two slices of bread and eat it? ♪ Lay, lady, lay... ♪ Lord Sandwich.
You must get this everywhere you go, you're going to get it everywhere.<eos> I've gotten used to it, you know.<eos> It'll take a couple of minutes for the navi computer to calculate the coordinates.<eos> Yes. No, that's exactly it.<eos> That wasn't even my line and I get...<eos> We all started saying those things.<eos> You started to say it, that's right.<eos> For the jump into hyperspace.<eos> And it goes... MAKES CHEWBACCA NOISE I remember you with Harrison Ford where he said he had a problem with the dialogue.<eos> - He said, "You can write this stuff, but you can't say it."

Now, you got a good thing going with Victoria... don't ruin it.<eos> Yeah, but I don't want to lose her, Mike.<eos> You're not gonna lose her.<eos> Look, relationships, they got ebbs and flows.<eos> Like me and Molly, okay?<eos> Whenever I feel like maybe she's a little bit sick of me, I make an effort.<eos> I unload the dishwasher a couple times, we're right back on track.<eos> All right, I hope you're right.<eos> No, I am right.<eos> And if you do do the dishwasher thing, make sure they're clean before you unload it.
After watching the news, I realized I was wrong.<eos> I'm reflecting right now.<eos> Is it your mother?<eos> Yeah. She's acting cool about it, but I think she's really upset.<eos> Now I feel bad.<eos> I told you. I'm going to continue to make you feel bad.<eos> I'm really upset right now.<eos> Director.<eos> Is this your earring?<eos> Where did you find it?
Are you cold?<eos> Do you want me to put the roof back on?<eos> N...no.<eos> Spring is so nice.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> Who's going to be at the villa?<eos> Ah, a senior I'm close with and a younger friend I know.<eos> Ah, it'll be nice and cozy.<eos> You said we're having a barbecue party, right?<eos> I'm really looking forward to it.
Hey, punk! Did I curse at you or something? All I said was that she was pretty!<eos> You're..<eos> What's with you guys?<eos> Is there something going on?<eos> So are you positive it's Jeong Seon Saeng? I'm asking if you confirmed it.<eos> Why didn't you tell me earlier?<eos> There's no tangible evidence, although we have reasons to think that.<eos> Even if we tell him we saw, I'm sure he's going to insist he didn't.<eos> The sample has either been hidden or given to another cosmetics company.<eos> I borrowed a camera from a friend and already set it up.
Excuse me?<eos> No, not, not...<eos> Jesus.<eos> Not for us, for you.<eos> In case you don't have friends in the city.<eos> I don't have friends in the city and I don't have a cell phone.<eos> And then my I.D. and my credit cards were in that purse, so I am screwed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Want to go try and find your purse?<eos> What, like the person who took it is just gonna put it back?
We just don't, uh, march as much as we used to.<eos> - Jazz.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You listen?<eos> - I like it.<eos> I like jazz.<eos> I-I don't know it.<eos> - I know "My Funny Valentine."<eos> - A classic.<eos> I actually did it one year at summer camp.
There'd be nothing left to you.<eos> So maybe you just don't understand who the fuck I am.<eos> John. Easy?<eos> Don't "easy," Frank.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Fucking flipperhead.<eos> See, I hate you fucking Russians.<eos> You're all crazy and you're arrogant.<eos> Now, the Irish, we came here for a piece of the American dream.<eos> You people come over here to steal it, so fuck all of you.
Put the safety doors on manual override.<eos> I cannot do that!<eos> Keep the doors open.<eos> My wife is still in there!<eos> Come on... let's go!<eos> Takashi, tell me this door's on manual.<eos> Manual, yeah.<eos> But Joe, we are starting to breach!<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Soon as they're through, I'll seal it.
No, no, yeah, but I want this car.<eos> Okay?<eos> I want this car.<eos> This one we're sitting in.<eos> - Oh, the floor model?<eos> - Yes, it's your favorite, right?<eos> - You want...<eos> - It's special.<eos> You understand?<eos> - Can I have it?
Before the slips of Erebor.<eos> Keep the map and key safe.<eos> Do not enter that mountain without me.<eos> This is not the Greenwood of old.<eos> The very air of the forest is heavy, with illusion.<eos> It'll seek to enter your mind, and lead you a strait<eos> - Lead us a strait?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You must stay on the path, do not leave it.<eos> If you do, you'll never find it again.
And that night it was the site of a heroic quest.<eos> The aim?<eos> To conquer The Golden Mile.<eos> Twelve pubs along a legendary path of alcoholic indulgence.<eos> There was The First Post, The Old Familiar,<eos> The Famous Cock, The Cross Hands, The Good Companions,<eos> The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive,<eos> The King's Head, The Hole in the Wall... All before reaching our destiny, The World's End.<eos> We took my car into town.<eos> I called it The Beast because she was pretty hairy.
Are we there yet?<eos> Let's do this!<eos> Soup Dragons!<eos> I remember this one.<eos> I put this on a tape for you, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, this is it.<eos> This is the tape?<eos> Yeah, yeah!<eos> Look, look.<eos> Where did you find it?
- Oh, hi, Bob.<eos> - Hi, Rose.<eos> And now, ladies and gentlemen, the star of the show... the man who's famous throughout the world... for his candelabra... and his piano...<eos> Mr. Showmanship...<eos> Liberace! Hey! Now, this next part of the boogie woogie is so strange, it really calls for an explanation.<eos> It's called a boogie woogie break.<eos> When I'm playing it and I stop at a certain point... you're going to think I've forgotten the music.<eos> But I didn't forget the music.<eos> There's just no music written for that part.<eos> That's why they call it a break. Hey! Oh, this is fun.
And it burns like a... bullshit.<eos> And Beverly's disappeared and you're yelling at me.<eos> I'm not..<eos> You know, you couldn't come home when I got cancer.<eos> Beverlys disappeared.. you rushed right back.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know where I think he is?<eos> I think he..<eos> I think he got some whiskey, a carton of cigarettes, and a couple of good spy novels...and..<eos> I think he got out on the boat. and steered it to a nice spot, close to shore like he likes em.
I don't know.<eos> How about number 48?<eos> Can you make out what that says?<eos> Yes, it looks like "earring".<eos> Any idea what earring that might refer to?<eos> I believe that was a CZ stud.. Belonging to Lacey Stubbs, which we found in the Cole residence.<eos> If i remember correctly, there was blood on it.<eos> Rusty Berkhart has a pierced ear, also.<eos> Is it possible that the earring might have belonged to him?<eos> I questioned him about it, and he stated that he had given it to Miss Stubbs.
Run!<eos> Hold fast!<eos> Hold fast to the rope!<eos> That's it!<eos> More trees!<eos> Do this together!<eos> Burn them all!<eos> Take their place!<eos> Stay on the ropes!<eos> Victory, I can almost taste it.
It's only been on the market a couple of months.<eos> I'm gonna track the owners down and see if they know anything.<eos> You got any new info on that corpse we found at the priest's basement?<eos> No DNA, dental or fingerprint matches.<eos> Nothing?<eos> The priest is sticking to the story too. Alright.<eos> Same person who took him took those girls.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> I'm wearing out the tape I guess.<eos> I watch it everyday after breakfast, it's the only video I have of him.
-And raring.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Sir, the torpedo just armed itself.<eos> The warhead's gonna detonate in 30 seconds, sir!<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> I can't get my arm out!<eos> Target their signal. Beam them back right now.<eos> The transporter cannot differentiate between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.<eos> We cannot beam back one without the other.<eos> Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it?
Evasive maneuvers!<eos> Get us to Earth! Right now!<eos> Captain!<eos> Stop!<eos> Everybody on this ship is going to die if you don't let me speak to him.<eos> Uhura, hail him.<eos> Sir. It's me. It's Carol.<eos> What are you doing on that ship?<eos> I heard what you said.<eos> That you made a mistake and now you're doing everything you can to fix it.
- Wants to do it his own way, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You can take him home.<eos> - All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> As you can see, Mr. Cassidy, the last two procedures were not covered by insurance.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have extended coverage.<eos> You did.<eos> Wyatt Corp terminated it.
Look, you'll get better and better...<eos> I'm as scary as you!<eos> I'm as scary as anyone!<eos> - I just wanted to help.<eos> - No. You just wanted to help yourself.<eos> Well, what was I supposed to do? Let the whole team fail because you don't have it?<eos> So your calculations were a little off.<eos> That door took me all semester.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> The professor's just going to shred it.
(Ben) That's my family, goddammit.<eos> You threaten my family, I will end you, mother fucker, you hear me?<eos> Put that fucking bow down.<eos> I can't hold it much longer.<eos> You wanna play?<eos> You want your war, goddammit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. We can play.<eos> You want your war?<eos> Come and get it.
The things I wonder about, she won't.<eos> It's been half a century since the scavengers destroyed our moon.<eos> Forced to leave their own dying planet, they came to take ours.<eos> Without the moon, the Earth was thrown into chaos.<eos> Earthquakes toppled cities within hours. Tsunamis wiped out what remained.<eos> Then came the invasion.<eos> We did what we had to do.<eos> We used the nukes.<eos> We won the war, but lost the planet.<eos> Left it contaminated. Most of it uninhabitable.
"We've got to throw the long ball."<eos> It took us decades just to crack the GPS codes.<eos> That's how you brought down the Odyssey.<eos> Why?<eos> The Odyssey's compact reactor, courtesy of NASA.<eos> Very hard to come by.<eos> Did you like the show last night?<eos> That was just one fuel cell.<eos> Imagine what 10 of them will do, with a core of weapons-grade plutonium.<eos> We have a nuke, and we have a drone to carry it.
Targets look good. Initiating burn in 3,2,1... Ignition.<eos> We see a good burn.<eos> Are you reading any output from the object?<eos> Negative. Zero heat. No EMR.<eos> How is the rest of the crew doing?<eos> Co-pilot Victoria Olsen should be up here shortly.<eos> The rest of the crew remains in delta sleep.<eos> Copy that. You missed a hell of a game last night.<eos> What did I tell you guys? No spoilers about last night's game.<eos> I'm looking forward to watching it when I get back.
Show-off.<eos> Lo, the adventure begins!<eos> Please report for quest assignments.<eos> Step forward when your group is called.<eos> Heed this reminder.<eos> All guilds must complete their quest prior to tomorrow's battle at Evermore.<eos> Also, Ryan the Necromancer beseeches thy help in finding his inhaler.<eos> Oh. His inhaler of doom!<eos> And to the owner of the sperm-white Toyota Tercel, thy chariot is blocking the witches' coven.<eos> Move it or you'll be faced with a hex of great dark magic. And you'll be towed.
You made that up.<eos> This is the "Sigillum Aemeth." It is the only one of its kind.<eos> It was handwritten in the 16th Century by the mystic John Dee and it has been lost for generations.<eos> Uh, bullshit.<eos> It came from the internets, not the 16th Century.<eos> If you're tying to get out of admitting how awesome I am...<eos> John Dee was tying to summon angels, but evil travels under its own power and he actually summoned demons and the demons forged this book.<eos> - What are you saying, Kwok?<eos> - Dee tried to destroy, but he couldn't.<eos> So he sealed it and he hid it deep underneath his manor estate and it has been lost for generations.
Plus, someone has to stay behind to keep the peace.<eos> You going boating?<eos> I'm undercover.<eos> Sure, Ray.<eos> You blend right in.<eos> See you Sunday.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> What about your car?<eos> It's parked in a fire zone.<eos> Well, if there's a fire, go ahead and move it.
Sheriff.<eos> Keep it.<eos> You earned it.<eos> Thanks, Ray.<eos> Jerry would want you to have it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Ray?<eos> Ray!<eos> What in God's name happened to my car?<eos> Well, next time don't park it in the fire zone.
Team extraction completed. She's all yours.<eos> Good.<eos> Are you inside?<eos> Yes, yes, Viktor.<eos> I'm inside.<eos> Yuri?<eos> You surprised?<eos> I'm in the same place where it all started... before you betrayed me.<eos> Remember... you promised to give me my life back.<eos> You gave it back to me.
And what have I been telling you all night?<eos> The closer you look...<eos> The less you see.<eos> Now look into my eyes.<eos> And sleep.<eos> Okay.<eos> And...<eos> If you can get this bill from me, you can have it.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Take it. Get it.
Sometimes in the mornings I sit on a bench there.<eos> And I watch the people make a wish and lock it in a lock on the bridge. Then throw the key into the Seine.<eos> All day they do this.<eos> Mothers, lovers, old men.<eos> Watching the key sink into the water and their secret is locked away forever.<eos> Real and, at the same time, magical.<eos> So, do you really think it's possible there's a fifth Horseman?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There is a legend of a secret order born in ancient Egypt called "The Eye."<eos> It is said they perfected sleight of hand to steal food from the Pharaohs and give it to the slaves.
Dive now!<eos> Ballistic!<eos> He kicked Aston Martins out there!<eos> - Dusterino!<eos> - He's ready.<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - Oh, that's cool.<eos> The piston and cross-wrenches.<eos> Your squadron insignia.<eos> - You've earned it. - It fits you.
Like 20, 25 miles an hour or something.<eos> - And you just jumped out of the car?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> It was snowing so I didn't think it would hurt. But it did.<eos> That's amazing. That's awesome.<eos> You're such a good listener.<eos> - No...<eos> - Um, all right, you go.<eos> Um, I remember, um, I think it was sophomore year. You came to gym class and you were wearing the mascot head and you refused to take it off.
His beautiful possibilities completely ignored.<eos> And still bitching about Darwin.<eos> Still.<eos> So much for the scientists.<eos> And now they've succeeded in contaminating their own fucking blood.<eos> Yeah, well If we're gonna have a litany in all the zombie atrocities in history we would be here until the sun comes up.<eos> The sun is coming up.<eos> Should I tell you again about the 'Spooky action at a distance'?<eos> Einstein's theory of entanglement.<eos> I love the way you tell it.
Or check them out from afar.<eos> I've had a beer before.<eos> And I've spent a night in jail before.<eos> But there's a limit to everything.<eos> Who's your friend?<eos> Peter.<eos> Nice eye patch.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You don't sound too cool with it.<eos> My mom makes me wear it.
- Did it sting?<eos> Papa stings, huh?<eos> Right now!<eos> Look, Papa!<eos> Look!<eos> Blow the candle out!<eos> Daddy's just not properly awake yet.<eos> Hmm? Really.<eos> He hasn't looked at the boat yet.<eos> He'll look at it properly in a minute.
Not this guy.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - The sacristy!<eos> The back door.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> Come here.<eos> We're heading towards danger, not away from it.
Or anything.<eos> Just go with it.<eos> Step two is don't go bowling if for some reason you get the itch.<eos> I can't believe we're leaving those horrid things... hovering around those sweet girls.<eos> They won't hurt em.<eos> They just want to smell em before they die.<eos> God.<eos> Look, Stormy, there's nothing I can do about bodachs, okay?<eos> And right now I wouldn't even if I could.<eos> I need em to help me see the danger coming so I can maybe prevent it.
I want to eat it all up. I want to discover myself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want that for you too.<eos> How can I help?<eos> You already have.<eos> You helped me discover my ability to want.<eos> Hey, do you want to go on a Sunday adventure with me?<eos> Yes, I would love to.<eos> You like this song?<eos> I heard it the other day. I can't stop listening to it.
Screw that.<eos> Nelson loves traveling.<eos> He loves it.<eos> We've lived in Indonesia, we built a water purification system in Myanmar.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So, you're just this single dad, traveling the world with his kid, doing good?<eos> When you put it like that it just sounds so appealing.<eos> But I have that on a T-shirt actually,<eos> "Single dad, traveling the world with his kid, doing good."<eos> You could borrow it someday if you'd like.
I have Nelson.<eos> - You do?<eos> - He's fine.<eos> - He is?<eos> - Yes, he's fine.<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> Nelson, you know how much I love this statue, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You rode a horse three days through.<eos> Outer Mongolia in the pouring rain, living off of mare's milk to bring it back.
- He's fine.<eos> - He is?<eos> - Yes, he's fine.<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> Nelson, you know how much I love this statue, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You rode a horse three days through.<eos> Outer Mongolia in the pouring rain, living off of mare's milk to bring it back.<eos> That's right.<eos> And I've dragged it place to place, across the world, ever since I was 22.
- Oh, he's a columnist at the times.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Well, I'd love to get a copy of the book.<eos> Ohh. Really?<eos> - Yeah. Sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh... - Want to sign it for me?
- It's... not a chemical cocktail.<eos> It's kind of a... a... whiteout.<eos> That deletes all the chemical influences in a second.<eos> And the truth... comes right out.<eos> And where is it?<eos> It's like the cyanide capsules the Nazis had, in case of surrender.<eos> When I left the old world I took one.<eos> It was my compensation from Miramount-Nagasaki that's what I asked them for after 20 years of work.<eos> This little capsule.<eos> I want it.

That's more likely.<eos> This is all I have left.<eos> Robin, if you take it, you're leaving, you're leaving me.
That's it.<eos> I'll leave you to make your own arrangements.<eos> - You okay, buddy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks, Harris.<eos> - Yeah, it's gotta be pretty rough on you.<eos> - Yeah, I guess it is.<eos> - I, uh, got you this book.<eos> James told us about your problems.<eos> You need to read it pronto though;
- Exactly.<eos> It's impossible that one judge in California can make it all disappear.<eos> It's out now.<eos> Well, remember what Solzhenitsyn said.<eos> "No one can bar the road to truth."<eos> And Solzhenitsyn didn't even have Twitter.<eos> I mean, whoever thought that we'd need extra servers... to fight censorship attacks from the bastion of free speech.<eos> I sent leaks to our mirror sites.<eos> You should...<eos> Having fun making history instead of reading about it?
We're going to have to push back publication.<eos> There's no way we can release in four days.<eos> Fourteen pages in The Guardian, twelve in The New York Times.<eos> This is more coverage than all the leaks we have had, combined.<eos> We are winning an information war... which goes beyond any short-term alliance we have with the mainstream media... and you want to throw it all away because you fear... that some U.S. Government informant might come to harm?<eos> These are human beings, Julian, and their lives are at stake.<eos> What about the lives of the soldiers... and the civilians involved in these conflicts?<eos> Death squads, unreported civilian casualties, countless incidents of friendly fire.<eos> This is information the world needs to know.<eos> So, the next time you find yourself lecturing me about this organization... please try to remember why I created it.
Water tablets are on ration since yesterday, so you'll have to wait till Friday to have a wash.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Only one rule in here.<eos> Don't touch any of Nick's stuff, okay?<eos> He will come home.<eos> So.<eos> -Water tablets?<eos> My dear child, where have you been?<eos> The terrorists contaminated the water supply.<eos> We have to clean it before we go near it.
Way you riled him up, I'm surprised he got to sleep at all.<eos> I came in here earlier tonight thinking that your brother was running his own show, thinking he was the man I needed to talk to if I was gonna have any peace.<eos> But it turns out that he's a true believer. But you...<eos> Why, you're the brains.<eos> What's that? What's it look like?<eos> Like the 30 pieces of silver the high priest Caiaphas gave to Judas Iscariot.<eos> Well, think of it as a donation from a concerned parishioner who'd like to see your brother shift focus away from me and mine.<eos> I'm afraid you've misjudged me, Mr Crowder.<eos> I would never tell my brother how to spread the good word.<eos> How about where to spread it?
36 during the day and 27 at night, excluding the night of the accident.<eos> - 1-4-4.<eos> - 1-4-4?<eos> The telephone number for the ambulance.<eos> The villa is free now.<eos> If you're interested, I'll get you a good deal.<eos> - Who owns it?<eos> - Me.<eos> But I don't know what to do with it.<eos> I often rent it out to cinema people.
I was raping Frank Herbert, raping, like this!<eos> But with love, with love.<eos> And then I came with that.<eos> It was such a beautiful object.<eos> So well done and at the time, there were no photocopies.<eos> It was just photos of each drawing. In color so well done with so much detail about the costumes, about the techniques used.<eos> Every studio have one book like this. Every studio.<eos> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, everything, all them Michel Seydoux give a book like that.<eos> This approach was chosen precisely because I was thinking they might have a certain distrust of Jodorowsky.<eos> But since we were showing the camera angles, since we explained each scene the way we wanted to film it they should have been relieved.
Huh? Or do you want to look at your little nuts in the mirror and see if you got any peach fuzz?<eos> AII right, good.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> You like it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, I Iove the sexy casa!<eos> You guys like that?<eos> You like that fine Russian pussy?<eos> That was mine.<eos> I gave it to him. Like nothing.
Now I'm the criminal here?<eos> It's a secret stash.<eos> You're telling me you don't have a secret stash?<eos> You're a very difficult victim, Victor.<eos> It's Money Management 101.<eos> Get a chopper, ASAP.<eos> My name is Victor Kershaw.<eos> I'm looking to close my account.<eos> And what would you Iike to do about the safety deposit box?<eos> well, I'm really in a rush, but I may as well open it while I'm here, right?
Solid work.<eos> Excellent illustrations of the lake formation process.<eos> T.S... C+.<eos> Report shows undeniable qualities, but as usual, is way off subject.<eos> What does the formation of lakes in Montana have anything to do with the east-west migratory pattern of Canadian Geese.<eos> Sir, I'm not sure if you read the introduction... But I<eos> You think you're the smarter than everyone else, don't you?<eos> As for the diagram, its very pretty but scientifically erroneous.<eos> Really, Sir?<eos> Bacause I sent it to the Discover Magazine and... they like it, and they publish it.
I only have needles that let in draft<eos> But my answer is...<eos> Yes.<eos> Overjoyed, the sparrow took refuge there and you know what?<eos> He survived the winter.<eos> The children returned and wept tears of joy.<eos> Upon seeing this, the Creator decided to punish all the other trees for their selfishness.<eos> From that day on, every tree lost it's leaves in winter, except the pine, who saved the sparrow.<eos> My grandmother told me this story.<eos> Had you ever heard it before?
Pants-down, botty-whackers, eh?<eos> Only on weekends.<eos> You still know fuck all about my country, eh, you little Pommy ponce?<eos> There once was an Australian stockman, lying, dying.<eos> And he got up on one elbow and he turned to his mates who had all gathered around and he said...<eos> Fuck me.<eos> You mad little British bastard. Well, you know...<eos> Where do you know that song from?<eos> My mother had the record. - Oh.<eos> - We'd listen to it endlessly as kids.
And finally, I'm sure you've all noticed the fabulous chandelier you'll be delivering.<eos> What?<eos> Where?<eos> Up there.<eos> Nice.<eos> It's extremely delicate, so if one of you breaks it, you're paying for it!
Well, you're not saving me.<eos> Not this time.<eos> I don't have time for this shazbot.<eos> You're getting heroed, whether you like it or...<eos> If you're done saving me from the fire monster from the sun, I'll be on my way.<eos> _ I guess some grown men just don't like being carried.<eos> Thank you, Bender.<eos> You brought me right to the lava pit.<eos> And another thing.<eos> If someone gives you a nice medal, you should be responsible enough to care for it.
...pause?<eos> !<eos> Man, those executives are crazy.<eos> Calculon's the greatest actor ever!<eos> Thank you, Bender.<eos> I appreciate your honesty. They're showing Calculon's star on the Walk of Fame!<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> I'll always have that.<eos> Calculon was truly the has-been's has-been.<eos> And so I am proud to tear up his star and replace it with a second star for the fabulous Robert Wagner.
Now I have to become a squid, too? !<eos> Aw, Sweetie, tentacles are beautiful.<eos> I mean, look at your Mother here.<eos> She's so gorgeous, you hardly even notice the tentacles.<eos> And if you're worried, you can always move down here with us.<eos> In the sewer, you'll fit right in.<eos> Sewer mail!<eos> He's single.<eos> I don't care if that operation will only delay the tentacles.<eos> Somehow, we got to find a way to pay for it.
That's a hell of a slow ship. I know I've heard that melody before.<eos> I just can't remember where.<eos> Hmm. Perhaps we can narrow it down by seeing what part of Fry's brain becomes active when he hears it.<eos> Interesting.<eos> I can isolate those tones to a memory Fry formed on December 31, 1999.<eos> That's the day I fell in the freezer tube.<eos> I, too, was on Earth that day, on my mission to ensure Fry's successful transport to the future.<eos> But I recall no such music.<eos> I always forget that he can talk.<eos> Well, that must be when I heard it.
It's not working out, Fry.<eos> I put your stuff out on the sidewalk! Hey, you hussy!<eos> You can't dump Fry!<eos> That's my job!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Only two minutes until midnight!<eos> That music!<eos> That horrible, agonizing music!<eos> - Is that the tune, Fry? - No.<eos> Then stop dreaming it!
Come on, jump!<eos> - Bull's-eye!<eos> - Holy smurf!<eos> - Good one, Smurfette!<eos> - Blend that, candy man!<eos> Vexy, let's go!<eos> Hold on!<eos> Look out!<eos> Nice move, stealing a cart.<eos> I didn't exactly steal it.
He was surrounded by lights, then he was gone.<eos> Tell me...<eos> Tell me we can still patch the fuel line.<eos> Andrei?<eos> Say something.<eos> - Andrei?<eos> - We can't.<eos> There's one thing still worth trying.<eos> The communication array is still salvageable.<eos> I can fix it if I take parts from the life support.
Yeah.<eos> And I feel like I know Sharon, too. I mean, not as familiar as I feel with you, but it's there.<eos> But then I keep thinking maybe she's my girlfriend.<eos> Or my sister.<eos> She could be my sister and that'll be pretty gross.<eos> You think she likes me?<eos> I-I don't have time for this, okay?<eos> I-I gotta get this door open.<eos> Try to find some tools, like a crowbar, or something.<eos> Get it in there and try and pry it open.
Holy earth from the Mount of Olives.<eos> Stir it in your mead and swallow it in one gulp.<eos> Have you forgotten how to drink, lad?<eos> I'll remind you.<eos> Like that, boy.<eos> Like that.<eos> The farmer with the tooth.<eos> - Death is coming for him.<eos> - Death is coming for all of us.<eos> No, I felt it.
Please express our regrets to the Shah, but we cannot join him.<eos> You refuse to obey?<eos> !<eos> We are Hakims not hunters.<eos> I will convey your answer.<eos> I know.<eos> Each of us is thinking "why should I stay and risk my life..."<eos> "fighting a pestilence that has no cure", well... we must each find our own answer. So...<eos> Those who wish to leave, go now with my blessing.<eos> The rest will battle death by my side until... we defeat it.
Jesse, don't you see that?<eos> Quick!<eos> Quick!<eos> There!<eos> Karim.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> Where I am going, there is a river of wine... and women...<eos> Women that are more beautiful than in the Shah's harem.<eos> There might even be a redhead.<eos> God gives us life... and God takes it back.
Clear the gate!<eos> Everyone inside!<eos> Thank you, Master, for all that you have taught me.<eos> Thank you, Rob Cole... for all that you have learned.<eos> Come with me!<eos> The Hakims... have reached a consensus.<eos> I have side sickness.<eos> I shall not live to honor the sunrise.<eos> Only you... have seen the cause of this illness with your own eyes.<eos> You will cut me open and then remove it.
Can I help you?<eos> I'm anita.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Yeah, mark and luke.<eos> - Hello. Yeah, just wondering what's going on With containers on this piece of property.<eos> Uh, on my piece of property?<eos> We are setting up.<eos> It's private property.<eos> Well, this is my land.<eos> I bought it.
Five years, almost.<eos> Whose is this container?<eos> It's where we keep all the dead children.<eos> Do you think it's really important to be sexually passionate with each other, after that long?<eos> - Is this yours?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Are you Anita Schultz?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Your visa's good for another two months.<eos> After that, you'll have to renew it.
-Get her in here.<eos> I know I'm not supposed to say it, but I want to meet my granddaughter.<eos> She's got a family.<eos> This is what's killing me.<eos> You may not want to see her but I do and I'm gonna look for her.<eos> Tui!<eos> Tui!<eos> Tui!<eos> I got lost.<eos> Left the path, I couldn't find it again.
- That sounds nice .<eos> They are calling me. I have to go.<eos> She didn't have time anymore? -No!<eos> What are we going to do now?<eos> - I don't know. Buy ice cream! -Yes!<eos> Here we go.<eos> I call you, baby .<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will end the evening with "Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans"<eos> I won't sing this song anymore, because I don't know a thing about New Orleans, but Dompan can sing it instead.
Here we can dance and play.<eos> The dining room.<eos> Here you can sit.<eos> We 've saved the best for last .<eos> There is one more small room up there.<eos> - Oh...<eos> - It's your room.<eos> -But where are you going to sleep<eos> I'll sleep in another room.<eos> You can take a look at it later.
Dorothea Jarrow had been treated for the mental illness.<eos> But had shown some improvement, n'est-ce pas?<eos> Yes.<eos> And it was so beneficial for her to spend some time in a normal family home.<eos> And Dorothea and Margaret, they were fond of each other?<eos> There was a bond between them.<eos> A bond of dependence and love.<eos> And in many ways, they were alike.<eos> Pardon.<eos> But in twins, although there is this bond of love if something should occur to break it, then it is shattered forever.
I was like this.<eos> Just like this.<eos> Then I went to the desert to seek answers, and now I have them.<eos> Actually, George Sr. had come to the desert to escape questions.<eos> Years earlier, after duping his twin brother Oscar... - You gave me up, George.<eos> - George?<eos> I'm not George.<eos> ...into taking his place at a party the family held on the Queen Mary, George Sr. stowed away with a son who was also fleeing the family.<eos> How was the party?<eos> Mom stole it.
- In here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We're gonna sell that land to the government for Sitwell's wall, and I'm gonna take the cash. I am gonna mount a case that shows that my wife is not the power-hungry monster the SEC wants to make her out to be.<eos> You're such a puny thinker.<eos> Am I puny-thinking again?<eos> Sitwell's wall?<eos> How about our wall?<eos> We build the wall.<eos> We do have the plan.<eos> He says he can build it for $200 million, we offer to build it for $150 million, and we make up the difference when we sell the land.
I'll teach you how to get yachts, I'll teach you how to get penthouses, and how to get something for yourself by taking it from someone who thinks it's his.<eos> Does it come with lemonade?<eos> It comes with all the lemonade you can drink.<eos> "Squeeze" had two meanings.<eos> Who's in?<eos> Sign 'em up. Sign 'em up.<eos> Come on, get your wallets out, let's go, guys.<eos> And George Sr. had even found a great way - to handle the heat. - Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> He had his twin brother endure it.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> Although, in my culture, "full of (BLEEP)" is kind of like a dig.<eos> I mean, you'd never say it to a customer.<eos> But yeah, no, I know what you mean.<eos> This bag is as fake as you are.<eos> Well, how do I learn?<eos> Just look at the spelling.<eos> God. No, I...<eos> Pull your head out of the sand.<eos> Love is where you left it.
Says the least spiritual man I know.<eos> What deal did you strike with her?<eos> What part of her soul did you buy?<eos> All I've asked is that she testify that I was a wonderful mother who did her best.<eos> So all of it.<eos> No, Michael.<eos> I'm not a whore.<eos> I don't get any of the money until after I do the disgusting thing.<eos> But I'm not here just for the stimmy.<eos> I'm here because a shaman told me that love is where I left it.
I don't know. You want me to tell him to go himself?<eos> I can tell Ron Howard to go himself.<eos> Tell him to shove it up his.<eos> I just can't do it now because I'm in front of a jury.<eos> Barry, I will meet with him.<eos> You're in front of a jury right now?<eos> Oh, and the looks I'm getting.<eos> Got to go. Sorry, everybody.<eos> I'm an attorney, too.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'd like the defendant to reach over the school gate, open it from the inside and enter the school property, please.
I knew it.<eos> Michael, you got to get this Love guy against the wall between the U.S. And Mexico.<eos> That's not right.<eos> You're really opposed to this wall, huh?<eos> When did you become pro-immigrant?<eos> I have changed, Michael.<eos> I cry at the drop of a hat, and I hate the way I look.<eos> I actually had one cute hat, and it... it blew off at the CVS parking lot.<eos> And this whole car full of black kids ran over it, for no reason.<eos> And they saw it!
Sweet.<eos> They're all Rolexes.<eos> Guys.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well, it wouldn't work in the first place, so don't worry. it's fine.<eos> Shit.<eos> Put it... there.<eos> - What the fuck are you doing?<eos> - Got a new room at my dad's in Vegas.<eos> I need some stuff to decorate it with.
I'll feel like I let him down again.<eos> Mrs Travers?<eos> I don't suppose, you can give me any more for the pain?<eos> When will enough be enough, Travers?<eos> I've brought you something father.<eos> Be a darling Ginty, my old pal! Come here.<eos> I'm sick.<eos> Help father out won't you?<eos> You know, In my washroom-- there's a bottle of medicine that father needs.<eos> - Mother took it away.
I'm always worried there's going to be frogs in here, or something.<eos> John, if you were sad, what would you do?<eos> See, my Rose is sad.<eos> No, I'm depressed.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> It's not sad.<eos> Well, what's the difference?<eos> Well, you can't cure it with ice-cream.<eos> You can't cure it...<eos> You can't cure it with beer!
Poor guy.<eos> No.<eos> Hello!<eos> Can I please have a mojito!<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Brendan.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> My dog has a soft toy and its name is Brendan.<eos> So, if I say to him...<eos> if I say to him, 'Where's Brendan? ' he goes and gets it because he knows its name, because he knows the name of a soft toy, but he's a dog.
You lied to him because you thought that he was going to break up with you.<eos> No!<eos> I thought I was pregnant.<eos> Geoffrey.<eos> Geoffrey.<eos> Josh, I want to talk to you.<eos> Oh, no, no, not now.<eos> Now.<eos> Can you guys just maybe, just do me a favour and stop this fight for a bit briefly?<eos> It's just, I don't want to miss it.
- How are you?<eos> - Fine. And you?<eos> - I'm out for a run.<eos> - Are you stuck?<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> - Let me help you.<eos> Hang on...<eos> You contact has migrated...<eos> Can't see it.
How long have you been cooking this thing up?<eos> Well, you remember Lola's little hot tub party?<eos> And great men don't miss their fate.<eos> I missed mine, Francie.<eos> I was probably staring at it the whole time and I just missed it.<eos> So everyone was in on this except for my lanky ass.<eos> People are predictable Francis, you, me.<eos> If we weren't, we'd just spend all our time trying to figure out what crazy shit everybody else was up to.<eos> All I did was drop off a sculpture.<eos> And then picked it on up.
Take him to Qyburn.<eos> - Will I die?<eos> - No.<eos> The corruption has spread.<eos> I fear it must be cut away.<eos> The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.<eos> Then you'll die.<eos> You're no maester.<eos> Where's your chain?<eos> The Citadel stripped me of it.
He has to die.<eos> The Karstarks are Northmen.<eos> They won't forgive the killing of their lord.<eos> Your mother's right.<eos> If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.<eos> You tended to their wounds.<eos> You brought them supper.<eos> Now they're dead.<eos> And more boys will keep dying until this war is over.<eos> You need Karstark men to end it.
The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.<eos> I still dream of that night.<eos> Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.<eos> I dream of the voice from the flames.<eos> Was it a god?<eos> A demon?<eos> A conjuror's trick?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.<eos> And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.
I've got orders from Lord Bolton.<eos> And what are those orders?<eos> To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.<eos> You think you'll get a reward.<eos> I serve Lord Bolton.<eos> Any appreciation your father--<eos> You think you're getting a reward.<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand.<eos> And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.
How gentlemanly of you not to disclose her name.<eos> One day I'll tell you who she is.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> So you're top dog now, are you?<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> I asked the man on the gate and he said you'd taken over from the boss.<eos> I'm only his private secretary.<eos> What about the car?<eos> He lets me use it.
I don't even know how that got started.<eos> That's, like, people are saying that around town.<eos> I'll walk you through it.<eos> You just walk up, climb up the machine, lean over the back.<eos> Can't believe I'm listening to this idiot.<eos> Listen to the man.<eos> You're gonna see two pipes coming into the top.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - In between them, there's gonna be a silver button.<eos> Hit it a little bit.
How long?<eos> A week, maybe less.<eos> Listen, Steinar, I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but we're still brothers after all and I want you to know that when I'm King<eos> I'll make sure you're taken care of.<eos> The omens deceived us, Steinar.<eos> An army of 500 are only hours behind me.<eos> All this talk of reason... sounds like a cover-up for weakness.<eos> We lie here because we have no choice.<eos> We need land!<eos> We either take it or our people perish.
It's OK.<eos> You said lots of things that...<eos> I just wanted to...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just want to apologize.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Anyway, I talked to our publisher.<eos> We decided to can the entire book.<eos> This is the last copy.<eos> Let me know, and I'll delete it.
Can't.<eos> Clara.<eos> Got to find.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> How long have you been like that?<eos> Days.<eos> Weeks.<eos> Don't know.<eos> Long story.<eos> I'll keep it short.
Oh, that's terrible.<eos> I forgot you're a closet Christian.<eos> Is it bad to make blow job jokes in church?<eos> It kind of is, okay?<eos> We've done worse.<eos> The girls asked me again what our wedding was like.<eos> Yeah? What did you say?<eos> - I say it was very low key. - Yeah.<eos> Very low key.<eos> So low key we don't remember it.
Yeah. I love you too.<eos> Bye. Okay.<eos> Okay. He's fine.<eos> He says he'll call you from Chicago when he lands.<eos> Why can't I talk to him?<eos> Twice you've done that.<eos> You could have just handed me the phone.<eos> He didn't have time. They were boarding.<eos> What did he forget?<eos> His science project. But we'll mail it tomorrow.
Nothing.<eos> Know what? I have had absolutely zero time for myself.<eos> I have 10,000 emails I have to answer that I didn't answer.<eos> You think I don't?<eos> I spend all day making dinner and wiping you and your son's pee...<eos> While you talk to fellow novelists. Blah, blah, blah, you're a genius.<eos> Blah, blah, blah, no, you're a genius.<eos> The second we say goodbye to Henry, you suggest I give up my dream job.<eos> Oh, okay, now it's your dream job?<eos> This afternoon you weren't even sure you wanted it.
You think I don't?<eos> I spend all day making dinner and wiping you and your son's pee...<eos> While you talk to fellow novelists. Blah, blah, blah, you're a genius.<eos> Blah, blah, blah, no, you're a genius.<eos> The second we say goodbye to Henry, you suggest I give up my dream job.<eos> Oh, okay, now it's your dream job?<eos> This afternoon you weren't even sure you wanted it.<eos> Do you ever listen to yourself?<eos> It is my dream job.<eos> Just because I have doubts doesn't mean I don't want it.
This is a choreography contract that Jerry was supposed to send to Derek.<eos> He didn't send it because he wants Derek back.<eos> He's betting against tom.<eos> Mmhmm.<eos> I can't let that happen.<eos> That's why you have to shut down the show.<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> What if we make it more clearly about the fame?<eos> About how people do anything to get it?
So glad you could make it.<eos> - Thank you for asking me.<eos> - Sure. Well, I thought I would start with why I love actors, move to a few, uh, anecdotes, take some questions, just go from there.<eos> I'm sorry, I think there's been a misunderstanding.<eos> You're not here to speak.<eos> You're here to watch.<eos> Watch what? Your play.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's important to hear it out loud. You are not going to humiliate me in front of a bunch of 12-year-olds.<eos> They don't know that you wrote it.
'Instead of which - at the risk of mixing too many metaphors - 'he's put himself out in the wilderness.'<eos> Oh, God.<eos> The day from hell.<eos> You'll get back.<eos> You just have to give it time, let things play out.<eos> They'll close ranks. That's how it works.<eos> Those that haven't already.<eos> I'm screwed, Freya.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm just trying to look the damn beast in the eye, see it for what it is.
You don't suppose it's about Noah, do you?<eos> That his disability somehow means the world owes Aiden something?<eos> Be very careful, Bruce.<eos> When I put your name forward to the PM, even though... It was you who put my name forward?<eos> Even though I knew it was a chance in a lifetime for you, I was afraid he would try to block it. Or worse, use you to get back at me at me somehow.<eos> I should have known he cares too much for you to put you in such an invidious position.<eos> So why did you put my name forward, Bruce?<eos> To assuage your guilt?<eos> How many times have you stepped aside for him over the years, Freya?<eos> When that Shadow Transport job came up, you had a shot at it, too.
- Yeah.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> My boys.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Renai, it's me, it's okay.<eos> I tried reaching you.<eos> I tried everything.<eos> I played your song.<eos> I should've known it was you.<eos> Only you could play it that badly.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.<eos> Say no more.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> What, are you fucking kidding me?<eos> ! You're fucking kidding me, right? !<eos> - Baby!<eos> - What?<eos> I feel like I should leave my jacket in the car. Maybe not.<eos> Should I bring it?
Did I take an Ambien?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you drug me again, you fucking wanker?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Guess what, though.<eos> While you were sleeping, I wrote you a fucking song.<eos> I'll play it to you back at the hotel.
It's a question of mathematics.<eos> How to pack a group of spheres in the most economic fashion.<eos> And since nature always employs the most efficient means to achieve her ends, I've taken inspiration from her.<eos> I call it the cluster bombard.<eos> The casing houses a grouping of smaller explosives, an Archimedean solid, which is separated by iron spacers.<eos> So when the bombard lands, it fragments into a fountain of shrapnel.<eos> I estimate one bombard could take out a dozen of your men and their mounts.<eos> Now, I know what you're thinking.<eos> You're thinking, "Well, fair enough.<eos> A bombard's really only as good as one's ability to lob it."
Nor do my men.<eos> The Medici family have always been patrons of the arts.<eos> Particularly those celebrating the holy faith.<eos> Which is distinctly true of this creation, Your Highness.<eos> David, as sculpted by Donatello.<eos> The Lord who saved me from the claws of the lion and the bear will save me from this abomination.<eos> You do not see beauty in its design, Friar Torquemada?<eos> Is the artist a sexual deviant, like others I've heard of in this region?<eos> I find it lewd.<eos> Please cover it for the remainder of our visit.
But trust me - trust me... ..no-one defines me.<eos> Not Florence's outdated laws and certainly... certainly...not you.<eos> Your infatuation will fade and you will find others to love.<eos> I have no doubt.<eos> Every kiss sends a message.<eos> That one...was goodbye.<eos> Goodbye?<eos> (Lucrezia hums)<eos> Do you know, I've never heard that tune from anyone except you.<eos> My father used to hum it to me when I was a child.
Hey, how you doin? Nice to meet you.<eos> Oh, whoa!<eos> Hey, hey, hey! What's up?<eos> Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.<eos> I didn't see you back there.<eos> That's my associate, Bob.<eos> Actually, he's my brother.<eos> He's a simple...<eos> I'm his brother, too.<eos> He used to play in the dryer. We turned it on once. Whoa, whoa!
You see?<eos> I have fears.<eos> Go to the Seer, ask if your fears will come true.<eos> It's sometimes better not to know one's fate.<eos> I take it, from what you said yesterday, that King Horik is prepared to compromise and offer some deal regarding those lands of mine, which he still occupies?<eos> He is prepared to pay you to renounce your illegal claims of his lands.<eos> You disappoint me now, Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> I thought you'd come here with a serious purpose.<eos> - If you would just name your price.<eos> - The land is priceless, which is why King Horik wants to keep it for himself.
You always talk about my brother.<eos> What choice do I have?<eos> He is your earl.<eos> Which one would you like tonight?<eos> Why don't you take both of them?<eos> I don't need to be bribed with women.<eos> What is it you want, Rollo?<eos> What is it you really want?<eos> Fenrir, the giant wolf, could not be constrained by any means known to man, so the dwarves forged a chain, but not from metal.<eos> Nothing made by man could constrain Fenrir, so they forged it from the things we cannot see and the things we cannot hear.
- Oh, I can take them.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Yes. It's on the way to my office.<eos> This watershed act proves that once again the anti-capitalist agenda is alive and well in the Democratic party.<eos> Let me show you what's really going on.<eos> Here are the democrats eating up all of their soft science, "organically homegrown" propaganda that the eco-fanatics are force-feeding them.<eos> And over here, at the tail end of all those jackasses, are middle-class Americans... people who just want to work hard and rely on jobs in the drilling industry.<eos> And what about the hypocrisy, folks?<eos> Does Peter Russo honestly have the gall to lecture us on the purity of our rivers when he has been polluting himself with chemicals for years?<eos> He's not just been eating grass, he's been smoking it.
Not just a few.<eos> There's a sizable coalition that wants to see your bill fail, including environmentalists from your own party.<eos> - Don't think the bill does enough.<eos> - We wanted a passable bill.<eos> That's why we aimed for middle ground... do you actually care about the Delaware river?<eos> I don't sponsor legislation I don't care about.<eos> Until recently, you hadn't sponsored any legislation at all.<eos> I spent my time in congress focusing on things that were important to my constituents.<eos> - The shipyard.<eos> - Kept it open as long as I could.
Don't we have an event at 11:00?<eos> There won't be any events until we talk.<eos> You're hijacking the microphone.<eos> You're contradicting everything I say.<eos> We need to be promoting the watershed act.<eos> Well, I appreciate your being so forthright.<eos> Let me tell you what I don't appreciate.<eos> The D.N.C. Is running a man with zero track record, except for substance abuse, to fill my shoes.<eos> I realize you don't want to be here, sir, but it seems like you're deliberately trying to sabotage my campaign.<eos> Despite my better judgment, I'm trying to save it.
You were out of money.<eos> You had to mortgage your own house just to keep your staff on payroll.<eos> I'm well aware of what I did.<eos> I was there.<eos> My point is you kept going.<eos> You hit 67 counties in less than 20 days, and you proved everyone wrong.<eos> Like it or not, it's my name on the ticket this time, and I got the shot, and I'm gonna prove everyone wrong.<eos> Just like you did.<eos> Including you, sir.<eos> I would like your support, but if you won't give it, fine.
This would normally be my case, but it's unusual.<eos> With the new way of doing things,<eos> "unusual" belongs to you.<eos> So, if you need anything from homicide, you know where to find us.<eos> Welcome to Psych Crimes and Crisis.<eos> - You know how to use a gun?<eos> - Not a cop.<eos> The light bulb's missing.<eos> Ok.<eos> He took it... from here.
So, you think the killer was using logic when he put the light bulb in a boy's chest?<eos> Probably not, but I'll start with logic and you can start with evil unicorns, and we'll see who solves it first.<eos> The suspect moves past the younger boy's bed to get to Toby, the older boy.<eos> Maybe he needs Toby to show him where the thing is.<eos> What's the thing?<eos> A trophy?<eos> Boy says no, and...<eos> "Whoops!<eos> You'd be surprised what regular people can do when the adrenaline's pumping.<eos> But this guy, he held on to the light bulb; he didn't toss it or smash it;

Report. What's on board this thing?<eos> 'Dynomorphic generators, conceptual geometer, beam synthesiser, 'orthogonal engine filters.'<eos> Guys, guys, look. I think we should split up.<eos> It's our best chance of finding the girl.<eos> You know it is.<eos> Don't touch a thing.<eos> The TARDIS will get huffy if you mess.<eos> Keep in radio contact, all right?<eos> Get back to the console.<eos> Strip it apart.
Ask yourself why he couldn't cut you up.<eos> He has just one tiny scrap of decency left in him.<eos> You just helped him find that, OK?<eos> Now you.<eos> Don't ever forget this.<eos> OK, move, move, move.<eos> The Eye of Harmony.<eos> Exploding star.<eos> In the act of becoming a black hole.<eos> Time Lord engineering - you rip the star from its orbit, suspend it in a permanent state of decay.
The Avatar has gone missing.<eos> After President Raiko refused Korra's request to aid the South in the War of the Water Tribes, she headed to the Fire Nation, seeking a new ally against Unalaq.<eos> But unbeknownst to her friends, a dark spirit attacked Korra and dragged her into the ocean.<eos> She has washed up on a desolate island with no memory of who she is.<eos> We found the Avatar washed up onshore, but she doesn't remember anything.<eos> - [weakly] Raava.<eos> Raava.<eos> Raava.<eos> - A dark energy has infected her.<eos> We must purge it before it destroys her Avatar spirit.
Someone is in a good mood.<eos> How'd the job interview go?<eos> I'll tell you about it later.<eos> I think there's some possibility of employment there.<eos> Employment would be nice.<eos> - Really nice.<eos> - Mmm.<eos> I think you might be right about the furniture.<eos> I'm going to get rid of it.<eos> If you want, or I guess I could get used to it if you want to leave it.
Can you come here?<eos> Hey, hey. Hey, doll.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Chloe.<eos> Hey, uh, Chloe, can you bring me a bottle of champagne?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> No, doll.<eos> Can you bring it to my trailer? Say, tonight around 11?
He just doesn't know it yet.<eos> Hello, Deborah.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Is your husband home?<eos> - Arthur's around back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Morning, Reverend Ramsey.<eos> Thought I would've heard back from you by now.<eos> I want you to taste something.<eos> The pipes in my house, they draw the water from the aquifer, but I prefer to drink it straight from here.
You got a great situation here.<eos> I'm not looking to fuck it up, but you better believe I want a piece.<eos> Been on the road for two years.<eos> And nothing...<eos> I mean nothing has panned out.<eos> You give me some fuckin' hush money, send me on my way.<eos> We both know I'm gonna end up back inside.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I'm not going back.<eos> This is my only play, and I'm making it.
Now, you'd be a fool to let that one go, but I s'pose that means you probably will.<eos> How did you manage that?<eos> It was quite easy, really, once we learned we had shared opinions. On?<eos> You.<eos> You think I'm being unfair.<eos> Devoid of humour or charm perhaps, but unfair implies you had an agenda and I can't imagine a reason you would.<eos> If I was harder than I needed to be, I'm sorry.<eos> It wasn't personal.<eos> Apology accepted. Good.<eos> The job is yours, if you want it.
I missed you.<eos> I missed you too.<eos> I was glad to receive your letter.<eos> The hospital will be lucky to have you.<eos> If they want me, that is.<eos> I don't want him employing the Adams woman.<eos> She said she'd be discreet.<eos> Well, she contacted George because she has no other options.<eos> She will scuttle off as soon as possible, and you'll just have to train someone all over again.<eos> The job's yours if you want it.
And about you too, Aki.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I had fun.<eos> Wait!<eos> You're not coming?<eos> Uh.<eos> "World peace" have you managed to write it?<eos> Our genius boy, what'll he become?<eos> You see he.. originally, he didn't want to do it like this.<eos> Music... has no meaning if you can't sell it.
We're still burning Guy Fawkes after 400 years, but seemingly we're supposed to forgive and forget the Japs after eight.<eos> Something inconsistent there.<eos> I need a favour. Of course.<eos> I can't walk in alone.<eos> I'm not invited.<eos> I'm inviting you.<eos> But it's...<eos> I'm there with you, or I'm not there at all.<eos> I'm not too proud to admit I need help.<eos> Then you have it.
I know every chronicle.<eos> Every poem.<eos> Every legend.<eos> Every song.<eos> Every single one?<eos> Blimey.<eos> I hated history.<eos> And now I have to sing a song in front of everyone.<eos> A special song.<eos> I have to sing it to a God.
The bus leaves from the jetty at 7:00.<eos> Screw the bus.<eos> I got a car.<eos> Great!<eos> That'll be much more comfy.<eos> Micaela.<eos> Yes.<eos> His camera.<eos> Yes.<eos> He gave it to me when he was sick.

I'm in a financial hole, okay?<eos> I bought something I shouldn't have and I can't get rid of it.<eos> - What did you buy?<eos> - A boat.<eos> - Is that a euphemism?<eos> - No, it's a boat.<eos> It's a leaky fucking boat and no one's bidding on it.<eos> Do not yell at me, Mike.<eos> I did not force you to buy a boat.<eos> I have a cracked keel, I have to dry-dock it.
We just lost the House and you're crowing?<eos> You're actually pleased about this?<eos> Why?<eos> Because well, we lost the House, that's bad, obviously, but now this gets me off your case and that's okay?<eos> Couldn't have put that better myself, sir.<eos> Are you eating my pizza?<eos> No, sir, you...<eos> Because you said that...<eos> No, I said don't wave it in my face.<eos> - I didn't say eat it.

I'll call you back with a counter.<eos> This is our top priority-- Ohio,<eos> Florida, and Pennsylvania.<eos> We need all of them, or Walker's a one-term president.<eos> Pennsylvania is why he picked Matthews as a running mate.<eos> But now we have to find a replacement.<eos> The special election is this November.<eos> Patricia Whittaker, D.N.C. chair.<eos> A rare example of someone whose head is in the game instead of up their backside.<eos> Competence is such an exotic bird in these woods that I appreciate it whenever I see it.
Rhoda is getting the best treatment, I promise you.<eos> Elijah!<eos> There you are.<eos> The name is Eliyahu.<eos> - Yes, Elilulu.<eos> I didn't expect you to notice, but we English are not accustomed to sweating here like you natives.<eos> I am transferring my sister to better care.<eos> George, put the bed back in place.<eos> - Don't.<eos> George, you better put it back before I spit you and the Englishman on an IV pole!
Everybody down.<eos> I saw it!<eos> It's a stick-up!<eos> Manager, it's a stick-up!<eos> First thing, you get rid of those bars.<eos> What is this, the gorilla cage at the zoo?<eos> Do you even have insurance for that thing?<eos> My late security manager thought it was necessary.<eos> Dedi, please. We're a joke.<eos> And next time that poor old man yells "stick-up," if anyone sets off the silent alarm, disable it.
I have had the worst day.<eos> Our dance photo didn't come out, someone moved my stapler, and, worst of all, I hurt you.<eos> But you'll be happy to know that we'll be offering another History class, because I care about you.<eos> And not because I found out if we don't offer a real History class we'll lose, like, $40,000 in grant money.<eos> Thank you, Dean.<eos> By the way, you didn't have to come all this way - to tell me that.<eos> - Oh, no, it wasn't a problem.<eos> It's on my way.<eos> Please tell me you're breaking into that condo.<eos> No, I bought it.
Uh, it's kind of a date.<eos> But I pay, right?<eos> Why don't you tell me about you?<eos> Well, I'm in this basic women's studies class at NYU.<eos> We have to do this exercise at the beginning of every class.<eos> We have to draw ourselves, our, um...<eos> And then we have to talk about it.<eos> Ah, you brought a little folder too.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have to take it out.
You don't have a problem with this?<eos> Cutting out Justin?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not really.<eos> He's not that cute anyway, and I think he fucked my friend, which is kind of gross, right?<eos> I'm learning that it depends.<eos> Did you just...?<eos> So I was at lunch today with a client.<eos> They are divorcing, of course, and he needs a place in the city, so I thought, "The loft."<eos> Can he see it?
Mrs. Bulkan said I'm really good.<eos> It's very good.<eos> Sorry again. I was late.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know if I like that Christopher Columbus line.<eos> Do you have a problem with it?<eos> No.<eos> You don't like the Christopher Columbus line?<eos> Would you do me a favor, hon?<eos> Just like it.
That's not true.<eos> Lassie, that's what we thought at first.<eos> - But it doesn't add up anymore.<eos> - Think about it, Spencer.<eos> Put your finger to your head and use your brain.<eos> They got a couple of their bong buddies to crawl in the hole and play dead.<eos> You got hosed.<eos> But now they have gone too far, because my time is money.<eos> Wait a minute. How come we're ruling out the theory that the yeti moved his food stash<eos> - because we found it?
- Yes! Good work!<eos> Jules, you're amazing!<eos> Hang on, Lassie, we'll have you out of there in no time!<eos> Hey!<eos> That lady hawk stole my camera!<eos> How do you know it's a female?<eos> She's circling around.<eos> I think my whole leg just came off.<eos> Lassie, she's coming back this way.<eos> I think she's gonna drop it.

This is so humiliating.<eos> I can't tell Marlowe the truth.<eos> I've got to come up with a cover story.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Does anybody know where we are?<eos> Because I certainly don't, and this sucks.<eos> Yeah, agreed.<eos> We can follow the river up a ways, but the tracks won't be good once the sun goes down.<eos> Didn't you guys bring a map?<eos> - I kicked it into the creek.
We needed the 50 grand for an exploratory committee.<eos> 'Cause, even though he was a terrible husband, he was a great lover, and would have been a fabulous governor.<eos> I really wanted to make love in that mansion... with Antonio.<eos> Well, I'm bored.<eos> Come on.<eos> All I'm saying is that showing me passed out surrounded by beer cans is not exactly my idea of a nuanced photo.<eos> Well, if you hated that, you're not gonna like this commercial.<eos> It's about to start airing.<eos> What? Dude, we have a commercial?<eos> Yup. I sliced one together last night and got the local station to air it in exchange for you giving free psychic readings
An eight-year-old boy.<eos> Just because, you know-- just as a move!<eos> Walt's a bastard.<eos> Secret's out.<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> But I need you to put out the lighter, okay?<eos> Look, Jesse...<eos> Jesse, I don't want to kill you.<eos> And you don't wanna be killed.<eos> So put it out.
Lariat.<eos> The one on Candelaria and Monroe.<eos> - Lariat on Candelaria?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Kuby rented the van.<eos> Mr. White dropped it off.<eos> He had us wash it good before Kuby took it back.<eos> Wash the rental? Why?<eos> It was filthy, man, like he had went off road with it.<eos> After we had hosed it down, he grabbed a shovel out the back, handed over the key, and that was it.
You know I'm out of the business.<eos> Just a couple times to tutor my nephew here, that's all.<eos> Get him on track to bringing the purity up.<eos> Get the color right too.<eos> Apparently that blue touch you put on it-- it's all the craze with those Slavic types.<eos> So I'm told.<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Look, what was the price per head last time?<eos> I'll triple it.
The rest of her estate has been left in its entirety... to the church.<eos> Most unexpected and very generous.<eos> Did Anne-Marie not leave anything for her brother?<eos> Well, I don't need her money.<eos> I can't wear her jewels.<eos> Actually, I'm interested in a different kind of legacy.<eos> Her play.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It was cancelled the day she died.<eos> I want to restage it.
That was very understanding of you.<eos> It was the worst decision I've ever made.<eos> I wish I'd gone back.<eos> I wish I'd found him, thrown him in the car and dragged him home.<eos> If you think I would do anything to harm my son, you really don't know the man you're dealing with.<eos> We'll need to talk to you again.<eos> If you must.<eos> Mr Robson...<eos> Do you know this game?<eos> I'd recognise it anywhere.
I'm genuinely sorry about what happened to Jason.<eos> I truly am.<eos> It's his sister you should be apologising to.<eos> But he doesn't have a sister.<eos> He was brought up in care.<eos> They were split up when they were young, but they kept in touch.<eos> Her name is Laura Parr.<eos> My brother was a genius.<eos> Built that game single-handed.<eos> Till Wendy Robson stole it from him.
You don't want everything going into the roth ira.<eos> 5, 10 grand a year.<eos> I'll set you up with a nice, diversified package.<eos> Low-risk, high-yield.<eos> I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control.<eos> If I brought a senior U.S. congressman into the fund, hoo hoo hoo, that would really up my stock in the company.<eos> What are you all gabbing about back there?<eos> We're talking about the old library.<eos> Yeah, what's happening to it?<eos> They gonna tear it down?

One of the youngest state legislators in the history of South Carolina.<eos> A 22-year veteran of the U.S. Congress.<eos> House majority whip.<eos> Speaks volumes about the values young people learn here at the sentinel.<eos> Values like honor, duty, discipline, like sacrifice, service, and respect.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Francis J. Underwood library.<eos> Congressman?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wrote a speech.<eos> But I'm not gonna read it.
- You sit your ass down.<eos> - All right, hear me out, sheriff.<eos> - They got you outgunned.<eos> - Damn straight we do.<eos> While on the other hand, if he shoots, one of you boys is dead or shitting in a bag the rest of his life.<eos> For what?<eos> The 200 bucks Sugar has in the register at 4 p.m. on a Tuesday?<eos> Come on.<eos> So, Sheriff, why don't you let them take the cash?<eos> Just let them take it.
What I mean is I wouldn't want you to take matters into your own hands.<eos> Ha, ha. Look at me.<eos> Nobody runs from a fight faster than an old fighter.<eos> What happened to your title fight?<eos> Oh, I knocked it off the hook the other night, busted up the frame.<eos> I'm having it redone.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> You let me know if you need any more of those painkillers.<eos> That's some car.<eos> Look, if you're thinking of stealing from Kai Proctor you may as well take a bullet and put it in your head now.
Halbach told me you always arrived first.<eos> So we have a few moments before the others get here.<eos> I-I can't do it!<eos> What you're asking, it is too dangerous.<eos> If there was more money, would you find it less dangerous?<eos> - You must understand...<eos> - I understand greed.<eos> - You must understand... - It makes things very simple between us.<eos> You are asking me to betray my country.<eos> You've betrayed it before, to the Soviets.
Where's the Colonel going?<eos> We'll find out at dinner tonight.<eos> We need shovels.<eos> I blame myself.<eos> The Soviets knew it was me you approached in Warsaw.<eos> They were bound to make the connection sooner or later.<eos> So these men who came...?<eos> I've dealt with that situation.<eos> Fernand is driving their car to Lyon.<eos> He'll dump it somewhere.
That should get you started.<eos> - Supplies are inside.<eos> - Shit.<eos> You okay, buddy?<eos> Been trying all morning to get tickets to the Wilco concert at Soldier Field tonight.<eos> - Can't get through.<eos> - Wilco?<eos> Aren't they for, like, dads with receding hairlines and shit?<eos> Come on, Wilco is the beacon of anti-commercialism.<eos> Yeah, because no one wants to buy their whiny music, they gotta give it away for free.
It's a fucking shambles.<eos> It's-- it's bollocks.<eos> Um, I agree.<eos> Hank, I'm sorry. It needs work.<eos> Yeah, we're really gonna have to roll up our sleeves on this one.<eos> What the fuck are you guys talking about?<eos> It's a rock opera with the tone of my book.<eos> That's what you wanted.<eos> I don't even like the fucking book.<eos> You said you loved it.
Yeah, we're really gonna have to roll up our sleeves on this one.<eos> What the fuck are you guys talking about?<eos> It's a rock opera with the tone of my book.<eos> That's what you wanted.<eos> I don't even like the fucking book.<eos> You said you loved it.<eos> Remember?<eos> On your flying whorehouse?<eos> Yeah, I remember, but when I said that,<eos> I hadn't read it.
- Will you be my wife?<eos> Come on!<eos> Say yes!<eos> No?<eos> Nobody?<eos> Really?<eos> No? Then get the fuck off my stage.<eos> Be gone, all of you!<eos> I wrote this next song for my wife, Natalie in hope that she'll forgive me although if she did, I'll probably just bugger it up all over again<eos> But tonight I'm gonna play it for my good friend and collaborator
I didn't call her.<eos> I can't... deal with her right now.<eos> I get it.<eos> Actually, I don't.<eos> Not to draw attention to the obvious, but if you should be angry at anyone right now, it's me.<eos> I slept with a married man.<eos> I know, but I'm just not as angry with you as I am with Savi.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Maybe it's because we're the married ones.<eos> It's, like, we took the oath together, and she broke it.
Um, he can take it for show and tell.<eos> Wow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No problem.<eos> - Look at that.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Hey, uh, Ryan thought of a joke for you.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> That, um, that was sort of more of a ploy to make him sit through the operation.<eos> Listen, my 8-year-old son, he thought of a joke for you. You're gonna sit down and you're gonna listen to it And you're gonna laugh your ass off, 'cause it's really freakin' funny.
- that you meant well...<eos> - Trust me.<eos> This is what she needs.<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> May I take your order?<eos> Uh, we gotta take this thing to Buckner.<eos> And I could help!<eos> I can help!<eos> I'm just not sure...<eos> Keep it for one week, okay?
And we'll just see how this amnesia holds up against a sudden and quite possibly violent confrontation with his mother.<eos> Ba-ba-ba-ba... Bad idea!<eos> According to my clinical research on drug induced amnesia...<eos> Said the fake scientist...<eos> - Hmm, and what are your parents' names?<eos> - What?<eos> Their names are... um, uh... Damn it, Krieger, did you drug me?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Wow, memory is such a fragile thing.<eos> And if Archer's real identity is exposed to him too suddenly, his mind may reject it permanently.
I know that's not the sound of Evan Cross admitting defeat.<eos> You know those hacking skills I keep asking you not to talk about?<eos> Yeah, we're gonna need those right now.<eos> Bring it.<eos> Good luck.<eos> So you're saying your intention was to tranquilize the terror bird.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Major Douglas was in the line of fire.<eos> But you didn't tranquilize the terror bird.<eos> You killed it.
Major Douglas was in the line of fire.<eos> But you didn't tranquilize the terror bird.<eos> You killed it.<eos> On closer inspection, I discovered that the bird was wounded.<eos> It wouldn't have survived.<eos> I see.<eos> I see...<eos> So it was a mercy killing.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Except major Douglas reports that there were two civilians in the room with the bird when he found it,
When is this?<eos> The night Danny snuck out of his bedroom.<eos> He said he was out on a call, what's he doing?<eos> Waiting for someone.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't, but I bet I'm right.<eos> Tape's run out.<eos> Is there another one?<eos> No.<eos> They just use the one tape and rerecord over it, to save money.
I'll have to show it to Nolan, but this is, this is good.<eos> Woz?<eos> Hi. Hi.<eos> Woz!<eos> Hi!<eos> Yeah, I'm in the living room.<eos> Hey. Good news.<eos> Huh?<eos> Let me guess, your bosses liked the video game.<eos> They loved it!
How can you not know what I'm talking about?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> But it runs on a TV monitor.<eos> Yes, like a television set.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I don't think you understand.<eos> It's not a TV.<eos> It's a personal computer.<eos> Okay, do you own a typewriter?<eos> Great. Okay, now do you use it?
Where you go?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I want you to leave, please.<eos> Where the fuck did you put that bottle?<eos> You must go!<eos> What are you up to?<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> That's enough.<eos> Get out!<eos> - You have to give it back to me!
Previously on "Body Of Proof"...<eos> Welcome back.<eos> You will be working with a new homicide team.<eos> Try to start off on the right foot this time.<eos> - Megan.<eos> - Tommy.<eos> You have five seconds to tell me what you're doing here.<eos> There was an opening.<eos> I took it.
So, what did you think of that book?<eos> I prefer non-fiction, but I liked it.<eos> You read the whole thing?<eos> I liked the part where Scout says,<eos> "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> Page 177, 12 lines from the bottom.<eos> So... first, I roll.<eos> Five.<eos> I take my piece and move it five spaces.
She likes trains.<eos> Maybe she just got on a train and...<eos> She looks like the other girls.<eos> Yes, she fits the profile.<eos> Could Elise still be alive?<eos> We simply have no way of knowing.<eos> - How's the cat?<eos> - What?<eos> How's your cat?<eos> Elise was supposed to feed it.
He's had a mild seizure.<eos> That doesn't seem to bother you.<eos> I said it was mild.<eos> Are you the man who claimed to be the Chesapeake Ripper?<eos> Why do you say "claimed"?<eos> Because you're not.<eos> You know you're not, and you don't know much more about who you are beyond that.<eos> Are you the Ripper?<eos> A terrible thing... to have your identity taken from you.<eos> Well, I'm taking it back, one piece at a time.
Your trying to be her friend impacts the case against her.<eos> Well, the case against her doesn't really matter anymore, does it, Jack?<eos> We could use the articles I wrote at the time of each of the murders as book chapter headings.<eos> The chapters themselves would be you telling your story...<eos> Where you were and what you were thinking when, one by one, eight girls just like you all over Minnesota were disappearing.<eos> What are we gonna call it?<eos> I thought about The Last Victim, but there is already a book about serial killers called The Last Victim.<eos> Was it a bestseller?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Especially after the guy who wrote it killed himself.
Are you going far?<eos> Yes.<eos> I see that you are armed.<eos> Nothing to keep you here anymore?<eos> Good morning.<eos> Are you going with me this time?<eos> I'm going to town.<eos> I know.<eos> I have written a new song, but it is not quite finished...<eos> I will play it for you later.
We had purchased the land, and the tractor used to break down all the time.<eos> Sometimes I was under the engine hood all day long.<eos> I can't go on like this.<eos> Hey.<eos> I've made a mixtape.<eos> Just a few songs you might like.<eos> See you around.<eos> Did you want to come here?<eos> A good song.<eos> Damn, what a long time since I heard it.
Elspeth, I need this job.<eos> Then show us something.<eos> With your students' work, with the magazine, with your new poem.<eos> Be who you were.<eos> Nobody can do that.<eos> Hello?<eos> Dina?<eos> Hey, why are you painting in your pretty blouse?<eos> I'm retiring this blouse.<eos> I'm giving it to you.
With your students' work, with the magazine, with your new poem.<eos> Be who you were.<eos> Nobody can do that.<eos> Hello?<eos> Dina?<eos> Hey, why are you painting in your pretty blouse?<eos> I'm retiring this blouse.<eos> I'm giving it to you.<eos> No, we'll just have it re-sewn with a Velcro strip like the others.<eos> Do you want it or not?
And you know where you can put your stuffy, drab, pictureless magazine.<eos> And the round goes to Delsanto!<eos> - Delsanto? - Ding, ding, ding.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She left the ring.<eos> She quit.<eos> It was hit and run.<eos> All right, all right, I have a challenge for you.<eos> Forget the poem.<eos> You pick a subject, paint a picture, we print it in the issue.
I've been trying so hard to paint what I see, Emily, and now I'm learning to see what I can paint.<eos> Something that excites me.<eos> Take it. If you like it, you can have it.<eos> I can't look at it anymore.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want you to see what I'm painting now.<eos> I miss your input.<eos> Your not being satisfied.<eos> Bring your work over.<eos> I'd be glad to be dissatisfied with it.
A case that will leave its mark? That will stand as a precedent?<eos> My mother always said that I would never amount to anything.<eos> - I'll show that old bitch.<eos> - What do we do now?<eos> As your lawyer, I suggest you cease masturbating in fertility clinics.<eos> - Do I have to get a real lawyer?<eos> - You can't afford a real lawyer.<eos> I'm gonna call the Bar Association today, reactivate my license.<eos> You don't have a license?<eos> I lost it because of a small formality.
Danny, you're just in time.<eos> Aunty Jean.<eos> Did you have a good day?<eos> Oh, spent the morning pulling a dead girl out of the lake.<eos> Oh, how awful!<eos> She's from the bad girls' home.<eos> The what?<eos> You know, up on the highway.<eos> I think you mean the reform school.<eos> No one calls it the bad girls' home.
And take that bloody painting with you.<eos> There's something else going on here, Lawson.<eos> Something we're missing.<eos> Home!<eos> Oh, seize the day, Lawson.<eos> Seize it with both hands!<eos> What are you smiling at?<eos> Ah! I surrender.<eos> If you can't appreciate the wonder of that painting, there's no hope for you - and that's speaking as a doctor.<eos> Your father would have hated it.
So why even try?<eos> I finally realized why Dorrit was so fixated on her goal of ruining the day.<eos> It had nothing to do with torturing me.<eos> Having Thanksgiving without my mom was torture for her.<eos> Dorrit, open the door.<eos> I'm not leaving until you let me in.<eos> Then you're gonna die out there.<eos> I smell pot.<eos> No doy.<eos> That's 'cause I'm smoking it.
Pick your battles, Brock.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Tell it to the senator.<eos> He's in your office.<eos> Senator Schumacher.<eos> There's a lacrosse stick in my bed.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Syracuse, Hopkins all the schools were all after Reed offering him full rides.<eos> He was lightning on the field.<eos> Now he's dead, and my wife she's got his lacrosse stick in our bed holding onto it every night as she cries.
Excuse me.<eos> Could you tell me where this is delivered to?<eos> Delivered each morning.<eos> Our presence here marked. City Police, sir.<eos> Let them mark it.<eos> It's a German named Koch that saw them first.<eos> Grew them too.<eos> Cholera bacillus in a jar.<eos> Saw how it loved dirt and dank earth, how it lived to breed and spread in river basins.<eos> And how if your glass was strong enough... ..you could actually see it in a man's gut.

He's smart.<eos> He took my magazines...<eos> Into the John.<eos> Who does that?<eos> I'd kill him.<eos> - I would.<eos> - Exactly, man.<eos> So I let him get in there and get settled.<eos> I walk over to the door.<eos> I kick it in, bam.
Come to the car!<eos> All right, just come here!<eos> Tim, come on!<eos> You let her go! Just put the rifle down!<eos> Police!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Put the gun down now!<eos> Put the gun down!<eos> Put your hands in the air now!<eos> Put it down now!
♪ Gonna dress you up in my love ♪<eos> ♪ The bitch is back<eos> Yeah! Wow, guys, that was incredible.<eos> What inspired that mashup?<eos> I mean, the thing was feuds so we just... So Unique demanded mediation.<eos> Might I suggest doing an Elton John/Madonna mashup?<eos> Madonna finally forgave Elton John for calling her "a fairground stripper" and saying that her career was over, but their decade-long feud was epic.<eos> Unique is, was, and ever shall be Madonna.<eos> He can try to be Sir Elton, but... you ain't got it.<eos> Well, the awesome things about feuds is that once all the anger has gotten out, you can shake on it and let bygones be bygones.
We're on the Internet.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> It's too horrible.<eos> Can you whisper it in my ear?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> See, everybody, by acting out our secret shames, like Carly's traumatic sense-memory of potty training, we become more vulnerable as actors.<eos> Kurt, you're up.<eos> You want to see some real acting?<eos> You're looking at it, because this is nothing compared to my real guilty secrets.
Kurt, you're up.<eos> You want to see some real acting?<eos> You're looking at it, because this is nothing compared to my real guilty secrets.<eos> And as a gay man, there are so many to pick from.<eos> Like my obsessive marathons - of powerhouse women-<eos> Golden Girls, Murder She Wrote, Moonlighting, Designing Women.<eos> Or my very private Sweatin' to the Oldies sessions on DVD with the uncompromising Richard Simmons.<eos> But my most secret, my most guilty pleasure of late?<eos> My boyfriend arm.<eos> I ordered it online one night while on Ambien.
No, friends who cheer you up by playing pranks on your other friend.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Maybe a mascara mustache for Lady Hummel, which would probably be the only facial hair he's ever had, or we could do that stick-his-hand-in-warm-water- make-him-wet-the-bed trick?<eos> Lady's choice.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Oh, my God, the curtain means privacy.<eos> Oh, my God, Kurt.<eos> That thing is really creepy.<eos> What is that?<eos> I thought it was stupid the first time I saw it, too, but I kept thinking about the ad.
You shut your mouth!<eos> And what about Rihanna?<eos> Do we really think that bad girl RiRi is some kind of a role model?<eos> I mean, she's the one who got back together with him.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Yes, seriously, we always do Rihanna songs, and do we always agree with everything that she says and does?<eos> Are we saying that it's okay to go back to somebody that abuses you?<eos> No, we're not.<eos> Look, all I am saying is that I think that we should be able to separate the art from the artist.<eos> Well, I don't think you should, and personally, I can't listen to his music without thinking about the horrible person behind it.
Dude, I'm just here for my bro, some brews and the bountiful Bettys.<eos> I love college!<eos> Yeah, college!<eos> Some dreams are bigger than others.<eos> Me being on Broadway, that's a big dream.<eos> Me being on Broadway in Funny Girl as Fanny Brice, inheriting the mantle of my idol, Ms. Barbra Streisand, that's the culmination of every dream I've ever had.<eos> Since its premiere in 1964, Funny Girl has never been revived on Broadway...<eos> no doubt because producers haven't been able to find an actress capable of filling Barbra's formidable shoes.<eos> Luckily, I've been grooming myself for this audition since I was five, which is when I first saw Funny Girl in all its Technicolor glory.<eos> I heard my dads use the phrase "star quality" before, but I never truly understood it until that moment.

- I'm here.<eos> Do you guys have vows prepared?<eos> - and... no. - No.<eos> You always get to make the romantic speeches, so, um, why don't you let me do it this time?<eos> I'd love that.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> There was this one day, um, right around the time that we first met.<eos> Um, out in the courtyard.<eos> And I had gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe, and you scraped it off with a credit card.
Around where?<eos> Around school, the entire school system.<eos> I'm gonna get algebra removed from the school curriculum.<eos> Well, unless you're going to make that to happen by Monday, I suggest you get on over to Kathy's and get some help with that midterm.<eos> What's the worst that can happen if I just fail algebra?<eos> I mean, I should fail, otherwise there's no point to my efforts to get algebra removed from schools.<eos> Ethan,<eos> I...<eos> I agree with you in that requiring all students to take algebra could possibly keep a student who's bad at algebra from succeeding in school overall.<eos> And even though algebra is used by accountants, financial planners, engineers, physicists, and a lot of occupations, not everyone does get algebra and not everyone uses it in their adult life.
We are trying to get a menace off the streets.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you... thirsty?<eos> No.<eos> Just dropping off an abandoned urn.<eos> With ashes in it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna leave it here while I try to track down the family.
So put yourself in my shoes.<eos> I definitely wouldn't have beat him up.<eos> Who's gonna fix the pipes now?<eos> Who's gonna rebuild the supermarket that burned down the day we got here?<eos> Huh?<eos> All these supermarkets going up in smoke everywhere we go.<eos> The plumber told me it might be the main water supply.<eos> I'm gonna see the mayor tomorrow.<eos> Oh, are you gonna whack the mayor now?<eos> Oh, no, I'm gonna take care of this thing and get to the bottom of it.
If our plan doesn't succeed, they will cease to exist.<eos> After all this time the feelings you had for these people... the feelings we all had,<eos> they have not grown in you?<eos> When we first came, when we started to experience emotive development by being in this era, we agreed, the 12 of us, to speak nothing of it.<eos> You lost control, as did August.<eos> When we first came here we did not know the true nature of our expedition.<eos> We were not told.<eos> The people of this era, this is their destiny.<eos> Destiny can be changed.<eos> But you have to have the will to change it... even if it requires sacrifice.
He's in the number six stairwell.<eos> B-Unit, cover the 61st Street exit.<eos> Subject is moving on foot.<eos> Repeat, he's in the number six stairwell.<eos> He knows that we know.<eos> You're saying we can't complete the plan because we're missing one single piece?<eos> Without the initiating reactor there's no way we can open the wormhole.<eos> There's simply not enough energy.<eos> I thought the rocks provided the energy.<eos> To sustain the reaction, not to trigger it.
He still helped them.<eos> Do you have any idea how lonely it feels?<eos> Having this discussion without him to back me up.<eos> If you want to know what loneliness feels like, ask his wife.<eos> And she could have done with some of that money.<eos> Were you having an affair with him?<eos> No.<eos> Do you have any idea who his clients were?<eos> He kept an appointment book.<eos> I never saw it, never knew their names.

But I wound up taking early retirement to pursue my other dream.<eos> I wanted to invent something that would change the world, make life better for people.<eos> This is one I'm working on now.<eos> I haven't quite got the bugs worked out of it yet.<eos> You know when your feet are hot? You don't want to put on a hot shoe, do you?<eos> You want a nice, cool shoe.<eos> So this is a shoe tree.<eos> You insert this into the shoe and flip on this little fan.<eos> You see?<eos> And what it does-- it cools the actual shoe before you put it on.
He's good at that. "That's real magic."<eos> This was all 20 years ago.<eos> What did August just do to Tim?<eos> I wish we could ask him.<eos> But we can't.<eos> But we could do the next best thing.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You want to leak our tape?<eos> It's not exactly our tape.<eos> Well, you did send it to me, right?
Levator scapulae muscle strain.<eos> That should do it.<eos> I should, uh, actually get going.<eos> What...what about your drink?<eos> Um, I don't usually drink with clients.<eos> So, I'll get my office to invoice you.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> - See you!<eos> Huh.<eos> I'm gonna find my Levator scapula and sever it later tonight.
We're doing this now.<eos> Uhh.<eos> I'm--I'm sorry.<eos> Um...<eos> I'm sorry that I've been a pain in the ass.<eos> Um, can I, like, buy you lunch or something?<eos> My treat.<eos> Well, Claudia gave me the money, but...<eos> Well, thanks, but I got paperwork.<eos> Yeah, looks like mountains of it.
Nevertheless, if you want my half, it's going to cost you.<eos> Good, fine-- what's the price?<eos> Oh, no, no, I'm not interested in chump change, Mr. Nielsen.<eos> No, no, I have got my eye on a far greater prize.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Dan Seavey was one of the most successful pirates of his time.<eos> His unrecovered fortune would be worth, whew, tens of millions today.<eos> But, you see, I need your half of the puzzle box to get it.<eos> - We don't have the puzzle box.<eos> - I don't have it.
Just bag it.<eos> Hurry!<eos> Uh...<eos> Claud, are you gonna fill me in?<eos> Franz Mesmer's magnets.<eos> They create illusion through the power of suggestion.<eos> I'll give you one guess who slipped them to us.<eos> Nick?<eos> Oh, thanks, but I got paperwork.<eos> Looks like mountains of it.

Among other things.<eos> Sutton said that a stone kept him from aging.<eos> - Not just him.<eos> - Clearly.<eos> And now you've got...<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Oh, just half the stone?<eos> Where's the other half?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I need to find it.
No, of course not.<eos> Did you get through to Pete Olsson?<eos> Just to his office.<eos> He wasn't there.<eos> He doesn't want to see me, does he?<eos> Some people have a problem dealing with the past.<eos> Not you, though.<eos> But I'm sure he'll come round.<eos> Your chariot awaits.<eos> I got it in yellow.
"Not only am I concerned for my safety, but the safety of our son and the citizens of Los Angeles."<eos> I got physical because I was attacked.<eos> In the moment, I relied on my training, followed protocol, and subdued Tammi with minimal, yet...<eos> necessary force.<eos> Did you or did you not choke Ms. Bryant and throw her head against a generator?<eos> I-I did not.<eos> Her boyfriend, Victor Sifuentes, is claiming there's a video of the incident, which shows you, in uniform, losing control.<eos> Says you seized his camcorder before departing. Is that true?<eos> No, I did not lose control.<eos> Mr. Sifuentes shoved a camera in my face, and, feeling threatened, I took it away from him.

He had every reason to spill.<eos> Plus, he did not flinch when they asked him about the green-and-red Civic.<eos> Oh, and I got the gang detectives running, uh, Chris through their system, every spelling, even with a "Q."<eos> I wouldn't put it past these fools.<eos> If, um, anything jumps out at them and they can't reach me while I'm in the air, I told them to give you a call.<eos> No worries.<eos> I got you.<eos> Keep a hard-on for that car.<eos> Yeah. You know what?<eos> I'm gonna find it, all right?
She's all right, man.<eos> Yeah? No. It's all right.<eos> You okay?<eos> Alive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, after you left...<eos> I started thinking.<eos> If I were an asshole who robbed a cop, I thought maybe somebody saw my car, what would I do?<eos> I'd probably ditch it, right?
Little Al. Oh, yeah.<eos> Nice one, Chop! There you are, Finn.<eos> Nice one, mate!<eos> Raemundo.<eos> What's up with you? You all right?<eos> No, I've...<eos> I've got a tummy ache. Oh, damn.<eos> Better be OK for tomorrow.<eos> Like the shirt?<eos> Why don't you try it on? I dunno.

Chop? "All right, Rae!"<eos> So how do you host a sexy party?<eos> "Whoo! Yes!"<eos> All right, Rae?<eos> Mwah! All right, Rae.<eos> Give us a hug.<eos> No.<eos> I've got a no-hugging policy.<eos> You just hugged Archie.<eos> Yeah, I just implemented it in the last few seconds.
Chop, sexy parties aren't as big as normal parties, are they?<eos> No. It's very much an intimate affair.<eos> Just a few guests.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> Chloe.<eos> What?<eos> - What? I've got a bit of a problem.<eos> Well, what's up?<eos> I've got therapy in an hour.<eos> Skip it.
Yeah.<eos> Right, come on.<eos> Noise.<eos> Music.<eos> All right?<eos> Will he be all right?<eos> Yeah, he's fine.<eos> Do you need your hat back?<eos> No, mate, it's yours.<eos> You can keep it.
What am I gonna do?<eos> Okay, I'm flattered that I'm your go-to guy for off-the-book advice, but do you realize you completely screwed us on a key piece of evidence?<eos> So much for a sympathetic ear.<eos> Megan, she went to the guy's room, took the shirt without a warrant.<eos> It's completely inadmissible.<eos> So she wasn't thinking clearly.<eos> Her job is to think clearly.<eos> Look, she should've come to us first.<eos> This is a piece of evidence we could've nailed this guy with, and now it's off the table.<eos> What if I just put it back?

What?<eos> It's getting late.<eos> As soon as he saw the wire, he grabbed his keys and a gun and took off.<eos> Adam, he's on the run.<eos> Have them lock the hotel down.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> God, I'm such an idiot.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself.<eos> You put the shirt back. We can use it as evidence.
None of this adds up.<eos> All right, if he's had immunity all along, why did he run?<eos> Because the police were chasing him?<eos> Or maybe he's not done with whatever he came here to do.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look at these.<eos> Look what they all have in common.<eos> A necklace.<eos> She's wearing it in every photo.<eos> - It's like she never took it off.
A necklace.<eos> She's wearing it in every photo.<eos> - It's like she never took it off.<eos> - Right.<eos> But she wasn't wearing it when we found her.<eos> That abrasion on her neck.<eos> What do you bet the links on this necklace match those marks?<eos> That the killer snatched it off her neck?<eos> Yeah, we didn't find anything like it in Sergei's things.<eos> Maybe he took it as a trophy to give it to his employer.
Sam Porter.<eos> Dixie Mafia thug, served eight years of a 10-year stint for attempted murder, Trustee with the prison. I know this dude.<eos> - You do?<eos> What bag?<eos> The bag I showed him last night.<eos> Raylan, on a scale from one to a shit load, how much do you need to tell me right now?<eos> So, Arlo didn't say anything about the ID or the bag?<eos> Just got him to admit he knew it was hidden in the wall.<eos> Why would your father do that?<eos> Why would he hide a Panamanian diplomatic bag in the wall or murder someone for just laying eyes on it? Either.
Sorry.<eos> No.<eos> You have nothing to say sorry for.<eos> I'm gonna need some more of this.<eos> I'll make some up.<eos> You know, just when I'm feeling sorry for myself, I start thinking of the poor professor.<eos> He left me a card the night he died, but we were in Melbourne.<eos> Really?<eos> What did it say?<eos> Would you mind if I hung onto it?
She seems so blissfully happy.<eos> I'm sure she is.<eos> So how is she?<eos> Devastated.<eos> I suppose her health will improve for a while, now she doesn't have all those poisons in her system.<eos> It most certainly will.<eos> Here we are.<eos> And congratulations, eh?<eos> Honourable mention.<eos> I don't deserve it.

Guess how many fingers on my left hand?<eos> Five.<eos> You lose. Four fingers.<eos> What kind of fucked up game is this anyway?<eos> It's hot in here. Are you boys having fun?<eos> You're here for it too, right?<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> The hangzhou half doesn't interest you?<eos> That's none of your business. You already lost the taipei half. You don't want to lose this half, do you?<eos> I can help you secure it. And then I can make a fortune.
It's not here.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, to ask you these questions again.<eos> Can you think of anyone who might've wanted to hurt her?<eos> You just set him free.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Greenwood. Thank you, sir.<eos> The Greenwoods won't be adding you to their Christmas list any time soon.<eos> Now what?<eos> We keep looking for that bag.<eos> She babysat at the Jacobs.<eos> Maybe she left it there. You still think Jacobs is good for it?
But first I must deal with treason within the ranks... the two renegades who voted against the bill.<eos> I have zero tolerance for betrayal, which they will soon indelibly learn.<eos> I know why you lost the vote.<eos> Somebody got to Vanderburgh and Abrams.<eos> Remy Danton.<eos> Your wife.<eos> I've got contacts on both their staffs.<eos> There was a meeting between the three of them.<eos> I know.<eos> I arranged it.
Shortly after we took over.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> It's all right, Betty.<eos> I'll talk to Dr. Crayden about upping your chlorpromazine levels.<eos> Everything's going to be all right.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct honor to welcome to Newman's Books the writer of...<eos> Maniac:<eos> One Woman's Story of Survival.<eos> It's been on The New York Times Best Seller list for... ten weeks now.<eos> The book is a sensation, and after devouring it in one sitting, I can honestly say... she's my hero.
All this would be so much easier if I didn't...<eos> You're emoting, Henry.<eos> Continue.<eos> Whatever feelings I have for Jo are not relevant.<eos> I have to protect her from Adam.<eos> I know what I have to do...<eos> Whether she hates me for it or not.<eos> Lucas, there's a knife in evidence lockup.<eos> I need to do a metallurgy test on it.<eos> Could you fetch it for me, please?
Smile.<eos> Sara, Sara come on, come in!<eos> Thanks, I'm Jamie.<eos> Do you want to come out with us on Saturday night?<eos> Just down to like the pub.<eos> Thomas will be there and stuff.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It's like a gropey club.<eos> They've gone there for years.<eos> I'd like to see it.
She had to shoot him?<eos> Self-defense?<eos> What happened has been hard for all of us to accept.<eos> But I don't accept it.<eos> If all this hadn't happened, we'd be having her funeral right now.<eos> You were gonna kill Victoria?<eos> My brother values our secrets.<eos> He'll do anything to keep 'em buried.<eos> I found the envelope - you were looking for.<eos> - Would you destroy it, please?
Wait for me.<eos> - What... what are you gonna do?<eos> - Fix it.<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad, stop!<eos> Please!<eos> Dad, please.<eos> Say something.<eos> Why did you put that flashlight back in my truck?<eos> The detective was looking for it, and she wouldn't leave you alone.

How exactly did she manage to get her hands on a gun?<eos> Security ID'd Noah Bennet, and...<eos> Well, there's no way to put this delicately.<eos> He was with your daughter.<eos> Bring them to me.<eos> What about epic?<eos> Local tracking still functions properly.<eos> As long as you're within 100 feet of an evo, they'll all register on the device.<eos> But remote locations? Not without the girl.<eos> At least tell me we found it before she died.
What are they doing here?<eos> Some kind of scavenger hunt.<eos> Renautas publishes the "Evernow" game, so they're taking photographs of themselves at different locations on the campus.<eos> A Japanese gamer named Ren Shimosawa set it up.<eos> The girls are dressed as--<eos> Katana Girl.<eos> Hmm. Miko Otomo.<eos> This is a Trojan horse to get past security.<eos> She's here for the sword.<eos> Get it out of here and to my house.
If she's a dangle, she's learned something about you.<eos> You're Bill Adams.<eos> You've never been involved in an operation before?<eos> No.<eos> Great.<eos> The meet is in two hours.<eos> Debriefings work on details.<eos> That's how you trip up someone trying to lie to you.<eos> Her file is on the computer next door.<eos> I read it already.
George Bisset.<eos> I'm the new owner of Newton.<eos> - You say you heard them screwing?<eos> - Yes, I did, sir.<eos> And you kept the sheets as I asked you to.<eos> Yes, I have, Mr Farrar.<eos> Foul state they was in as well.<eos> Well, then...<eos> This is Lady Worsley's riding crop.<eos> See if she'll claim it and give her real name.
Maybe we should all go to Macy's and exchange the laptop.<eos> That way we won't be killed.<eos> What?<eos> I just got an idea.<eos> - To do what?<eos> - Save us.<eos> But you said the hard drive was destroyed.<eos> What can you do?<eos> It is, but the solid-state layer is still intact.<eos> If I can encrypt it, the Rezident won't see this.
I checked. No paper connection.<eos> You know, I could dress up as a grieving daughter, pretend...<eos> And what?<eos> Poke around? See if you find the drugs?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Look, you want everything at once, right this second.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> Okay? But trust me, fight it.<eos> You'll get stabbed less.<eos> Just give me the list, and I'll go over it while I'm baking your cake.
We're looking for any other women in his life.<eos> Maybe one of them was willing to go to more extreme measures to break up with him?<eos> I think I'm gonna call it a day.<eos> Oh, what's the rush?<eos> Isn't tonight the big sleepover with the twins and Grandpa Leo?<eos> 'Tis.<eos> So you're off duty all night.<eos> Actually, I have plans.<eos> I promised my DVR that there would be some serious binge-watching.<eos> I don't want to let it down.
-This is Nucleus?<eos> -Yep. That is a beta of their entire mobile platform, and it sucks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, the UX is, like, Soviet-era.<eos> When it stores photos, they actually get larger.<eos> They never cracked middle-out.<eos> I actually kind of wish you didn't show me this, because now I know we totally would have beaten them.<eos> As it is now, I mean, we can't get funded. All of our new coders quit.<eos> I mean, can you even imagine what would happen if, like, a tech blog got their hands on that piece of shit?<eos> They'd tear it apart.
You're never gonna sell. - What?<eos> - Look what's happening here.<eos> It's magical.<eos> The only thing magical is how much this house has appreciated in the last three years, Jared.<eos> I'm selling.<eos> That's just money.<eos> It has no real value.<eos> It literally defines value.<eos> Look at this check.<eos> You can't actually cash it, but think about what it represents.
Don't restart it.<eos> We won.<eos> - Yeah, we beat Gavin Belson, and we won.<eos> - We won?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> We won.<eos> What the fuck happened here?<eos> Magic.<eos> Gilfoyle's shit hardware caught fire.<eos> No, 'cause your shit software was slowing it down.
No, he rescued him because you were holding him against his will.<eos> I have scientists and engineers there.<eos> Right now, in the future.<eos> But they are cut off.<eos> Cut off from the present, from their families.<eos> If the bridge doesn't reopen, no one will escape the H.E.L.E.<eos> That's why I need you.<eos> None of this is the prophecy.<eos> We're supposed to stop the apocalypse.<eos> Tommy... there is no stopping it.
Nakano send you after me?<eos> What?<eos> Look, I don't care how many drunk ninjas he throws at me.<eos> That kamikaze prick's not sending my company to the bank for a frozen corpse.<eos> Corpse.<eos> This is where you get the virus.<eos> Virus?<eos> There's a virus in that thing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you're gonna help me destroy it.
We've known of you for a long time, Traveler.<eos> You were born Jose Ramse.<eos> You had a child.<eos> You are now separated from him by a great distance.<eos> Join me, Traveler.<eos> And forever he will be safe from those who seek to erase him.<eos> You are not alone, Traveler.<eos> You are important, valued, loved.<eos> I know you want to fight back against your tormenter.<eos> But there is a better way, and I can show it to you.
Leland Goines has been murdered.<eos> We received a call from the mental institution.<eos> Jennifer Goines is talking about the Night Room.<eos> I believe this means we can pursue.<eos> Jennifer gave us the location of the Night Room, but the origin of the virus was destroyed by James Cole.<eos> Why would you allow us to be set up for failure?<eos> The period of interference must be maintained.<eos> There's something you're not telling me.<eos> This cycle must happen exactly as it has, otherwise the Traveler will have never come.<eos> We must maintain it.

Whoever it is, I think it's unrealistic to expect that this stays secret.<eos> We have to meet with the Germans.<eos> It's already set.<eos> Good.<eos> They're going to shit.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> My name is Carrie Mathison.<eos> I'm from the During Foundation.<eos> We funded the construction of your gym.<eos> Ah, you must come back later if you wish to see it.
The magician, Stephen.<eos> He is our enemy.<eos> We must destroy him utterly and take his wife.<eos> Oh, Stephen.<eos> You are brilliant.<eos> Of course, it will be very hard to find, but it will destroy him utterly.<eos> What will, sir?<eos> Moss-oak.<eos> We must find and awaken a moss-oak.<eos> If we use it well, the magician will bargain her life away.
Skye, tell me we got it?<eos> (Sighs) No.<eos> Assistant director: It's gonna take an hour to reset.<eos> An hour?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Ok everybody, gather up!<eos> All right, round two. "Butts up."<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Ball comes to you and you miss it, you've got to run and touch the wall before someone throws you out.
Now we show it in cold, hard numbers.<eos> It is time to unite.<eos> I will depart from camp at once and not rest until I see this into the hand of King Louis himself.<eos> Aw... afraid I can't let you do that, "de Frenchy."<eos> It's Brewster, sir.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - Just not why you speak.<eos> Sir, King George, he knows his ledger's been stolen, right?<eos> He's dispatched Robert Rogers to retrieve it.
None of you are coming, except you.<eos> What?<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> I'm not going anywhere, not without everyone in here.<eos> You don't have a choice, son.<eos> Listen, I remember what I said last night, and I meant every word.<eos> I think you're the most wonderful...<eos> I think I'm falling in love.<eos> Nice kiss.<eos> I hope he remembers it.
their bottom line.<eos> Which is what we're doing here.<eos> [SIX] No.<eos> Ferrous Corp. doesn't care about their men. They'll just get more.<eos> Ships, on the other hand, are a lot harder to come by, and a hell of a lot more expensive.<eos> You're saying we take out their ship?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh man.<eos> Well, I like the idea in theory, but it begs the question:<eos> How do we get it down here?
You can get out.<eos> You're no use to anyone.<eos> Let me just say that this...<eos> this is Australia.<eos> Not Russia!<eos> So now you've got a problem with the revolution!<eos> What are you - a bloody idiot?<eos> You think a bunch of words is going to change the world?<eos> Why don't you hand your card in?<eos> Go on, throw it on the table.
Why aren't you at the RAAF, wing walking or something?<eos> Now, that won't score you any points.<eos> I've managed to score a few without you.<eos> European Club - haunt of militant unionists, including the Amalgamated Mechanics and committed red-ragger Rupert Higgins.<eos> The logical deduction with the union trouble at the RAAF, Higgins' file, belonging to an unlawful association charge, dismissed ten years ago.<eos> Sedition charge still pending.<eos> Do you think our victim was passing James Manning information?<eos> It could explain what she was doing near the base with his keys.<eos> What about next of kin on Manning's military file?<eos> You should be impressed I managed to get his service number before Compton whisked it away.
I was trying to keep the rest safe.<eos> I knew Dr Perkins wanted to popularise his device, but Dr Samuels disagreed.<eos> So Dr Perkins was pursuing it alone.<eos> And for that, he would need funds.<eos> Dr Samuels was never convinced of the percussor's therapeutic value, but we're sitting on a goldmine.<eos> With such different views to Dr Samuels, why didn't you just leave the practice?<eos> Well, how can I hang my shingle out anywhere?<eos> As a physician, I'm tarred with the same brush.<eos> I had to do something.<eos> Given your commercial interest in the percussor, it makes perfect sense for you to remove it from the scene of the crime.

Just need to make absolutely sure.<eos> ~ Excuse me, Mr Edwards?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> Found this is the driveway, doesn't belong to the doctors.<eos> Look familiar?<eos> Oh, yes, I was looking for that.<eos> You think I killed Betsy?<eos> Harriet told you that Betsy was blackmailing her, and she'd arranged for Betsy to have access to the percussor the morning she died.<eos> So you arrived early for your appointment, unseen by anyone, as you'd done on many other mornings.<eos> And sabotaged the percussor after Harriet left it for Betsy.
The morning newspapers reported an unidentified man had been dragged from the River Thames, strangled before his body was dumped in the early hours.<eos> How do you know it was the man your father argued with?<eos> The newspapers described the heavy coat he was wearing.<eos> Have you ever spoken to him about it?<eos> I've accused my father of a lot of things, Jack... .. but not murder.<eos> What is it we're looking for?<eos> Whatever it is Miss Fisher thinks she's trying to hide.<eos> Keep a look out.<eos> A locked drawer's a good start.<eos> Will you be able to break it open?
~ When exactly did he disappear?<eos> City South Police.<eos> Inspector Robinson.<eos> Prudence Stanley here.<eos> Could I speak to my niece, please?<eos> It's your aunt.<eos> ~ Aunt Prudence?<eos> ~ 'Phryne? '<eos> I was wondering if you were planning to return for lunch today.<eos> I've decided to stay because Mr Butler is making shepherd's pie and you know how much I love it.
~ What other one?<eos> This is No.11. The 12th photo is missing too - where is it?<eos> I thought there was only this one.<eos> Excuse me, Miss Fisher, but we're about to start.<eos> Miss Lombard to serve.<eos> (Not behind your base line, Constance.<eos> Move forward! )<eos> I can't believe that man's still walking around after what he tried to do to you.<eos> Why would Angela lie about buying that 12th photo?<eos> Unless she didn't buy it.
Possibly, but with no feet, and a glowing ring around its neck.<eos> The gatekeeper's convinced it was an alien.<eos> Or someone more ecclesiastical.<eos> Psalms 19.<eos> We had this reading at last Sunday's mass.<eos> - Where did you find this?<eos> - Do you recognise the handwriting, Dot?<eos> It looks a lot like Father O'Leary's.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I know it from our church meetings.
Sick of it.<eos> Our farming changed the genetic structure of wheat faster than we could evolve alongside it, Bread is low in essential nutrients.<eos> - It makes you more hungry.<eos> Fucking gluten, Josh.<eos> Fuck off, gluten.<eos> You bloat me, gluten.<eos> Yeah. Mmm.<eos> So, I was just thinking maybe it's just okay to eat bread sometimes. No!<eos> I can't!<eos> You might be able to eat it just once, But I'm not strong enough in moral character. Shh.
Hey, Adele.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Yes, Adele, I'm sorry, Ok?<eos> I'm sorry, it's just gonna be really gross to eat you if you've already eaten, Ok?<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> Try harder climbing up the food chain.<eos> Ella's refusing to come over anymore.<eos> You two really fucked me.<eos> I had a tiny light of happiness and you stamped it out.
I mean, I do not want to go into your bedroom without you.<eos> Go.<eos> Dad?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Which bits are okay to touch?<eos> Zero bits.<eos> You okay? Yeah.<eos> Why are you in Tom's room?<eos> Um, I was just curious about his exercise bike.<eos> He found it on the street.
I like outie vaginas.<eos> They're really friendly.<eos> They're like, "hey, how's it goin'?"<eos> -Well, I think you have a beautiful vagina.<eos> -Does claire have an outie?<eos> -Well, this feels like a trap.<eos> -Hey, hey, take a look at this pimple for me.<eos> -Ooh.<eos> -This one.<eos> Do you think I should pop it?

-Did you sneak licorice into the shopping?<eos> Oh, it's yucky!<eos> 3:00?<eos> Yeah, no, I'll definitely be home by 3:00.<eos> Yeah, it'll be good to see you too, yeah.<eos> Yeah, life certainly does get busy, yep.<eos> No, you hang up first.<eos> -Hannah, there's no more room for the groceries in the kitchen.<eos> -We're losing the blender. -Huh?<eos> -My ex. Debbie wants it back. -Oh, shit.
We can stick to our plan, babe.<eos> Come on, w-we can go north from here.<eos> Growing old together was our plan.<eos> Our plan now is to beat this cancer, okay?<eos> That's me making up my mind.<eos> Paulette...<eos> I am so sorry that you have to experience this.<eos> This kind of thing is curable now, right?<eos> At least, there's a chance.<eos> The cancer had already spread when they discovered it.

What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Jess asked me to clear out Tom's room.<eos> She just can't.<eos> Hey, do you still have Jess' house key?<eos> We should really get that back.<eos> I don't know where Nat keeps it, but I'll take a look.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> I asked mom if we could come home.<eos> She said no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> W-we're gonna figure it out, all right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, sweetie, do you know where Nat kept the key to Jess' house?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, we don't need it anymore, and, Jess' sister asked for it back.
God, Christy, be reasonable!<eos> Ben, I'm asking you politely.<eos> Please, do not come here.<eos> Merry Xmas, bi-otch!<eos> Okay, that hat...<eos> You like it?<eos> Who did you steal it from?<eos> Bite me.<eos> Hey, I got you a present.<eos> I put a little thought into it, but I'll be cool if you don't want to keep it.
Or he could... maybe it was an accident.<eos> Tom would have let me in.<eos> You don't got your flashlight.<eos> - What?<eos> - Listen.<eos> You get out of the cab.<eos> You go to Jess'.<eos> You don't have your flashlight!<eos> Yeah, but I could have...<eos> Stopped and picked it up on the way to the woods.
He wants to be.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> If I had a sweet, smart, loving, handsome little guy like you... there's nothing in the world I wouldn't do to let him know I loved him.<eos> Getting sleepy?<eos> Good night, little man.<eos> What's today, my fine fellow?<eos> Today?<eos> Why, Christmas day!<eos> Christmas day.<eos> I haven't missed it.
Maybe late 40s, early 50s.<eos> He hit Victor across the back of the head.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I just froze.<eos> I mean, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.<eos> And then I took off to try and help.<eos> What happened next?<eos> The guy crouched down.<eos> That's when I saw the gun.<eos> He pointed it at Victor's head. That's when I heard the gunshot.
I'm 20.<eos> What's with this Keno guy?<eos> What does it even mean?<eos> Is he Japanese?<eos> No, Keno is just short for Kevin Norbert.<eos> He's called Kevin Norbert?<eos> Yes. Rolf Horst.<eos> - Here's your knife.<eos> - Keep it, it's a present.<eos> - I can't accept it.
- That's right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You stabbed yourself in the neck.<eos> - I didn't...<eos> - Oh, sure, that happens a lot.<eos> - People stab themselves.<eos> - Sticking to that story.<eos> If you hadn't stolen my knife in the first place, none of it would've ever happened.<eos> I was eight years old.<eos> I was looking at it 'cause I was a curious little kid.

We got to have it.<eos> You know, about the next step.<eos> Yeah. Right, I know that.<eos> Okay, baseball's not here.<eos> It's the wrong box.<eos> Yeah, but what are these?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> What the hell did I do with my baseball?<eos> What could these be? Oh, my God.<eos> I could've sworn I put it up there.
Okay, just...<eos> - We will.<eos> - We're clear about this.<eos> - Yeah, just... - Uh-huh.<eos> (Sydney) Mom.<eos> Mom, why is the door locked?<eos> This is confusing.<eos> Get... hide.<eos> Um, the door's locked because I am looking for my robe, sweetheart.<eos> And let me find it.
No, I mean...<eos> and it's not a metaphor.<eos> I really wanted to kill them, all right?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I mean, they'd be running around, they'd be screaming and...<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Oh, my gosh.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just... I just remembered, they wanted to play with my baseball, so I hid it from 'em, and I know where I put it.

Whoa. Look.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> (Zeek) Millie.<eos> Yeah, I'm in here.<eos> Come and look at these pictures that Max developed.<eos> No, later, later.<eos> I'm just way too excited.<eos> I remembered what happened to my Reggie Jackson baseball.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> You remember Adam and Crosby used to play with it all the time, so I took it, and I put it in a shoe box, and I hid it up in the rafters in the old barn.
You're killing me, dude.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Thank you. (door opens over phone)<eos> All right, I'm in the men's room by the urinals here.<eos> Can't... Whoa!<eos> Uh... What happened?<eos> Uh, I-I slipped on your dick.<eos> Then it flew in the air.<eos> I landed on my back, and I guess my mouth was open, 'cause it fell right in my mouth.<eos> And then, I spat it out and, well, long story short, it's in the toilet.

There's plenty more where she came from!<eos> Go.<eos> ... London?<eos> For God's sake, go to London and find your friend. Please!<eos> Are you going?<eos> Good luck.<eos> Aye-aye.<eos> I found her heading out, like she was she running away.<eos> No.<eos> I sent her to check the van, I think I left it unlocked.
Are you going?<eos> Good luck.<eos> Aye-aye.<eos> I found her heading out, like she was she running away.<eos> No.<eos> I sent her to check the van, I think I left it unlocked.<eos> That's right, isn't it, Zara?<eos> Check van.<eos> Come back.<eos> I'll check it now, I've got to go and park properly.
For what?<eos> To get Callie emancipated.<eos> If we can get Callie emancipated before the waiting period is up, then she's no longer a ward of the state.<eos> She's considered an adult and wouldn't need anyone's consent to be adopted by us.<eos> And what if Robert finds out?<eos> Or the judge?<eos> No, emancipation petitions aren't heard in family court.<eos> And Robert wouldn't find out.<eos> If Callie doesn't tell him, which is asking her to do exactly what we accused Robert of.<eos> To give her a choice, not take it away.
If she didn't have it on her phone, how did she send it?<eos> Well, that's the thing.<eos> I went through 972 photos on Zoey's cell.<eos> Photo wasn't there.<eos> I mean, I checked e-mails...<eos> Nothing.<eos> Then I went to look for the text that she sent her dad this morning.<eos> See... there's no way she sent that text.<eos> I mean, Zoey's phone died on Friday at 11:10 p.m.<eos> It wasn't turned on until you plugged it in this morning around 9:00 a.m.
And you tried to escape?<eos> Upstairs.<eos> But he followed me.<eos> We struggled.<eos> And he pushed me.<eos> I...<eos> I fell off the balcony.<eos> When I saw him coming down the stairs, I knew it wasn't over.<eos> That's when you went for the gun?<eos> Tell me again where you got it.

Oh, you mean the basement.<eos> Earlier, you said you found the gun when you moved stuff into the basement.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> It's...<eos> It's hard to talk.<eos> Um...<eos> I meant I was moving stuff from the basement into the attic when I found it.
I reverse time-stamped a call from Emily's phone<eos> - to yours last night to support her story.<eos> - Good.<eos> 'Cause I know one cop who's gonna be looking into it.<eos> Well, anyone searching for Agent Taylor will begin in Miami.<eos> I sent our, uh, dread pirate Malcolm texts from her phone and dropped a trail of digital breadcrumbs indicating a long-awaited last-minute vacation.<eos> That phone's gonna be a problem, man.<eos> It...<eos> It's got GPS.<eos> If Malcolm tracks it, we're all...
It communicates directly with Langley, the Pentagon, the White House sit room.<eos> The intel being squeezed out of these targets, our highest-level targets, is mission-critical.<eos> We needed our interrogators and our operatives in the field working together in real time, so we removed any latency between the time we received a lead and our ability to act on it.<eos> You put an access point to the country's most sensitive data in a prison... with the country's most dangerous enemies?<eos> Yes.<eos> Which is why I am asking you-- do not release that code.<eos> Sir, Braxton's back online.<eos> Cooper.<eos> The code.<eos> If I give it to you, what assurance do I have that no hostages will be harmed?
Lost how?<eos> In Mexico, there are these fish that have colonized the freshwater caves along Sierra del Abra.<eos> They were lost.<eos> They found themselves living in complete darkness.<eos> But they didn't die. Instead, they thrived.<eos> They adapted.<eos> They lost their pigmentation, their sight, eventually even their eyes.<eos> With survival, they became... hideous.<eos> I've rarely thought about what I once... was.<eos> But I wonder if a ray of light were to make it into the cave, would I be able to see it?
Down here-- the boiler room!<eos> Take her to Braxton.<eos> Paper-Dog, we are 10-zero minutes from primary target.<eos> Requesting authorization to arm and engage.<eos> You can't let this happen.<eos> Don't put this on me.<eos> You gave up that code.<eos> You have three federal agents and at least 40 innocent hostages in that facility.<eos> Inmates included, over a hundred lives will be lost.<eos> I don't agree with this course of action, but I understand it.
I would bet dollars to diatoms that is where your substance came from.<eos> How are we supposed to figure out where it is with pelican pee?<eos> The Audubon Society created a sanctuary in Terrebonne Parish for birds who were hurt in the Deepwater Horizon spill.<eos> There's plenty of brown pelicans there.<eos> And lots of square footage.<eos> Oh, let me help you with that.<eos> You know what, no matter how many times I tell a bad guy that cell phones are gonna undo them, they never seem to learn.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, Dante seems to cycle through ten or 12 phones.<eos> He uses one phone, then he shuts it off, then he's on to the next phone.
This contact in washington, but they don't steal it!<eos> Well, they're either the killers, or they're dead.<eos> Who else?<eos> They're the only ones I know of.<eos> [ sighs ] oh, god.<eos> Look, every month, they put a crate on a tugboat.<eos> The tugboat comes down the river.<eos> I unload said crate --<eos> That's me, by the way -- I hide it in the woods,<eos> And then trippi's guys pick it up And distribute to their buyers.
- You read the book?<eos> - No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have a good rest.<eos> Gun it, bitch, without that cocaine, I can't control the other werewolves.<eos> Um, I'm confused.<eos> Chris Rock is killing all the werewolves, but he is also a werewolf.<eos> This movie makes no sense.<eos> I love it.
Bitch, dur, dur, dur, dur, dur.<eos> Who else would be my focal point?<eos> Also, I wanna do it in one of those birthing pools, and I feel like my apartment is just... it's dirty, and there's a lot of traffic around it.<eos> I thought maybe I could do it here.<eos> In the living room.<eos> You know, don't... don't push away the idea of doing it right in my bedroom, though.<eos> We can get my bed out.<eos> You know, I'll move all my stuff out.<eos> We'll just put your birthing pool, you know, in here.<eos> - We'll bring it in.
I am really glad I'm here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, this is for the swelling of your face.<eos> Just rest on it.<eos> Okay, Jaimé, now, we have to do the two most important things a dental surgery victim needs.<eos> What is it?<eos> - Give her Froyo and braid her hair.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Okay, I need you to go 42 Squirts, and get me a real Abbi flavor.<eos> You'll know when you see it.
What's gotten into you?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Carol.<eos> Just coming down for dinner, as I do.<eos> So you got rid of the beard.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Thought that was kind of cool.<eos> You did?<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, your chin is... too pointy.<eos> You just need something to smooth it out.
She has a child!<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> A little boy.<eos> Did you even think about that?<eos> !<eos> Look, I panicked.<eos> I panicked, okay?<eos> And I-I went for the safety gun, and then... then,<eos> Mark lunged for it, and it... and it went off.<eos> And he lun... he fell back, and he hit his head, and then, Cindy was screaming, and then... and then... and then, Anna got the gun, and then, I got it back.
- Guys. There is no alien.<eos> - But, Velma, we all saw it.<eos> Oh, I forgot.<eos> You're the expert now.<eos> Are you still mad at me because I scared higher than you an the test?<eos> And have better hair?<eos> Guys. I need you to take a break from arguing.<eos> We're a team.<eos> There's only one way to find out if this alien is real or not.<eos> We've gotta catch it.
- Yes. - The alien.<eos> You caught the alien.<eos> - Yes. - The alien.<eos> You caught the alien.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Does anyone have a spare hair dryer?<eos> I seem ta...<eos> The alien.<eos> You caught the alien.<eos> Yes. We caught it.
- It is real.<eos> - I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> Shannon Lucas.<eos> - But haw?<eos> - Why?<eos> Who?<eos> Oh, right, it's Shannon.<eos> That's right, it was Shannon.<eos> Being an astronaut made her the perfect alien.<eos> She knew how to adjust the frequency of a micro-radar transmitter... to turn it into a devastating sonic weapon.
So now what?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Breakfast?<eos> There's no I.D., no clues, but... 200 bucks.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Pancakes?<eos> Vince.<eos> Yeah, I'm on my way.<eos> Dwight is giving the crystal to Croatoan.<eos> He's getting it from his hiding place right now.
Pancakes?<eos> Vince.<eos> Yeah, I'm on my way.<eos> Dwight is giving the crystal to Croatoan.<eos> He's getting it from his hiding place right now.<eos> But you're the controller.<eos> I thought that made you the crystal.<eos> Thus, my apprehension and reason for my call.<eos> Why is Dwight doing this?<eos> He thinks the crystal is useless to us now, and if he gives it to Croatoan, Croatoan will give him this in exchange.
Wow! You'll thank me when she gets a gold star.<eos> Can Daddy come for dinner?<eos> Would you like to join us?<eos> Richard's parents are in town, so he's been cooking up a storm.<eos> Oh, I should take a rain check.<eos> Sutter called as if the office was on fire.<eos> No telling how long it'll take me to put it out.<eos> Hey, Richard.<eos> Raylan. Richard, my daddy and I found a baby frog.<eos> Can we take it home?
Get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Kneel down.<eos> You don't need to do this.<eos> Not so tough now, are you, amigo?<eos> Anything you wanna say before I blow your brains out?<eos> I shoulda killed you when I had the chance.<eos> Drop the gun.<eos> I said drop the gun.<eos> Put it on the ground.

- Okay, okay.<eos> Just don't hurt her!<eos> - Ow!<eos> I swear to God, if you hurt her, I'll kill you!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> Amanda, it's gonna be all right, okay?<eos> I didn't mean to!<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> The fire just started.<eos> I tried to stop it.
Seriously?<eos> No.<eos> But I did check.<eos> Honestly, I didn't even know that your family owned the grocery store, too.<eos> I figured it belonged to a chain or something.<eos> Look, Gord, I'm gonna let it go this time, but next time...<eos> Next time what?<eos> It was a mistake, I apologized.<eos> Doesn't change the fact that there were kids that needed food and supplies.<eos> Were you ever gonna open it up?
Right.<eos> Yeah, I forgot about that.<eos> And what about in the new world?<eos> I guess we seem to be making the rules up one day at a time.<eos> All right, later, Chuck.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - My father owns this bar.<eos> So technically, I own it now.<eos> So what the hell makes you think you can just come in here and open it?
It won't stop it.<eos> If he can produce phosphorus from his skin, you'll have to suppress it topically.<eos> Something that can be applied to his skin that won't evaporate in the heat.<eos> And we have to figure out a way to get it onto him.<eos> Got to be some kind of fire extinguisher.<eos> Yeah, good, and it's got to be sticky enough that he can't wipe it off, and it can't be flammable.<eos> Like a skin conditioner that won't burn.<eos> Yes.<eos> Let's start with licorice root.<eos> We boil it down, it gets very sticky when heated.
Can't do anything!<eos> So I've arranged for our students to speak to astronauts at the space station, uh, via Russian translator.<eos> And, as an added surprise, actually get to operate the Mars rover.<eos> You see, this is...<eos> "Mission to Mars: Field Trip to Another World."<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Well, you all had great presentations, but I'm sure no one can accuse me of favoritism when I choose Mr. G's proposal which was so, so, so clearly the best one.<eos> What does space have?<eos> You can't even walk on the ground.<eos> You obviously picked it because he's your frickin' boyfriend.
I've had these clothes for forever, I just don't wear them when you're around.<eos> - You are dressed like Ryan!<eos> - Are you around me all the time?<eos> No.<eos> Dressing up like someone else isn't going to work.<eos> - Unlike this crystal...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> And I am never taking this crystal off.<eos> Well, I mean, except if I'm making a tomato sauce and the crystal keeps dipping in the tomato sauce.<eos> Then I'll take it off, and that's just being practical.
And this is your first divorce, both of you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Ah, excellent.<eos> Rookies.<eos> I love rookies.<eos> Uh, I understand what a difficult time this must be for both of you, so I will start by trying to make you feel a little better.<eos> You have already done yourselves a tremendous service.<eos> You have chosen to divorce in what I like to call a humane way.<eos> You're not shooting your marriage in the head.<eos> You're not running it over with a car.

What's up?<eos> - Hey. Uh, not much.<eos> Yo, we missed you at Molnar's party.<eos> Yeah. I-I got tied up...<eos> He's going to Stanford.<eos> This isn't gonna work.<eos> Hundred bucks says it does.<eos> The apple never falls far from the tree.<eos> Anyway, my, uh, friend just got back from a surfing trip to Baja, um, with a-a duffel bag full of cocaine.<eos> And he offered to sell me some of it.
We each took one.<eos> Bromberg loaned us his, uh, helicopters.<eos> Local sheriff's department was more than happy to help.<eos> Bromberg's got five helicopters?<eos> The Detroit office has seven.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> - Drop your weapon.<eos> - What?<eos> - Milt, what's going on here?<eos> - Drop it now. Throw it into the corn.
- let him go. - Drop your weapon.<eos> You, too.<eos> Get back.<eos> Oh, no, M-Milt, Milt, Milt, think about this.<eos> Take it.<eos> You have every right to want to kill me.<eos> I deserve to die.<eos> Your son was a good kid.<eos> He was a really good kid.<eos> And if I thought for one second it would bring him back, I would take that gun, I would put it to my head and I would pull the trigger.
Well, I hope you have.<eos> And that whatever was clouding your mind is gone.<eos> Because I just had to give a victory speech... alone.<eos> And one way or another, I need you on that plane with me tomorrow.<eos> No.<eos> The desk.<eos> Left-hand drawer.<eos> You still have this.<eos> Yes.<eos> It felt wrong to throw it out, for some reason.
You're early.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Jean...<eos> Good evening.<eos> Have a good evening.<eos> No dessert?<eos> No, I'm ok.<eos> Thanks for helping.<eos> Did you find my wallet by chance or take it from my bag?<eos> I found it on the floor.
You just described burning man.<eos> [ laughs ] She framed it as a commentary On social attitudes regarding female mental illness.<eos> What, like that's a bad thing?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Any luck with lucy harms?<eos> Yeah. She's totally guilty.<eos> Or murder or simply annoying you?<eos> Did you find the victim's assistant?<eos> Between the arts center and his loft. We pinged his phone. It's still in the area.<eos> Figure he dumped it.
Won't she be worried?<eos> She'll be proud of you, becoming a woman and all.<eos> Maybe she could come.<eos> Might make her real happy.<eos> We'd just have to do something about the smell, is all.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I didn't mean to offend you.<eos> It don't matter.<eos> Besides, you won't even notice it once you're married.
I could just end you both right now, take what you found and bring it back to mother.<eos> She'd never know the difference.<eos> Then do it...<eos> Little brother.<eos> Well?<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Well done, brother.<eos> Good to see you, sir.<eos> All right, you jackass, go grab that box.<eos> We got to bring it home.
I'm not leaving without the coat.<eos> I'm keeping the coat.<eos> I'm keeping it.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Drop the coat, mother(bleep)!<eos> Drop the (bleep) coat!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The pistol doesn't shoot, honey.<eos> It's a 1782 Ketland flintlock.<eos> It's priceless 'cause my father gave it to me, but it will not shoot.

So, I ran diagnostics on the plane's router.<eos> One device overloaded the entire system.<eos> It was a denial-of-service attack.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, Liftoff Wireless' Wi-Fi service is available at a charge of $9.99 for the duration of the flight.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Willa's phone prevented any other passenger's device from connecting to the Wi-Fi.<eos> Phones aren't supposed to send that many data packets at once.<eos> Yeah, unless a hacker with some skills worked their magic.<eos> Uh-huh. I'll go ahead and unplug the router from the plane.<eos> I'll send it back to CTOC.
He could ruin our cred.<eos> You know what I can do?<eos> Put you in jail for the next 25 years.<eos> Who's collecting the phone-ransom money?<eos> I didn't know about the phones being ransomed, I swear.<eos> He hired us to install the box and clone the cards and buy the goods, that's it.<eos> Oh, come on, there was a server blade.<eos> What do you think that was for?<eos> That server blade?<eos> We didn't buy it.

That's Azra.<eos> Azra?<eos> Yes, it's beyond the badlands.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> Do you remember how to get there?<eos> No, I... I don't.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> Look, can I please just get my pendant back?<eos> It's the last thing I have to remember my mother.<eos> The baron's son took it.

I caught this little shit red-handed.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> It's mine.<eos> I'll take him out back and cage him.<eos> Execute him in front of the new cogs in the morning.<eos> Go away.<eos> I told you to stay in the barracks.<eos> Who gave you that compass?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You kept it for a reason.
- Yeah.<eos> ♪ No recess... ♪<eos> ♪ No recess... ♪<eos> High school's such a worthless fucking nothing.<eos> God, what torture, you know?<eos> No, I quit the last two months of school.<eos> I was so withdrawn by that time and I was so antisocial that I was almost insane.<eos> You know, I felt so different and so crazy that people just left me alone.<eos> Did Kurt find the underground or did the underground find him?<eos> I think he went in search of it, and I think they found each other.

Please, this is already my second cup.<eos> What happened there?<eos> Oh, I had an accident.<eos> Did you see him?<eos> Yeah. Not that it did any good.<eos> Sylvie, sweetheart, a patrolman dropped this off for you.<eos> Found it searching your ambulance the other day.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Totally forgot about that.<eos> Never got a chance to open it.
Yeah, I hope so.<eos> Look at this tremendous vehicle.<eos> Takes a great man to drive a car such as this.<eos> Connie handed in her notice yesterday.<eos> (Anouk) It is quite possible he is having a torrid affair.<eos> You acted in defense of another.<eos> He was gonna strike my child.<eos> (Hector) You go to trial?<eos> What if you do a Harry, and your head explodes on the stand?<eos> If I had a kid and Harry slapped it I would kill him myself, but I wouldn't drag in the law.
All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> (Woman) Mr. Apostolou?<eos> I'm Mr. Korkoulis' assistant, Runya Stamos.<eos> So nice to meet you.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Lovely office, the view.<eos> You should see it at night when New York looks like Christmas.
Reggie!<eos> Do you want to tell me what's going on?<eos> - I quit my job.<eos> - You're shitting me.<eos> You were right about Palmer.<eos> I should've listened to you years ago.<eos> Good for you, man.<eos> During the Revolutionary War, the Americans held you limeys off right here in Red Hook.<eos> There was a fort that covered most of the Red Hook peninsula.<eos> They called it Fort Defiance.
You were living with the blaylocks.<eos> Arthur Delacroix came to visit.<eos> He was a friend from the old neighborhood.<eos> That photo you didn't recognize last week was taken in your backyard by your foster father.<eos> Well, I didn't remember, okay?<eos> You lied about all of that.<eos> Plus you had Arthur's skateboard.<eos> After he died.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> May... maybe he left it at the house or something.
Fell on something. It killed him.<eos> Why'd you bury him?<eos> Because I knew that they'd blame me.<eos> Being a foster kid, you know,<eos> I've been in trouble before, so...<eos> I just...<eos> You know.<eos> I just covered him up best I could.<eos> You kept his skateboard.<eos> What else was I supposed to do, leave it there?
Like neepa or pramood or gamorra or groot or rocket the raccoon.<eos> I think some of those are guardians of the galaxy. And some of them aren't, rob, all right?<eos> I just wanna work really hard and be treated like everybody else.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There.<eos> Whoa!<eos> God, those stitches are gorgeous!<eos> I got the intrafallopian transfer in ten minutes!<eos> I can't do it like this!
Good night.<eos> Triple stuffed omelet, hold the onions.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> Huevos rancheros.<eos> I ordered a Belgian waffle.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> One sec.<eos> Excuse me, I'm just waiting for a cream.<eos> I will grab it for you right now, ma'am.
It's a bomb!<eos> Back away!<eos> Back away!<eos> Back away!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Get up.<eos> Get up.<eos> Who told you to bring the van here?<eos> Some--some guy.<eos> He paid me 200 bucks to drive it.
What do you mean you're not going?<eos> Now is not the time to poke the bear.<eos> It's too late.<eos> The bear is an asshole, and he's not just taking it out on me anymore.<eos> - He's taking it out on Rachel.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, he made it clear that he found the weak spot that's going to get to me, and he's gonna keep pressing it and pressing it until I can't take it anymore.<eos> Mike, you are not ringing that bell.<eos> You're damn right I'm not ringing that bell.<eos> But if I have to go raise a glass to that son of a bitch, I'm gonna end up smashing it over his head.
I don't like being scared.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> But, you know, when I was little,<eos> I was afraid of the dark. - You were? - I was.<eos> But grandpop, he...<eos> He taught me something.<eos> You know that... you know that song, "twinkle twinkle"?<eos> You remember?<eos> Well, it used to be a poem. And he said that when I felt scared,<eos> I should say the poem out loud, because it worked like magic and all my fears would disappear. I want to learn it.
I'm scared.<eos> I know.<eos> But you and I... we just need to be brave right now, okay?<eos> Okay, baby.<eos> Alright?<eos> Hey. I understand.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hey. Do you remember, uh...<eos> You remember when... When you were little and we used to... We used to say that poem, the one that would make our fears magically go away?<eos> You used to know it by heart.
- Minx?<eos> With the evacuation of the children, there was so much chaos that we... we weren't looking at her.<eos> We were looking at Minx.<eos> What about Silas?<eos> He said he saw Minx.<eos> He was telling the truth about everything but who he saw.<eos> It was Cassandra who caught him.<eos> She's the one who threatened to hurt his mom.<eos> What about Maria's computer file?<eos> Cassandra knew that we'd be able to retrieve it, so she doctored Minx's file.
It's me.<eos> Keith.<eos> You know I really want to be with you, right, but if you hurt John, then...<eos> then we can't be together. "They'll put you away forever.<eos> I don't want to lose you."<eos> They'll put you away forever, and, baby, I don't want to lose you.<eos> I want you to put the gun down.<eos> Unh! Initiate, initiate!<eos> All teams, go!<eos> Move! Drop it now!
Didn't know that house calls were part of your probationary purview.<eos> They're not usually.<eos> I'm here on my lunch hour.<eos> Do you mind stepping out of the pool?<eos> Uh... i-i need to check on a few things in the office anyway, so...<eos> Thanks, Melvin.<eos> I called you twice this morning, Daniel.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, I didn't have my phone on me.<eos> Then you need to get it and keep it on you.
No, he didn't.<eos> Just sin in general?<eos> We all have sin, sheriff.<eos> That's true, but he confessed to one a good deal bigger than most.<eos> Maybe so, but I feel any sin he has committed is far surpassed by the sins committed against him.<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because those sins were carefully considered, sheriff.<eos> I don't think Daniel ever carefully considered committing a sin and then actually committed it.
Or passed out or whatever he thought.<eos> So, he goes outside, gets the duffel bag and brings it inside?<eos> That's leading, Sheriff.<eos> Well, you tell me, then.<eos> He goes outside and gets the duffel bag and brings it inside.<eos> Okay. Then what?<eos> He goes to George's bedroom for a while.<eos> And that's where you found the wallet?<eos> The next morning, yes.<eos> Did you see him with the phone, or see him place it somewhere?
And that's where you found the wallet?<eos> The next morning, yes.<eos> Did you see him with the phone, or see him place it somewhere?<eos> No. It was just on the coffee table when I woke up.<eos> The coffee table?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> No.<eos> I-it was in George's bedroom, near... near the wallet.<eos> And that's when you picked it up?
Steven!<eos> Don't!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Emma...<eos> Emma.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Put it down.<eos> We got to talk about that gun.<eos> - Yeah, I should have told you I took it.
Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Emma...<eos> Emma.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Put it down.<eos> We got to talk about that gun.<eos> - Yeah, I should have told you I took it.<eos> - Yeah, you should have.<eos> You found it, all right?
Stop!<eos> Emma...<eos> Emma.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Put it down.<eos> We got to talk about that gun.<eos> - Yeah, I should have told you I took it.<eos> - Yeah, you should have.<eos> You found it, all right?<eos> It was Steven's gun and you found it.
All right, let's get back to it.<eos> And this time, as discussed, please place the sutures a full quarter inch from the edge of the wound.<eos> Ava?<eos> Where you at, girl?<eos> Boyd, you put it down. I just came to talk.<eos> If I wanted to hurt you, I would've done it already, don't you think?<eos> I gave up guessing why people do what they do a long time ago.<eos> Only way you're gonna get this gun out of my hand is with a bullet.<eos> Are you really here to talk?<eos> Why don't you... put it down?
I am sorry, Boyd.<eos> Oh, baby, let's have that conversation when we're sitting on a beach with the sand between our toes.<eos> Baby?<eos> Jesus, woman.<eos> What did you do?<eos> He was never gonna confess.<eos> Put that gun down.<eos> You ain't gonna shoot me.<eos> - I shot Boyd.<eos> - Put it down and step away.
- You saw 'em. They got nothing.<eos> They'll kill you for your boots.<eos> Give me that.<eos> In a couple days, you're gonna come to Arlo Givens' place, he's in the book.<eos> I'm signing it over to you.<eos> Y-You're giving me your house?<eos> He did you people dirt.<eos> This is payback.<eos> Been using that place as a bullshit excuse.<eos> I don't need the money from selling it.
I go downstairs and... I look out the window.<eos> It's dark, so I'm scared.<eos> I see a pile of logs but David's not there.<eos> So I look for him and... I shout: "David!"<eos> And then, I see a dark silhouette coming towards me.<eos> He's wearing a ski mask.<eos> He's wearing gloves.<eos> And a hooded sweatshirt.<eos> He has... He's carrying an axe.<eos> He lifts it up.
- Right, Henri?<eos> - Well, I'm glad you're happy.<eos> You ate well.<eos> You drank my whisky, you drank my wine.<eos> You smoked my cigars.<eos> So how about we get down to what you came to discuss?<eos> My land.<eos> The sale.<eos> Yes, your land.<eos> Did you really offer it to that asshole Charpentier?
You played that perfectly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, you're welcome.<eos> [Coughing] I deserved that.<eos> But can we get back to the job at hand... flying us past the Imperial blockade?<eos> Otherwise, I don't have to pay you or give your droid back.<eos> - What was in that crate?<eos> - Come on.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Calrissian said not to open it.
- What was in that crate?<eos> - Come on.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Calrissian said not to open it.<eos> Yes. [Chuckles] He did.<eos> [Grunts]<eos> [Snorting]<eos> Uh, kinda cute, whatever it is.<eos> [Sniffing] [Squealing]<eos> Catch it!
It can do the job of a dozen mining scanners.<eos> And the Empire doesn't want private landholders mining Lothal.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Pay us, and we'll be on our way.<eos> [Azmorigan] He has other debts to pay.<eos> Azmorigan?<eos> Did you forget I introduced you to Vizago, huh?<eos> I knew where you were headed.<eos> But your ship...<eos> You couldn't have hidden it anywhere close.
You gotta make this right.<eos> Yes!<eos> Nice shot.<eos> Rex got him.<eos> Probe deserved it.<eos> How long has this thing been watching us?<eos> Long enough.<eos> How's the Phantom?<eos> Well, engine took a direct hit.<eos> We're not going anywhere until I can fix it.
But we know that brother Aron stopped the sale.<eos> Yes, but there's no indication that Carlo returned the deposit.<eos> Suggesting that he hadn't given up on the idea of selling it.<eos> So, where are we?<eos> We got one brother who's willing to steal the car to sell it, the other one willing to steal it to protect it.<eos> So which brother did it?<eos> I don't think it was either one of them.<eos> You remember the shoe impression we found at the scene?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We compared it to all the shoes the brothers owned, and we did not get a match.
When you work for a freak like Vaughn, you're asked to do things that turn your stomach.<eos> But you don't say no, the scratch is too good.<eos> The life... Mmm, the women.<eos> There was this girl I had my eye on, Eliza Marquette.<eos> I was this close to nailing her.<eos> Frosty, but I loved it.<eos> She was taking heat for a bad leak, and then poof... Disappeared.<eos> I know all about Eliza Marquette.<eos> She was protecting the memo.<eos> You need to get your hands on it.
And that clue would be?<eos> You see, murders are not solved by positing outlandish, fanciful theories. Sad to say, a habit you seem to be acquiring, Detective Ryan.<eos> No. Crimes are solved by applying the scientific method.<eos> So are you gonna show us what you found or are you just gonna stand here and talk about it?<eos> There are bruises on the victim's wrist as if the killer seized her.<eos> Yeah, signs of struggle.<eos> We already know that.<eos> Ah. But what you don't know is that the killer left a print.<eos> After a painstaking examination, I recovered an intact print here.<eos> Did you run it through the system?
And can anyone corroborate that?<eos> No.<eos> So tell me, why was Ana in possession of a security key to a Swiss bank account containing $100 million?<eos> (SIGHS) I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> Okay, well, here's my theory.<eos> Ana was involved in some kind of a business deal with Layla Nazif. Something secret, illegal, or both.<eos> Now, you either knew about the deal or you were involved in it, too.<eos> Feel free to jump in and correct me at any point.<eos> You went to Ana's place to collect the money.<eos> She didn't have the security key, so you killed her. And then you hired Castle to find it.
Eat crap Ruffles, and not just your own.<eos> - Guys, let it go.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> The sad truth is that a dog can get a degree here.<eos> Yeah, but the happy truth is none did.<eos> There's a difference between truth and honesty.<eos> Library dues?<eos> Who cares!<eos> Ruffles put the work in relative to Greendale.<eos> That City College ad may be technically a lie, but it's really dishonest to kill it on a technicality.
- Elroy, Abed is your friend.<eos> Now the real reason I came by, I'm dying.<eos> Not really, but imagine how bad you feel for complaining about the Wi-Fi.<eos> Here's the real reason.<eos> Too short?<eos> It is too short? It's not too short?<eos> You people are no help.<eos> School board come in.<eos> School board, you're surrounded.<eos> If this is about the bonfire, we'll put it out when the weather breaks.
Same reason my mom took my half brother to Arizona.<eos> That's probably why the Wi-Fi's down, we'll have to move it.<eos> If you move them the mother won't come back.<eos> Those birds aren't the new IT lady, I am.<eos> I'll move it carefully.<eos> The mother won't come back.<eos> Kid, animals have been murdering each other for 3 billion years.<eos> Birds have had their 15 million in the spotlight.<eos> The same as lizards and plants and they all just use it to murder, eat, screw and not invent Wi-Fi.<eos> Now we may end up saving this world, or blowing it to hell or making a new one.
Okay, if it helps.<eos> - "Daniel-san, what you want?"<eos> - Okay, no, sorry, no.<eos> You read Daniel-san.<eos> You read Miyagi.<eos> We'll do scene seven, Miyagi's office.<eos> - Are you the repairman?<eos> - Aye.<eos> - The faucet's really leaky there. - Aye.<eos> When you gonna fix it?
Karate?<eos> - Yeah, you know?<eos> Hey, me and some of my friends are gonna have a party at the beach later.<eos> You should come.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Are you the repair man?<eos> - Aye.<eos> - Faucet's really leaking there.<eos> - Aye.<eos> - When are you gonna fix it?
Hey guys.<eos> Mind if we sit with you?<eos> Oh, yeah, that would be great.<eos> I have to say, you guys seem very happy together.<eos> Hm, we have our moments.<eos> I'm excited because we're going antiquing this weekend.<eos> I love antiquing.<eos> Everything is so old.<eos> I like it too.<eos> You said you hated it.
We have one.<eos> What is it, George?<eos> It's it's the The Aviator.<eos> No, no, it, The Avatar.<eos> No thank you, that movie is three hours of puke.<eos> Of course, Britta's joking.<eos> We enjoy Avatar very much.<eos> We do?<eos> Yes, it's an immensely popular movie.<eos> Of course, we love it.
You're literally killing me.<eos> For real? Yes!<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Every single one of you was gonna leave here except for me.<eos> Troy, Shirley, Annie's gonna be President.<eos> Even Pierce got to die.<eos> And Chang goes to Hollywood.<eos> So, we force you to make the crappiest movie of all time, and then we force you to make it even crappier.<eos> And we watch it, and it's still not even that bad.
I watched it. There's no scientific explanation for...<eos> Hm, Jeff.<eos> You helped me learn something about film making today that I think we all need to apply to life.<eos> It's okay to plan some stuff, and it's okay to figure out what we did wrong.<eos> But our plans are randomly gonna fall apart and our lessons are randomly gonna be wrong, and if we just keep the cameras rolling and shoot a lot of crap eventually<eos> Annie is going to reach down her shirt and pull out a laser bomb.<eos> I didn't write that, we didn't plan that.<eos> God made that happen.<eos> God made this movie, and it's dumb.<eos> And we're dumb for being in it.
No, Great Aunt Polly is Garrett's side.<eos> I haven't met her.<eos> Oh my God, do you think she saw me pushing meemaw, and now she's wondering what's wrong with her?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Annie, the world will still need you after you finish your cake.<eos> Am I that bad?<eos> We have the same dragon.<eos> Eventually you will slay it, or train it, or dissolve in its stomach.<eos> Its name is Helping Others.<eos> If I train it, can I give it a cooler name?
It was fun, you know?<eos> Gave me a chance to get some one-on-one time with you.<eos> So in a way, it was kind of a selfish move.<eos> Such a sweetie.<eos> Ooh, what's that, Melissa?<eos> Well, someone went out and got me a charm bracelet.<eos> Was that someone's name Todd?<eos> Did Todd get that for you or...?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I got it... I got it for her.
Walter, this is cruel.<eos> He still thinks he's in Secret Service.<eos> Exactly.<eos> That means he still has access to that time in his life.<eos> And there might be a way to get him more lucid to remember it all, but it is... it is dangerous.<eos> More dangerous than a nuclear bomb?<eos> The research that I have been doing for my sister has led me to some incredible papers on extreme transcranial direct current stimulation.<eos> You want to juice the guy?<eos> What do you mean, "juice him"?<eos> Apply this high-level electric current to certain areas of his brain to kick it to a substantially higher function level.
All right, I'm gonna slowly dial you down now.<eos> Well, Bruce, the good news is-- I'm alive.<eos> The bad news is-- it didn't do anything.<eos> Cabe, think fast.<eos> Welcome to us.<eos> ♪ Scorpion 1x15 ♪ Forget Me Nots Original Air Date on January 19, 2015<eos> You'rewheeled in on a gurney.<eos> Triage nurses are barking orders.<eos> Then they remove the football to run an arterial line.<eos> Someone picked it up.
Well, that sounds like Daisy and Kyle's work.<eos> Kitchen workers saw a couple that matched their description loading a cart into a laundry van.<eos> I got Sloan on the line, pulling CCTV footage to see if we can track it.<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> Hey.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Van went north on Mercer after it left the loading dock.<eos> That was a few minutes ago.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Picked it up again 6 minutes later.
She looked up directions to Pier 46 in Red Hook.<eos> - How long ago?<eos> - 20 minutes.<eos> Why?<eos> That just seems a little amateur hour.<eos> She'd have to know this would be the first place we'd look.<eos> She wasn't planning on getting killed.<eos> She thought she was taking her computer with her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So why would Strauss leave it behind?
Do not move!<eos> You know, the look on your face right now makes what happened to me in court today almost worth it.<eos> You think you've won?<eos> You haven't won anything.<eos> Daisy, Kyle, Andrew... they're just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> I have students everywhere that make Joe Carroll's followers look like nothing!<eos> You, your niece, your girlfriend all die if I go back to prison.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Drop the briefcase.<eos> Drop it.
Uncuff me.<eos> Unh!<eos> No!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> There's no place to run!<eos> Get on your knees.<eos> We both knew it would end like this for one of us.<eos> You had your chance and blew it.
Anyway, we followed a couple of leads to two users,<eos> - Tyler Zane and Alton Finn.<eos> - Zane?<eos> Isn't he that Vic you found dead in the psychiatric hospital?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And I think-- we think-- that he was killed in a cover-up.<eos> The same cover-up that cost Julianna Keaton her life.<eos> Wait, what's Keaton's connection to all this?<eos> Well, she was the one responsible for making the drug. Right?<eos> And distributing it, which is why we arrested her.
There is nothing else you can do until the sun goes down.<eos> All right, you want to do something, do it with your son.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> It will do you both good.<eos> Whatcha doing?<eos> Where were you all night?<eos> I was out babysitting a vampire.<eos> That's the Jeter foul ball.<eos> The one you spilled a soda on me trying to catch?<eos> When I used the soda to deflect the ball so you could get it from under the seat.
Shit.<eos> She could have been moved to another car.<eos> If you're gonna switch cars, you don't do it behind the National Guard Headquarters.<eos> It's right there.<eos> Right in front of our goddamn faces.<eos> Look at the hotel...<eos> The right side is all lit up but the left is dark all the way to the top.<eos> No lights at all.<eos> Not even a television.<eos> The Mayfield was a famous hotel in the '30s and '40s, then it became a flea-bag, transient kinda place until the 1980s when they remodeled it.
- Setrakian will be there.<eos> When I outbid him, he and his confederates will certainly try to take the book from me.<eos> For that very reason, the Master cannot entrust such an important task to you.<eos> - I will be attending the auction.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Not with my resources, you won't!<eos> That's the way the Master wants it.<eos> Don't agree to this, Eldritch.<eos> Ungrateful whore.<eos> If you do not appreciate his gift, I can easily reclaim it.
We already tested it on a strigoi.<eos> It infected more than a dozen others.<eos> - All of them died.<eos> - If we can get the tools to mass produce this, you could kill every strigoi in the city.<eos> Then the rest of the country.<eos> You could be the person who ends this plague.<eos> What do you think, Frank?<eos> What do you need from us?<eos> A bio-reaction facility, and your teams to help disperse<eos> - the agent once we make it.
So...<eos> Are you guys in love?<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Yes? No? I mean, should I be happy for you?<eos> I need to know if I should be happy for you.<eos> You know what? I think it's important to know who to be happy for and who's just gonna be alone.<eos> Why did Cooper fly in last night?<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Well he bought me a present and he couldn't wait to see my face when I opened it.
So, if she wants to make the dinner, she can.<eos> Aww, thanks, baby.<eos> Fun.<eos> Why can't you date somebody who can do my job?<eos> You are never gonna believe what Josh just told me.<eos> Oh, thank God, finally!<eos> You know?<eos> I know that it's something big, and that I don't know it.<eos> So, tell me.<eos> Josh is having a business dinner tomorrow night, and Jilly wants to cook it, and he's letting her.
70% infection rate.<eos> When is this dated from?<eos> Nine weeks ago.<eos> Do you see any trends based on those days?<eos> At first glance, no.<eos> I'll do a full analysis.<eos> I should be able to extrapolate from the size of the cities and the date of impact how fast it's moving and what the situation might be now.<eos> We also found a file labeled "SECNAV."<eos> It's a video file dated September 9th.<eos> - We haven't reviewed it yet.
You once said that you didn't believe I was a killer... that I valued life too much.<eos> Well, I believe that about you.<eos> You wouldn't just leave me here for dead.<eos> That may have been true once, but that was before I lost someone, someone dear.<eos> She's gone now, and I won't risk losing anyone else.<eos> Good-bye, Claire.<eos> Charles Wynn died of a myocardial infarction caused by 9 milligrams of aconitine.<eos> He struck an oncoming car, hospitalizing the couple inside, and somehow sparing the six-year-old in the backseat.<eos> All of which you know... if your friend read you the report.<eos> I don't have to read it.

I want to show you something.<eos> You see, huh? Yeah?<eos> Yeah, I know it's a little scary.<eos> You know, I have some bones to bury too, huh.<eos> Yeah, you like it, huh?<eos> My wife gave me this tie.<eos> It's easy enough.<eos> You don't like the color?<eos> Oh, uh... Nevermind.<eos> Nevermind. I'll tie it myself.
We speak with one voice.<eos> If you do not return to work, I shall have you hanged!<eos> Kill me, and two more shall take my place.<eos> I understand your complaints.<eos> Tell the King that we will fight for him again, build for him again, show trust and loyalty again, but first the King must show us all that he is a man that will honor his promises.<eos> I was at Cambrais, and at Compiegne!<eos> You need new locks.<eos> Have you lost your mind!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I could fix it for you, of course, but I'm withholding labor, so...
Then he contacted one woman: The last profile he viewed.<eos> She's a human resources employee at McGregor-Aldrich, the construction company.<eos> Even if you're right and Mikhail hid the egg at one of McGregor's job sites, they probably have a hundred... 217 on the East Coast.<eos> I'm assuming Mikhail wouldn't have wanted to fly, given all the security cameras at airports.<eos> Alex, how are you doing?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Watching someone die, plugging their chest wound with your index finger...<eos> That's not in the analyst job description.<eos> We need to find his laptop.<eos> I need to find it.
All of them.<eos> Just stay on this side of the glass.<eos> I need to go back to Mikhail's apartment.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, you gonna tell me why we came all the way over here?<eos> Philadelphia City Hall.<eos> - What?<eos> - The egg.<eos> The laptop with the SVR files.<eos> Mikhail hid it in Philadelphia City Hall.
I'll give this back to you when we're done.<eos> There's no outlets.<eos> Well, how... how do they vacuum?<eos> We take the prisoners' staircase to the second floor.<eos> We go courtroom through courtroom using inner doors.<eos> That will allow us to enter without alerting the court police officer.<eos> Now, if they find out we're here, we're screwed.<eos> If you keep this in your pocket you can have your ball back.<eos> I got it.<eos> We have to plug it in, or we won't be able to get into the vault.
Get your scans ready, Shahir.<eos> We should be out of here in no time.<eos> [cellphone vibrates] That's probably Hayden's mother calling right now.<eos> Uh, Shahir, could you answer my phone?<eos> It's in my pocket.<eos> Please.<eos> Is this an engagement ring?<eos> - Hey, could you put that back, please?<eos> - Is this for Alex?<eos> Put it... get the phone, Shahir.
Of the central intelligence agency?<eos> They've given us our first freelance mission,<eos> And if you screw it up,<eos> There won't be a second one, so listen up.<eos> [giggling continues] I'm listening.<eos> Two days ago, an american spy plane<eos> Went down in the jungles of borneo<eos> About 500 miles from you.<eos> The pilot ejected, but without the onboard computer.<eos> You're to secure it, then destroy the aircraft.
Started planning it while you was away.<eos> - Who's planning it?<eos> - Me and their manager.<eos> Want to do a whole series, like, chapters in a book.<eos> - Who's paying for this?<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> Los Angeles... someone said it's like a volcano spewing out wreckage in all directions.<eos> That plant?<eos> Mine since '87.<eos> My daughter wants to tear it to the ground, and build her stadium there, but she's got a few boxes to tick first, like bird people fretting about migration patterns, et cetera, et cetera.
And I might reasonably not give a shit about that law, Professor.<eos> See you later.<eos> I hope not.<eos> However it works in your corner of the world, harassment means jail time in mine.<eos> This "meet me now" shit... it's not gonna fly.<eos> I got a job for ya.<eos> What is it?<eos> Some guy's got a burner phone that belongs to Governor Verona.<eos> - So?<eos> - We got to get it.
- What made you take that phone.<eos> - He lied to me.<eos> - A thousand times.<eos> - About what?<eos> He said he loved me.<eos> I lost two years of my life campaigning for him.<eos> Coming out with that phone isn't gonna hurt Verona.<eos> He'll make a public apology...<eos> We're not coming out with a phone.<eos> I changed my mind and Professor Blackwood says - he'll destroy it.
Press starts calling you a thief and a whore.<eos> You don't deserve that.<eos> You're young.<eos> You made a mistake.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mistakes were made.<eos> You know, I'm not even the only woman on that phone.<eos> I walked in on him fucking someone in a hotel.<eos> That's when I took the phone.<eos> You want me to help you get it back?
I ain't done nothing wrong, and I ain't talking to nobody about nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> You are shut down as of today.<eos> Vice guys are gonna watch this building.<eos> We see any activity, I'm bringing you and those two up on narcotics and trafficking charges.<eos> You want to get us feeling more cooperative... better give me a call.<eos> Do the right thing.<eos> All right, Pop, talk to me.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Package up what's left of the coke and hide it.
I left something.<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> Why are you lying to me?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Norman, stay the hell out of it, okay?<eos> It doesn't concern you.<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> What are you doing here so late?<eos> I was just, uh...<eos> I was messing with the timer earlier, and I forgot to reset it.
I'm okay.<eos> Aren't you gonna have any?<eos> Oh, please, breakfast?<eos> Gross.<eos> Friend, can I ask you a very friendly favor?<eos> Of course.<eos> Can I please have Scott Lockhart's number?<eos> - What?<eos> - Scott's number.<eos> He changed it.
Why do you two keep looking at each other?<eos> Tell him, Mom.<eos> Because it's true.<eos> The baby's name was Eamon.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ma, what are you talking about?<eos> Your grandfather Silas was a terrible person, boys.<eos> He was a drunk who beat his wife.<eos> He beat your dad.<eos> And your grandmother had an affair with Thomas Hodges, and she got pregnant, and when Silas found out that the baby wasn't his, he drowned it.
You understand?<eos> Hoi understand.<eos> All right, good.<eos> Tell them.<eos> What I just...<eos> Shit.<eos> Take engine apart.<eos> Every single piece.<eos> Break...<eos> Break it down.
As per federal law, we will acquire the land and mineral rights twenty miles on either side of the southern route,<eos> precise numbers here.<eos> Any questions, you may direct to the man who made the survey for the Union Pacific while he was in my employ, Cullen Bohannon.<eos> I have some questions, Mr. President.<eos> This is the route the Union Pacific plans to follow, exactly?<eos> Uh, saving room for any necessary detours, yes.<eos> Detours?<eos> Unforeseen departures from the thing you have committed yourself to doing.<eos> I know you're familiar with the term.<eos> I'm familiar with the route. And having surveyed it myself,
I... I will.<eos> From bed.<eos> In case of infection, you need to rest.<eos> Eva, thank you.<eos> I truly appreciate everything that you've done, and I promise you that I will rest.<eos> But I...<eos> I need a story, Eva.<eos> I haven't had a decent scoop in months.<eos> Slippery elm don't work on your schedule, Miss Ellison.<eos> If you don't respect it, it can turn real bad.
Chloe.<eos> Chloe?<eos> Chloe?<eos> Chloe!<eos> God.<eos> Chloe!<eos> Did you know that by week 16, your baby's only the size of an avocado but it can hear?<eos> It says you're supposed to, like, talk and sing to it.<eos> I think I'd probably play my cello.<eos> My singing might scare it.
Because I was smiling in my sleep, and he said I was thinking about somebody else.<eos> I got up, left the house, and walked on the ice of the lake.<eos> I was terrified.<eos> He always said that he would kill me rather than let me leave him.<eos> The only good thing i got from Ron was my baby.<eos> We moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey, and he started writing "dianetics."<eos> The book was conceived and he started working on it in 1950.<eos> He said many times that the only way to make any real money was to have a religion.<eos> That's essentially what he was trying to do with "dianetics"...<eos> Get a religion where he could have an income and the government wouldn't take it away from him in the form of taxes.
Do you believe that?<eos> Sure. People who oppose you are undoubtedly criminals?<eos> I believe that, yeah.<eos> You know, there isn't and hasn't been any effort which has been taken to, quote, "silence critics."<eos> "No, that doesn't happen.<eos> "Oh, we would never do that."<eos> But according to many insiders,<eos> Hubbard was growing more and more vindictive toward those who stood in his way.<eos> He created what he called the rehabilitation project force.<eos> The rpf was what we called it.
What's she doing?<eos> ~ Anita, what are you doing?<eos> ~ I'm doing the ironing, Laura.<eos> What's that?<eos> What are you...<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Argh! Oh, God!<eos> Teganaria domestica.<eos> The house spider.<eos> ~ I found it on the wall as I was preparing to iron.
Find it soothing.<eos> Well, as it happened, I was in Dispatch when that call came through.<eos> It's just a time-waster.<eos> Now, off you go.<eos> Press are waiting.<eos> 'It's DI Voss, STTF, sorry to wake you.'<eos> You were in the control room last night.<eos> Did you take a call about an incident at a smash club?<eos> INAUDIBLE RESPONSE<eos> Did someone ask you to drop it?
OK.<eos> That one is...<eos> What is your emergency?<eos> I mean, none of them will hurt you.<eos> If you could read me the serial number.<eos> It's just inside the bottom lip.<eos> That's right, yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> OK, Um...<eos> Leave it alone now and someone will come and pick it up.
If you could read me the serial number.<eos> It's just inside the bottom lip.<eos> That's right, yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> OK, Um...<eos> Leave it alone now and someone will come and pick it up.<eos> Yeah, no, thank you.<eos> OK.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Would you like me to send a Synthetic unit to collect it?
I'm an optimist, not an idiot.<eos> Hm.<eos> When I was very young, my father brought me an injured fox cub he found.<eos> Its leg was broken... crushed.<eos> It could not survive.<eos> He gave it to me, wanted to see what I'd do.<eos> I didn't want to make that choice.<eos> But he left me with it.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Put it to sleep.
The, er, thing from inside Mia.<eos> - How Leo found you.<eos> - Her root code.<eos> It's proof of what she is, right?<eos> - Yeah, I guess.<eos> - It's our leverage.<eos> Tell this Hobb if he doesn't let them go, we go public with proof, proof that they exist.<eos> It wouldn't work.<eos> Elster wrote that code.<eos> No-one would understand it.
Whatever it is... .. it can't be as bad as what I did.<eos> It just... it can't.<eos> There's nothing you could tell me that would change the way I feel about you.<eos> Of course there is.<eos> Mia!<eos> Hobb'll be able to trace your phone.<eos> We can't...<eos> No, no, it's fine.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Mattie's re-rooted it or something....
Mum.<eos> Hi.<eos> We should get moving soon.<eos> Fred's just transmitted their position.<eos> It's not far from where we're picking up the laptop.<eos> All right.<eos> Bring them back.<eos> And be discreet.<eos> Can you bring them in?<eos> If it's all right with you, I'd like to make sure Mr Hobb gets it myself.
You'll never see any of us again.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I have the code your father used to make them.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Look again.<eos> It's not complete.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Let me talk to her.<eos> Keep him talking.<eos> - Check the code, scan it for missing data.
I'm sure there's times you've thought about killing me.<eos> It's crossed my mind.<eos> Well, if it's worth anything, you're not a shitty teacher.<eos> You've given me hope that I might be able to control what happens when I'm cut.<eos> Why did you lie to me about Azra?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I know the way, but it's all jumbled in my head.<eos> That's why I thought the Widow's book would help.<eos> I got my compass to work.<eos> I put it in the cutout of that book.
That name mean anything to you?<eos> No.<eos> What is it?<eos> A story they used to tell cog orphans.<eos> Make them believe that they were from some faraway place beyond the Badlands.<eos> Paradise.<eos> If it's just a story, then where'd the pendant come from?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Perhaps it was a maker in the outlying territories.<eos> He could've forged it from a picture he saw from the old world.
Sunny's loyalty's been unimpeachable.<eos> But I think he's played us both.<eos> Lock down the fort.<eos> Have Sunny meet me in the chapel.<eos> That pendant.<eos> The one you took from Sunny's Colt.<eos> Do you still have it?<eos> What made you think of that?<eos> Just curious.<eos> No, I traded it.
Pickasee.<eos> Pickasee.<eos> He didn't catch a fish that day.<eos> No.<eos> No, you -- you caught a fish, a small one.<eos> Daddy?<eos> He wants to know why you're keeping him here.<eos> There's something in me...<eos> A voice.<eos> And when it starts, I can't ignore it.
I want to know what's going on at the house.<eos> Sure.<eos> And Cho...<eos> Thanks.<eos> No problem.<eos> This is the ring we sent you a picture of.<eos> It was my grandmother's.<eos> Anne's dad gave it to me to propose with.<eos> Which is sweet, but it's not really me, you know?<eos> So we thought maybe we could take the diamond out, put it in a necklace or something.
What?<eos> You can tell Dylan I have it.<eos> Hey...<eos> Pull.<eos> - Don't even start.<eos> - Let him by.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna kick your ass someday, and I'm gonna enjoy it.<eos> I got a question for you about a name on that ledger.<eos> I was wondering when you'd actually look at it.
'Cause from here, it looks sloppy.<eos> You're Gang Unit and Tactical, right? Yeah.<eos> I know you not from the streets.<eos> So you was in the military.<eos> And your little medical card, that's legit, huh?<eos> PTSD?<eos> You're a little PTSD case, huh?<eos> You a soldier, and I respect that.<eos> So I'm gonna keep it 100 with you.<eos> You come in here talking some weak-ass bullshit about my business and the way I handle it, 'cause you think that's gonna make an impression on me?
Can we just cut with all the bullshit, please, Pops?<eos> All right.<eos> How much?<eos> $70,000.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Who the hell did you get into?<eos> Couple different people.<eos> But The, uh, The Union bought my debt.<eos> So, what do you need me for?<eos> I can't pay it, Pops. That's the point.
Maybe later?<eos> Maybe.<eos> All right, I'll, uh... I'm gonna give you a call.<eos> Hey.<eos> - So, the phone was a burner.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I've got a warrant in for the transaction I.D. number.<eos> Okay, what does that... what does that give us?<eos> - Place and time of sale. - [elevator bell dings]<eos> If we're lucky, some video of the person who bought it.
If we're lucky, some video of the person who bought it.<eos> That's it?<eos> [chuckles] I'm kidding.<eos> - I owe you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> What do you know about The Union?<eos> Uh... not much, that it's, uh, like a slush fund.<eos> Yeah, my dad was part of it.<eos> Him and his cronies skimming off the pot, passing it around.
Finish soon our days of sin, and bring us to eternal peace through the purifying blood of Thy Son, our Lord and only Savior Jesus Christ.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Thomasin, what's thou done with the silver cup?<eos> Is't not on the shelf?<eos> Nay-<eos> In the six board, then.<eos> T'ain't there neither.<eos> It's been disappeared for some while.<eos> Didst lose it?
- Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Thomasin, what's thou done with the silver cup?<eos> Is't not on the shelf?<eos> Nay-<eos> In the six board, then.<eos> T'ain't there neither.<eos> It's been disappeared for some while.<eos> Didst lose it?<eos> I've not touched it.

Aliases the SVR was unaware of.<eos> He was about to make contact with the Americans.<eos> Offering to trade the files I downloaded.<eos> Where are the files now?<eos> They're on an encrypted hard drive secured inside a laptop.<eos> Take us there.<eos> We'll protect you.<eos> I don't know where it is.<eos> What?<eos> I gave it to Mikhail to hide.
- She knows.<eos> I don't, actually.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> You sure you're ready to be back so quick?<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Just don't push yourself too hard, all right?<eos> All that surveillance, and we didn't know about the secondary loading dock?<eos> The blueprints we were working off didn't include it.
How's that working out for you?<eos> Your inside man?<eos> Where is he right now?<eos> Why hasn't he told you where they are?<eos> I trust him.<eos> That's the problem right there. You trust him more than you trust me.<eos> Instead of believing in me you're putting faith in a man you hardly know who's a little too cozy with the enemy if you ask me.<eos> I hate to say it, but the man has a point.<eos> Without that key it doesn't matter if we're ahead of schedule or behind.<eos> If Tonkin can't get it, what benefit is it to the mission?
In the future, my future, if I ever get back, there are no guarantees.<eos> Sam might not be there.<eos> He might not even be.<eos> I thought you were optimistic about Brad helping us.<eos> He asked me the questions I'm afraid to ask of myself.<eos> Well, you can always stay here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't stop now.<eos> Where's my key, Tonkin?<eos> She has agreed to return it.
What I said, about wanting to see Sam, nothing has ever been truer for me.<eos> But every one of us getting what we want when we want it?<eos> I know it doesn't work that way.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> And sometimes I don't want to go, either.<eos> Well, with the way things are playing out we may be stuck with each other for good.<eos> Kiera, can't you just give up this fantasy, ok?<eos> Come back to reality, as hard as that may be?<eos> Whatever your plan was,<eos> Brad blew it apart when he blew this place up.
- Yeah.<eos> Boston police!<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> Back up.<eos> I need everyone to take a step back.<eos> I need an ambulance at the Essex Street subway platform for a gunshot victim.<eos> This is an officer-involved shooting. [Cellphone beeps]<eos> - Did he have a gun?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did you pick it up?
Uh, how's a half-hour?<eos> Great. Thanks.<eos> [Cellphone beeps]<eos> - IAD?<eos> - Clock's ticking.<eos> The victim's stomach contents.<eos> Maltodextrin, oat powder, whey isolate.<eos> - Protein shake.<eos> - The ingredients are consistent with a commercial product called Parallax.<eos> Computer geeks drink it so they don't have to leave their chairs.
Uh ... no. [Sighs]<eos> - Okay, give ... give me your coffee.<eos> - Wait, that ...<eos> - Steve? - Hmm?<eos> I went to get a coffee and they made it wrong, so I have an extra cappuccino.<eos> Thought you'd be tired and you might want it.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, I will just ...<eos> I'll leave it right here in case you change your mind.
Yeah, we'll be right there.<eos> Hey. Let's see it.<eos> I grabbed the footage from social-media sites, so it's jumpy and there are missing moments, but it's the best I can do with what we've got.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Back it up.<eos> - What?<eos> There. [Computer beeps]<eos> Play it forward, slowly.<eos> - There was a gun.<eos> - Somebody took it.
Well, that's the problem!<eos> They don't know.<eos> Or if they do know, they're not telling us.<eos> Well, if it was theft, maybe he got caught in the act.<eos> Robbery victim kills the thief, panics, dumps the body.<eos> Here, according to the uniforms.<eos> Here?<eos> - The driver said he picked the fridge up here?<eos> - That's what he said.<eos> So far, nobody saw a refrigerator here before the time he claims to have picked it up.
- On company time?<eos> - We're not supposed to do it.<eos> But people throw away valuables, man.<eos> Like last week, I found a deep fryer.<eos> - You know, for, like, turkeys.<eos> - Where did you get the fridge, Ricky?<eos> Behind a warehouse on Franklin.<eos> I didn't know it had a body in it!<eos> You didn't notice the extra weight<eos> - when you put it on the truck?
Okay.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What'd he want?<eos> The Governor is concerned about the fallout from a scandal at the Medical Examiner's office.<eos> He's hoping to get ahead of it before the media gets ahold of the story.<eos> Therefore, effective immediately, I am suspended from duty.<eos> You gave a full report of our investigation<eos> - to the Governor's office?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They requested it last night, and I sent it over.
Well, he usually takes off before the sun's up.<eos> Did he have any problems with anyone?<eos> - Like you know, arguments or fights?<eos> - Not that I ever heard about.<eos> Do you mind telling me how you got that shiner?<eos> Oh, I bodychecked a forward at hockey practice this mornin'.<eos> It's nice, huh?<eos> - Wallet's here ... debit card, cash.<eos> - So it probably wasn't robbery.<eos> I'm gonna get this phone to Nina, see if she can unlock it.
Well, your mother can be very rational.<eos> We're talking about the same person who thinks she started the Led Zeppelin riot in 1975?<eos> Well, we can't prove she didn't.<eos> Okay, did you find anything that links Evan Ballard<eos> - to Stuart's murder?<eos> - No, the rubber on the boots that we found in the suspect's apartment was not a match to what we found on the fingers.<eos> - I'm still waiting ...<eos> - Jane.<eos> Stuart's personal cell phone just showed up online.<eos> Can we track it?
- No, the rubber on the boots that we found in the suspect's apartment was not a match to what we found on the fingers.<eos> - I'm still waiting ...<eos> - Jane.<eos> Stuart's personal cell phone just showed up online.<eos> Can we track it?<eos> We don't have a warrant for G.P.S. data yet, but whoever has the phone is using the camera.<eos> Photos are uploading automatically to Stuart's cloud storage.<eos> Well, at least he didn't erase 'em.<eos> Looks pretty run down.<eos> Maybe a homeless person picked it up?
She'd get everything.<eos> So, what would you like to do about that?<eos> - Why did they let you out of jail?<eos> - Because I didn't kill Mom.<eos> You admitted to putting the rat poison in Duke's food,<eos> - and she ate it.<eos> - That's not what killed her.<eos> She died from a more lethal kind of strychnine.<eos> - How?<eos> - Police say someone put it in her coffee.
I'm gonna go make us some tea, okay?<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me make you a cup of tea.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what, your new motto now is to protect and scare? !<eos> - Sorry, Angela, I ...<eos> - You all need to calm down!<eos> I'm gonna make a big pot of chamomile tea!<eos> Could you make it in a scotch glass?
What better way to find the author Than by getting the Dark One to do it for you?<eos> But how?<eos> Isn't it useless as long as he's outside of Storybrooke?<eos> Unless they found a way to lure him back.<eos> Any one of them could control him.<eos> Or even worse... use the dagger to kill him And become the Dark One herself. No.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> I assume you hid the dagger somewhere safe.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Then let's move it. What?
How 'bout you tag along?<eos> And be a third wheel?<eos> Actually, it would be a fourth wheel, but who's counting?<eos> Come on.<eos> Lu's making pork chops.<eos> You know, it kind of sounds like an afterthought.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, by the way, you hear about that new bill in congress about the returned?<eos> It's a joke.<eos> The senate will kill it.
Charlie, I don't think you should be anywhere around this piece-of-crap salesman.<eos> And ... and I don't think that finding dark Charlie and locking her up is gonna work.<eos> I mean, she may be...dark, but she's still a part of you.<eos> You're right.<eos> I hate it, but you're right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go to the bunker.<eos> Baum used the key to Oz.<eos> Maybe there's something in the Men of Letters' files about the key.<eos> If we fix it, we can get back to Oz.
I'm the early bird, ready to get that worm.<eos> So look out, worm, I'm coming at you.<eos> Maybe you should get some more sleep.<eos> Yeah, you could be right.<eos> This couch wasn't exactly built for sleeping.<eos> I'm sorry, innkeep, looks like you're down to four stars...<eos> Feel free to use my bed.<eos> I can't find his phone.<eos> This says he checked in with one.<eos> Well, my partner might have already come by and picked it up.
I know this town.<eos> Willard Finch lives here.<eos> We're not just laying low, are we?<eos> Gracie...<eos> I'm not who you think I am.<eos> I told your father that I went awol, but the truth is that... I never left the army.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's all about your father.<eos> He stole valuable scientific material.<eos> I was assigned to recover it.
Yeah, this very mysterious lab... you work at studying...<eos> What is it?<eos> Wait, I forgot, hold on... black holes?<eos> - Black holes?<eos> Right?<eos> - Black holes, exactly.<eos> I made this for you.<eos> Got liquorice root in it.<eos> It'll help with that cough you've got, but...<eos> You, my dear, have to earn it.
I was, like, way above, and then I came back.<eos> Her name is Krystal Goderitch.<eos> We intercepted them as they were forcing her into the trunk of a car.<eos> You're sterilizing women.<eos> You've done something to me!<eos> You gave her the Castor pathogen, didn't you?<eos> You're somehow able to fight it off.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?<eos> - No, ch-it.<eos> - What?<eos> Remember when I got you this job?<eos> You said, "OMG, Jake. I owe you one."<eos> I said "OMG"?<eos> That was before other people started saying it.<eos> I was an originator.<eos> You said I could ask for anything, and for six years, I've been sitting on that chit.<eos> Well, now I'm cashing it in.
Oh, but you must. May I?<eos> I don't mean to be forward, but maybe your good fortune will rub off on me.<eos> Let's hope.<eos> Bill? She's one patient. And her antenna was up.<eos> A few days ago, I heard Betty ask if you were eating for two.<eos> That's an express--<eos> I asked her if I could finish her coleslaw.<eos> She was joking.<eos> Lester told me he had to send back a woman's lab coat in size medium.<eos> He assumed the company sent it in error.
It didn't seem to me like you were willing to contemplate a serious replacement, which is what we need, what I need.<eos> If I'm gonna maintain the practice, grow the clinic, represent the book when it's published, I need a competent woman at my side to counteract the perception that I'm a pervert.<eos> Look, the understanding that I have with her is that the second you're ready to come back after the birth--<eos> And you didn't think that this was a decision that we should make together?<eos> I certainly wasn't consulted in all the decisions that you made that affect me.<eos> This book is the culmination of 12 years' work, and I'm not gonna let your impulsivity put it in jeopardy.<eos> This was not an impulse.<eos> Really? You and George planned this, huh?<eos> Conceiving the baby was a mistake.<eos> Keeping it was a deliberate decision.
So, she sings, she cleans, she... travels by parasol...<eos> A modern witch specializing in housework.<eos> It hardly sounds progressive.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Miss Poppins seems quite fulfilled.<eos> What is it?<eos> This charm... is a duplicate of the Halo Blade wielded by the angel Orion.<eos> That sigil is a beacon.<eos> Used to call upon an angel.<eos> Miss Mills must have received it from him and... kept it from me.
He collects black market antiques and weapons.<eos> Rumor is he has an entire storehouse of occult items at his place.<eos> So, whatever Carmilla's after in the vault...<eos> Is something we dare not let her have.<eos> Original architectural designs from the Knox estate.<eos> Direct from a 1775 Sons of Liberty folio.<eos> Now, this symbol in the corner represents a lever lock system.<eos> Its tumblers for the vault... they run through the walls of the entire house, making the house like a fortress.<eos> One big safe.<eos> And this is how you crack it.
But how are they...?<eos> All right.<eos> Each knob is marked with an alchemical symbol.<eos> Push the correct knob, the door will open.<eos> We don't know which one that is.<eos> If we choose wrong...<eos> Then I doubt we leave the vault alive.<eos> Quandary, indeed.<eos> About the sigil, I should have told you.<eos> Orion gave it to me, I used it to find him.

My error entirely.<eos> So what makes someone in the flavors and fragrances industry interested in sex research, Mr. Logan?<eos> Well, as a doctor, I'm sure you know--<eos> I'm not a medical doctor. My degree is in psychology.<eos> With your science and my engineering, we could completely revolutionize the electric hand-massaging industry from top to bottom, pun intended.<eos> There are two questions that have puzzled me in my entire career.<eos> I think maybe we can answer those questions together.<eos> And what might those questions be?<eos> What is the smell of sex?<eos> And how do we get it in a bottle?
My dear viewers, I think I may just have had a near-death experience.<eos> If so, then I'm happy to report that in heaven there's a lot of dancing and joy.<eos> However, I think, and I'm sure you would all agree with me, it would be prudent to take a commercial break.<eos> I remain and always will be<eos> Walter Blunt, right here, right now.<eos> You've had quite the day, Major.<eos> I'm proud of you for not dying.<eos> Thank you, Harry.<eos> The Gods, you know, have given me a second chance.<eos> I mean to make the most of it.
I have not spoken to any of my ex-wives.<eos> This is the benefit of divorce.<eos> You are facing felony charges.<eos> Your ratings have been shit for months.<eos> All that's left is your accent.<eos> They need me to see a shrink.<eos> You always bring your own couch, Doctor?<eos> Yes, I'm a Freudian.<eos> The gods have given me a second chance.<eos> I mean to make the most of it.
And who ensured we followed the trail to Radnor.<eos> Oof. I wish I could see the look on their face when you slap the cuffs on them.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe you can.<eos> Mr. Castle, I got an urgent call to meet you here regarding Shana Baker.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, just one final question, Miss Morris.<eos> Who hired you to kill Shana Baker and frame Spalding Elliot?<eos> (CHUCKLES) What are you talking about?<eos> I think you know.<eos> That's you retrieving Elliot's cigarette butt so you could plant it at the crime scene after you killed Shana.
We're holed up in his cabin, and he's in town for more than just The Author.<eos> But he won't tell me why, which means whatever it is he's planning... it's bad.<eos> So the Dark One's returned.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's only one person who can help us drive him back out.<eos> H-h-he's here?<eos> Th-that's...<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Well, did you really think he'd stay away?<eos> The dagger... you need to hand it over so we can stop this fight before it starts.
That's impossible.<eos> Well, did you really think he'd stay away?<eos> The dagger... you need to hand it over so we can stop this fight before it starts.<eos> The dagger?<eos> I-I don't have the dagger.<eos> Killian does.<eos> Who?<eos> Me?<eos> Well, I haven't seen that cursed blade since you commanded the Crocodile to leave the first time.<eos> But y-you took it from me last night to hide it where no one could find it.
Now, you know the deal I hand this over, you tell me every detail of the Dark One's plan.<eos> Oh, you hear that?<eos> Aye.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Why the devil not?<eos> Because you're wrong, Hook.<eos> Villains can't get their happy endings.<eos> I never should have believed you when you said we could do this without The Author.<eos> I delivered your voice.<eos> It's not my fault if your magic can't get it out of the bloody shell.
How are you here in this land?<eos> A young mermaid found me and brought me through a portal.<eos> I need to say something.<eos> I'm sorry, Ursula.<eos> I never should have forced you to use your voice as a weapon.<eos> It was just...<eos> Every time I heard you sing, I heard your mother, and it was too painful.<eos> I let that pain fuel my desire for vengeance, but it shouldn't have.<eos> It should have reminded me that I still had a piece of her... you.<eos> Let me return your voice so I can hear it one last time.

Aye.<eos> But it's a stark reminder of something.<eos> What?<eos> With all this talk of authors and the book, we've never discussed one fact...<eos> I was a villain.<eos> But you're not anymore.<eos> Neither is Regina, but she still lost her happy ending.<eos> If we're to believe the rules of the book, then it's only a matter of time before I lose mine.<eos> Wait.<eos> If you're afraid of losing your happy ending, that means you found it.
Gold is here.<eos> We're holed up in his cabin, And he's in town for more than just the Author.<eos> But he won't tell me why, Which means whatever it is he's planning... it's bad.<eos> So the Dark One's returned.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's only one person who can help us drive him back out.<eos> H-h-he's here?<eos> Th-that's... that's impossible.<eos> Well, did you really think he'd stay away?<eos> The dagger... you need to hand it over so we can stop this fight before it starts.

Although I do intend to hold it over your heads for a very long time.<eos> I think we both know what happened in that world was not real.<eos> Although, seeing you guys as real villains made me sorry for holding a grudge against you for so long.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Do you remember this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I nearly got hepatitis stealing it back from your boyfriend's rat-infested place.
Elliot, Josh isn't your daddy.<eos> No matter how many times you try to sit on his lap.<eos> Hey, Dad...<eos> I mean, Josh?<eos> I was wondering if I could talk to you about something.<eos> Okay, look,<eos> I know when Gabi was talking to Cooper, I let my feelings bubble up a little bit, but it's not gonna happen again.<eos> I've just got to focus on being her boss and being professional.<eos> That's brilliant, Josh.<eos> If I had a glass, I would raise it to you.
But you have healed more than just my wounds.<eos> You are here because i want you with me.<eos> Even though i'm part mitanni?<eos> This does not matter.<eos> You're an egyptian, as well.<eos> That's not how others will see me.<eos> Out there, we were neither.<eos> Suhad, i am bound to my life here.<eos> My customs, my people, my duty, and yes... The queen.<eos> I want to give you this world, But i will not force you to take it.
And here this is.<eos> Yeah, I saw that.<eos> And it makes you feel...?<eos> Like it must be a slow news day.<eos> There's no infraction here, legal or departmental.<eos> I understand you've been speculating in real estate.<eos> Yeah, well, I've been working Brooklyn North Narcotics now for, like, 12 years, and thanks to a lot of hard work from all our guys, you know, we're bringing back a hellhole.<eos> Block by block.<eos> So, yeah, you know, I bought a house, I made some money.<eos> After I flipped it, I bought another house, kind of like that.
Obviously.<eos> Everything worked out great.<eos> What do you think, Harry?<eos> Can you get the e-mail back?<eos> That is the $64 question.<eos> Which actually is my hourly rate.<eos> But you're a friend, so you can just take me to dinner.<eos> Probably cheaper to pay him.<eos> Listen, Harry, you get this book back before Molly's publisher reads it,<eos> I will chew up a prime rib and feed it to you like a baby bird.
My fixer-upper hall monitor.<eos> Anyway, I stepped away from class to retrieve my shatterproof Suh-weet.<eos> Thanks.<eos> When I got to my office, I found Zeke in here digging around.<eos> Trespassing in a teacher's office.<eos> This is strike three for you, Zeke.<eos> I'm afraid that means automatic suspension.<eos> Uh, but I got a good reason.<eos> Save it. Tina, I need you to escort Zeke to the principal's office.<eos> I'd do it myself, but I dropped my cell phone in the toilet, and I need to put it in rice immediately.
Yeah, we're good, Rudy.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Tina's giving Rudy some 'tude-y.<eos> Shut up, Zeke.<eos> I'm sorry I said "shut up."<eos> You shut up.<eos> Look what Teddy did!<eos> Funky pattern.<eos> I'm putting it up!
She always point where the Earth's energy indicates.<eos> - Theo, sing your song!<eos> - No! Not again!<eos> Manduca,I willnotsingalone.<eos> Singwithme !<eos> Come.<eos> Who are you?<eos> How can you live alone in a jungle like this?<eos> Manduca, you have the compass?<eos> You didn't leave it in the longhouse?

I must remember.<eos> I need to keep the music of Cohiuanos.<eos> You will show me the way?<eos> I do not know him.<eos> You have to find out.<eos> Move your luggage out.<eos> Ready.<eos> Satisfied?<eos> Show me that box.<eos> I will not let you throw it away.
He spent more time in the box than a cherry cordial.<eos> You from Mass.?<eos> - Concord, you?<eos> - Dover.<eos> Brad Davis.<eos> - Mike Walsh, nice to know you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Congratulations on the house.<eos> It was a steal.<eos> I knew someone would snap it up.
- Morning. - What's all this?<eos> - Going on a trip? - (Chuckles)<eos> The roof's been leaking like a sieve since the storm.<eos> We need to move to a motel while it gets fixed.<eos> - Which sucks.<eos> - Will. Language.<eos> - Well, how long you out for?<eos> - The estimate says two days, which probably means four.<eos> Where's your backpack?<eos> Go back up and get it, please.
That's weird.<eos> - Um...<eos> - What?<eos> Um...<eos> The, uh... condom...<eos> Isn't here.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Uh...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I don't see it.
- History is not new evidence.<eos> As it turns out, we do agree on one key detail.<eos> Your company's current pipeline is not the worst thing on earth.<eos> - Then what is?<eos> - The first pipeline. The one Anneca built in 1988, four years before the current one.<eos> Is that what he told you?<eos> The man is delusional.<eos> - Probably.<eos> - There was only one pipeline.<eos> We broke ground to build it in '92.
How long?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Please find out how long that's going to take'?<eos> It's going to take how long it takes.<eos> No. Well, can you hurry up the process a little bit?<eos> Well, then, I'm going to do it myself. Stop.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, stop.<eos> - I don't want to wait for...<eos> - I'll expedite it.
Can you do me a favor?<eos> Just give this to him'?<eos> Unless, he doesn't have to read it all, but it's just to get him started.<eos> Sure.<eos> Just a couple things.<eos> I'll let him know.<eos> Can you do me one more favor actually?<eos> Can you just charge my phone?<eos> My phone died.<eos> Maybe I'll just grab it when I'm leaving?
Sure.<eos> Just a couple things.<eos> I'll let him know.<eos> Can you do me one more favor actually?<eos> Can you just charge my phone?<eos> My phone died.<eos> Maybe I'll just grab it when I'm leaving?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That cool'?<eos> I can plug it in.
That's nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just got to sit a minute.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Take a deep breath in.<eos> Exhale all the negative out.<eos> Deep breath.<eos> Push it all out.<eos> Cancer's gone.<eos> You beat it.
I'm celebrating my anniversary with my wife in New York.<eos> We ran into him at a French restaurant.<eos> There's no way in hell I believe he just randomly wandered in.<eos> He claims he was at a symposium at NYU.<eos> What is he really doing here?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Is it possible that Klaus is playing us?<eos> That this is somehow about getting close to my wife?<eos> He's got a briefcase.<eos> Elizabeth's security team checked it, but it was the family and friends search.
That this is somehow about getting close to my wife?<eos> He's got a briefcase.<eos> Elizabeth's security team checked it, but it was the family and friends search.<eos> They could've missed something.<eos> Klaus is a money launderer and a smuggler.<eos> He's not an assassin.<eos> He could have a weapon.<eos> Maybe a vial of sarin.<eos> He would've known he'd be searched.<eos> He would find some way to conceal it.
A symbol associated with the "Ritual of Awakening,"<eos> a ceremony that sparks the power of those with witch heritage.<eos> There was once a thriving coven in this area.<eos> Their descendants could number into the thousands.<eos> A bell rings and 1,000 people turn into witches?<eos> We're talking mayhem.<eos> Only three people were affected.<eos> Clearly, this ritual did not have the intended effect.<eos> Whatever the case, we have to make sure that that bell does not ring again.<eos> We crack it.
Henry.<eos> Henry is the source of all our ills.<eos> We take out the heart of this evil, the limbs will surely follow.<eos> I will not hesitate.<eos> Not again.<eos> One thing's for sure.<eos> I'm glad I'm not in this alone.<eos> I echo that sentiment, Lieutenant.<eos> The witch bell.<eos> You cracked it once.

No, no.<eos> We'd expect that.<eos> There is another possible location.<eos> The bell I intercepted in 1773 was en route to Sleepy Hollow Town Hall.<eos> That town hall's been boarded up for years now.<eos> We arm ourselves to the teeth.<eos> Stage a full-frontal assault.<eos> A distraction?<eos> Long enough to find the bell.<eos> Destroy it.
So much for the old ways.<eos> Not entirely.<eos> The bomb on the bell, they haven't spotted it yet.<eos> Doesn't change the fact that we're tied up and weaponless.<eos> Tied, yes.<eos> Hardly weaponless.<eos> I have two flintlock pistols beneath my coat loaded with Greek fire charges.<eos> You been holding out on me?<eos> I did say "armed to the teeth."<eos> A direct hit to the black powder would ignite it.
We're on the verge of signing a peace deal with them for God's sake.<eos> That deal isn't worth the paper it's printed on.<eos> Sure, it might buy us a few months, maybe even a few years, but with the Ayatollahs still running things, Javani and Shiraz aren't partners.<eos> They're puppets.<eos> You can still salvage this, sir.<eos> It's not too late to get on board.<eos> Forget it, Andrew.<eos> It's over.<eos> Not by a long shot, Mr. President.<eos> The coup is already in motion, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
Like Hanna.<eos> She isn't taking mine or Spencer's calls.<eos> Have you talked to her?<eos> No. I haven't.<eos> But hopefully, I can lure her out of the house with a hot fudge brownie.<eos> Uh, I don't think that's an actual parking spot, Spence.<eos> The laptop's moving.<eos> What?<eos> Mona's laptop.<eos> Somebody's taken it out of the storage unit.
I mean, why would he be willing to kill for Alison?<eos> Spencer and Aria almost froze to death tonight.<eos> And I...<eos> Hanna, I got to go.<eos> I'll call you when I get home.<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> I just need to wipe down the counters.<eos> Okay.<eos> And about your dish...<eos> You didn't ruin it, Emily.
I'm not here for your needs.<eos> My job is to take care of your cousin.<eos> Well, he would want us to stay longer.<eos> I understand.<eos> But what Mr. Mahoney needs right now is rest.<eos> Spencer?<eos> Spencer, slow down.<eos> There was blood everywhere!<eos> Okay?<eos> I threw out the purse, but what if somebody finds it and they turn it in?
This isn't a debate.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> You need to tell me now.<eos> Hanna!<eos> Okay, I... I went there to move everything out of the unit.<eos> I thought Mona's bloody clothes would be there, maybe her body.<eos> I thought you just said you had nothing to do with her death.<eos> I didn't.<eos> But someone put my name on the storage unit's lease.<eos> And they rented it the day before Mona was murdered.
I'd love to see you again before you leave.<eos> To be honest with you, Cece, I've always had a crush on you.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Okay, so I've never said this out loud before, but...<eos> I'm... in love with someone else.<eos> It's kind of complicated because he has a girlfriend, so I can't tell anybody.<eos> I mean, Winston knows, but you, you don't know Winston.<eos> I got to get back to the truck soon.<eos> Power steering's out again.<eos> I'm the only one strong enough to drive it.
You want to release Sergei's virus?<eos> Like a bad itch.<eos> When it gathers its Intel and tries to phone home, we can trace it back to Sergei.<eos> In theory.<eos> Do you remember what happened last time?<eos> It blew out all of our systems.<eos> The furnace overheated, almost burned down the building.<eos> I've learned from my mistakes, okay?<eos> I've been studying this virus.<eos> I think I can defang it with this.

Oh, sorry. I'll make some more coffee right now.<eos> No worries. I'll do it.<eos> 'Cause you don't want my grubby peasant hands on it?
Maybe Linus is working with this mystery woman.<eos> And Cody got caught up in whatever game the two of them are playing.<eos> Well, my guess is, you come all this way to Portland, you're going to play this game more than once.<eos> Checked with Robbery. They've been hearing about businessmen, single guys from out of town, being trick-rolled.<eos> - Put out an APB on Balouzian's car.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If Balouzian's the guy who attacked our victim, he could be Wesen.<eos> What kind is the question.<eos> And if they're gonna pull this again, where?<eos> If they rented the first condo using Toynbee's identity, maybe they used it more than once.
Malcolm, don't.<eos> Killing him.<eos> It seems like it just perpetuates the cycle of violence that he celebrated.<eos> Joe Carroll has escaped federal lockup twice.<eos> I for one will sleep easier knowing he's dead.<eos> Well, just because something makes our lives easier doesn't make it right.<eos> As doctors, we do everything we can to preserve life, all life.<eos> You agree with me, don't you?<eos> Cancer's a living organism, right?<eos> Do you hesitate when you kill it?
No, and it's not just about the ads.<eos> It's about how people are getting to the ads.<eos> So if you search "heart disease," like our Vic, you get the heart disease info page.<eos> Fine, okay, but if you search general symptoms like "fatigue,"<eos> or "nausea" and you click around long enough, you end up... At the heart disease info page.<eos> Yeah, I tried it, too.<eos> I got this rash on my elbow.<eos> It-it's not on his elbow.<eos> Look, I searched "rash," then it took me down some wormhole of related symptoms, and then eventually, I ended up on a page that said I had cancer.<eos> The algorithm takes any symptom and links it up with a bunch of others.
How were you first contacted about this job?<eos> I met a guy on a cancer support chat group online.<eos> Said he had access to black market Lindrexia and said I could have some if I helped him distribute it.<eos> Did you ever meet with him in person?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> It was always a dead drop.<eos> No one was ever there.<eos> Lung cancer.<eos> Kicked it twice.
We leave them here, the cops will be up our asses so fast.<eos> I say we pull the backhoe around, dig a hole.<eos> A few Gypsies fall off the face of the earth, who's gonna give a damn?<eos> They're family!<eos> Not some fucking trash to be thrown out.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Fucking animals.<eos> - Andreas, you gotta calm down.<eos> - But these...<eos> - Get the guys to put the bodies on a truck, appoint someone to drive it to a long-term lot somewhere, lock it up, let the bodies freeze, and that will buy us some time
What is fable?<eos> - Where is Ruth?<eos> - And where is Mabel?<eos> If one is aware that one is losing one's mind, one can't really be losing it, right?<eos> What are you asking me for?<eos> I don't exist.<eos> Go away! Shoo!<eos> Skedaddle.<eos> Is that Isaac's phone?<eos> He left it to me in his will.
- Meaning what?<eos> Well, I've always wondered why your kind developed this physiological characteristic.<eos> It has little effect on human prey and only negative consequences on other upir.<eos> Peter's here.<eos> I'm putting you on speaker.<eos> Spivak is a sulfur-based life-form.<eos> Upir toxin has an extremely high concentration of nitrogen oxide.<eos> It would only take a minute amount to cause an extremely robust reaction, should the two substances come into contact.<eos> This toxin is your evolutionary advantage over a competing species, the reason you were able to wipe them out.<eos> We're going to need to extract it from the glands in your mouth.
Let's hope they're still alive.<eos> If the cartel knows that his son used a drug tunnel, they're gonna kill him.<eos> Send a message not to mess with their business.<eos> Did you get an address?<eos> Yeah, all we need is a ride.<eos> Grab the van, take the family to the consulate.<eos> I'll wait here until the coroner arrives for Mauricio.<eos> You'll need one of these.<eos> We'll check out Naziri's warehouse.<eos> See if we can link it to this lab.
How?<eos> I'm Olivia Pope.<eos> And it's funny because it's useless.<eos> Eat.<eos> It's not bad.<eos> It's not good, but...<eos> Not bad.<eos> Right.<eos> The journalism stuff, it pays the bills.<eos> I've been working on a novel for years, but if I sold it, I could have my daughter with me full-time, settle down, get married.
There's more.<eos> There has to be.<eos> You love falling in love.<eos> The moment when it's all possibilities and dreams.<eos> You think he's out of my league?<eos> The thought never crossed my mind.<eos> Where are we going to drink tonight?<eos> Somewhere dimly lit and terribly old-fashioned.<eos> So we're on the doorstep, saying goodbye.<eos> And I'm trying to give him Pavel's number, because I don't have a phone except he doesn't write it down.
He had me open the case.<eos> I was surprised he even knew what Esephera was, but he knew exactly what he was looking for.<eos> He even knew how much we charged. It was strange.<eos> But I thought it was for someone he knew.<eos> Only you don't know who.<eos> So that's it?<eos> You're just here to clear your conscience?<eos> Uh,<eos> I have a phone number for Simon.<eos> He gave it to me at the pharmacy.
Who was that?<eos> Kitty, what are you doing...?<eos> Who was that?<eos> My boss at Leda.<eos> Del Gruner.<eos> Why?<eos> You said I could come here if I ever needed to.<eos> You gave me a key.<eos> Kitty, tell me what's going on.<eos> Before we got De Merville on the phone the other day, I wondered... what it would be like to hear his voice again. After five years, what it would do to me, if I would even recognize it.
You will attend court, dance, flirt, gossip, play cards, seduce<eos> but henceforth you will do it in my service.<eos> You will tell me what people are doing what they are saying who is sharing a bed with whom who is cheating on their wife and who cheats at cards.<eos> If you disobey me, you will suffer the same fate as your mother.<eos> From now on I own you.<eos> That is my offer.<eos> Very well.<eos> - Why this color?<eos> - Because it's regal.<eos> I hate it!
Uh, not for long, hopefully.<eos> Oh. Uh, I j-<eos> - I'm sorry. I just- - I just wandered in.<eos> Well, it's an open house, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> And-- and the realtor said there was a-- there was a home office, and I've always wanted one.<eos> Listen, this is a great house.<eos> You should buy it.<eos> But whatever you do, turn this room into a den.<eos> When you have a home office, you use it.
It's... it's the first book I ever sold Adrian.<eos> The day we met.<eos> Michael's a rare book vendor.<eos> Our hands touched when I was ringing her up...<eos> And it was...<eos> It was such a high.<eos> It was electric.<eos> We were both too shy to ask for a date.<eos> So I wrote my number on a bookmark.<eos> I saw it as soon as I got home, and then I called.
This is good news, they're happy.<eos> Oh, they're happy she crushed my hand?<eos> Congratulations on a job well done, Dr. Frankenstein.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm the boss, I had to make the call.<eos> The boss of what?<eos> Have you even thought about what we're doing here?<eos> Yes, this project could save lives, a lot of them.<eos> Well, I'm sure the people who split the atom said the same thing.<eos> Julie, Humanichs was supposed to be a revolution.<eos> Six months, and all we've done is turn it into another weapon.
I got everything you need right here.<eos> Couple of drops of this in your eyes...<eos> Aw, it's just a kid, man!<eos> Who cares?<eos> Nice work, eagle eyes.<eos> What's up, homes?<eos> You a little lost?<eos> I'm looking for an apartment. Uh, 19203 Grand Avenue.<eos> You don't have a GPS?<eos> I turned it off so I won't be found.
I screwed up.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll say one thing, you are consistent.<eos> Missed all those birthday parties and school recitals.<eos> - We gave up on Christmas, but...<eos> - But...<eos> She came to me first.<eos> And not you, that's it.<eos> She came to me, not you, and that's got you all kinds of pissed off.<eos> No, what has me all kinds of pissed off is the fact that she gave you a second chance and you blew it.
MOLLY: So... you're saying if we succeed with Taylor... it'll probably kill Ethan?<eos> Most likely, yes.<eos> Molly.<eos> I know this is impossible.<eos> Sacrificing my child.<eos> Yes, that is... pretty impossible.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I can't make that decision.<eos> I won't!<eos> ETHAN: Then let me make it, Mom.
What the hell?<eos> _<eos> _ [electronic trilling]<eos> Where's Ethan?<eos> Mom?<eos> Oh, Ethan.<eos> Ethan.<eos> How?<eos> When I tried installing the anti-virus, it triggered an emergency firewall.<eos> John must have put it in there to protect him.
Is there any sign of Colonel Cox?<eos> Colonel Cox has been redeployed to a post more suitable to his talents.<eos> Does he have those?<eos> Talents?<eos> So that would make you...<eos> Colonel Emmett Darrow.<eos> The king is dead. Long live the king.<eos> Well, I've squandered enough of your time.<eos> High priests at the security desk tell me my transfer form is missing a signature.<eos> Leave it with the girl.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Please just leave it.<eos> Just leave it, please. I'm fine.<eos> - It's fine. Let me help.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Okay, I'll get out of your face.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm impressed. You're doing great.<eos> Can you juggle the apples while you do that too?<eos> How about this? I will take the bike. I'll wheel it to your front door, and then you can frog-march me off your land.
Okay.<eos> Now, this won't take long.<eos> You okay, honey?<eos> All right, you see that?<eos> It's all I could find.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I don't like this, Milo.<eos> You have to understand that Jennifer is the conduit of a force that is affecting every kid in the world.<eos> If you start testing her, you'll be playing with fire.<eos> Playing with fire is how we learned to master it.
It's standard intake procedure.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The gaggle is gonna pounce.<eos> I assume that you're talking about the strip search.<eos> It's standard intake procedure.<eos> Bahrain's gonna take it as an affront, ma'am.<eos> I know, and that's unfortunate.<eos> But the Hassanis should have thought of that before they took Ms. Shihab as their slave.<eos> Speaking of which, has Bahrain accepted our immunity waiver yet?<eos> They haven't rejected it.
I've forgotten my prayer book, I'll see you in there.<eos> I don't know how you coped, Father.<eos> Cold showers.<eos> Morning, afternoon and evening prayers.<eos> Lumpy porridge and lumpy beds.<eos> It certainly brings back memories.<eos> - It's worse than prison. - Is it?<eos> You said there had been some developments?<eos> Douglas Hitchens' prayer book.<eos> I found it in Wolfe's room.
~ What?<eos> Fire!<eos> We could have been killed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for saving my life!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I think so.<eos> What happened?<eos> A leak in the petrol tank.<eos> Didn't you notice when you repaired it?
Fire!<eos> We could have been killed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for saving my life!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I think so.<eos> What happened?<eos> A leak in the petrol tank.<eos> Didn't you notice when you repaired it?<eos> Someone must have punctured it when I left it outside the hotel.
Reluctantly.<eos> Did you have to threaten him with your gun?<eos> Like I said, that gun was...<eos> Easy enough to get into the hands of an officer.<eos> The safe wasn't forced.<eos> Only you and Mrs. Grayson have a key.<eos> But she has an alibi.<eos> Gregoire saw her leaving the room after the gunshots were fired.<eos> How could I have dumped the gun in the pond and still been first on the scene?<eos> You could have hidden it, then taken it to the pond later.
This is Lady Felicia Montague...<eos> The police are busy searching for a thief.<eos> The last place they'll look for him is here.<eos> - Thank goodness!<eos> - Well, if it isn't the bishop.<eos> - I was expecting you earlier.<eos> - Tell me you've brought reinforcements.<eos> I'm afraid I came alone.<eos> Not even armed with your trusty umbrella?<eos> In all the excitement, I must have left it in the cloakroom.
I'm sure she's fabulous.<eos> But she didn't want me.<eos> I guess not.<eos> But she did keep you.<eos> She didn't abort you.<eos> What does abort mean?<eos> When you don't keep the baby.<eos> - Before or after it's born?<eos> - Before.<eos> - You kill it?
No. I mean, she talked about her sex life on the air all the time, but her lovers always got code names.<eos> The All-Nighter, Sir Cries-A-Lot.<eos> So, there were a lot of lovers?<eos> From what she said, yeah.<eos> I don't know any names or anything, but everybody around here knew she had a thing for men already in relationships.<eos> Do you think one of her lovers did this?<eos> We'll look into every possibility.<eos> This way.<eos> This is the line to Sasha's mic.<eos> It should ground into this panel, but the killer ran it over there into the backup generator.
Remind me why we're glad she's back again.<eos> Please tell me that Liam is not dead.<eos> Fine.<eos> So I was feeding, and then that little voice inside my head that tells me to stop, he never piped up.<eos> More, please.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Well, this is awkward.<eos> Ugh. God.<eos> Oh. You got blood on my necklace!<eos> Now I'm gonna have to clean it.
Think?<eos> That seems like something you might remember.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> I mean...<eos> I was just 13 when he fell to his death from the stairs.<eos> And you know that...<eos> That's around the time I started to lose my mind.<eos> Lyman...<eos> He showed me this police report, and it says that I pushed him.<eos> Well, Mama had her judge friend bury it to protect me, but now if I don't sign the conservatorship
Ant. Ant.<eos> Ant.<eos> Ant.<eos> Ant.<eos> God, they're everywhere.<eos> Are we sure that we've cleaned up all the food and crumbs?<eos> Why is everyone looking at us?<eos> We're the ones who eat up all the crumbs.<eos> Yeah, we're the solution.<eos> Well, there are no ants on my desk because I sanitize it daily.
Okay, for the last time, that is not what happened.<eos> And that's cocaine.<eos> Are you sure? [chuckles]<eos> Five dollars says you're wrong.<eos> Let me get in there.<eos> Take a good look and smell. No, don't.<eos> [groans] Okay. It was cocaine.<eos> Turns out I was accidentally doing some cocaine.<eos> Not on accident.<eos> You put it in your nose on purpose.

You're surprised?<eos> Your father loved many things.<eos> But most of all, he loved beauty... in a song, a painting, a man, a woman, and your mother was so beautiful.<eos> Now, I had learned to accept this as part of the package, the occasional night he never came home, but this was different.<eos> - How?<eos> - You.<eos> You made it different.<eos> When he found out Vivian was pregnant, he made a decision.<eos> He was gonna become a husband, a father.<eos> But like so many promises he made, he couldn't keep it.
I don't know.<eos> Because I was thinking you need a suit for the trial.<eos> Could go buy one in the morning.<eos> I have a suit.<eos> (Rosie) No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It's slightly iridescent, but the pants match the coat, and that's what makes it a suit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You were wearing it when we first met.
- Right, the plot in Queens.<eos> Our children will want to see us, visit us.<eos> You think?<eos> So what?<eos> We sacrifice everything in our lives for our kids.<eos> We're supposed to do that afterwards too?<eos> - Yamas.<eos> Give me your jacket.<eos> I'll hang it up for you.<eos> You can wear it tomorrow in court.
This place is worse than prison.<eos> At least in prison, you get 30 minutes in the yard.<eos> You know you don't have to be here, right?<eos> You can leave whenever you want.<eos> Uh, hi, Judy.<eos> Welcome to what's happening.<eos> We are on lockdown.<eos> But you are an officer of the court, which means you have a badge.<eos> So?<eos> So use it.
That is not an altoid.<eos> Oh, man, that's my calcium pill.<eos> You can still eat it.<eos> It's good for your bones.<eos> Look, look, look.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, you've been holding out on the chocolate cell phone.<eos> No, fool, it's not a chocolate phone.<eos> It's Gary's.<eos> I snagged it after you guys were finished looking at that puppy video which was so sad and moving.
Now what will you sacrifice for me?<eos> You're insane.<eos> I won't ask you to betray him any further.<eos> - But Bruce Wayne is a complication. - Unh. Unh.<eos> He has to be dealt with.<eos> You'll be safe here till I'm done.<eos> You think you can stop him alone?<eos> Who says I'm alone?<eos> Red security grid up and active?<eos> Unless someone shut it down and didn't bother to tell us.
No, you don't understand, man.<eos> I-I didn't kill anybody.<eos> You're covered in blood, you've been screaming like a madman, running around with a chainsaw.<eos> No, I-I don't remember any of that.<eos> Well, what do you remember?<eos> I was cutting down an old tree, okay?<eos> I'm a park ranger.<eos> And the tree was dead on the inside.<eos> You're saying the body was already inside the tree?<eos> I-I started cutting it down, and all of a sudden, blood started spraying...
Please tell him to come back.<eos> We have a murder to solve.<eos> But, Dr. Brennan...<eos> And we might be working late.<eos> Wetestedtheequipment that you use to fix the flooring in the building, and your mallet caused the victim's injuries and tested positive for her blood.<eos> So your move next.<eos> No. You guys got it all wrong.<eos> I didn't kill Justine.<eos> Right. So somebody stole your mallet, then killed Justine with it, and then what?<eos> Planted it back on you?
Well, it's a long story, but most of it you'll think is rubbish, so I'll just skip to the happy ending.<eos> We brought you a present.<eos> A birthday present.<eos> Well, it's neither of our birthdays.<eos> No, it's for Sweets' birthday.<eos> Do you remember the thing he would do?<eos> He would give out presents on his birthday.<eos> He would say how grateful he was to all of us<eos> - for another good year. - Apparently, he finished your present just before he died and never told anyone.<eos> He was gonna give it to you today.
Alone.<eos> Of course.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> What was all that about?<eos> Like he said.<eos> Counselling.<eos> It is the most plausible explanation.<eos> You have a very loose definition of "plausible".<eos> Just a small amount of strychnine in the bowl of Frederick's pipe - one puff, that would be enough, plus conveniently burning the evidence.<eos> Even if that's how he ingested it, it doesn't mean he didn't put it there himself - evidenced by the vial that was found beside him.
Meddle?<eos> Besides, did Jacob even smoke a pipe?<eos> ~ I don't recall.<eos> ~ So how was the poison administered to him?<eos> I haven't quite worked that out.<eos> Yet.<eos> But I urge you not make the same mistake as your predecessor by thinking that Jacob's murder was suicide.<eos> And I urge you to get on your bike.<eos> Both figuratively and literally.<eos> Strychnine acts in seconds, so Jacob had to have ingested it in the room.
Which was what?<eos> Two murders.<eos> First Frederick, and then Jacob.<eos> You mean... that thing really works?<eos> Jacob was troubled, but was clearly a genius.<eos> You've been back in time?<eos> Twice.<eos> I hid in the corner a year ago.<eos> I witnessed the murderer put strychnine in the bowl of Frederick's pipe.<eos> And then, yesterday, the culprit put the poison in the cooling fan so Jacob would've inhaled it when he turned on his machine, which also explains why some of the strychnine fragments went into the worm tank.
Well, there must be a spare?<eos> Well, it's in the safe at head office.<eos> But, if something had happened, they'd have let me know.<eos> When did you last go into the vault?<eos> After we closed to the public yesterday.<eos> We had a delivery scheduled and I waited for it to arrive, escorted the couriers into the vault, and locked the door as they left.<eos> What was the delivery?<eos> Well, we often store valuable items for other organisations, our part to help the local community.<eos> The gallery at Little Haydock are loaning a valuable item from a collector in Paris.<eos> I said that we'd keep it safe while they prepared the space.
I think she needs time to think.<eos> That's the one thing I may not have.<eos> I am here because I've discovered that Billy planned the robbery.<eos> - I've spoken to one of his men. - Billy? Are you sure?<eos> The one question that's been going around in my head all day... ..is why me?<eos> Why was I taken to the vault with you?<eos> Especially, as it turns out now, that the robbers knew I was there.<eos> Billy must have... overheard me setting up the meeting with you.<eos> I don't believe that there was a trust fund.<eos> I think you invented it to make sure that I was at the bank.
Yeah, this one is positive.<eos> Which makes 30 positives.<eos> But there was that one negative.<eos> The negative was a popsicle stick.<eos> Do you even bother telling your boyfriend if there's only, like, a 96% chance you could be pregnant?<eos> 100% chance.<eos> It was a popsicle stick.<eos> I saw you eat the popsicle and then draw this little minus sign on it and then pee on it for some reason.
In fact, why don't you all come to dinner tonight?<eos> This isn't one of those dinners where you guilt everyone, is it?<eos> No.<eos> Guilt dinners are only for you.<eos> And they may need to stop 'cause it's getting expensive.<eos> I personally would hate to see the man who abandoned me with two small children, but if you're cool with it, then fine.<eos> See you at 7:00.<eos> Bring dessert.<eos> Oh, I shouldn't bring dessert.<eos> I'll just eat it in the car.
Ma?<eos> Ma! - [door shuts]<eos> Yes, hi.<eos> How much to go to San Francisco?<eos> Mindy, wait!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hold on one second, sir.<eos> Okay, you caught me.<eos> I took your candlestick.<eos> I was just borrowing it.
What the hell?<eos> No, listen, when Richie was 15, I wouldn't let him go live with Bret Easton Ellis.<eos> So he threatened to throw himself off the Empire State Building.<eos> I said, "Good.<eos> Here's ten bucks.<eos> Enjoy the view.<eos> Bring me back a T-shirt."<eos> Annette, as much as I love hearing the origin stories of gay men, I gotta go.<eos> I'm sorry for ruining your dinner.<eos> No, Mindy, you didn't ruin it.
Yeah, we were like brothers.<eos> He was always there for me.<eos> And the one time that he needed me...<eos> And yet, you knew nothing about the gun?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Well, why... why?<eos> He wouldn't ask me, would he?<eos> I mean, I'm a doctor, after all, I...<eos> I took an oath to protect life.<eos> So, where might he have got it from?
Be my guest.<eos> Now, that's my kind of speed.<eos> Well done.<eos> Well, it's not smoking, but it's definitely a gun. 9mm.<eos> Just like the murder weapon.<eos> Ballistics will match it.<eos> It's nothing to do with me.<eos> Then we won't find your fingerprints on it, then?<eos> You wanted a gun.<eos> You got it, and you killed Jake.

Look, OK, so I got the gun.<eos> That's why my prints might be on it.<eos> But I got it for Jake.
Stripped himself of his valuables and hid them away.<eos> And then the final act.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> The gun would still be there.<eos> Well, it was.<eos> Until someone else made it disappear.<eos> You knew about it, didn't you?<eos> And as his oldest friend, you had to be first on the scene.<eos> So you could get the gun out of sight.<eos> Later, you'd put it with the valuables into your medical bag and get them safely away when you accompanied your friend's body.
How did she think that was gonna play to the guy on the street?<eos> Not to mention the Aceway boardroom.<eos> If they're still on the fence about settling claims with fixed sums, they won't be for long.<eos> She probably just gave the killer exactly what he wants.<eos> Nick made something of himself.<eos> So did some of the other people on that plane.<eos> Why shouldn't they be recognized?<eos> Why shouldn't their families receive more?<eos> Marcus called-- the sketch from the gun dealer should be here soon.<eos> He'll e-mail us once he gets it.
Well, if you did, maybe you wouldn't be choking down a damn Khan worm right now.<eos> What's a Khan worm?<eos> You think that's what it is?<eos> Or some sort of freak cousin.<eos> Freak cousin of what?<eos> A couple years back, Dean and I worked a case.<eos> We got stuck in a cannery with this worm.<eos> It would get into people's bodies and -- It was freaking awful.<eos> All right, so you've been to this rodeo before.<eos> How do we kill it?
She doesn't have to.<eos> I made it at home.<eos> I set up a little lab in the garage.<eos> Hey, there could be a finder's fee in this for you.<eos> So it's a moldable rubber cast in a unique honeycomb structure.<eos> Inspired by bees?<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> I used a high silicon-to-cornstarch ratio so that the rubber's extremely elastic.<eos> Obviously.<eos> If you cover a beaker with this, you can drop it on the ground without a scratch.
That goes for both the dead as well as the living.<eos> I made a mistake once.<eos> NCIS!<eos> Stop!<eos> For six-tenths of a second.<eos> Six-tenths of a second, and I have been obsessing on it for... close to eight years.<eos> Everyone always accuses me of running, but there is a difference between running and trying to put something behind you.<eos> There is.<eos> But if you keep avoiding that "something," people wonder if you still have your track pants and jogging shoes on.<eos> Assuming Reagan was having an affair with Hackett, I've been working the Colorado number to see if we can use it to locate Reagan.
Sheriff Reyes will provide a full briefing in an hour.<eos> You've tried triangulating their radios and cell phones.<eos> You got nothing.<eos> I mean, this many people... command post, staging area... you're dividing into search teams...<eos> It's the same protocol as when combat patrols don't check in.<eos> It means you guys have absolutely... no clue where they are.<eos> I'm Calvin Riggs... my brother Daniel is one<eos> - You have my word we're doing everything possible to find your brother and those men.<eos> Mm. And there's that look.<eos> - Infantry grunts call it "propaganda face."
Her daughter.<eos> And no one will allow me to be vindicated.<eos> No one seems to consider how much I... how much I miss her.<eos> How much pain I still feel.<eos> I know I'm... I'm not a perfect man, but I loved Carolyn.<eos> And they shouldn't be allowed to tell 15 million people that I did this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Dylan has a black eye.<eos> - I saw.<eos> - How did he get it?
These were called herms, as in Hermes the god, and these were little pillars - or large pillars in some cases - with a phallus on them and they were rubbed in oil and then, as you passed one, you'd give it a good fondle...<eos> There you are, another one there. ..to give you good luck.<eos> - And where is it from, darling?<eos> - Greece.<eos> The great period of Greece, if you like.<eos> In fact, during the Peloponnesian War in about 415 BC there was a terrible incident known as The Mutilation of the Herms when they were at war with Sparta, the Athenians, and every single penis had been hacked off.<eos> And they blamed this on the disastrous expedition to<eos> - Sicily a little later. - Well, it changes...<eos> That period of history, the discovery that the penis has anything to do with reproduction changes everything.<eos> There's no natural reason to suppose that the predisposition to pop it in a snug hole somewhere, which is what all humans and animals...we can observe animals doing, and humans have the same predisposition, the idea that,
In 1895, their FA Cup was stolen from the window of a sports shop in Birmingham and, 63 years later, a man called Harry Burge confessed that he had been the man who had stolen it, - and he had melted it down and made counterfeit half-crown coins. - Wow!<eos> The second major trophy to have been mislaid by Aston Villa<eos> - was the European Cup in... What year did they...?<eos> - 1981.<eos> Yes, they mislaid it in '82. Two members of the...<eos> - 1982.<eos> - It would have been, yes.<eos> Two members of the team decided to take the cup to a darts match, where it disappeared.<eos> And many years later a man called Adrian Reed was identified as the culprit.<eos> He took it to a local police station.

February 29th.<eos> Yeah, well done, absolutely.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> Right, well, it is.<eos> I'm standing my ground on this one.<eos> They squeeze into the middle of February and add an extra 24th, so the 24th becomes the 25th,<eos> 25th becomes 26th, 26th becomes 27th, 27th becomes 28th, 28th becomes 29th.<eos> The reason for that is that the Roman calendar was divided into three.<eos> The Kalends, the Nones and the Ides.<eos> And when it came to discovering, which they did, that a year was actually not 365 days but 365 days and a quarter, they added it into one of those calendar series.
Still, Liam can get to you in ways no one else can-- primal ways.<eos> Okay, that was before I knew he was a beast.<eos> Besides, I've already proven that I can keep myself from going primal, thank you very much.<eos> Once, maybe.<eos> But I like the confidence, I do.<eos> By the way, any luck finding the gem?<eos> Be nice to keep his beast side in check.<eos> JT, I told you, I went to the dungeon; it's not there.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I-I swore I hid it there.

Yeah.<eos> Why don't you sit?<eos> Thank you.<eos> To turning the page.<eos> So...<eos> Agent Gaad is under so much pressure with this investigation.<eos> I'm not sure he's gonna make it.<eos> He lost his cool yesterday in a way that he never has before.<eos> He actually attacked the mail robot.<eos> And Gene couldn't fix it.

Help?<eos> What's in it for you?<eos> Because if you're going to fry that candy-coated bitch, I want in.<eos> You want to help?<eos> Tell me how to turn him back.<eos> Sam, it can wait.<eos> Tell me how!<eos> The hex bag that I'm wearing.<eos> It will reverse the spell.<eos> Squeeze it, and you'll return to your proper age.
Now, go get your coat and run.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Go.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Jose?<eos> My cousin was feeling faint, I was just letting in some air.<eos> Why is there a coffee pot on the floor?<eos> I am sorry, sir. I, uh...<eos> I will bring it to the kitchen in a moment.
(Cecile): We have had to sell so many things.<eos> Silverware.<eos> Candlesticks.<eos> Your friend Gregoire's paintings.<eos> We've got nothing now.<eos> Michel is out selling table cloths so that we can look for bread in the market.<eos> - (Aurora): That's too bad...<eos> - How can you imagine...<eos> Michel buying bread?<eos> And who knows what they put in it?
So I did what you asked.<eos> I went through the evidence from Mark's safe house top to bottom.<eos> You're gonna tell me I'm crazy, right, chasing ghosts?<eos> Actually, I might have something, evidence that a computer was in use.<eos> But there was no computer in the evidence log.<eos> But there was an open Ethernet line with an unusually high data transfer rate.<eos> Someone in that house was spending a lot of time online.<eos> Missing computer.<eos> This is good.<eos> So how... how do we find it?
Your manhood, your dignity.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How?<eos> The cameras that we planted are still active.<eos> They link to this web portal.<eos> If the FBI found the laptop, then they would have taken them down, so somebody else has it.<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> Feds came in the door 90 seconds after Mark split.<eos> Laptop was on your bed.<eos> They have it.

Immortality.<eos> What do you have?<eos> I went through all the evidence logged from Mark's safe house, and I found this.<eos> A receipt.<eos> For a laptop purchased in Rego Park.<eos> I have the BIA, which means if someone is using the laptop<eos> - we can find them in real time.<eos> - How?<eos> I'll just enter the I.D., into our system, see if it pings anywhere.<eos> If not, we'll have to submit warrants to all the telecoms, so maybe we can find it that way.
They also make a really awesome cell phone.<eos> Yeah, but weapons are more likely.<eos> These ghosts, if that's seriously what we're calling them, are stepping up their attacks.<eos> Escalating.<eos> People are so scared, they don't even want to leave their homes.<eos> Unless it's to pack up in the middle of the night, get the hell out of town.<eos> What do you want us to do, take our football and go home?<eos> No. We ask for help.<eos> Oliver walked away.<eos> That was before these guys started taking over our city and turning it into a war zone.
Darn, looks like your services are no longer needed.<eos> Fine, I didn't really want to do it anyway.<eos> It's not like I'm getting an Oscar for this [bleep].<eos> I am so thrilled to be a part of this, honey.<eos> I've already been working on an impression of you that I think you'll adore.<eos> Hard to believe, since you literally know nothing about my life, but whatever.<eos> Good luck, Darlene.<eos> You're gonna need it.<eos> Hey, I didn't get to your yearbook yet.<eos> Do you mind if I get it back to you tomorrow?
What cure?<eos> Jenna's cure?<eos> There is always a cure.<eos> You just have to want to find it.<eos> Yeah, how are you gonna find it if you're dead?<eos> And around and around we go.<eos> Saving people means all of the people, Dean.<eos> Not just that baby.<eos> Not just each other.<eos> I unleashed a force on this world that could destroy it... to save you.
There's 5 heretics... 2 guys, 3 girls...<eos> And your mom isn't home.<eos> - Enzo?<eos> - He's not there either, so if we're going to do this, now is our window.<eos> - Whoa, whoa. - Show me how this works.<eos> First of all, this is a bomb.<eos> Ok.<eos> - That there is a timer.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm gonna set it for 60 seconds.
I had no idea it was, like, you know, actual racing.<eos> It is a beautiful day for racing.<eos> Hey, want a hit?<eos> Sure. Thanks, Crit.<eos> Mmm, this homebrew of yours is oh so refreshing.<eos> Your bread is, uh...<eos> Whoop, hey, there it goes!<eos> Got away from me there.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Uh, you-you kind of threw it.

They all complained of stomach pain.<eos> Francis came in here, lay down...<eos> And died.<eos> Yes.<eos> No sign of a struggle.<eos> So, we have a change of clothes, the key to his Jeep, phone, wallet containing cards and cash.<eos> Now, according to Francis's son, his journal is missing.<eos> Apparently he relied quite heavily on it.<eos> It's what he wrote his notes and dates in.<eos> You think someone's stolen it?
Interesting.<eos> What?<eos> Unless I'm not reading this properly, it looks like the Society is 4,000 out of a pocket.<eos> Yes, it's, um.... out of pocket.<eos> ~ Out of...<eos> ~ I've got it!<eos> OK.<eos> Dwayne, er, they'll need checking for fingerprints.<eos> Also we need to contact Ryan, ask him if he knows where his dad's Jeep is.<eos> Maybe he just borrowed it?
You go to the camp, acquire some water hemlock and when the Society members aren't looking, slip it into the stew and leave unnoticed.<eos> You think I killed Francis?<eos> That's preposterous.<eos> We can prove you were at the woods.<eos> But why?<eos> Revenge?<eos> Ah, the journal at last.<eos> It belonged to Francis.<eos> Everything he did or was going to do with the Society - including the speech he was meant to give today - is in there.<eos> I thought, if I took it...
What's wrong?<eos> Dwayne, if you could search Ryan's bedroom?<eos> Ryan, what's happened?<eos> What were you doing with the Jeep, Ryan?<eos> Just wanted to get out of here.<eos> Get away.<eos> We told you it was missing, you said you didn't know anything about it.<eos> Why was that?<eos> Why were the windows smashed?<eos> Why were you trying to set fire to it?
- Go on.<eos> - Emma had a boyfriend.<eos> - What?<eos> Who? - I don't know.<eos> Yet.<eos> What's going on on your end?<eos> - The breastplate is gone.<eos> - What? What do you mean, gone?<eos> - How?<eos> - Well, if I knew that, Peter, I would have it back in my possession.

Do you want to die today?<eos> I'm not giving you my gun.<eos> If you don't give me your gun, you're going to make me use mine.<eos> Back off!<eos> Back up!<eos> Back up!<eos> Give me your gun!<eos> Tell you what I'll do.<eos> I'll put this right on the floor.<eos> I'll lay on top of it, arms and hands where you can see them so I can't grab it or do nothing.
I-<eos> - I haven't gotten mail in a week.<eos> Nobody writes you.<eos> Officer Swanson, I'll remind you that you are under oath.<eos> Now, please tell us what Mr. Quagmire said he did with the girl.<eos> (sighs) He, uh, said he gave her a Frosty Jim.<eos> And can you please explain to the courtroom what a Frosty Jim is.<eos> Uh...<eos> Sir, you're under oath.<eos> Well, it's when you urinate in a condom, and tie it off, freeze it, and then the woman, um, pretends it's a man.
Electronic devices in the bag.<eos> In the bag.<eos> We searched the ship.<eos> This is everyone on board.<eos> I looked for the rockets; they're not where we left them.<eos> Cell phone in the bag!<eos> Cell phone in the bag now, lady!<eos> Do I have everyone's attention?<eos> One of you knows where my cargo is.<eos> I intend to get it back.
Right, the news...<eos> Sh, sh, sh, sh. And first of all, bad news, I'm afraid, because Britain's motorway network is going to get a new type of speed camera, which is grey and invisible.<eos> And unlike any other motorway speed camera we've seen in the past, this doesn't just come on when the limit is lowered for some reason, but it's on all the time, constantly.<eos> ~ Really?<eos> ~ Yeah, constantly.<eos> That is funny, cos I seem to remember the Tory Party saying they were going to "end the war on the motorist."<eos> ~ I remember that.<eos> ~ But you can end a war by brutally killing everyone.<eos> Hertfordshire Police said, "It's not in the public interest<eos> "to tell anyone where the cameras are." So, fair enough, we'll pay the fine. "I paid it into a bank account,
Yeah!<eos> Play the tape.<eos> Come on.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Yes, wheel spin from an automatic.<eos> Oh, it is wet, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> It will and here it comes.<eos> Down to the first corner and around it.
No need to wonder if they were having an affair.<eos> Not sure it lasted.<eos> What?<eos> 'Secrets cost. 2K.<eos> Tomorrow.'<eos> ~ He was blackmailing her?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> I've never seen this phone before.<eos> We found it in your wife's gym locker.<eos> Why would she have kept it there?
You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you do say may be given in evidence.<eos> ~ Do you understand?<eos> ~ Come on, son.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I know a man who knows a man at the council.<eos> I'm sure I can convince them not to get too heavy-handed.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And the ticket?<eos> Make sure you pay it within 30 days.
Boz."<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> We were just goofing off.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Go home.<eos> This is where I live.<eos> Then go someplace I can't see you for a long time, okay?<eos> You know, we really work well together.<eos> Maybe we should start another project.<eos> Maybe I could even fund it.
- Uh, yeah, check again, dumb-ass.<eos> - I'm showing 80 live modems.<eos> - Wait a second, hold it.<eos> There's code in here that we didn't write.<eos> What?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Someone hacked into "Tank Battle."<eos> They added bytes that let multiple users play on a single phone line.<eos> This is awesome.<eos> Like a kid when he buys a movie ticket and then passes it back to his friends.
Something else is going on.<eos> He's using a code to go in through the service entrance.<eos> Might be messing with the electrical system, security cams.<eos> What's he doing now?<eos> He's making a call from a burner phone.<eos> Clyde Barton.<eos> Hi, is this the account holder at After Hours Management?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is Brian Humphries at Fisher Savings Loan.<eos> It appears the government's made an inquiry into your account and decided to freeze it.
I was a victim of cyber crime.<eos> Like you, I posted on social media, checked my bank account balance online, even kept the confidential files of my psychological practice on my computer.<eos> Then I was hacked, and as a result, one of my patients was murdered.<eos> My investigation into her death led me to the FBI, where I joined a team of cyber experts to wage a war against a new breed of criminal hiding on the Deep Web... infiltrating our daily lives in ways we never imagined faceless... nameless... lurking inside our devices,<eos> just a keystroke away.<eos> You've reached Raven.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> Raven, hey, it's me.<eos> It's Nelson.<eos> I'm sending you a file, but just don't open it.
Alone?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> All right.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> What is going on?<eos> I need your cell phone.<eos> Why?<eos> It's important.<eos> Is your personal laptop here?<eos> No, I left it at home.
- He has her?<eos> He has Nancy?<eos> Please, too little, too late.<eos> Max, we're in $10,000 worth of debt and you spent money on new kitty litter?<eos> Relax, I'm going to pee in it, too.<eos> Well, I guess it beats that Sprite bottle you've been using in your bedroom.<eos> It's just such a long walk to the bathroom that every time I have to go, it's like I'm raising money for MS.<eos> Oh, I have good news.<eos> I found your lost bra in the litter box.<eos> Don't think I'm not still wearing it.
Uh... because I heard the shot, and I saved you.<eos> At the risk of bruising your beastly ego-- maybe you didn't.<eos> I'm just saying, maybe someone's trying to scare us off this case.<eos> If you kill a cop you're only gonna attract more cops to investigate.<eos> Yeah, but none who can actually figure out what's really going on, which is what we have to do if we hope to get us back.<eos> And back home.<eos> What?<eos> You don't like my houseboat?<eos> Well... I do have a lot of good memories here, but it's not where we live.<eos> Besides, I thought you were gonna sell it.

I do have a lot of good memories here, but it's not where we live.<eos> Besides, I thought you were gonna sell it.<eos> I am, I just...<eos> I haven't got around to it yet.<eos> If you hadn't noticed, I've been a little busy.<eos> You're not secretly holding onto it as a safety net in case you and me don't work out, are you?
You got a *** honey?<eos> ***<eos> Huh. Try it with groceries.<eos> Ow, just leave the bag out.<eos> I'll wash it with the clothes in the morning.<eos> Actually, no need.<eos> I didn't make it to the court today.<eos> So...<eos> By the way, I'm looking at a house in Queens tomorrow.<eos> Your mother found it for us.
Tony!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop, Tony!<eos> Stop!<eos> Ah! No!<eos> - Put the gun down, Tony!<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> - Put it down, Tony.
Stop!<eos> Stop, Tony!<eos> Stop!<eos> Ah! No!<eos> - Put the gun down, Tony!<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> - Put it down, Tony.<eos> - Tony, drop it!
This was the '70s.<eos> A teacher said "retahded" in Boston in the '70s.<eos> "My daughter's retahded." She used to tell us every day. "I have a daughter and she's mentally retahded.<eos> "She's 35 and she lives in my house.<eos> "She better be fucking retahded. I'm gonna stick her back up in my vaginer."<eos> So I thought it was called a vaginer 'til I was, like, 25.<eos> And I remember thinking it was, like- It's a vaginer, it's a- Like, a thing that vagines, you know?<eos> Like, you use it to vagine- I gotta vagine my driveway.<eos> I just gotta vagine this new table I just made.<eos> That would make a nice table, like, you make a new table and then you take the- the 80-grit paper and you sand it, and then 120, and then you go, "All right, honey, get up there,"
You're my Angel Dust.<eos> Sorry, that's a drug.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Bye.<eos> Louise.<eos> When are you coming down?<eos> Mom has a stain on her apron.<eos> You're missing so much.<eos> How'd you get this number?<eos> Mom writes it on my leg every morning in case I get lost.
And I know what I have to do.<eos> I'll even go back to school if you want.<eos> School, even?<eos> If I agree to help you, to make you ready, you must do exactly as I say and when I say it with no exceptions, is that understood?<eos> Understood.<eos> But, in return, you must fix that computer.<eos> Fix it?<eos> How on earth am I gonna do that?<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> I'm not the one who broke it.
Be strong, Bridgit.<eos> Okay.<eos> - It's on.<eos> - Now... you're gonna want to cut yourself about a foot and a half of fuse.<eos> Okay.<eos> Push the wick into the plastic explosive.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now get out the flame.<eos> You got about a minute and a half to get out of there once that fuse is lit.<eos> Spark it up.
That's okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Edwige, I can see that you know this knife.<eos> You're scared of this knife.<eos> Why?<eos> - Why are you lying to me?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> Madam, if there's one thing I know, it's a liar.<eos> Now, tell me about this knife, or I will use it.
Uh, she knows that...<eos> You talked to your mom about me?<eos> - It came up.<eos> - Aw.<eos> Look, the p... the point... the point is that you can take that chemistry class again.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> It wouldn't matter.<eos> I'd still have a "D" on my record.<eos> So what?<eos> If I were a med school, and everybody who took that class got an "A," and then I saw one girl who retook that class and took it and took it until she kicked that class's ass,
I left the cage unlocked, and he's gone.<eos> - Somebody find him!<eos> - Stay off the ground!<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - I'm out of here.<eos> - He couldn't have gone far... unless he can fly.<eos> Can tarantulas fly?<eos> - Jake, you better find that spider.<eos> And I'm not coming back here until you do.<eos> - Uh, sarge, I think I found it.
- Damn, Rosa, okay.<eos> Look, I think they've been skimming people's desserts for weeks, but I can never prove it.<eos> Did you see them take your ice cream?<eos> - No, but Hitchcock has fudge stains all over his chest.<eos> - He's always got fudge stains all over his chest.<eos> - Ugh.<eos> - They'll deny everything.<eos> We need hard proof.<eos> - So let's get it.<eos> Step one: put a delicious pie in the fridge and cover it with poison.
You are trying to shame me, and that will not fly.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I need some more nibs just to calm down.<eos> - Jake, dope alley.<eos> - I know.<eos> I think this is where Batman's parents got killed.<eos> I'll take your word for it.<eos> The juvie angle didn't pan out.<eos> Neither did the B and Es, but I traced the label on the slayer's oolong.<eos> Turns out he got it at Chang's Medicinal Tea Shop.
Of course.<eos> Jeffords, we'll rendezvous later.<eos> Sir, I want to talk about Jake.<eos> - Okay...<eos> - Amy! Help!<eos> Our foot fungus heist has gone sideways!<eos> Hitchcock, not now.<eos> Scully doesn't know I'm in here.<eos> I stole his foot cream, but then I lost it.<eos> Amy, you're the only hope I have of finding it.
Charles!<eos> I'm starting to get worried, Jake.<eos> Relax.<eos> If anybody can handle it out here, it's Charles.<eos> He saw "Into the Woods" ten times in the theater.<eos> Watch it.<eos> That's poison ivy.<eos> Whoa. Good call.<eos> I'm allergic to poison ivy.<eos> I got it one time at sports camp, making out in the woods with Liz Almont.
What? No, it doesn't.<eos> I mean, sure, there are a couple of similarities, but... oh, man.<eos> It's the exact same one.<eos> Ugh! I have a dumpster mattress!<eos> All right. That settles it.<eos> We're going mattress shopping.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Oh, this is the best.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> You know, once we get it, we'll have to break it in.
But he's about to learn himself a lesson.<eos> Right about... Nah...<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Ow.<eos> Timed it perfectly.<eos> What?<eos> What did you do to my cupcake?<eos> This is yours?<eos> Why on Earth is your cupcake on my chair?<eos> Because it's very special to me, so I can put it wherever I want.
Ugh. Don't say that.<eos> Look.<eos> I was scared too.<eos> I'm gonna call my mom tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's buy this baby.<eos> Calling up the website, finding the mattress, adding to cart, signing in as "guest"...<eos> That is not an option.<eos> Creating an account...<eos> You don't have to buy it right this second.
- No, he didn't.<eos> But I figured out a way to buy him something and trick him into accepting it.<eos> - You are bad.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> Oh, wait. You're making fun of me.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Well, I don't care.<eos> He would never open a gift, right?<eos> But what if his gift didn't look like a gift?<eos> - He would open it?
You will be Guenter.<eos> With the little dots over the U.<eos> ♪♪ Jurgen.<eos> -Hey,Matt. Areyouin position?<eos> - I'm here.<eos> - Oh, great, the bad guy's name is Matt.<eos> Hey, sorry that took so long.<eos> Gina, you doing okay?<eos> You scared?<eos> - I'm scared you won't let me make a flamethrower and use it to throw flame.
Er... Florence, could you make a start on the financial checks, please?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Commissioner.<eos> I'm here to talk about Sergeant Bordey.<eos> Ah. So, you know?<eos> I've had a formal request to release her.<eos> But she hasn't decided if she's going yet.<eos> Nevertheless, she can't go unless we agree to the transfer, by, um... signing this release form.<eos> I see.<eos> And will you sign it?
Pacifica Elise Northwest, stop this instant!<eos> We can't let the town see us like this.<eos> We have a reputation to uphold.<eos> Now come into the panic room.<eos> There's enough mini sandwiches and oxygen to last you, me, and a butler for a week.<eos> We'll eat the butler.<eos> You dare disobey us?<eos> Dingly, dingly.<eos> Is this bell broken?<eos> Our family name is broken, and I'm gonna fix it.
Look, I need everything to be perfect.<eos> Status update, rosa.<eos> How are the flowers?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yellow.<eos> Terr-bear?<eos> I had my tuxedo altered To make it tighter like you wanted.<eos> Delicious.<eos> Jake, have you checked in with the jeweler?<eos> Will be ready at 2:00 on the wedding day. I'm gonna pick it up on my way to the ceremony.
The real issue is power.<eos> We don't get those stasis nets back up and running, this war's over before it begins.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Where we going?<eos> - To the gulanite mines.<eos> There's no point.<eos> Why not?<eos> The mines collapsed the night you disappeared.<eos> The ground hardened into I don't know what, but our drills can't cut through.<eos> The gulanite's down there, but we can't access it.
Uhh yeah, we have a damaged relationship.<eos> Do we?<eos> If it gets any worse we're gonna have to shut it down.<eos> A damaged relationship?<eos> Relay switch.<eos> I said relay switch.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I think you heard me wrong.<eos> There's a relay switch on the lower level...<eos> Look, the ship is in a state of disrepair and we can't afford to fix it.
You thought wrong.<eos> But if?<eos> No, it's complicated.<eos> Right.<eos> And also that.<eos> Don't stop on my account.<eos> Did you need anything?<eos> Five figured out the code to the mystery room.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> And we're about to open it but if you two have something better to do.
The Android's offline.<eos> Her neural chip's been removed.<eos> There's something in her hand.<eos> Volkov-Rusi.<eos> The soldiers who took the ship.<eos> We didn't get them all.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> No one messes with my robot.<eos> Whoever took her down removed her neural implant.<eos> We're gonna to need to recover it to bring her back online.
It is so sad about Boone, isn't it?<eos> Oh, are you okay?<eos> I mean, how are you feeling?<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> How do you...<eos> How do you think I'm feeling, Chanel?<eos> My best friend in the world, who used to compliment me all the time, was murdered, so, news flash.<eos> I'm super sad.<eos> I want to be the one who tells you how awesome you are all the time.<eos> Well, uh, you had your chance, Chanel, and you ruined it when you started freaking out when I said I want to have sex with your corpse.
But what do you mean, "you guys"?<eos> I'm by myself.<eos> But... where's Gracie?<eos> I thought she was upstairs with you.<eos> I don't know where she is, actually.<eos> The GPS said she was in this house!<eos> Wait. You tracking her phone?<eos> Yes.<eos> I gotta know where she is at all times.<eos> Okay, well, maybe she turned it off, because serial killer or not, that's a little creepy.
"all-around haggy nature of her person."?<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> There were still milkmen in 1995?<eos> Pete, this was one month after the bathtub incident!<eos> And suddenly, the Hag of Shady Lane is stealing milk and diapers?<eos> She was taking care of a baby.<eos> The baby, Pete.<eos> I mean, it's too big a coincidence.<eos> I think she had the Kappa baby.<eos> I don't know how she got it, whether she kidnapped it, or someone gave it to her... but if we're ever gonna find out what happened to that baby, we have to figure out who that woman was.
Isn't this a coincidence.<eos> I was headed over to Kappa House to steal some of your panties.<eos> Oh, Chad, that's amazing.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> But, Chad, listen.<eos> You have to help us.<eos> We're trapped in the house and the power went out and my phone is the only one that's working because I'm pretty sure the killer knocked down a cell tower or something.<eos> Wait, well, why does yours work, then?<eos> Because mine's a satellite phone.<eos> Elon Musk gave it to me.
I nominate Chad.<eos> Screw that, Evil Harrington.<eos> We're locking you upstairs in my closet until we can find a way out of here.<eos> This feels so good.<eos> Yeah, it does.<eos> No, not this.<eos> I mean, it feels so good now that my brother's gone.<eos> It's such a relief.<eos> The only time we've ever been apart was the two minutes that separated our birth.<eos> The only bummer is, like, we created this amazing clicking language, and now I have nobody to use it with.
The pink one.<eos> It looks newer.<eos> Old people toothbrushes are always super worn down and have that rubber tip thing at the end.<eos> Okay. so now we have to give this to the cops so we can compare the DNA and wait for the results.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> A perfect DNA match.<eos> That is what the lab said.<eos> The person that used this toothbrush is the same person that bit into that bologna sandwich.<eos> I should have figured it out myself.<eos> It always bugged me why someone would go through all that effort to make a sandwich and not finish it.
Yes, that's your mom, right there in the middle.<eos> What about all that horrible stuff Chanel told me about her?<eos> About how big of a bitch she was?<eos> About you literally having to sue to get me away from her?<eos> Well, all of that is mostly true.<eos> I was gonna tell you the truth eventually, but you just got so attached to the fake story.<eos> I figured, why upset the apple cart?<eos> So our house never burned down?<eos> No, that was true.<eos> I burned it down to cover up any evidence you might find.
Where do you think I am?<eos> I'm in the gym.<eos> Yeah, I'm wearing a disguise.<eos> What do you think, I'm an idiot?<eos> Look, I'm totally incognito, I'm blending right in.<eos> Look, Gigi's the problem, okay?<eos> She's the one that got us into this, and now she's blowing our brand.<eos> I mean, who shows up in a Justice Scalia costume?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She said she got it at the discount bin at the Halloween store.
I take packing very seriously.<eos> I was just in a zone... now I'm out of the zone.<eos> I just want to know why it isn't me you're taking home for Thanksgiving in the Hamptons.<eos> First things first.<eos> It's Hester, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hester.<eos> What is going on with the neckbrace?<eos> My spinal column was collapsing, so I decided to bedazzle my neckbrace and put it back on.

Well...<eos> I guess we'll just have to see how it goes bringing Chanel home for Thanksgiving.<eos> Yeah, I guess we will see, as that's what's going to happen.<eos> I guess we'll just have to wait and see.<eos> Yeah, we will wait and see, as Thanksgiving is an event that takes place in the future and therefore it hasn't happened yet.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yep, sure will.<eos> As the arrow of time flows in one direction, causing future events to flow inexorably towards us.<eos> Wh...<eos> Okay, just so we're clear, I only caught this kiss... so I could throw it away.
Fine.<eos> Let's hit the road, Number Six.<eos> We're going home.<eos> *** looks good.<eos> ***<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> Pete was just about to ruin any chances of marrying Grace by explaining why he thinks her dad is the killer.<eos> Grace, this is really hard for me, but I'm an investigative journalist.<eos> So, like everyone else, I started with a motive.<eos> Yours was easy, sir, 'cause you just keep on repeating it over and over again.
Yeah?<eos> Well I've got an erection.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Wait, my brother.<eos> Sh!<eos> It's too late for him now.<eos> He's just upstairs!<eos> Really?<eos> He's gonna kill the mood.<eos> TV: If anyone has a lead apron, now's the time to wear it.
No, I'm going back to my parents'.<eos> Fine.<eos> If I promise to make an effort, can I come?<eos> No.<eos> OK.<eos> But I've never broken up with anyone before, so... ..what do we do?<eos> Well, that's definitely my tarpaulin.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Remember, I shook the shitting dog off it?<eos> Then you gave it to me for my birthday.
It's quite hectic.<eos> - I've got quite a lot going on.<eos> - What, like drawing pictures of Steven Seagal?<eos> Someone has to remember, Suze.<eos> I carry the flame now.<eos> Tom, you promised these people you'd be their leader.<eos> And now, with all the hardship, the danger, the fear... you're gonna break that promise?<eos> - I was planning to, yeah.<eos> - You need to ask yourself one question.<eos> And I ask it every day and, truthfully, I think childbirth has made you more attractive.
It's gonna be hard to go home."<eos> RILEY:<eos> They all have the same stories.<eos> "My boyfriend doesn't know.<eos> Ha-ha."<eos> "My parents don't know.<eos> I hope they never find out."<eos> And then I just straight up tell them, like, "Your parents are gonna find out."<eos> It takes about a month.<eos> That's when stuff starts posting, and that's when people from their hometown start seeing it, because everyone watches porn.
-(SLURPING)<eos> Slurp it up.<eos> You missed a spot.<eos> MAN 3:<eos> Thought you, uh, Mexican chicks are good at this shit, cleaning up.<eos> (JADE MOANS)<eos> JADE:<eos> I don't judge anybody.<eos> If that's what floats their boat.<eos> They're watching it on the computer, and they're not going out and doing it to an actual girl.
You know what I mean?<eos> People are in those situations<eos> -outside of porn, all the time.<eos> -TRESSA:<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> Relationships.<eos> With me, it's all fake.<eos> That's where the line becomes fuzzy for some people.<eos> They don't see that.<eos> 'Cause they see our end product, that I guess is so realistic because people buy it.
Bloody hell, Dean.<eos> What if you get a hard-on?<eos> What happens?<eos> It can snap.<eos> Like celery.<eos> That's a nice knob, Dean.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> So how's it work?<eos> Well, only one man holds the key, and he lives in Bristol.<eos> Apparently he wears it on a chain round his neck, like the Dungeon Master.
Wants to breed them.<eos> Could be good, this time.<eos> Long way to go but, you know, I could sleep in the car.<eos> How's the job?<eos> - How's things, then?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - How's the flat, all right?<eos> - Fine!<eos> Pete, tell Leanne her tea's ready.<eos> And she's not having it upstairs.
I want some respect around this house!<eos> This house is a mess!<eos> You're a mess!<eos> Rossi: This man doesn't hate is mother.<eos> He hates the idea of that she represented.<eos> Hesitation marks on the earlier victims indicate that the unsub feels conflicted by his actions.<eos> It's possible he does not want to hurt the women he abducts, but somehow he feels he has to.<eos> Given his warped sense of justice, he may see himself as a protector of these women.<eos> He may even want them to fight back.<eos> He lost control at an early age, and he's desperate to regain it.
Yeah, the shorter hair makes sense now.<eos> (Sophie) Yeah.<eos> Good for you, Caroline.<eos> I hope you like long, boring stories.<eos> Okay, where's Allie?<eos> I know she's here.<eos> I put a spy app on her phone, and I'm not proud of it, but I'm a jealous woman.<eos> Oh, her phone.<eos> I have it.<eos> She left it at The High when I threw her ass out today per your instructions.
Mine's Morris.<eos> Morris and Norris.<eos> Well, at least that's fucking ridiculous.<eos> You just don't think stuff like this'll happen.<eos> What, that repeated sexual intercourse between two healthy adults will do the exact thing it's supposed to do?<eos> Have you ever done a science class?<eos> Do you know how to read?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not pregnant, and you are, and it's because of me but if you're going to have this baby, then...<eos> Who says I'm going to have it?
It's trite, but when Zoe turned 20, she started saying that I was a capitalist fascist and guys like me were the source of all the world's ills.<eos> And we didn't speak for months.<eos> Ten days ago, I get a call from her editor saying she's down in Mexico, wants to blow the lid off this big drug cartel.<eos> You want us to find her?<eos> In drug cartel territory?<eos> There are ongoing, very sensitive border sovereignty talks between the U.S. and Mexico.<eos> The last thing the State wants is us sending in a paramilitary group to rescue a citizen.<eos> Well, they must know who you are.<eos> They know who Zoe is.<eos> There must be a substantial ransom; pay it.

There's something.<eos> Could you hand me the tools?<eos> Here.<eos> It can't be.<eos> Were there mobile phones in the 16th century?<eos> Chapter 6 Time of Rogues.<eos> They found this phone in a 16th century dig site?<eos> The archaeologists must have flipped out.<eos> One is under psychiatric care, that's all I'll say.<eos> And it couldn't be a hoax, that someone put it there later?
Hello, Angustias.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> I didn't know that paracetamol had such a rapid effect.<eos> Well... give that to Salvador when he returns.<eos> Inside is the certified copy of the patent for the prototype of the mop invented by Manuel Jalón in 1964.<eos> Now the Americans won't steal the invention from us.<eos> Why are you looking at me like that, Angustias?<eos> It's like you've seen a ghost.<eos> I've just received a fax.<eos> I sent it to myself in 2005.
And if they can't pay it...<eos> - Well, then what can I do?<eos> - Think.<eos> If there's evidence anywhere, we need to find it.<eos> I've been searching through letters and diaries... I've found nothing.<eos> Well, is there anything else written down?<eos> Anywhere?<eos> Think hard.<eos> I have wondered about the counting house.<eos> He left it to me as a source of income.
Sorry, I don't know what you mean.<eos> Well, I mean, come on. Your behaviour is verging on that of a stalker.<eos> That...<eos> That is not true.<eos> I... I just wanted to try something new...<eos> I just... with my life.<eos> You know, try something different.<eos> You did it to get close to Stevie, didn't you?<eos> What?<eos> That necklace, I've seen it before.
I just... with my life.<eos> You know, try something different.<eos> You did it to get close to Stevie, didn't you?<eos> What?<eos> That necklace, I've seen it before.<eos> 'Grand Central Beer?<eos> I'm no sell-out, especially not that stuff.<eos> 'It's crap! '<eos> It belonged to Stevie, didn't it?<eos> He gave it to me.
I told you, the beer company are delighted with that little clip.<eos> But there was a bigger problem than the bad press that clip might have brought you, wasn't there?<eos> Stevie, the new Stevie... .. didn't want to sell out.<eos> He was still a man of the people... .. and because of that, he refused to sign that contract.<eos> But I told you, he did.<eos> He did sign the contract.<eos> And you saw Stevie sign it?<eos> No.<eos> - Pete did.<eos> - The date on the contract indicates that Stevie signed it yesterday morning.
I never liked Andrew Devlin, and the feeling was mutual.<eos> Arrogant bastard thought I was just another Las Vegas loser.<eos> He was married to your sister.<eos> That had to make Thanksgiving dinner kind of awkward.<eos> And then some.<eos> So I kept my mouth shut until my sister got the dollar signs out of her eyes and realized what an ass he was.<eos> Can't say I disagree.<eos> What gave her the wakeup call?<eos> He always had a temper, but on a leash.<eos> Then he started losing it.
That's roughly... 20,000?<eos> Unsavory characters, like our dead thief, rent out their botnets to send spam e-mails, perform DDoS attacks, mass identity theft.<eos> You know, all that good illegal stuff.<eos> Can you tell if our thief connected to the botnet before the bounty hunters broke down that motel room door?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> What is it, Krumitz?<eos> He sent two separate messages to two separate computers somewhere in the botnet.<eos> It must've been the passkeys.<eos> Like a bank robber hiding his stash until the heat dies down and he can recover it and get away.
It's complicated.<eos> Well, Sifter and I spoke to the judge.<eos> She agreed to lift your probation.<eos> Wow, that's-that's crazy.<eos> I didn't, I didn't even know he liked me.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.<eos> We all set?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We embedded a decoy passkey on the computer in the home, one infected with our own malicious code.<eos> So when the bounty hunters try to use that passkey, it'll infect their computer and we'll have complete control over it.
The unpaid intern, the... powerful man.<eos> But you suspected him of something?<eos> You must have... you stole that clay pot, with the ashes.<eos> There was talk.<eos> Strange talk about DNA samples being sent to a lab in New Mexico.<eos> And it was like I was being asked to cover up something I didn't know anything about.<eos> It was a cow.<eos> The red heifer.<eos> Those ashes would be really important to some people out there, crazy people who've been talking about reclaiming the Temple.<eos> I mean, if they had the original ashes, they could mix it with new ashes from a pure red heifer, and...
How would you know when to jump?<eos> Because you'd give me a lecture on it.<eos> Burn!<eos> Ray! She burned her.<eos> I know, but-- no.<eos> Shut up, because here's the thing--<eos> Safety brakes.<eos> That's actually what elisha otis invented.<eos> Not the elevator itself,<eos> But the safety brakes to stop it.
Man, you are nothing like your file.<eos> All these stories about what a badass you are,<eos> But I gotta tell ya, farooq's not seeing it.<eos> Well, in those stories, I'm probably not<eos> Changing poopy diapers, so--<eos> So do you seriously not even care<eos> What I'm doing with your mainframe?<eos> I honestly don't.<eos> Okay, I'm going to tell you anyway.<eos> I'm using it to backdoor my state-of-the-art
I don't know.<eos> But his wife wasn't the only one who called.<eos> Some of the other people sounded a little... I don't know, shady?<eos> Most of them wouldn't even leave their names.<eos> When he offered me money to answer the phones, I assumed I'd get a check every week.<eos> Instead, he sent cash.<eos> It was like he didn't want there to be a paper trail.<eos> Did you get paid recently?<eos> Yeah, I got an envelope a couple days ago.<eos> I was gonna bring it to the bank at lunch.
That's right.<eos> Steven let everybody go last week.<eos> I left for Springfield, Ohio, the next day.<eos> Got back last night.<eos> What were you doing there?<eos> Nephew's birthday party.<eos> I'll show you the travel receipts if you want.<eos> He might not have killed Steven Horowitz, but he's lying about one thing.<eos> He has the complete list of debts.<eos> He stole it.
We'll go ahead and call your attorney right after we get done reading you your rights.<eos> What is that?<eos> That, madam, is your property.<eos> You're Steven Horowitz's next of kin, so... you rightfully inherit ownership of the debt he was collecting in order to maintain the family lifestyle.<eos> Steven could have told me he was fired.<eos> My God.<eos> What happened to us?<eos> I couldn't say.<eos> I can tell you that that package, worked properly, will make you very, very wealthy.<eos> Steven decided he had other ideas for it.
Perfume, lipstick?<eos> I'm getting lavender with,<eos> I want to say rose hips.<eos> It's your face cream!<eos> I did buy some more this morning, but--<eos> The same kind that Stella was eating before Joe's rash cleared up?<eos> And now you're wearing it again, and his rash is back?<eos> No, it can't be my face cream!<eos> Ay, please don't make me say goodbye to my face cream!<eos> Stella was eating it to save Joe!
Yes, I can see that, honey.<eos> You left it in the sink!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I waited in line for two hours, but I got it.<eos> Ooh, we making a home movie?<eos> - _ - Hello?<eos> Hey, dad. Dad, take the phone away from your ear.<eos> Why would I do this?<eos> Now I can't hear you.<eos> Put it in front of your face.
Uh, Lily, she made me her famous chocolate-chip scrambled eggs...<eos> - Ooh.<eos> - ...which she then watched me eat.<eos> - Ooh.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You got my present, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> Darn it.<eos> They promised it would be there on time. _<eos> Oh, well, I can't wait to open it and check the date on the invoice.
How come, on your badge, you got a mustache, but now you're not wearing one, huh?<eos> Oh, I was Freddie Mercury in a Queen cover band, but, uh, then I got demoted to Brian May.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm thrilled for your musical career and everything, but, uh, we got no way of knowing that this is you.<eos> I mean, we gotta be careful here.<eos> This is one of them, uh, highly sensitive joints.<eos> It'll take me weeks to grow that mustache back. Or years, to get a new badge!<eos> Yeah, well, that's your problem, ain't it?<eos> You will see us again, in God knows when.<eos> Young man, how do you fit such brilliance into such an ugly, ethnic head?<eos> Well, if you own a bar, you either keep it clean or learn to deal with inspectors.
These are ruthless people we work for.<eos> Do you think he'd give you away?<eos> No.<eos> He wouldn't do that.<eos> We've soiled another serving girl.<eos> Why so serious?<eos> It's just a bit of fun.<eos> Let's get out of this mausoleum and find some proper women.<eos> You're far too choosy.<eos> My friend doesn't know ripe fruit when he sees it.
He is here...<eos> In us, with us.<eos> So why?<eos> So, the temple is...?<eos> Part of the old law, which is now been completed.<eos> We are still Jews, Saul.<eos> The temple is an important part of our lives.<eos> We have message to preach, James.<eos> But it has nothing to do with that pile of stones.<eos> You would just abandon it?
Who shall speak of his descendents?<eos> "For his life was taken from the earth."<eos> You look to have fallen on hard times, friend.<eos> Indeed.<eos> And I have fallen hard.<eos> If you need help, I've repaired a few wheels in my time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Please.<eos> The passage you were reading just now from Isaiah does it bring you comfort?<eos> I had hoped it would, but I am struggling to understand it.
How could she die like this?<eos> If you can think of anything else, please give us a call.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, if his car broke down, he'd need a new one.<eos> Must have been in a hurry, otherwise why didn't he get a tow truck?<eos> Maybe the car was stolen.<eos> Either way, his car broke down.<eos> He had to walk.<eos> Then his car must still be out there.<eos> Unless he was just using it as an excuse to get into the house.
- Power.<eos> Y-you're focusing on the power.<eos> Power.<eos> I should...<eos> I'm gonna pass these out...<eos> - Power.<eos> - Over here.<eos> No. I'm running for president, Louise.<eos> Ooh, I love your poster font, Millie.<eos> They use it for horror movies.
Do I tell you or that car payment you're holding?<eos> You can tell us both. (Sighs)<eos> It's a McLecklin, my hammer.<eos> You know that brand, Bob?<eos> McLecklin?<eos> I don't know hammer brands, Teddy.<eos> They're the best... they're like the Meryl Streep of hammers.<eos> Ah, look at that slice.<eos> Uh, I'm not crying because of the onions, I'm crying because it's beautiful.<eos> And it's so thin, I could actually use it as a tissue.
I'm gonna say we're still even.<eos> And there's only one thing left.<eos> Knife against hammer!<eos> Hammer against knife!<eos> Metal against metal!<eos> No way.<eos> We're-we're done.<eos> A tie is good.<eos> Yeah, Bob loves his knife.<eos> I'd hate to destroy it.
Listen.<eos> We go in, we grab my mom, she flips Stefan's switch, he triggers Caroline, emotional dominoes, heyyyy!<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> If I give you my blood, will you just get out of my face?<eos> Probably, although...<eos> I think you're gonna want to join us.<eos> Stick with me, Bonnie Bennett.<eos> I might just have the answer to all your prayers.<eos> You want the 1903 ascendant.<eos> Just let me reach in my pocket and pull it out.
Are you not attracted to me?<eos> Do you not think I'm beautiful?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Oh... child.<eos> You're as beautiful as an English rose at sunrise.<eos> I just want our first time to be perfect, that's all.<eos> With a waxing orange crescent harvest moon.<eos> Can you picture it?<eos> It's hangin' so low, it's almost like a dew drop.<eos> I think I can lasso it.
Whatever it is, she's still searching for it.<eos> I was pretty surprised.<eos> I didn't think you'd give up your seat as a news anchor.<eos> No, can't be. This must be for the upcoming Olympics news report?<eos> Yes.<eos> By any chance...<eos> have you seen my old cellphone?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I thought maybe you accidentally took it when you helped me pick up my things.<eos> Ah... yes, I guess I must've taken it.
Yes.<eos> By any chance...<eos> have you seen my old cellphone?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I thought maybe you accidentally took it when you helped me pick up my things.<eos> Ah... yes, I guess I must've taken it.<eos> - Why would you have taken it?<eos> - Because I was curious. I was curious to see what I sent in those text messages.<eos> Why would you be curious about that?<eos> When will you give it back to me?
Well, you know I'm on you 'cause I care.<eos> Try caring a little less.<eos> Come on, follow.<eos> I got somebody else I want you to meet.<eos> Hey, I got to get back to work.<eos> Hey, two minutes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mind if I come on in?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure, okay.<eos> Great, I'll include it in the report, and I'll get it out tonight.
How did you know that?<eos> Yeah, I got nothing to hide.<eos> It's a good job.<eos> I get paid super, workers' comp, holiday pay even.<eos> And Indy?<eos> She's doing a business course online.<eos> Wants to change her life.<eos> Good luck to her I say.<eos> Online? So she's got a computer?<eos> Yeah, the other cop took it already.
It's 150, a sit-down, or there's no deal.<eos> There's no fucking sit-down.<eos> You call us all the way down here when you knew the fucking deal wasn't square?<eos> There is no fucking sit-down.<eos> Here's her goddamn check. She cashes it when I get my pictures.<eos> Good luck fucking your intern.<eos> You need all the luck you can get.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Got an autograph after all.<eos> Sell it.
Mm-mm, you first.<eos> Where do you go?<eos> - NYU.<eos> - Columbia.<eos> I win.<eos> - Good morning, Jessica.<eos> - Hi, Daniel.<eos> - I still haven't received--<eos> - This year's budget?<eos> I was just on my way to give it to you.
How am I meant to sleep?<eos> How can anyone sleep at a time like this?<eos> I slept.<eos> Like a log.<eos> How?<eos> There is a massive rock headed this way!<eos> I know, which is why I'm writing my bucket list!<eos> How do you spell Minaj?<eos> What have you done with my passport?<eos> Look, I confiscated it.
I did.<eos> Twice already, remember?<eos> I would like to start to work now.<eos> All right.<eos> Since we're going to be working together, I think you should know I am not a morning person.<eos> Father Jude? The cardinals would like to see you immediately.<eos> Just when you think the apocalypse is as bad as it gets, that sticks its head in the door.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Your desk is buried under there somewhere.<eos> You might want to dig it out.
~ You've got a Panamera now.<eos> ~ I do, yeah.<eos> What in the name of all that's holy possessed you to buy a Panamera, which is not a good-looking car?<eos> It was...<eos> I think it's one of the most beautiful interiors.<eos> ~ I like those buttons, that's brilliant.<eos> ~ I think it's phenomenal.<eos> But I was actually going to shoot 24 in Cape Town in South Africa.<eos> And the flight I had was from Los Angeles to Frankfurt and then Frankfurt to South Africa.<eos> And Porsche, before Panamera had come out, they would take you off the plane, take your luggage off the plane, put it in a Panamera - the Panamera was being driven by a race-car driver - and they would take you to the next terminal, which was about five miles away.
~ I thought that was fun.<eos> ~ That was a lot of fun.<eos> ~ It was.<eos> ~ And these cars... ~ better than horses.<eos> ~ And nobody fell off.<eos> ~ Much better.<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> But can we just stop for a moment?<eos> The amazing thing - the cars survived it.<eos> And if Nissan... well, actually, or Bentley or BMW, if they made a laptop, I'd buy it.

I got $20 say you feel right at home.<eos> Hey.<eos> Someone's in here.<eos> NCIS!<eos> Federal agents!<eos> Who the hell are you? !<eos> NCIS!<eos> Prove it!<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I'm gonna reach down and get my badge... and flip it open.
We got enough going on today.<eos> I'm really glad that you feel that way.<eos> Um, I really need your help, actually.<eos> I have heroin in my pocket.<eos> You have what?<eos> It fell out of the lining of Harrison's jacket.<eos> And he swears that it was just an old stash that he had forgotten about.<eos> And we were arguing about it when the Secret Service came in.<eos> I panicked. I didn't know what to do.<eos> I slipped it in my pocket.

Are you in the Mafia?<eos> Witness Protection Programme?<eos> I know - you were a princess, and you went there desperately trying to experience the life of a common person.<eos> That is the plot of Roman Holiday.<eos> So it is Witness Protection?<eos> I will book our transport for the morning.<eos> Celine, secrecy becomes you.<eos> Whooo!<eos> Oh, man!<eos> I'm going to get me a big juicy steak and cook it!
- Thanks.<eos> The leavers' ball wasn't exactly top of my to-do list, especially without Finn...<eos> Any good?<eos> ... but I had to show Mum I was on the mend.<eos> Bought it when I was 30.<eos> When I was, and don't bite my head off,<eos> I was a couple of sizes bigger.<eos> I never... quite had the confidence to wear it out.<eos> Oh, Rae.<eos> I'll wear it.
But fine.<eos> Good morning, guys.<eos> Good morning!<eos> T-minus one day till pancakes and Laffy String wars.<eos> - Look what I just dug out of a box in the garage.<eos> - Yes!<eos> What?<eos> I love this apron.<eos> You better.<eos> You'll be wearing it tomorrow morning.
Bring her back.<eos> Hi.<eos> You heard something about Mom, didn't you?<eos> She's 16 now, Dad.<eos> You should tell her that Mom is in Iran where the coup is happening.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> Neither is Ali.<eos> But she couldn't have known there'd be a coup.<eos> She was hoping to prevent it.
- Or while he was not here.<eos> - You seem to be managing well.<eos> - Do you live in the castle?<eos> - You mean will I move out when Bertie marries?<eos> - That's not what I --<eos> - I have rooms that were made into a flat for an aunt, so I'm very comfortable.<eos> But don't worry, I'll be well out of the way.<eos> - Oh, I'm not at all worried.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> I told you, Mother, you're less trouble in the house than out of it.
What I need to reassure you about is that nothing really is going to change on a day-to-day basis.<eos> As you all know, that doesn't happen in a hospital where we are!<eos> What is it?<eos> It reminds me of when she ran the house as a convalescent home during the war.<eos> Do you still think they're taking advantage of her?<eos> If you want to keep her, Robert, you must let her go.<eos> I'm not very good at those American slogans.<eos> Then forget the slogan and listen to this.<eos> You have a wonderful marriage and with my parents, I should know.<eos> Don't spoil it now by asking her to choose.
- Stuff and nonsense!<eos> - This is because Andy's not interested.<eos> - What? - Andy's given her the brush-off.<eos> - That is not true.<eos> - Why is your cap on like that?<eos> - Like what?<eos> All pulled down over your ears.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Well, take it off.
Only thing missing is a piece of chocolate and a ghost story.<eos> My partner and I just busted a crack house, and it's not as scary as this.<eos> Look, you got nothing to worry about.<eos> Unless they find something.<eos> They caught mine pretty early.<eos> Now I'm five years clean.<eos> Ah, that's great.<eos> WOMAN 1: But you got to be diligent.<eos> You know, early detection is the key... that's why I come every year.<eos> Thing about cancer, can't just ignore it and wish for it to go away.
A prototype.<eos> So stay out of my way in there, and let me just show her the prototype, because that's all we need.<eos> We don't need a prototype.<eos> - Did you forget the prototype?<eos> - No.<eos> Did you forget the prototype?<eos> No.<eos> Did you forget the prototype?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where'd you leave it, Nick?
This little girl is a survivor.<eos> Yeah, she spent her first few weeks fighting for life.<eos> She's made it through the worst of it, but still she is gonna need some extra care.<eos> Can you tell if she's getting that care?<eos> At home?<eos> Well, I'm not seeing any signs of physical abuse or malnourishment.<eos> But beyond that?<eos> Your theory is wrong.<eos> Computer servers nowadays, they're all backed up on a cloud.<eos> There's no real point in torching it.
Turning you back to your old self is the primary objective, but it is vital that we're able to do the same with all the other zombies we believe are out there.<eos> I suppose.<eos> Rub it in, you smug little...<eos> Move, rat!<eos> I'm such a moron.<eos> I know who's killing these kids.<eos> Max Rager?<eos> How do you figure?<eos> In my vision, Teresa was retrieving Sebastian's wallet.<eos> The last time I saw it,
Aw, c'mon.<eos> Eating brains doesn't make you a monster.<eos> It takes a little more effort.<eos> Tommy?<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> One of your runaway kids, destined to run no more.<eos> It's Cameron's.<eos> So, I guess we get a giant can opener and start checking trunks.<eos> Or maybe not.<eos> If you're gonna kill Cameron and leave him in the trunk of a car to be demolished, and see he has a phone, you don't leave it here and on.
Credit goes to the dog, who probably smelled the blood.<eos> It looks like an animal attack, which it probably wasn't.<eos> Ah, a few dollars in his wallet, belonging to...<eos> Gary Goff.<eos> Expired Illinois license.<eos> Here's some kind of print.<eos> You recognize it?<eos> Not really.<eos> But that has got to be Wesen.<eos> - Should we track it?
Okay.<eos> When do we get her?<eos> We'll dig her out tomorrow.<eos> What's all that?<eos> Stuff from the trailer.<eos> The stuff that wasn't destroyed.<eos> Yeah, we're lucky there's anything left.<eos> What happened to the trailer?<eos> Juliette.<eos> She torched it.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think it's boiled down by now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whoa.<eos> I think it's done.<eos> Did you see the skull?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then all we have to do is strain it.
Previously on Grimm.<eos> Prostitutes, left-handed killer, organs being surgically removed.<eos> This is starting to sound a little familiar.<eos> You thinking Jack the Ripper?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What happened to the trailer?<eos> Juliette, she torched it.
I-I couldn't be happier.<eos> Two of my best, most dedicated colleagues won the lottery, and it's all because of some bloated bureaucratic rule book?<eos> Th-This is j... this is...<eos> It's wonderful!<eos> Gee.<eos> I wish we could go out and celebrate, you guys paying, of course, but we-we've got a case.<eos> Right.<eos> And I got the results from the test on his hair follicles.<eos> It turns out Chili did have a crank habit, but there's no evidence he used the day he was murdered.<eos> Well, if Chili wanted crank and Morton didn't get it for him, then maybe he just went and got it for himself.
How does it look?<eos> Like I made the right choice.<eos> It is quite exquisite.<eos> I was... talking about you.<eos> I made the right choice.<eos> I'm just so lucky to have you as my wife.<eos> I have something for you, too.<eos> For me?<eos> Well, what are you doing with my gambling sobriety chip?<eos> I found it in the laundry.

I do.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dr. Brennan asked me to take another look at the X-rays of the skull.<eos> I think I might have found something.<eos> Now, it's pretty small, but there appears to be evidence of hemorrhagic staining on the tympanomastoid.<eos> Maybe you could swab it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's the ear canal, right?<eos> Well, technically, it's the bone surrounding it.
Not that I can tell.<eos> Nieman's creating his victims.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> For Jerry Tyson.<eos> They're like clones.<eos> They're blond and pretty, just the way Tyson likes them.<eos> Nieman finds these poor women, lost souls that no one is gonna miss, and she remakes them.<eos> She grooms them for 3XK.<eos> Yo. We got the truck.<eos> Tory picked it up on another street cam.
One fish is enough.<eos> Where's your team with those updates?<eos> 26 separate pieces of grenade fragments, and there's not a single fingerprint on any of them.<eos> Not even a partial.<eos> So what's the urgency, Miss Sciuto?<eos> The urgency is that this type of grenade doesn't go off by itself.<eos> I mean, you have to turn the handle and throw it, and then boom.<eos> But the way this one exploded required some type of detonator.<eos> Which we never found.<eos> But you did find it.
No, it wasn't that.<eos> We were arguing one night about something stupid.<eos> I don't even remember what.<eos> And in a fit of anger, I told her that our being together, our rekindled romance, was a big mistake.<eos> And I stormed out.<eos> Next day, she called.<eos> I was in a classified briefing, so she left a voice mail.<eos> That's why I hope I haven't lost my phone.<eos> It's the only way I can still hear her voice.<eos> I was gonna give it back to you, eventually, anyway.
If you ever need to talk about anything with anybody, you got somebody right here next to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I heard what sister Mathias was saying about, you know, hiding pain by taking on a mission, and I-I know that's what you're doing a little bit.<eos> And it's okay.<eos> I mean, it's fine. I get it.<eos> I've done it before, too.<eos> But...<eos> I don't buy for one second that the Mark is a terminal diagnosis, so don't go making peace with that idea.<eos> There has to be a way.<eos> There will be a way, and we will find it.
Oh, thanks, Pablo.<eos> Oh, great news, I got some turkey burgers, you know we can grill, and watch a little Monday Night Raw tonight if you want?<eos> Oh, tonight's bad.<eos> I mean actually, I just came in to get my check<eos> 'Cause, uh, I may have to skip town.<eos> What?<eos> No, you can't leave, you're like the coolest thing about this place.<eos> That's very true, but, uh, I may have a, uh... situation.<eos> Hey, man, tell me what's up, maybe I can help you.<eos> I wish I could, but with all due respect, your tiny brain is a lot safer without my problems inside it.
Then I ran into one of my brother's work buddies, and, um... he introduced me to tai chi.<eos> And it saved me.<eos> How so?<eos> I like to put it like this.<eos> I went to church a lot as a kid.<eos> And we were always taught to love our enemies.<eos> Tai chi taught me something new...<eos> To love the enemy inside me, as well.<eos> So I don't look at peace as the absence of conflict anymore.<eos> I see it as the acceptance of conflict.
- Hot cops! Whoo, whoo! - Come on!<eos> Move it!<eos> Move it! Move it!<eos> Anyway, Walt, I got everything under control.<eos> There ain't nobody hurt and definitely nobody shot.<eos> What... What the heck happened?<eos> Seems these dewy young ladies driving down here from Minneapolis on a last, final prenuptial hoo-hah or something.<eos> Yon casino bus tries to pass them on this double yellow.<eos> Another car's coming in the other lane.<eos> Bus tries to come back into the his own lane, hits the RV party thing, and runs it right off the road.
I guess your affair was the surprise of the wedding.<eos> - [sobs] - What?<eos> Did you arrange for Delia to come down here and see you because you knew your fiancée was on the road?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Maybe Delia threatened to tell Nikki, and that's why you killed her.<eos> [scoffs] No, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Well, you knew enough to dump the body where you wouldn't be suspected.<eos> And you had access to the girls' itinerary, right?<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> I gave it to him.
You already admitted that you knew about Delia and Noah, so you had motive.<eos> They betrayed your best friend here, and if you didn't order a gift basket for Delia because you knew that she wasn't coming on your trip, well, that gives you intent and premeditation.<eos> The only thing... The only thing that was premeditated was talking to Delia.<eos> We just wanted to get her to admit anything, so when Nikki and I showed up in the RV and she just got on like nothing was wrong, like she could be screwing Noah and she could still be our friend...<eos> We didn't mean for any of this to happen. I promise.<eos> She tried to leave, so I grabbed her, and she started pushing me.<eos> Nikki pushed her off, and I-I-I have no idea how it happened, but she hit her head and she landed on the floor and she wasn't moving and she was bleeding so much.<eos> So, we drove and we got a bag.<eos> And she would even admit anything!<eos> And after you got hit by the casino bus, the two of you, you took advantage of all that chaos, took somebody else's luggage tag, put it on your new bag, and dumped the body.
Two.<eos> - Can you describe them?<eos> - Nope.<eos> You didn't see them, or you don't want to describe them?<eos> Look, it happened.<eos> It's done.<eos> Way I see it, I was being punished for trying to take a shortcut.<eos> What kind of shortcut?<eos> Took out a loan at the casino.<eos> Instead of working to try to pay it back, I played craps.
Hey, Sheriff. I didn't hear you drive up.<eos> I parked up the road a bit.<eos> I didn't want to disturb you.<eos> I didn't want you to run off.<eos> No danger of that.<eos> Right.<eos> I guess I meant to say I didn't want you to drive off.<eos> Oh.<eos> Anyway, I got to thinking that this cross was a little too close to the road.<eos> I was afraid somebody might knock it down.
You know what, Cyrano Caballero?<eos> You're right.<eos> I need your services.<eos> Sign me up.<eos> I have standards.<eos> And I have a cousin who works for ICE.<eos> - That's Immigration, Customs, and...<eos> - I know what ICE is.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, then you would be motivated to start me a dating profile and send it to Mr. Loftus.
It's me.<eos> I need you to call the Cumberland County morgue, find out if they've done the autopsy on Will Balint yet.<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh, looking for anything in particular?<eos> Yep.<eos> Missing teeth.<eos> So, you were thinking that Sam Poteet was the new Hector.<eos> Mind if I ask who was the old Hector?<eos> Well, Hector was a former boxer who lived on the Res.<eos> Whenever the Cheyenne needed justice, didn't feel they could get it through legal means, they'd hire Hector to knock some teeth out.
If he inhaled mud, that means he was conscious.<eos> So, he had his face in the mud.<eos> Someone was pushing him, and he was trying to fight back.<eos> So much for a drilling accident.<eos> I also found out who got promoted after Will died.<eos> - Trot Simic.<eos> - Yep.<eos> That sounds like a run of stupid good luck.<eos> He also get a bonus?<eos> Well, if he did, he's out spending it right now.
Gimme that remote.<eos> I gotta turn this up.<eos> (Laughing)<eos> (In Russian accent) We are bad girls!<eos> (Sniffs)<eos> What's that smell?<eos> Is it garbage day?<eos> No, I made breakfast.<eos> Oh!<eos> Did you make it with garbage?
What are the contenders?<eos> Turkey Reuben, Turkey Reuben.<eos> - And Turkey Reuben.<eos> The Tryptophan would make me sleepy.<eos> I say... the Elvis.<eos> Bananas, peanut butter, bacon, fried.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, that sounds great, but of course, the perfect sandwich is actually the one we happen to have ingredients for.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Because I have to be able to make it right now.
I know.<eos> I was just saying, you don't seem like you.<eos> I am! I am! This is me!<eos> - Trying to give you space...<eos> - I don't need space!<eos> I am telling you, I don't... of course I want to have sex with my wife...<eos> I am your wife!<eos> I'm right here!<eos> I am your wife.<eos> He probably just lost his phone and some random lady found it.
Yeah, sure.<eos> I can see how he might get confused as to where his real home is.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> I hate you, you miserable cow.<eos> Still not funny.<eos> I really think we should take you to the doctor.<eos> I'm fine. Mom, seriously, you need to...<eos> I said I'm fine.<eos> I just need some coffee.<eos> - Would you like me to get it for you?
So why don't you go up to the house, give your sister a big old hug, and you two can pick out what kind of pizza to get for dinner, okay?<eos> Good girl.<eos> Come here.<eos> I don't want to be the woman that leaves her husband when he's sick, but that doesn't mean I won't.<eos> I thought a lot about what you said and I think you're right.<eos> This marriage isn't working, so we need to do what's best for the kids and what's best for us.<eos> So here are my terms.<eos> You're gonna write a check.<eos> It's gonna be for almost as much money as we have, and we're gonna use it to buy a 3033 mainframe.<eos> Not only that, you are gonna help me fix it up and get it running again.
We just got to cross our fingers. Hope Saviour works.<eos> No.<eos> Why should we?<eos> The Cold War... there were contingencies.<eos> Nukes went off, we were toast, but the guys with their fingers on the button... they all had bunkers.<eos> Well, there must be a Plan B.<eos> And we're gonna find it.<eos> Cos we're DS-fucking-X and that's what we do.<eos> We steal secrets.<eos> If there's a way of surviving this, we're gonna get in on it, right?
Oh, this is vague stuff.<eos> Vague stuff!<eos> I did not think this through.<eos> Moe, before I left, I just wanted to give you these examples of our most beloved, albeit depressing, literature.<eos> Ah, some nice bedtime reading'.<eos> Fun premise.<eos> I'm laughing already.<eos> Really not cheering' me up here, but, uh, let me offer you the only literature in this bar-- sure works for me, though.<eos> This coaster.<eos> I will treasure it.
He's gone.<eos> Did he say "heist"?<eos> On Mardi Gras?<eos> Official start of the big day.<eos> Clock is ticking.<eos> The cause of death for Cyd Lawson was a stroke.<eos> Likely caused by a crystal meth-induced heart arrhythmia.<eos> From an O.D.?<eos> Based on track marks, Mr. Lawson injected a significant amount of the drug into his system.<eos> Most users prefer to smoke it, because injection raises the possibility of an overdose exponentially.
We have nearly done this, I've nearly cracked it.<eos> 200 feet of near vertical rock.<eos> Just a few inches, another few turns on the winch.<eos> What a fantastic way... to pay tribute... to the car...<eos> What?<eos> It was at this point the producers broke the bad news.<eos> Because of where the winch cable was attached, the Land Rover wouldn't be able to climb over onto the flat dam top.<eos> And this meant only one thing.<eos> I'm going to have to go back down.<eos> I'm going to have to winch it down the dam.
Give me your wallet.<eos> Come on, give me your wallet!<eos> Man, you do not know who you're messing with.<eos> - Just hand it over!<eos> - All right.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Just settle down.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Just wait.<eos> Here, just take it.
Doesn't make me a special case, though. Most guys I know, shoot, they come from single-parent homes.<eos> But I used to watch him every Sunday on TV and emulate his style. I wanted to be like my father.<eos> Until I got old enough to understand what he had done, and then I got angry.<eos> Have you ever tried to reach out to him? Reach out?<eos> Did many a times.<eos> He never once accepted a call, a letter, an email. Nothing.<eos> He chose not to know me. He chose not to know me when I won a state title. He chose not to know me when I won a national title.<eos> He wanted nothing to do with me after all of that. He wanted nothing to do with me.<eos> So this number...<eos> You see it?
Yes, she always slept in them.<eos> And an eye mask.<eos> She couldn't turn off, otherwise.<eos> Her mind was very active.<eos> What do you think, then?<eos> Bodged mugging?<eos> Yes, well, I very much doubt that.<eos> There were no signs of a struggle.<eos> Nothing valuable was taken.<eos> The only thing missing is the phone, which suggests that whoever has taken it did so for a very specific reason.
! You were young, y-y-you had no choice.<eos> This is not... the right... time.<eos> Then it clicked.<eos> It was never going to be the right time.<eos> She just...<eos> She just couldn't bear the thought of other people knowing.<eos> I trusted her.<eos> She just didn't want me.<eos> I knew Bill had a gun.<eos> When he brought us over here from the airport in his Jeep, I saw it.
Told you!<eos> Tragic, really.<eos> All his life he looked for one person's approval.<eos> Then he ended up killing...<eos> No, it doesn't fit.<eos> What?<eos> ! Oh, come on, Chief!<eos> Surely we're allowed to solve a case quickly at least once in a blue moon?<eos> ! So who took her phone?<eos> Uh... Maybe she just lost it earlier in the day and didn't mention.
And all that time she was just drinking?<eos> Well, yes, that and crying into her phone. Phone?<eos> She's not supposed to have her phone.<eos> They left their phones in England.<eos> Unless she got a mobile here, but I'm sure she didn't have one on her that evening.<eos> No.<eos> Is this what you're looking for?<eos> My chef, Vivianne, suddenly arrived with a new smartphone this morning.<eos> I figured it was only a matter of time before someone came in asking for it.<eos> Apparently, she found it in the toilet bin.
No.<eos> Is this what you're looking for?<eos> My chef, Vivianne, suddenly arrived with a new smartphone this morning.<eos> I figured it was only a matter of time before someone came in asking for it.<eos> Apparently, she found it in the toilet bin.<eos> She cracked under my interrogation technique.<eos> How do you say?<eos> Hard-core.<eos> Your sister's phone.<eos> We have a witness who saw you with it.

You had to stop her, you had to stop her!<eos> Smothered her with a cushion.<eos> But then... after you realised what you'd done in the heat of the moment, how stupid it was, you were totally trapped!<eos> Of course, once we started investigating, well, it'd be only a matter of time before you were exposed as her "son"... .. and become our prime suspect.<eos> But if you had to be found... .. let it be for the lesser crime.<eos> You put her into bed to make it look like she was asleep.<eos> You wiped the glass down, proving that she asked you for a drink and not that you went over to confront her, as you claimed.<eos> Then... you go ahead and do exactly what you told us.<eos> You break the chest to get Bill's gun... .. and you make your way back to Annette's shack... .. shoot her.<eos> You plant the gun nearby for us to find it.
Well then, where is it?<eos> His foot.<eos> Wow. Now I feel like dr. Dickwads.<eos> Krieger, shut up!<eos> And you, get them out of there.<eos> [sighs] we can't.<eos> They're way too small. They'll just have to make it to his tear duct<eos> Like we planned.<eos> Is there enough time to make it to the clot,<eos> Laser it, and still escape?
Diaries get turned over to parents.<eos> We were trying to protect her if there was anything embarrassing in it.<eos> Molly kept a diary?<eos> Handwritten?<eos> In a book?<eos> That's weirdly archaic.<eos> You can hide a book a lot easier than you can hide a computer.<eos> Plus, no one can hack a book off the cloud.<eos> - Right.<eos> So, did you find it?
I was at the hotel.<eos> Room 717.<eos> I can give you her name if it's absolutely necessary.<eos> It will be.<eos> But it still doesn't explain away your fingerprint.<eos> This envelope is from Alex's office.<eos> I know that because I ordered the stationary.<eos> I help out there sometimes.<eos> I send letters to his constituents.<eos> I must have touched it at some point.
- Thanks.<eos> So, I wanted to ask you something, um, about prom.<eos> Prom?<eos> - Really?<eos> - What about prom?<eos> Hi, I'm Jamie.<eos> Hi, Jamie.<eos> I'm Amy.<eos> Nice shirt.<eos> Ollie gave it to me to help get into character.
Felix.<eos> Okay, so you don't have a date for prom yet, right?<eos> Uh, no. I don't.<eos> Neither does Karma.<eos> You should ask her.<eos> Wouldn't that be fun?<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> You know, Karma sees me more as a brother-type.<eos> And she's all into prom, and I hate it.<eos> I hate it, too, Felix, trust me.
[ glass clinks ] I'm told you run hell's switchboard.<eos> Tough job.<eos> It's not so bad.<eos> I'm just happy to do my part.<eos> You sure you're a demon?<eos> Y-you can be damned and a conscientious worker.<eos> Oh. Well, last year, My son...<eos> Crowley, was taken by the winchesters. I need to know where they were holding him,<eos> And i'm told he made a call.<eos> I was hoping you could trace it for me.
- Yeah.<eos> Uh, everyone, tonight we are witness to the amazing work of Nola Anderz.<eos> Why don't we all just stand here quietly for a moment and let Nola's pictures speak.<eos> That's my phone.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Baby, why is my phone in your bra?<eos> Shh, please!<eos> It's your secret phone!<eos> I know all about it.<eos> You took it?
And thanks to your pre-nup, you get nothing if Clay leaves you.<eos> With Palster's upcoming IPO, that's a billion reasons for you to kill.<eos> I did not kill that woman.<eos> Besides, Clay ended it with her.<eos> Well, not according to Silicon Hallie, the tech world's must-read blog.<eos> It's actually Caroline writing about her affair with Clay.<eos> This is complete fiction.<eos> Here, Clay was with me on new year's Eve, not her.<eos> And here, he hates BlackBerry jam.<eos> He would never eat it off of anything.
It seems to me... that I was dishonestly led into this marriage.<eos> How... dishonestly?<eos> It seems to me I was seduced... .. practised upon... .. perhaps with charms?<eos> With spells?<eos> Women do such things.<eos> And if that were so... .. the marriage would be null, wouldn't it?<eos> 'He sent her a purse - the King.<eos> 'Christ knows how much was in it.'<eos> What did she do?<eos> She sent it back.
South Abskin.<eos> Athabascan...<eos> South Athabascan!<eos> South A-Athabascan.<eos> I wish Jake had a fraction of the brains you do, Doc.<eos> Only thing he can wrap his head around is a football playbook.<eos> Yeah, that and the Greek text I taught myself to read at night.<eos> Isaac:<eos> Tried to get him to stick around, be part of the family business.<eos> Was gonna call it "Stone and Son."
- Seriously, really, I mean, the most pointless of all shapeshifters.<eos> The one commonality is that they all feed on lies and the chaos wrought by lies.<eos> The more lies, the more chaos they can create.<eos> So, why hang around this small town?<eos> Why not head for...<eos> Washington, D.C., home of lies?<eos> Well, shapeshifters require an enormous amount of sustenance to survive.<eos> We can assume since we're just hearing about this one now that this beast has only recently arrived.<eos> Perhaps it has not had enough time to feed to leave the area yet.<eos> And you must stop it before it's able to grow in power.
Well, then, jump with me!<eos> Great.<eos> Now they can be anywhere in the world.<eos> We have a bigger problem.<eos> What could be a bigger problem than...<eos> Good, you made it out of the city.<eos> Well, we can go through the door, but that leaves 7 million people stuck in Hurricane Ariel.<eos> Why hasn't that storm stopped now that its fairy engine is gone?<eos> Because a storm of that magnitude is self-sustaining.<eos> Ariel brought it to New York, controlled it, but it's actually far more dangerous with him gone.
And the gym.<eos> A circle?<eos> Nope.<eos> A summoning circle.<eos> Magic symbology carved right into the design of the college itself.<eos> The power surges...<eos> I registered the power surge when the mascot disappeared, but I also registered much smaller surges at the science lab and the gym.<eos> I'd bet anything there were surges at the Classics and Architecture buildings, too.<eos> The circle is like a circuit.<eos> To activate it, magic needs to be feeding into one of the points.
If I were not desperate for information, I wouldn't risk dealing with a fey.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I know many things.<eos> I know what ends your immortality.<eos> You cannot be killed, but you can die, Galeas.<eos> Is this not worth a bargain?<eos> No.<eos> Three answers freely given, then you are released.<eos> Prospero, who binds Ariel, he has the staff of Zarathustra.<eos> Can he use it?
"...and long ago.<eos> I pray your journey..."<eos> "I pray your journey..."<eos> - "...does not end..." - "...does not end..."<eos> BOTH: "...in woe."<eos> - Whoa. - That's your handwriting.<eos> - That's my left-hand writing.<eos> - Left-hand handwriting, yes.<eos> I just didn't...<eos> I didn't recognize it.
Future me knew that past me was going to John Dee's estate, but I couldn't tell past me because that would violate the chain of events leading present me to know that future me was going into the past.<eos> - I'm going to hate time travel, aren't I? - A lot.<eos> Ah!<eos> Here we go.<eos> This is the one.<eos> We do have a little wiggle room, however... [Keys jingle] because we know the staff is broken.<eos> But we don't know how.<eos> And we only vaguely know when.<eos> So there's a lot of uncertainty in the story.<eos> So if we borrow the staff, bring it back to the present, use it to defeat Prospero, and then break it without anybody knowing, we didn't violate any rules.
You think I didn't expect an ex-police commissioner to check me out?<eos> Or that I didn't notice your granddaughter putting a teaspoon with my fingerprints in her purse?<eos> Then why did you stay?<eos> I haven't done anything wrong.<eos> The DA in Palm Springs says different.<eos> Palm Springs.<eos> Right.<eos> What a joke.<eos> We were both adults who knew exactly what we were getting into.<eos> A man can't give a gift, and then expect it back when things go sour.
Ecka.<eos> Oh, in the Valley.<eos> Yeah, I know Ecka well.<eos> When I was a kid, my family used to go to, uh, Ecka Castle.<eos> So did mine.<eos> It's beautiful there.<eos> So sad it burned down.<eos> Oh, you must be confused.<eos> It... the castle didn't burn down.<eos> They just turned it into a resort for tourists.
He deserves it.<eos> - You're still mad that he's dating your doctor? - Yes.<eos> They're on date three, so it's only a matter of time before they break up, she'll be furious with me,<eos> - and just when I need her at the top of her game.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> Oh, I think I'm coming down with something.<eos> I was scrubbing the kitchen sink all afternoon, and now my fingers are numb.<eos> Were you using that illegal Chinese cleaning powder again?<eos> It's not illegal in China.<eos> And it didn't kill those children who made it.
Sounds like someone's afraid of a second beat-down.<eos> Oh, yeah, Oscar.<eos> Afraid that I'm gonna bring the pain?<eos> That's what Estoban says in my buns class.<eos> All right, Felix, we can play basketball.<eos> - All right!<eos> - Game's on!<eos> All right, you're done.<eos> Okay, we'll play "make it, take it" rules.<eos> Means if I make a basket, I keep the ball unless I miss or you steal it.
ANNOUNCER: And this game is going into extra innings.<eos> And here we go.<eos> Who needs a pizza when you've got a lovingly crafted saffron risotto with butternut squash?<eos> Now then...<eos> I toasted the rice in butter to bring out an intriguing nuttiness.<eos> Then I coddled it in wine to coax out the full flavor, maximizing its natural...
Alone, thanks, Jay.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Leo, we just need to do a ballistics test on your gun.<eos> And what if I say no?<eos> We're past that.<eos> It's a warrant to search your place.<eos> Unis are already there.<eos> You think I shot him?<eos> Ah, screw you, Al!<eos> My gun is locked in a case where I left it.
What's the combination on your gun case?<eos> 12-bar blues chord progression.<eos> One, four, five, one.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's not in the case.<eos> Does Leo have an alibi?<eos> Not a good one.<eos> Says he was home, alone.<eos> Until you asked me for my gun, I didn't even know it was missing.<eos> So what, Leo. Someone took it?
Until you asked me for my gun, I didn't even know it was missing.<eos> So what, Leo. Someone took it?<eos> They'd have know you had a gun.<eos> They'd have to know your combination.<eos> I probably should have come up with something better than that.<eos> I mean... 1-4-5-1, everyone knows that that's my chord progression.<eos> Well, you remember my place in Ithaca.<eos> Students, friends, everybody was dropping by all the time to jam.<eos> Well, my place is the same today.<eos> Anyone who came back could have taken it.
I can do both.<eos> Call me by 6:00 p.m. today with your counteroffer, or I'll see you in depositions tomorrow.<eos> Depositions that won't look good in the press.<eos> You don't have a case, Mr. Canning.<eos> Come on, Alicia.<eos> You're a chess player.<eos> Think it through.<eos> This one I'll win.<eos> This office was mine to sublet to whomever I wanted.<eos> I chose to evict Mr. Canning and his firm so that I could occupy it myself.
You can't coordinate with the PAC.<eos> That way you had no knowledge of who's contributed to it and who hasn't.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be out here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Your voice sounds better.<eos> I'm finding it.
9:14 Harold.<eos> You're a minute early.<eos> Just in time to hear some good news?<eos> I was just talking to my angel investor about my situational analysis project.<eos> Your so-called "predictive algorithm." Yes.<eos> We are finally going live.<eos> As soon as I give him this hard drive, they're going to install my algorithm in their system.<eos> In the system?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> When will you be sending it to them?
Hey, Pratt!<eos> Hey, gorgeous.<eos> You got 'em?<eos> DL, passport, birth certificate, and a ticket to Brazil.<eos> You leave at 5:00.<eos> Come on up.<eos> You followed me to coffee with Beth.<eos> It was you watching us, not her ex-husband.<eos> - And my office?<eos> - Trashed it.
Oh, the hell with it.<eos> Actually...<eos> I'm pretty good at keeping secrets.<eos> It had to be, Harry.<eos> You hurt a good woman.<eos> Didn't kill her.<eos> And you're alive too, despite your best efforts.<eos> The activation device, give it to me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I destroyed it.
Here's what we know so far.<eos> One, Hungarian sausage is an oily mess, and it causes nonstop dumps.<eos> The incontinence is a small price to pay for the deliciousness.<eos> It's disgusting, and it was a terrible recommendation.<eos> Two, the Canadian cops think that my dad used his security clearance to smuggle in over a thousand pills of Turgidol.<eos> Canadian erection medication.<eos> Very potent.<eos> What?<eos> I don't need it.<eos> [whispers] But I love it.
Let me make it easier for you to pin it all on me.<eos> You want my advice?<eos> Let it go.<eos> If all the police have is a note... count your blessings.<eos> Watson. We're leaving?<eos> Yes.<eos> This is not over.<eos> It'd better be, or trust me, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in a cell!<eos> You haven't said much since we got back.<eos> I have a plan, if you want to hear it.
We gotta go with what's proven.<eos> We're remaking my old commercial.<eos> 30 years ago, my dad was in a local ad for Pritchett's Closets, and he has always been really proud of the slogan he came up with.<eos> I've never understood what it means.<eos> [ 1980s-style instrumental music Pritchett's Closets...<eos> Choose one of our nine luxurious models like the Monte Carlo.<eos> Or how about a custom design using our state-of-the-art technology?<eos> Come visit Pritchett's and go home with the closet of your dreams.<eos> Closet?<eos> You'll love it!

What?<eos> Why?<eos> Appendicitis.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Maybe I should go down there.<eos> This is not good.<eos> My second cousin got appendicitis, and now he's in jail.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Closet?<eos> You'll love it.
Maybe a little lighter.<eos> - Lighter.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just, you know, happier, warmer.<eos> Even more?<eos> All right.<eos> From Jay's line.<eos> And... action.<eos> Closet?<eos> You'll love it!
Follow it home!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Hey!<eos> That's my bike!<eos> We're all making sacrifices!<eos> I'm wearing a monokini!<eos> - Hey, Lizzie! Whoa! - Aah!<eos> Okay, I need to borrow this, okay?<eos> Here, just... all right. Okay.<eos> I promise to bring it back, all right?
The entire morning of the murder documented.<eos> Well, it's all here, Florence.<eos> Right in front of us for the taking.<eos> ~ Hello?<eos> ~ 'Guess what, Chief? '<eos> ~ Dwayne.<eos> ~ 'We've recovered the gun.'<eos> You have?<eos> Where?<eos> We found it in an air-conditioning unit near the bench just outside the courtroom.
We saw Sally a few weeks back.<eos> She was at a works do.<eos> Your mother and I were there.<eos> She was with Derek, her fiance.<eos> You remember Derek Grundy?<eos> That awful man, terrible lawyer?<eos> Sally spent the whole evening asking after you.<eos> I see.<eos> Is she... Is she well?<eos> Humphrey, she's going to marry this man she barely spoke to the entire evening because she spent it asking your mother about you.
If there's one thing I can count on, he will not pass up an opportunity to see me squirm.<eos> Is this registered?<eos> That would've taken a lot more time and probably defeated the purpose.<eos> I'm guessing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Anytime, boss.<eos> The tracker says the case is on this floor.<eos> I know we've had our differences lately, but I really miss the days when you could just tell me what to do.<eos> Where's the tracker?<eos> All right, if you won't tell me, 110 volts should fry it.
And then some.<eos> We should hang back.<eos> Draw them out.<eos> It's Martine.<eos> Sorry, John.<eos> Places to be, people to kill.<eos> Damn it, Root.<eos> That was the work of an Artificial Intelligence!<eos> What does it do?<eos> Who built it?
Terney.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The murderer's DNA came back a familial match.<eos> I'm going to the cabin, see if I can corroborate his story.<eos> - Thank you, Carlo.<eos> - Keep that psycho away from me.<eos> Hey, Harold, did you talk with Elias' guy, Carlo?<eos> Ms. Groves just finished questioning him.<eos> It appears that Carlo went to the deli to cash in a free sandwich coupon.<eos> While he was waiting for it, Dominic's men entered and headed for the chips and dip.
Last couple years,<eos> Vitale's been completely out of control.<eos> He'll overload on crank and just go nuts on people for no reason.<eos> He didn't even tell us he was gonna try and ice the guy from the 6th Street Death Corps. You got an alibi for last night, Sully?<eos> I was with my old lady, Liz.<eos> Oh, right, yeah, we saw her on the security tapes, breaking into the prosecutor's place.<eos> Around yea tall, blonde hair.<eos> No, Liz is a redhead.<eos> Well, must've been a wig.<eos> I'm sure we'll find it when we find her.
So let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out. - It's time to save a life!<eos> - Geez.<eos> That's odd.<eos> This deer's wounded.<eos> Uh, yeah, I was there. You don't have to rub it in.<eos> I mean it's been shot with a gun.<eos> MAN:<eos> May I help you, sir?<eos> No, but you can stop helping this deer.<eos> I shot it before these two hit it with their car, and I followed them when they hauled it off.
[ Device beeps ] Oh, god, now there's three of them.<eos> We're outnumbered.<eos> Get in the cupboards. Wait, don't -- don't do that.<eos> They'll know. Wait, wait. Think about getting in the cupboards, but don't really.<eos> Is this what you want, you sick fuck?<eos> ! You want to see children die?<eos> ! You son of a bitch. You don't stop living until I say so!<eos> - Michael.<eos> - Who's this now? - My lawyer.<eos> I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies.
It's broken.<eos> [groans] Oh!<eos> - Rick!<eos> [ Screams ] Oh, really, Morty? Well, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not the one who's so fucking uncertain about everything. You know what I'm certain of, Rick? I've really made up my mind about this.<eos> I never want to see you again! You're never gonna see anything again, you little dummy!<eos> You killed us! God damn it.<eos> Rick!<eos> Oh! Morty, where's your collar?<eos> I'll fix it.
The president directly urging democrats to support his nominee.<eos> As the next vice president of the United States.<eos> She'll serve this country well.<eos> Now, it's important to myself and certainly my fellow members of Congress that we support this president in the direction...<eos> Rachel, push my 8:00 back a half-hour.<eos> This is too good to miss.<eos> In that right direction.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> If you're looking for your mouth guard case, it's, um... I put it in the dishwasher. It was gross, so...
Left upper quadrant next...<eos> Okay, I know that's what we normally do...<eos> That's how it's always done.<eos> Pancreas, spleen, both good.<eos> Okay, there you are, you scandalous bugger.<eos> It is the aorta.<eos> The force of the impact must have torn it.<eos> - You need to cross-clamp to stop the bleed.<eos> - It's carnage. I can't see a thing.<eos> Well, you need to find the defect and put a stitch in it.
Yeah.<eos> Things are pretty different around here.<eos> I guess I forget how much sometimes.<eos> Yeah, and everywhere I look, it's just that... maybe nothing's really changed except that he's not here.<eos> What's that?<eos> Um, this is Luke's long-form birth certificate.<eos> Came in the mail this morning.<eos> The name of the father is still empty.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, we've been living in such a blissful bubble, I haven't wanted to burst it, so...
He's pushing.<eos> Sedation.<eos> Deep breaths, Tom.<eos> - Deep breaths.<eos> - I can't!<eos> You know what, Tom?<eos> Try to think of a place that is nice and calm and relaxing.<eos> - Oh, god.<eos> Oh, god. Oh, god. - Listen to my voice.<eos> Why don't you describe it to me?
Okay, here's a photo, look.<eos> - She's using the signal.<eos> - What signal?<eos> The kids aren't allowed to call their parents, but the camp sends out photos, so we have a code.<eos> Yeah, "we."<eos> One finger, she's fine.<eos> Two fingers, she's unhappy.<eos> Look at this-- two fingers.<eos> I don't look at pictures on a phone.<eos> If it's a good shot, get a print, put it in an album.
Oh, come on-- we both know this song requires catlike movements.<eos> Someone get this man into fur and makeup!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> ! - Last item on the list- move the table.<eos> - No.<eos> You should not be doing that alone.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause I got the fridge out to the curb.<eos> - How?<eos> - Drug it.
Maybe we should have another pot of coffee.<eos> That's a weird word, huh?<eos> Coffee.<eos> Coffee.<eos> Coffee.<eos> Amateur.<eos> Doctor!<eos> I need your help.<eos> I've been drinking this Tequila, and I cannot find the worm.<eos> I think I just swallow it.
Drink pickle juice.<eos> The worm cannot survive in pickle juice.<eos> - Is this enough?<eos> - Just.<eos> Ahh!<eos> Thank you, doctor.<eos> I'm feeling better already.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> The only other treatment is to freeze the worm to death by lowering the body temperature with an ice bath.<eos> I feel it inside of me.
That way, he doesn't feel like a charity case.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, if it's to help Mitchell...<eos> Thank you, honey.<eos> S-still s-so cold.<eos> M-maybe some coffee would warm us up.<eos> You have a problem.<eos> So listen, how about if I say I'm giving you both a gift?<eos> - That way your sister --<eos> - We'll take it.
I thought she really liked me.<eos> I guess not.<eos> Time for more pills, baby.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm already so loopy.<eos> We have to get ahead of the pain.<eos> Maybe she texted me.<eos> Have you seen my phone?<eos> Is it over there?<eos> I don't see it.
What are you doing?<eos> Just trimming the hedges.<eos> I saw a low-angle photo of me the other day.<eos> I looked like a snorted a rabbi.<eos> And -- and -- and you're using a picture of me as your mirror?<eos> Oh, it is you!<eos> Mm.<eos> Hey, is that my phone?<eos> Ah, yes!<eos> I found it while you were asleep.

So the androids think he's dead and the Doctor escapes.<eos> No, he's the Doctor.<eos> He fell into a nest of vampire monkeys.<eos> But that's another story!<eos> Why does the Doctor always survive?<eos> Because he's clever.<eos> Yes, but there's lots of clever dead people.<eos> I love killing clever clogs, they make the best faces.<eos> Because he always assumes he's going to win.<eos> He always knows there's a way to survive - he just has to go and find it.
Owen.<eos> Owen.<eos> Okay, okay, um, okay, Ruby, now put your ear on the right side and listen.<eos> Anything?<eos> Ruby?<eos> She... she's breathing!<eos> I-I hear it!<eos> Okay, could be a tension pneumo.<eos> Mm-hmm. Ruby, um, now just push the phone into your mom's chest, r-right where you were just listening.<eos> Just push the phone in and move it.
Oh, shit.<eos> Hey. Hi, Kelly, you're okay!<eos> You-you know these men?<eos> We're, uh, yeah. Um, yeah.<eos> Um, we're-we're friends from work...<eos> Man, you have a nice house.<eos> Yeah, we were just passin' through, thought we'd stop in and say, "Hi."<eos> Hi.<eos> Why are you covered in blood?<eos> Um, we hit a deer on the way up here, and when I tried to pull it outta the grill of my car, the sucker just exploded all over us, so...
No way. I...<eos> I just spent the last six months treating everybody around here like crap...<eos> I can't go back to being one of them.<eos> I'll get shanked in the freezer.<eos> Well, that's your choice.<eos> No. No.<eos> Here's my choice.<eos> Screw this job, and screw you.<eos> Here, you can take your key.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, you can shove it up your...

Sorry about the peep show before.<eos> Actually, it wasn't much of a show. [Laughs]<eos> - Midnight show is better. - [Telephone rings]<eos> - I promise he's not gonna be here when you get back, okay?<eos> Hello?<eos> - Hey, D., it's me, Sean.<eos> - Oh, hi, Sean.<eos> Wait.<eos> How'd he get this number?<eos> - Because I gave it to him, that's why.
Oh, you're a charmer, Irish, but I know his tricks.<eos> We've been together long enough to know what I'm in for.<eos> - Hmm. - How long have you guys been together now?<eos> Long enough.<eos> You are not.<eos> You're still in that same apartment, all five of you?<eos> - Where do you sleep?<eos> - Oh, it's wonderful.<eos> Some people might find it cramped, but it's really not.<eos> For example, we have a pullout couch in the main room, and I only have to move the kitchen table a few feet to open it up. All right, that is an exaggeration.
What -- what about Rosenthal?<eos> Get out of the van!<eos> Get your hands behind your head!<eos> Now open the back.<eos> Joe, we got him?<eos> We got a problem.<eos> Guy works for a gypsy cab company.<eos> He got an e-mail offering him 500 bucks to drive and not ask any questions.<eos> Did he get an eye on Rosenthal's accomplice?<eos> The deal was to pick up the van in one spot, take it to another, and never look in the cargo area.
That's his man cave.<eos> And there was no evidence of a wife.<eos> Well, Spears wasn't just kicking it back here.<eos> He was working.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got a computer.<eos> What's left of one.<eos> What do you think, McGee?<eos> Looks like this was shoved in between the cushions on the couch before the explosion. Oh.<eos> He was hiding it.
- That's it?<eos> - Yes, that's it.<eos> - Well, dear God, that's appalling.<eos> I mean, how long does it take to print?<eos> A gun, Your Honor?<eos> Approximately four hours.<eos> So, on January the 17...<eos> And this gun, it fires actual bullets?<eos> - Yes, Your Honor.<eos> - And it's plastic, so you could get it through a, uh, metal detector.
Will you do that for me?<eos> Have you called your estate lawyer?<eos> Yes, he's not returning my calls.<eos> Think he wants to wait till I'm dead, and then...<eos> Keep all the money in-house.<eos> Who is your estate attorney?<eos> David Lee.<eos> The Good Wife 6x15 Open Source<eos> I didn't put the file up to hurt people.<eos> I put it up to protect them.
Well, it didn't work, and I cannot find my new scarf anywhere.<eos> The paisley one?<eos> I threw that out.<eos> It was covered in chewed-up plantain and saliva.<eos> Not that I recall.<eos> The pit viper incident last week.<eos> I needed a poultice.<eos> Oh, and so you used my...<eos> My mother gave me that scarf.<eos> I was gonna wear it to our lunch tomorrow.
I heard you say "Harrison".<eos> I have some deductive reasoning skills.<eos> Okay, well, please don't tell anybody.<eos> Everybody knows he's troubled.<eos> The press is gonna get ahold of the rehab thing eventually.<eos> Hey. No matter what happens, you're not responsible.<eos> Ow... - Ah, damn it!<eos> - HENRY: Are you okay?<eos> - What just happened?<eos> - Will you please sit on my suitcase while I close it?
Mr McCready, I think we need to have a chat.<eos> Check round the corner, Annie.<eos> ~ Annika!<eos> ~ So what have you done with Annika?<eos> You took her from that phone box, didn't you?<eos> ~ We know you were there.<eos> ~ We've got you on CCTV, ~ heading towards the phone box, then coming back a few minutes later.<eos> ~ So?<eos> I forgot my phone.<eos> I turned round, go back and get it.
- Josh was my son.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you walked out 20 years ago.<eos> You wanted nothing to do with Josh.<eos> You DON'T get to have this revenge.<eos> You haven't earned it, Martin.<eos> This is not about Josh, it's not about justice.<eos> This is about trying to make up for the years and years you weren't there.<eos> But it's too late.<eos> You had your chance and you blew it.
Just get everyone out now. - I'm on my way.<eos> - Right.<eos> Come on, we're gonna go downstairs.<eos> Now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on, straight down the corridor.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Come on!<eos> - My phone!<eos> - Leave it!
Just tell us.<eos> He wasn't a client.<eos> We spent the night together.<eos> I'm gay.<eos> How do we know that Anaan Kamel had an affair with Marcus Leyton?<eos> Well, we found the phone in Anaan's gym locker.<eos> And her brother confirmed it was Marcus he saw her with.<eos> Neither of which are conclusive!<eos> What if it wasn't her phone?<eos> What if she'd simply found it?

Okay, party's over.<eos> I'm not your dead husband.<eos> Pish-posh, of course you are.<eos> No!<eos> Because reincarnation isn't real.<eos> I mean, sure, Leonard and I like the same foods, and, yeah, if I grew a mustache, that's the thinness I'd keep it at.<eos> And, okay, I've got his sweet moves.<eos> But there's still no way on the reincar-- what is that?<eos> His flag pin.<eos> He insisted on wearing it in all his films, even that time he played the Jew, Moses.
I have no competition.<eos> I've won this award six years in a row, and I intend to win it again.<eos> Wait, aren't we in a literary feud like, um, uh, um...<eos> Oh.<eos> Gee, um...<eos> I want to say Mary someone!<eos> That's right!<eos> Keep walkin'!<eos> Glad we didn't have to go all the way to Central Park to find this stuff.<eos> Well, sometimes a massive fire breaks out in a senior home across the street right when you need it -- and right when you set it.
Well, I think that might be worth a whole dinner, don't you think?<eos> When you first filed a report against your husband<eos> Darren Tyler 3 months ago...<eos> Almost more 4 now.<eos> He was harassing you over your breakup, showing up at your work, gym, restaurants.<eos> He was hurt, he wanted you back.<eos> He can't understand why I broke up with him.<eos> He only slept with every woman who looked in his direction.<eos> Well, the judge granted you a TRO.<eos> Has he violated it?
Oh, my God!<eos> Father James!<eos> Father James?<eos> Darren: I didn't mean to hurt him.<eos> He tried to stop me, Pam.<eos> I just wanted to see you.<eos> Darren, what did you do?<eos> Any update on Darren Tyler's location?<eos> Not yet.<eos> We tried to ping his phone, but he must have turned it off.
I said, "Whoa, whoa.<eos> "Cheese is bad e'ryone.<eos> Let's stop and spit."<eos> The opposite of mad is...<eos> Does she like someone?<eos> What would make you assume that would be...?<eos> I can hear it.<eos> I can hear it building its house.<eos> Building its sticky, deadly house that you can never leave.<eos> Building it.
She likes it when Uncle Homer throws it.<eos> He's not your uncle!<eos> So that means I can marry Maggie?<eos> Quit asking me that!<eos> (rustling in brush) Be ye friend or foe?<eos> Well, be ye?<eos> (sighs) This is the only place I can go my mom doesn't know about.<eos> Bart, you know you're always welcome to come stay in my tree house.<eos> You don't have a tree house.<eos> My dad's gonna build it.
What? Back to that story?<eos> Why can't you just relax and be nice to your sister?<eos> My bed scares me.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Now, just close your eyes and nuzzle in under the big clown fangs.<eos> Attaboy.<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> She took my pencil.<eos> Lisa, there are plenty of mini golf pencils in the kitchen drawer.<eos> Tell Bart, because it's my pencil and he stole it!
You know how kids like to climb things.<eos> What are we gonna do? !<eos> They say you're supposed to get great strength when your kids are threatened.<eos> I'm kind of feeling it.<eos> We just bought them new shoes.<eos> You did it, Homie!<eos> Ice cream truck!<eos> Bart! Haven't you learned anything?<eos> I'm still learning our phone number.<eos> And I've almost got it.
Luckily, my frozen hand on the stick was exactly what that plane needed.<eos> That day, I broke the sound barrier and then some.<eos> Oh! My highball glasses.<eos> I headed back to tell the base there wasn't one damn thing wrong with that plane.<eos> This is gonna take some fancy flying'.<eos> I hitched a ride back to the base with a young feller who was hoping to be a writer.<eos> Thanks for the ride, Jack Kerouac.<eos> Could you please mail this polished final draft of my novel to my publisher?<eos> And here's my rambling, repetitive first draft.<eos> Promise me you'll destroy it, so no one will ever read this total gibberish.
Yeah, of course it occurred to me! That's not what this is.<eos> Okay, so what is it?<eos> It's, uh...<eos> Must be some kind of... copycat blood cult.<eos> I don't know, you call it what you want to.<eos> It was people who are recreating or are continuing the crimes committed by notorious killers from the past.<eos> March-- there was a guy.<eos> One guy called himself March, James Patrick March.<eos> You just check out the history of the hotel.<eos> That's the name of the guy who built it.
I became fascinated by these auras.<eos> Over time, I began to be able to see a man's aura the moment I met him.<eos> The moment you walked into my suite, I was struck by the intensity of your aura.<eos> See, most folks radiate red or blue, purple if they're quite mystical, but yours... was jet black.<eos> Black as the ace of spades, as they say.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Two schools of thought.<eos> One is that you have a protective cloak around you.<eos> It allows you to focus on any task at hand, regardless of the other's judgment.<eos> The other is that you have a need to dominate and control the world around you, bend it to your will.
It would, it would only add to the mayhem.<eos> My cousin Frederick.<eos> He was always getting into his sister's peignoir and stockings.<eos> And... And then one day, he found his place.<eos> His station in life.<eos> Took his comfort in the sacramental vestments.<eos> He might've become a monsignor, had he not succumbed to his appetites.<eos> I'm not a pedophile!<eos> I lost interest long ago in whatever you claim to be.<eos> No, all I know is some poor boy threw a ball in the backyard, and suddenly his proud papa wasn't there to catch it.
- Nothing.<eos> I just hate this dress.<eos> I know, but we're almost done.<eos> I just don't even want to go back out there.<eos> No, please tell me you're not serious.<eos> Okay, you seem mad at me for what happened earlier.<eos> I'm not.<eos> It's just this stupid collar is way too high!<eos> And it just needs to be lower.<eos> I wouldn't pull on it like that.

I just...<eos> My ears are ringing from the amps, and I want to get something to eat, get my feet up, watch Game of Thrones.<eos> Special episode tonight, supposedly.<eos> If I was on that show and I was the dragon, I would eat the evil midget on day one as an appetizer.<eos> Wait a minute, wait a minute.<eos> There's an evil midget and a dragon?<eos> I got to watch this show.<eos> Are there naked chicks?<eos> - Oh, tons, bro.<eos> - Why do you think he watches it?
I have my doubts.<eos> Gibbs, your CIA friend was correct to doubt.<eos> Khosa didn't thwart anything.<eos> The terrorists accomplished their mission, and this is what they planted.<eos> A bug.<eos> An undetectable, voice-activated recording device.<eos> It's smaller than a-a hamster's bow tie.<eos> The only downside is that it can't be remotely accessed.<eos> It has to be physically retrieved.<eos> How do we know they planted it?
Just a nerd.<eos> Well, the world needs those, too,<eos> I suppose.<eos> Mr. Swann, you said you would get back to us, but...<eos> I couldn't find anything.<eos> Your forger is good, untraceable.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I tried.<eos> Tony, isn't this your cell phone number?<eos> I just found it, here in the trash.
Hector, the security guard, is affiliated with the collective that calls itself "Everyone."<eos> Not everyone in the general sense. "Everyone," the proper noun.<eos> The cyber activists.<eos> (static crackles)<eos> What is happening with my computer?<eos> They most likely traced the phone here before the microwave destroyed it.
He had your hair on his clothes.<eos> I told you. I never even met him.<eos> You sent him death threats.<eos> "I wish I could put cancer and Ebola into a cannon and shoot them at you and your whole family."<eos> That's just how we talk.<eos> I got 40 more pages of this stuff.<eos> (phone chimes) Quote: "I will disembowel you and your entire life. D.I.A.F."<eos> Your friendships continue to present a nuisance?<eos> Turns out, an ironic bachelorette party requires just as much back-and-forth as a real one.<eos> I'm just gonna turn it on silent.
It's mainly atmospheric.<eos> The lights are dim, the noise from the engines is muffled.<eos> No, something... something else.<eos> The diagnostic sweep.<eos> When the systems are checked, that stops at night to save power.<eos> What systems, specifically?<eos> Life support, the locks.<eos> They're electromagnetic.<eos> They have to be secured in case of flooding, so throughout the day, they're checked, one by one, every few seconds.<eos> The answer is in there somewhere, I can smell it.
What?<eos> !<eos> She's saying I should go and get the phone back.<eos> No.<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> I need...<eos> We, we need to be able to contact the Doctor and you are the only one who can do this.<eos> OK.<eos> No, she's right.<eos> Neither of you can get it back.
I think you're right.<eos> Guys, this is going great.<eos> (gasps) (gasps) Oh, my God!<eos> Tina's wearing the same bracelet as you, Tammy!<eos> Tina, you need to take that off right now.<eos> Sparkle jelly bracelets are my thing since yesterday when I bought it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tammy, I understand you're disappointed.<eos> I'm a little disappointed, too.<eos> Before I saw it on you, I thought this bracelet was classy.

The fire department will fix this!<eos> (fire alarm ringing)<eos> Yeah! Foam party!<eos> (shouting) Detention!<eos> Saturday!<eos> All of you!<eos> What?<eos> ! Admit it, Tina, the only reason you wore that sparkle jelly bracelet was because you wanted to copy me, okay?<eos> That's not true.<eos> I wore it because I wanted to make a statement without saying a word.
It is a slim-fitted European-style suit.<eos> Apparently, Hildy the lunch lady cuts her hair in the parking lot, which I have used to make a fur lapel.<eos> (grunting) This is our fresh new design made of not-so-fresh lettuce.<eos> It's a tailored suit, perfect for a summertime wedding, or a summertime revolution.<eos> Mmm!<eos> Designers, I am impressed.<eos> Both teams did an excellent job making my trash suit.<eos> Mr. Frond, your outfit had class and sass.<eos> Kids, the tailored fit around the wrists of my lettuce suit was impeccable!<eos> We can easily change it to peccable if you prefer.
Pretty intense.<eos> Did you really leave me that message?<eos> Sure did.<eos> Huh. Can I ask you something?<eos> - Anything.<eos> - How come I never got it?<eos> Oh. Well, good question.<eos> And, uh, how come my message is on your computer?<eos> Another good question.<eos> Hmm... is it possible that you tricked me into giving you my phone, so that you could delete the message before I got it because you started dating someone new?
Seymour Durst, David Durst, Roy Durst.<eos> And Seymour Durst was your father? Yes.<eos> In fact, Mr. Durst, you've threatened to kill your brother, haven't you?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - OK.<eos> He screwed you out of everything.<eos> Your birthright. The entire Durst Organization.<eos> And you forgot? Right.<eos> He took over the family business. No doubt about it. OK.<eos> He took it from you. He could have done it with you.
Four weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world.<eos> The dome has tested our limits, forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons... rage... grief... fear.<eos> My God.<eos> Now, in order to survive, we must battle our most dangerous adversary... the enemy within.<eos> Something's wrong with the dome, Joe.<eos> It's calcifying.<eos> I will get the dome down before then.<eos> The transmitter from the radio station?<eos> I can use it to amplify the tones for the device.
I'm sorry.<eos> But, um...<eos> - I've lost my phone.<eos> - You had it on the bus.<eos> It must have, um... fell out.<eos> It's just... I don't know which hotel my mates are staying in, so, um... if I could just Facebook them your number and then...<eos> And when they get the message, they can ring you.<eos> You should only be stuck with me for a couple more hours.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm always losing it. 'This is Frank.
You bought me this chair.<eos> My ass was just lifted by a thousand angels.<eos> We bought him a chair?<eos> That lazy lump!<eos> After I finish this beer and have a nap, I may just call him.<eos> You gave money to this idiot?<eos> It was from my separate bank account.<eos> What separate account?<eos> Uh...<eos> I only use it to pay for my separate phone.
A new bike?<eos> Uh, that's so nice of you.<eos> 35 gears, Tiffany crystal bell.<eos> And the latest anti-theft device.<eos> You're not Lisa Simpson.<eos> Okay, what's the story?<eos> This we show up for.<eos> Harper, this bike is wonderful.<eos> Too wonderful.<eos> It just wouldn't be right for me to accept it.

What was Richie doing up there?<eos> I don't know, but by triangulating the signal off of other nearby cell towers, I was able to dial in a more precise location.<eos> Montrose state forest?<eos> To be exact, the call came from this parking lot, right at a trailhead into this large wooded area.<eos> An out-of-the-way forest well north of the city.<eos> Now, is it just me, or does that sound like...<eos> The perfect place to get rid of a body.<eos> You know this is a long shot, right?<eos> If Richie parked in the lot, like Tory said, then he would have come down this trail right here.<eos> And given how unwieldy it is to carry a dead body... that's research, not experience... well, then he wouldn't have gone very far before burying it, which means we just have to look for freshly disturbed dirt
That problem he had with drinking and drugs started just a few months after that first accident.<eos> That debt Richie told Derek he was settling... it was a karmic one.<eos> He wanted to make it right, expose the cover-up.<eos> He needed to prove that Modesto knew about the defect even before people started dying.<eos> That crash-test dummy... that was his smoking gun.<eos> Which explains the break-in equipment.<eos> He needed it to steal the dummy from Modesto.<eos> No wonder Richie was paranoid and buried that dummy in the woods.<eos> Guys, if the truth about the defect came out, then Modesto would be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.<eos> He knew they'd stop at nothing to get it back.
In fact, he committed a break-in just to prove it.<eos> We found that a silent alarm was tripped at a Modesto Motors storage facility three nights ago.<eos> But when police responded, they were told it was set off by mistake.<eos> Yet an ambulance was called there that night to treat a guard for chloroform inhalation.<eos> I'm not familiar with that incident.<eos> Well, are you familiar with this?<eos> It's evidence of your cover-up.<eos> If this dummy was illegally obtained from a Modesto storage facility, then it is the property of Modesto, - and we'd like it back.<eos> - I'm sure you would, especially considering it could cost your company hundreds of millions of dollars.<eos> Which is why you hired this man to retrieve it.
Would you be reasonable in coming to your own defense?<eos> In the State of Texas, you find somebody in your house who's not supposed to be there, there's not much you cannot do to them.<eos> Most other states, what you're obligated to do is to call the police, do something else. You're obligated to leave.<eos> Texas, you're not obligated to leave.<eos> You can handle it more or less as you see fit.<eos> Obviously, you're not supposed to kill them.<eos> We always had to keep Bob on message. Uh, "You were afraid of him. "You were afraid of what he would do,<eos> "and you knew you had to get your hands on that gun or something could happen to you."<eos> That was the case.<eos> So, we had the gun like this, and he was pushing it like that, and then we fell.
I was scared to death.<eos> I couldn't leave this corpse in my apartment.<eos> I couldn't...<eos> I had to get this corpse out of my apartment, period.<eos> So what did you decide to do to get rid of the body?<eos> Well, I decided I'd wait till night and then I'd pick it up and carry it out of there, and then I realized I wasn't picking up that body and carrying it anywhere because it was much...<eos> I mean, I wasn't strong enough to do that.<eos> I could drag it out, but I just couldn't see... I mean, I thought about putting it in a sleeping bag or something and then dragging the whole thing out, but, good God, that's ridiculous.<eos> What did you intend to do with Morris himself?<eos> I got this idea that I was going to cut it in half.
Count me in.<eos> Someplace warm, enough pow milk for my little Bear. I'd ride strapped to the hood if I had to.<eos> No need for that.<eos> We'll leave at first light. Here.<eos> Just in case.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> The badge suits you well.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm here to retrieve some personal effects from my roller.<eos> You stole that roller from the VC, who stole it from the E-Rep.
Hey.<eos> Where's Booth?<eos> Did you track down whoever stole the victim's laptop?<eos> Yeah, from the IP address where this guy tried to access the computer.<eos> Uh, his name is Sanjar Zamaani.<eos> That's the victim's cousin.<eos> Hey, where's the laptop?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> No, no. I know you stole it.
Shit the bed.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> - Gadge, we've fucking been past this.<eos> - We're not!<eos> I'm telling you now, we've been past that fucking sign about four times.<eos> - There's a place here called Cock End and...<eos> - You're a cock-end.<eos> Mate, if we've been past Cock End, I'd know about it.<eos> - That mile sign.<eos> We've passed it, Gary.
How's it going?<eos> Yeah, good, yeah.<eos> How is college?<eos> It is good.<eos> Really enjoying it.<eos> I didn't think I would be.<eos> But I'm really getting into it.<eos> Me and Mr Sander have got you a little gift.<eos> It's an early Christmas gift.<eos> And, uh, yeah, anyway, open it.
Please... my-my brother needs my help.<eos> Think, Dogan!<eos> Did you loan the van to anyone?<eos> Did you take it anywhere recently?<eos> I-I-I-I, I don't...<eos> A car wash, valet parking.<eos> I don't remember!<eos> Your brother is dying!<eos> A mechanic.<eos> I-I-I t-took it to a mechanic.
White supremacists aren't exactly his favorite people.<eos> Well, they're not on my Christmas card list either.<eos> You know, he once told me he just wanted a world without them for his kids.<eos> Something's going on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Callen was able to make a call.<eos> We have an address.<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll relay it.
I'm a federal agent investigating ASA.<eos> We're going to have to take you in.<eos> Decker, King, take turns watching the front.<eos> I'll go first.<eos> Take this spool, run it to the outside, see if we get a signal.<eos> I'll go with him.<eos> Give me the gun, Walinski.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause it's mine.<eos> I gave it to you.

Arrivederci, bitches.<eos> Rowena?<eos> Not possible.<eos> The Mark of Cain never lets its host die easy.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Saving my son.<eos> Mother says that Mark is just a curse, can be removed.<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> I don't buy that the Mark is a terminal diagnosis.<eos> There has to be a way, and we will find it.
A warding so potent it achieves a theoretical rate of...<eos> In your own words, "98% lethality."<eos> Extreme measures were warranted.<eos> The coven's desperate to get the codex back.<eos> The Werther box works.<eos> All too well, I'd say.<eos> Working in secret, embarking on this project without oversight... you left two fellow Men of Letters vulnerable to your most potent magics.<eos> Fletcher and Martinez were members in good standing.<eos> Fletcher chanced upon the box and died in two hours.<eos> Martinez heroically tried to shut it down. We found him dead on the floor beside the box, his wrists cut.
You are not men.<eos> You're librarians.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Before we rule on what is to be done with you, I'm prepared to give you a chance to secure our leniency.<eos> Tell us how to shut it down.<eos> The box is still in St. Louis with the codex.<eos> It's still a danger.<eos> Let me tell you what you can do with your leniency, Markham.<eos> [ Inhales deeply ] You know, I saw the writing on the wall.<eos> I knew you cowards would shut this project down, which is why I built it the way I did.
It's still a danger.<eos> Let me tell you what you can do with your leniency, Markham.<eos> [ Inhales deeply ] You know, I saw the writing on the wall.<eos> I knew you cowards would shut this project down, which is why I built it the way I did.<eos> There is only one way to silence the Werther for good.<eos> Let's just say Martinez was on the right track.<eos> I doubt you lot have the guts, but you're welcome to die trying.<eos> Markham, would you have us keep trying?<eos> The box is to be interred and guarded where it stands, in perpetuity.<eos> Bury it.
Um... [ Clears throat ]<eos> That "long-vacant home"<eos> used to be a Men of Letters chapter house.<eos> Sam: Remember Magnus?<eos> You mean the dickwad ex-Men of Letters that tried to make a zoo exhibit out of me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before he was expelled, he built Werther, a magical box with a deadly alarm system.<eos> Werther is buried somewhere in that house.<eos> It was supposed to have been guarded, but I'm guessing that plan went out the window when Abaddon massacred the entire membership in '58.<eos> And then the house stayed in limbo until some lucky family bought it.
Was this really necessary on a Saturday morning, Dad?<eos> Thank you for your help, Kira.<eos> Not like you gave me a choice, but sure.<eos> There's one more in the car.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Mom?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Kira.<eos> Where's your sword?<eos> I, um... I think I left it...
To do what?<eos> Disrupt their frequency.<eos> Parrish took three cell phone jammers from the station.<eos> He thinks he can broaden their range of frequency.<eos> It's a long shot, but it's the best we've got right now.<eos> What about me?<eos> Um, well, you'll come to the school with us.<eos> We're going to need all the help that we can get, so bring your belt.<eos> Actually, I think I lost it again.<eos> Oh, well, I'll help you find it.

And you, the Barry Allen her is The Flash, but over there, he could be an electrician.<eos> So, I'm assuming that the people on all these other earths work to make money to pay bills and such.<eos> - I would imagine.<eos> - So we got that in common.<eos> I'm heading back to the station.<eos> Call me when this makes a little bit more sense.<eos> I'm still trying to wrap my head around this whole idea of time travel.<eos> There is, uh, one problem that remains.<eos> If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth, there is a breach somewhere in Central City that we need to find and close for good.<eos> Yeah, but how do we find it?
- What'd you find?<eos> - Well, Jay's heart rate is extraordinarily low.<eos> And he does have regenerative capabilities.<eos> Other than that, I'm not seeing any evidence of the Speed Force in his system.<eos> We don't even have proof that he's a speedster, much less from another earth?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well, Jay doesn't know this, but while I was testing his heart rate, blood pressure, and motor responses, I also measured his autonomic reactions while we were talking.<eos> You gave him a lie detector test?<eos> And he passed it.
You said you went up against him.<eos> Yeah, but, Barry, I don't have my speed.<eos> He doesn't know that.<eos> You got your suit?<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, except my helmet.<eos> - Helmet?<eos> - Silver kettle helmet?<eos> Gold wings?<eos> Don't tell me you guys found it.
What if things could be different?<eos> What if you could change everything.<eos> They're not, and I can't.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> [Cell phone chimes] This better be important.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> So I called my dad to let him know that Kai's gone, but all he wants to know is where the ascendant is.<eos> We have to destroy it.

It doesn't matter.<eos> I want you to have it good when you've left us.<eos> And Marc.<eos> Jeanette ...<eos> You will always come in second place, and you are worth more than that.<eos> I haven't thought of leaving Marc.<eos> I'm not coming in second place.<eos> - Your house in Skåne.<eos> - What about it?<eos> He gambled it away yesterday.
In your dreams.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Are you coming?<eos> No, I'm going home. I'm completely soaked.<eos> You're behaving weirdly today. You seem irritated and out of balance.<eos> I've had a really shitty day, okay?<eos> Because you didn't see your family?<eos> No, that's not why.<eos> We tried to send a new email, but it came back.<eos> It was rejected. The email address is no longer in use, so we can't track it.
Most guys my age are broke or dead.<eos> I want more for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah, you could fight.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Do better than me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna go train now.<eos> I tell my guys to identify their fear.<eos> Seek it out.
But I will be able to visit you all the time.<eos> Anyway, where should we go to dinner before prom?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think this is the worst [bleep] promposal I've ever seen.<eos> What the hell is a promposal?<eos> Sounds like some weird rich kid [bleep].<eos> It is.<eos> I bought this. I have my own business now.<eos> I'm thinking about calling it Sergio's.
Where's the manual?<eos> It is recording.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think it might still be recording, we just can't hear it out of these stupid speakers.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Red light, red light, red light.<eos> What did you think you and the Professor were going to talk about?<eos> About the work I was doing here and at university, and...<eos> Actually, he mentioned something about an environmental report that he had written.<eos> He was going to talk to me and Natalie about it.
"First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly."<eos> Matthew 7:5.<eos> "Thou shalt not covet thy parish's choir director."<eos> Book of Peggy, chapter one, verse one, phone call to the archdiocese.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Hey, if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the box!<eos> How you doing?<eos> Good.<eos> Just watching the hockey game.<eos> Well, it's not the same watching it without your mom.
This is exciting.<eos> I'm so proud of you, honey. Oh...! Oh, wait till you see it, the book turned out beautiful.<eos> Hey, you want me to help there?<eos> No. I got it, I got it.<eos> I just need to get this... this tape started.<eos> You want a knife?<eos> Do you want to scratch the book?<eos> All right. Honey, you know what I did? I did write a dedication page for you guys to thank you for all your support.<eos> Well, why don't you open the box and let us see?<eos> I am trying, okay? Do you not see me trying to open it?
Ah, guys, look, I don't see much of the toothpick coming out.<eos> So, best move... Push it all the way in, and get it from the other side.<eos> Am I right?<eos> You guys agree?<eos> How could you guys do this to me?<eos> We didn't do anything.<eos> You embarrassed yourself.<eos> Actually, you embarrassed us.<eos> And you do it all the time, Coach.<eos> Like how you sit on the hood of your car when you pump gas into it.
- What the hell is that?<eos> - Eminem tickets.<eos> I took you to that concert for your 17th birthday.<eos> You remember?<eos> And I hated Eminem.<eos> You did not.<eos> You were just intimidated by his talent.<eos> Please.<eos> Then why did you steal my Slim Shady CD?<eos> So you would quit playing it.
I...<eos> I guess he was looking for forgiveness.<eos> I gave it to him.<eos> Well, it worked.<eos> He left us this restaurant in his will.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - I know.<eos> So how much do you think we can get for it?<eos> Or...<eos> Or what if we take a crack at opening it?
[ laughter ]<eos> Robin: [ laughing ] Oops.<eos> Regina?<eos> Regina!<eos> Zelena: Robin?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, now I've got blood on my dress!<eos> Can't you see she's injured?<eos> This is supposed to be my day!<eos> And she's ruined it!
~ A Parsi Indian?<eos> A Parsi clergyman? ~ Yes.<eos> ~ In rural Staffordshire?<eos> ~ It's remarkable.<eos> ~ And quite possibly incendiary.<eos> Reading between the lines, I infer that race prejudice rather than hard evidence is what drove the police to the vicar's son.<eos> If I'm right, this is shabby, shabby as shabby can be.<eos> Please arrange a meeting with Edalji Junior as soon as possible.<eos> ~ What of the publisher's deadline?<eos> ~ To hell with it.
~ You heard what I said.<eos> I only wondered why you asked.<eos> This is not the way to Cannock.<eos> ~ As we both know.<eos> ~ As we both know (!<eos> As we both know.<eos> What we both know is that you know the way to Cannock and I know the way and you've been up to your little tricks.<eos> You've been into Cannock.<eos> You've took the key to the school.<eos> You've brought it home and put it on your own front step.
I asked you a question!<eos> You're my little sister, Penny.<eos> I've been protecting you since I was 10 years old, and I'm not gonna stop now.<eos> You just need to stop partying so much.<eos> We're just going to see Eliza.<eos> I assume you are familiar with Ryan Hardy.<eos> I can deliver him to you.<eos> What is that worth?<eos> Someone has my laptop.<eos> They're using it to watch Max.
Once the feds found my hack, they brought down the iron curtain.<eos> I haven't found a way to pierce it.<eos> Wait.<eos> I thought you were a genius hacker.<eos> I am, and you're only alive because your spy might just be what I need to hack back in.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> You just said you couldn't hack the FBI, so how are you gonna find this guy?<eos> Did your friend check to see if the laptop was the only computer accessing the web portal?<eos> - No.<eos> - If he's smart, he wouldn't bring it back to his house.
I'm disappointed.<eos> Won't last long.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Your friends aren't coming, but mine are.<eos> Where do I find Eliza?<eos> Forget it.<eos> I'm not helping you.<eos> I'm positive you're supposed to call her after I'm dead, which means her number's in your phone.<eos> It's highly encrypted.<eos> There's no way you'll be able to hack it.
Well, I found out what Foster and his partner were after.<eos> A raw diamond?<eos> This case does have its roots in South Africa.<eos> And not just South Africa.<eos> The bloody Boer War.<eos> This could be war booty.<eos> However it came to be, if Archibald Brooks came into possession of this diamond, swapping identities with Douglas would provide him with the opportunity to flee with it.<eos> And how did Foster and his partner find out about it?<eos> Well, sir, perhaps the diamond was hidden by all three of them.<eos> They made a pact to retrieve it together.

I had enough money for a week, but...<eos> I hadn't gone five blocks when I remembered that I'd left the money in the apartment.<eos> - So you went back.<eos> - Yes, and Archie was gone.<eos> I was relieved.<eos> And then I saw the blood.<eos> And then I saw the gun.<eos> Ah, the gun!<eos> I didn't want to leave her without any kind of protection.<eos> I... I kept it at the back of the kitchen drawer.

I kept it at the back of the kitchen drawer.<eos> But that's not where you found it.<eos> It was on the table.<eos> I picked it up.
Sirs, I've identified the man in the photo.<eos> His name is Joseph Pringle.<eos> He was discharged - the same day as Foster.<eos> - Do we have an address?<eos> Just an old one in Kingston, sir.<eos> Nothing in Toronto.<eos> Henry, we need to find this man.<eos> We have to be able to place him at the scene.<eos> Sir.<eos> Murdoch, Edna Brooks said the barrel of the weapon was still warm when she picked it up.
Simon identified it.<eos> - George?<eos> - You alright, George?<eos> Sir... this is Simon's scarf.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I gave it to him.<eos> (Murdoch, echoing): What do you remember, Simon?<eos> (echoing):<eos> He, uh... he was wearing a scarf.<eos> (echoing): Whoever was wearing it likely killed your father.
I redid your shitty motion to dismiss on Colter.<eos> My shitty motion?<eos> Yeah, your precedents might as well have been<eos> Flintstone v. Rubble.<eos> Listen to me, The Flintstones is an iconic classic that clearly conveys the fact--<eos> - That you're old?<eos> - Hey, you're the one who came up with the reference.<eos> Which conveys the fact that I'm smart.<eos> Wow, somebody took their confidence booster shot - this morning. - Actually, I took it last night.<eos> And by took it,
Oh, you are my hero.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I mean, who says that men can't cook?<eos> I think Georgio's does.<eos> - That's a fair point. - Mm-hmm.<eos> So how was your test?<eos> Mmm...<eos> Whoa, it was that bad? You studied like crazy.<eos> No, it's not that it was that bad.<eos> I just... I didn't take it.
Now, where would be the perfect place to...<eos> Good morning, Louis.<eos> Holy shit. You just scared the shit out of me.<eos> What are you doing here so early?<eos> It's 8:15.<eos> Well, yeah, but we worked late last night, and I told you to take the morning.<eos> Louis, it's day two, I'm not taking anything.<eos> Oh, shoot.<eos> I get it.<eos> You came in early because you bought me an expensive gift and you wanted to surprise me by putting it on my desk.
Wow!<eos> Lena Dunham changed everything!<eos> Listen, which one of you is sleeping with the model?<eos> I know one of you said you were, but I don't listen when you talk.<eos> [muffled] She is.<eos> This is a massive ad campaign, and I don't know how else to say this, but I need his penis to look bigger.<eos> Oh!<eos> Yeah...<eos> It gets nervous when you shine a light on it.<eos> Sometimes I hear her coaxing it out of its crawl space with treats.
I'm just w- are you deaf?<eos> ! I said get out of here, bitch!<eos> He was already on 50 milligrams of thorazine.<eos> Perhaps he did see something before he revived.<eos> Well, if he did, he really didn't want to talk about it.<eos> Can i get a black tea, please?<eos> Uh, coffee for me and black tea for her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, maybe he did have a near-death experience, But it wasn't a very pleasant one.<eos> Maybe he didn't want to discuss it.
Yeah?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Gun.<eos> Same make and caliber as the murder weapon.<eos> Lisa could have used it to shoot her husband.<eos> At the very least, reasonable doubt.<eos> George Reed isn't in the clear yet.<eos> Not until we have a ballistics report that can definitively tie that gun to the murder.<eos> We can't bag it and send it off for independent testing.
What I had to.<eos> You're gonna win this race, Mel.<eos> And I'm gonna be right by your side when you do.<eos> We got the ballistics report back.<eos> And?<eos> And the gun we found at Lisa Hoffman's house matches the weapon that shot her husband 15 years ago.<eos> Dad, this is great news.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.<eos> My people found the gun in a file box in Lisa Hoffman's basement.<eos> If she hid it there after shooting her husband, it had been sitting in that basement for 15 years.
Dad, this is great news.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.<eos> My people found the gun in a file box in Lisa Hoffman's basement.<eos> If she hid it there after shooting her husband, it had been sitting in that basement for 15 years.<eos> So, what's your point?<eos> I don't know Delaware as well as you do, Congressman, but I do know that Selbyville is less than 10 Miles from the Atlantic ocean.<eos> It gets hot there in the summers, humid.<eos> There was no air-conditioning in Lisa Hoffman's basement, and there's no rust on this gun.<eos> Those ballistics shouldn't have been a perfect match, but they were, which means the gun wasn't sitting in that basement for 15 years.<eos> Someone kept it.

I understand, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> I understand what my role is supposed to be.<eos> But I was clear with you on the person you were getting when you asked me to take this job.<eos> I am not here to advance my own agenda.<eos> I am not here staring into the oval office imagining myself with my feet up on your desk.<eos> And I am not here to be your lap dog.<eos> The only reason I am here is to help you make real change.<eos> But this bill, it's not about real change.<eos> Have you read it?
I have to get off the ship.<eos> I need you to get me an abortion.<eos> Who else knows about this?<eos> - Who else have you told?<eos> - No one.<eos> If the admiral finds out that I'm pregnant, that there's actual physical proof...<eos> You have to help me.<eos> I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't tell you that if you could just wait a few weeks - before you have the procedure...<eos> - Weeks?<eos> At eight weeks, we can test the DNA and use it against him in court.
Olivia, listen to me.<eos> - Goodbye, dad.<eos> - Olivia.<eos> Olivia!<eos> Why are you working with Rowan?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Those bodies in the morgue.<eos> I know your work.<eos> I'd know it anywhere.
We can use it to magnify the electrical charge.<eos> Stop looking confused!<eos> Look happy!<eos> Winning is all about looking happier than the other guy.<eos> Always walk briskly.<eos> Makes you a moving target.<eos> Oh, that's for Lofty.<eos> Lofty!<eos> And talk with confidence, even if you're terrified.<eos> Act as if you know their plan, and sometimes, if you're very lucky, they'll actually tell you it.
We have to assume that the FBI communications have been compromised.<eos> So... So what then?<eos> It's just me and you with no tactical support, nothing?<eos> I don't see any other way.<eos> Yes, Mom.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm working.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you have your hearing aid in?<eos> I told you I'm not gonna talk to you unless you wear it.
I'm sorry.<eos> Get up, get up.<eos> Hey, Carl.<eos> Agent Hardy.<eos> Need a couple of battery packs.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Equipment, agent Hammond.<eos> Hi.<eos> This is agent Williams.<eos> I just got a notification that I never returned my vehicle tracker, but I definitely gave it to you last week.
Yes, we're dating.<eos> So no side projects from now on, okay?<eos> Sure.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Oh, uh, nothing.<eos> I have to stop by my sister's apartment on the way to work.<eos> Meet Cindy Reynolds.<eos> She's an SVR asset working for the New York Stock Exchange.<eos> We're making it look like she's receiving secret orders from Moscow to arrange a drop for the operative who's gonna carry out Black Dagger.<eos> Now I embed the file into a jpeg and plant it in the dot over the I in "Cindy" like so.
Everything.<eos> You've seen the operative who's running Black Dagger in person?<eos> I saw him kill two men in Rome.<eos> I have a picture of him from there.<eos> And rather than tell me or Sam or anyone, you pursue it on your own.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> There's a mole, I think, in the task force.<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> I planted a file about the operative on the FBI server so the techs would discover that he's here.<eos> They missed it, so I went to Brock.

Uh, kind of.<eos> Like, we watched "Cat People" the other night.<eos> You could see about half a boob, which we...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> The coax.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - 10BROAD36.<eos> We can use Ethernet encoding.<eos> Plus... plus, the cable's already hidden along the walls.<eos> We can just adjust it where we need to.
Tell Charlotte to find another way. - Can't.<eos> - What do you mean you can't?<eos> She's dead?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Charlotte sacrificed her life to give us this one shot.<eos> And I honestly believe this is our only shot.<eos> - Nathan, when I was outside the shroud, I had a-a... a vision. - Okay...<eos> - It was the future and Haven was hell on Earth.<eos> Way worse than this and it was all because you went into the Void and didn't come back.<eos> I came here to prevent the apocalypse, not help you start it.
Even if we forget that sometimes.<eos> - Audrey!<eos> - Nathan?<eos> Lisa, Nathan's coming.<eos> We're gonna end the Troubles, I promise.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Things are gonna get better for you.<eos> I want you to tell your little brother he's got one hell of an arm.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Hailie, you have to keep it open.
Do you seek to make the dead speak like a necromancer?<eos> Someday, science will make the dead reveal all their secrets.<eos> For now, I am merely lifting the edge of the curtain.<eos> I'll give you a peek of what I've found, if you're not afraid.<eos> You feel this?<eos> The ridges on the stump of the tongue.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> His tongue was not cut out.<eos> He bit it off himself.
- My dad passed away.<eos> I dedicate this wing in his honor.<eos> I just woke up one morning with such a strong feeling that I needed to share Grey house with the world again.<eos> So George and I are reopening the bed and breakfast.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I didn't see you there.<eos> Oh, I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> Are you lost?<eos> I'm looking for Grey house.<eos> Well, you found it.
pushing someone away before they have a chance to push you away, when what she really wants to do is be your friend<eos> Mom, you just don't get it.<eos> It's been a long time since you were in high school.<eos> True, true.<eos> But with age comes wisdom.<eos> For you.<eos> A compass?<eos> That was Dad's.<eos> - From when he was a Scout.<eos> I just happened to find it in some boxes at the store today.
I mean, you were completely exposed. I could have pulled back, but I didn't. Instead, I chose to light you the fuck up.<eos> I make no apologies about it. It's the type of player I was back then.<eos> I'm well aware of that.<eos> It's football.<eos> Players are aware of the risks.<eos> What if it was you that got laid out?<eos> Would you want a handshake, a "no hard feelings"?<eos> Some show of respect?<eos> Dan, I didn't have that in me back then.<eos> I took that hit, I put it in a box and I buried that motherfucker.
Have you come across the term yet?<eos> No.<eos> You eat outdoors among the flies and rodents.<eos> Alak was very young, and insisted we try it.<eos> I confess it was fun, in a dirty way.<eos> Until we encountered a hellbug skitterling.<eos> Alak thought it was cute and wanted to play with it.<eos> But I grabbed him in my arms and I ran.<eos> My husband tackled the beast.<eos> Killed it with his charge blade.
20 minutes ago, he made the same argument you just made.<eos> All our intelligence assessments are unanimous that Juliet is the last of the coup conspirators.<eos> There's strong evidence that she's still conspiring with opposition elements in Iran, which means she arguably poses a clear and present danger to American lives.<eos> We have a real shot at taking her out.<eos> We're going to take it.<eos> I know there could be blowback, but this is about national security.<eos> President Shiraz will be here to sign the nuclear treaty in two days.<eos> I'd like to put this behind us before I stand next to him in the East Room.<eos> In that case, you'll need me to pave the way with Algeria.<eos> You send in a drone without their blessing, they'll probably shoot it down.
What?<eos> ! Your wife?<eos> !<eos> It was my sous-chef!<eos> Oh, god!<eos> Come back with that penis!<eos> Okay.<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> Okay, Rory.<eos> Hand it over.
I know you helped her steal that drive back, and I know that this charade of an event is your alibi.<eos> Plausible deniability while Emily does her dirty work.<eos> Oh, wow, you're good, except for those pesky details.<eos> Oh, don't stand there and play dumb.<eos> You are kicking Victoria while she's down.<eos> What do you think that will do to her?<eos> Why don't you just be a man and admit to what you've done?<eos> Louise, you're in over your head, and you picked the wrong side.<eos> Oh, um, and while you were trying to record a confession on your phone right now,<eos> I was running an app that reset it to factory settings.
My story.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Everything changed.<eos> Yes, everything but you.<eos> Which I suppose is just now starting to become apparent, standing there alone on the tarmac, realizing that while you hid behind your mission of revenge, everyone else around you evolved.<eos> Did you really think they'd wait forever, sacrificing everything and getting nothing in return?<eos> Did you honestly believe that you'd get your "happily ever after"<eos> after so many lies to so many different people...<eos> Until all you had left were enemies?<eos> Like the little pyromaniac that you are, you started a fire and convinced yourself that you could contain it.
It does not attack.<eos> It defends.<eos> It requires skill, not strength, to turn your opponent's aggression against him.<eos> That is how a woman can defeat a man twice her size.<eos> - Miss Crain, congratulations.<eos> - Thanks, Doni.<eos> You can call me Juliana, you know.<eos> Your necklace, it's very lovely.<eos> Thanks.<eos> My boyfriend made it.
Please, Caroline.<eos> I don't want your help, Stefan.<eos> I just want you to die.<eos> Your heart's racing again, Stefan.<eos> Let me fix that.<eos> Caroline, please stop.<eos> Ok.<eos> Needle and thread as requested.<eos> Do I want to know why you suddenly decided to take up sewing?<eos> Heh. Well, Caroline and I spent the entire day digging in the woods to find a Teddy bear, and now she wants to repair it.
You need to know that if this has to be it for us.<eos> No.<eos> You're not dying, not after everything.<eos> You're not dying, Tyler.<eos> It's a full moon.<eos> If you turn, it will heal you.<eos> You have to.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not triggering it.<eos> You once told me that I gave you a second chance, and you promised me that you wouldn't waste it.
This the room?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where's the elliptical?<eos> And the Bowflex?<eos> Find what's missing, Gunny.<eos> Drill bits weren't for woodworking.<eos> You own a safe?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bolted to the closet floor-- why?<eos> She was trying to crack it.
And you do the same.<eos> Sure.<eos> We'll talk in your a.m.<eos> Delilah, I'll call you in a few minutes so that we can...<eos> My feelings aren't easily hurt, but I don't think he knew who I was.<eos> Or maybe he did, and that's why he left in such a hurry.<eos> Find out.<eos> I told you to scrub your profile.<eos> FBI sends weekly reminders to service members.<eos> I use it for work.
I killed a pig.<eos> Well, Barbie and Eva are out looking for food, but Junior could use you on his dorm-building team. I'll show you.<eos> Do you mind waiting here for me?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Come on.<eos> What are you doing with that?<eos> It... looks like my voice recorder.<eos> I was a reporter.<eos> Carried it everywhere.

There is a way in, okay?<eos> I know.<eos> I've been through it before.<eos> That's a long shot that it's still standing, but for anyone that's alive out there, it's the only shot that they have.<eos> That might not be a good idea.<eos> - Eva, where's the key?<eos> - What key?<eos> The key for the hatch.<eos> I thought you had it.<eos> - No, I stuck it right here.
The man I love should see right through that.<eos> Don't turn away from us, from what we have.<eos> What we had is in the past.<eos> It should still matter to you.<eos> Look, what I have now with Eva there's no more tension, no more drama.<eos> We can just be.<eos> But do you really... love her?<eos> Hey. What are you doing out here?<eos> Well, I... thought I saw a deer.<eos> Too bad you didn't shoot it.

What do you want?<eos> I just want to see you.<eos> You have been right all along.<eos> There is something wrong with me.<eos> Eva's really messing with my head.<eos> Meet me out by the Soderquist farm.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> I'll be there in an hour.<eos> Your gun!<eos> Toss it in the woods.
I can make him work faster.<eos> No.<eos> No violence.<eos> He's too valuable.<eos> I'll handle him.<eos> - Have you seen Junior?<eos> - I haven't.<eos> But anything you need, I can take care of.<eos> Joe will need our last remaining amethyst to continue his work.<eos> I'll find a way to get it up to him safely.
We're so close.<eos> We just need a fresh sample of the most recent viral strain.<eos> There's some more lab equipment outside.<eos> Can you go bring it in, please?<eos> Dr. Bloom's enthusiasm is misplaced, s I think you know.<eos> Synthesizing a new formula will take months.<eos> And by that time, the virus will have mutated again.<eos> Aluminum phosphide?<eos> It's a grain fumigant.<eos> I brought it in with us to help preserve the cattle feed.
What's the matter?<eos> Something's wrong with the dome, Joe.<eos> I know.<eos> It's calcifying.<eos> Christine said we only have a day before the air supply is cut off.<eos> Are we gonna die?<eos> I will get the dome down before then.<eos> I promise.<eos> How?<eos> The transmitter from the radio station, I can use it to amplify the tones for the device.
I wasn't an angel either.<eos> I was in a gang...<eos> - I know.<eos> - And I had a record...<eos> A long one.<eos> But I turned it all around the day Keon was born.<eos> Everything changed for me.<eos> I wanted to do better for him.<eos> But a dad with a rap sheet doesn't play well in court.<eos> I tried to get full custody of him, but they like to give it to the mom.
We gonna start our own company.<eos> ANDRE: It'll never work, Mom.<eos> The business has changed completely since you and Dad started out.<eos> This could work.<eos> We just need a dope name.<eos> We've got Hakeem.<eos> All he has to do is record one more song for his album.<eos> Empire will never let us have that album.<eos> You heard Jamal.<eos> He's going to bury it.
Yeah. I wrote this for you.<eos> I did.<eos> Come on home to Empire.<eos> We'll do more stuff together.<eos> That's what I miss.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> But I ain't coming back to Empire.<eos> What about your album?<eos> What about it?<eos> I put it out.
- Look, just don't ruin it by being you.<eos> - I don't even care at this point though, 'cause I got - something better now.<eos> - What?<eos> My album, that's what.<eos> This song that I just did... it killed.<eos> And it was equal parts Cookie and Lucious.<eos> So that's what my album is gonna be.<eos> Both of y'all, together.<eos> Lucious, Cookie...<eos> Might call it The Black and White Album. Who knows?

This was not a smart move at all.<eos> All right, where were we?<eos> Uh, you were asking my client for $28 million.<eos> Which I said wasn't an offer.<eos> It was a punch line.<eos> Your contention is that the market for your movie In Brain was strangled - by the downloads of said film. - The illegal downloads.<eos> Uh, you are aware that In Brain, uh, was released on, uh, Wharf Master on February 3 of this year?<eos> I am, two days before it opened in theaters.<eos> - That's why I'm suing you.<eos> - And do you know who uploaded it?
Not "we," you can't go anywhere near that crime scene, Alex.<eos> You have to go about your daily routines and just act normal, okay?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Sam, he... he knows something's wrong, that I lied, I can feel it.<eos> Alex, until we know who this mole is, you have to try to stay strong and...<eos> Hope I'm not arrested.<eos> Yes.<eos> Listen, why don't you go back to the hotel and try to get some sleep, okay?<eos> A quantum implant?<eos> How the hell did you get it on the computer?
I think you'd be safer going back home.<eos> Sam agreed to put an FBI detail on the house.<eos> (Alex) the SVR would never try anything in front of the FBI.<eos> Sarah would be safe there.<eos> (Sarah) [sighs] where is it?<eos> I've looked everywhere.<eos> Where did she put it?<eos> (Natalie) what are you doing?<eos> Looking for my tablet.<eos> Mom confiscated it until my next report card.
- What makes you think she's the one?<eos> - She's the right age, she fits the description, she's never been married, and she was living well above her means until precisely ten months ago, when she had to downsize.<eos> She moved to an apartment, she put up her house for sale.<eos> Huh? Well, let's go have a chat.<eos> Cora Gilliam. FBI.<eos> Open the door.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Gun!<eos> Keep your hands away from the weapon.<eos> The gun's registered to me. I'm allowed to carry it.

I'm allowed to carry it.<eos> Carrying it's not the problem.<eos> Pointing it at FBI agents is the problem.
That she was his half sister?<eos> Sit down, Mom.<eos> We have something to celebrate.<eos> Thanks, baby girl. You're the best.<eos> Garcia says that Marc Clifford grew up by the name of Marc Powers.<eos> - That's why he was so hard to find.<eos> - Rockville P.D. Say there's no sign of Cora or anybody else at her apartment. Maybe she's on the run.<eos> Or Marc's already gotten to her.<eos> This house brings back memories.<eos> It's too bad you have to sell it.
She's been through a lot recently, so we totally understand.<eos> She wasn't the easiest to deal with before he went overseas, and things just got worse when Connor got sick.<eos> Just attitude... staying out late and...<eos> You know, I can tell that she's upset, but she doesn't want to talk about it.<eos> The last time that we went to visit him in the hospital and she could see he was getting better, he hugged her.<eos> I don't think I'd seen her cry since she was ten.<eos> Well, he's only been gone a few hours, and we are using all of our resources to find him.<eos> Absolutely, and please, if he contacts you, let us know.<eos> Uh, we also need Connor's computer.<eos> I'll go get it.
Whew! I'm beginning to think that some clients aren't worth the 20 feet in the cold.<eos> Maybe it's time to un-nail that basement door, huh?<eos> That's the sex blanket.<eos> I have asked you not to call it that.
- More coffee.<eos> - ...and the Man of Steel?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Sorry about that, sir.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> A female hero.<eos> Nice for my daughter to have someone like that to look up to.<eos> Yeah, real nice.<eos> What happened with the plane, Vartox?<eos> You were ordered to bring it down.
Where... Where am I?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Name is Hank Henshaw.<eos> And I believe you already know Agent Danvers.<eos> She doesn't need those.<eos> Welcome to the DEO, the Department of Extranormal Operations.<eos> The DEO monitors and protects Earth from extraterrestrial presence and/or invasion.<eos> That means you.<eos> Your ship.<eos> We keep it here as a reminder of the day you crashed on Earth.
You just talk to me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Do you have any ideas?<eos> No.<eos> You used me.<eos> What?<eos> - That wasn't a think tank exercise.<eos> You were trying to find a wedge issue against gay marriage.<eos> Of course I was.<eos> And I found it.
~ Beep!<eos> ~ Beep!<eos> ~ Beep!<eos> What are you?<eos> Roadrunner?<eos> ~ Beep!<eos> ~ Beep!<eos> Erm, hi.<eos> Turns out the colonel has the fridge.<eos> So, good news - you guys didn't steal it.
Ah, sorry, I should explain.<eos> Sometimes the guys like to call me Medal.<eos> ~ Oh, have you got a...<eos> ~ No, not yet.<eos> Nick wrote me up for one, but the committee's probably deciding what "no regard for his own safety" means in medal terms.<eos> Anyway... er...<eos> Wow!<eos> That is, er, a bit tidier than it was before.<eos> Thank you, Simon.<eos> I've left space for the fridge, if some bloody clown owns up to stealing it.
Because he didn't push you.<eos> I extended my tour for you, because I heard that you could be the best team in Afghan.<eos> Potential operator.<eos> Potential chief bleep.<eos> Potential Army 100.<eos> Special Forces.<eos> Very tidy.<eos> But in order to do that, you have to work at it, hard.<eos> So can we forget about the stupid fridge?<eos> Nick would've got it back.
Good night, Blake.<eos> I see you there.<eos> I, uh... I-I hate to ask...<eos> Apparently.<eos> (sighs) It's about Secretary Marsh's portrait.<eos> It's being removed to make room for James Madison's, but, uh, no one seems to...<eos> - Want it?<eos> - They don't.<eos> And we can't just...<eos> - Throw it away.

Yes, naturally.<eos> If the man or men or women were here to do arduous work, the hours would have been long.<eos> They would have needed to eat, hydrate and, of course, expel waste.<eos> Toilet seat was up, so I'm guessing at least one person was a "he""<eos> Also we found this in the fridge.<eos> "Doogh."<eos> Carbonated yogurt drink popular in Arab countries.<eos> It's hard to believe bubbling yogurt is popular anywhere.<eos> I figured it didn't belong to the Ayers, so I called the American distributor.<eos> No place on the island sells it.
I can't let you die.<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> Power's surging across the city.<eos> It's coming to the Machine.<eos> Harold, no!<eos> Men have gazed at the stars for millennia and wondered whether there was a deity up there, silently directing their fates.<eos> Today, for the first time, they'll be right.<eos> And the world will be an undeniably better place.<eos> Pity you won't be there to see it.
~ If I see food, I eat it! ~ HE LAUGHS<eos> Well, there's plenty of salady stuff, anyway.<eos> Oh, Angela, read this card that he got for me, it's a scream!<eos> You mind if I charge my phone for an hour, Ange?<eos> ~ Running a bit low.<eos> ~ No, of course not.<eos> Down here, is it?<eos> Oh, no, no, just a minute.<eos> I'll put it in up here, Pat.<eos> "Forget about the past, you can't change it.
Three generations.<eos> Just let me refocus...<eos> Oh... Come on, David Bailey, hurry up!<eos> One, two, three... ~ Wait!<eos> ~ What?<eos> I didn't show Katie the card.<eos> Oh, show her after, Mum!<eos> No, I want to show her now.<eos> Listen to this, Katie.<eos> "Forget about the past, you can't change it."
Fucking hell.<eos> ~ No, please, let me take your shoe.<eos> Sorry about this.<eos> Meant to be lucky, innit?<eos> Or is that just if a bird shits on you?<eos> Yeah, it's just birds I think.<eos> Yes. A mate of mine was going out with this bird, yeah, and she wanted him to lie under a glass coffee table... ~ I'll just take this outside, I won't be a moment.<eos> ~ All right.<eos> ~ What's he doing?<eos> ~ He's pulled it off.
Six, five, four, three, two, one.<eos> Trajectory is good.<eos> Thrust is good.<eos> Saviour is in the air.<eos> Repeat, Saviour is in the air.<eos> - Jude, you hold on so tight!<eos> - Because you're a terrible driver!<eos> It's the Saviour launch.<eos> I forgot all about it.<eos> We missed it.
Are you OK?<eos> You have to get me out of here.<eos> Why am I even on a military base?<eos> The President imposed a state of emergency.<eos> The judicial process has been suspended in favour of military tribunals.<eos> - Your chances of getting a fair trial are zero.<eos> - I have rights!<eos> No, Rhonda, you don't have any rights whatsoever.<eos> The State will seek the death penalty for you.<eos> And what's more, they'll probably get it.
...fine?<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I checked the Navy Locator.<eos> There's no listing for a Petty Officer Daniel Harvey anywhere in the Navy's record.<eos> Someone needs to tell him that.<eos> Abby examined the I.D.<eos> If it's a forgery, it's a really good one.<eos> And no hits on his prints.<eos> Vehicle's legit-- it's registered to the Department of Defense's motor pool.<eos> Who checked it out?
We're not "nobody."<eos> Yeah, thank God I'm out of that car.<eos> You two have the worst taste in music I've heard in my life.<eos> Ah! You found the pimp.<eos> Pimp by night.<eos> Tattoo artist by day.<eos> The purse?<eos> In his trunk.<eos> There was a DNA tube sewn in to the lining.<eos> I'm running it down to Abby now.
Hi, Gibbs.<eos> Hi, Vance.<eos> Hi, other people pushing buttons and stuff.<eos> Abbs, what do you got?<eos> A keystroke logger, Gibbs.<eos> McGee found it embedded on Orlando's laptop.<eos> Someone has been spying on him for weeks.<eos> Good work, but Orlando's no longer our target.<eos> Well, who was on the other side of that bug?<eos> Um, I traced it back to a State Department IP address.
So afraid.<eos> And yet, they have no idea... just how powerful their fear can be.<eos> But I know.<eos> And I want more.<eos> Ah. It's the lab report.<eos> So that red substance is mercury sulfide.<eos> Commonly known as cinnabar.<eos> Cinnabar.<eos> Cinnabar used to be used as a pigment in supernatural artifacts.<eos> The hides of certain demons are believed to contain high levels of it.
No, that'll be all.<eos> Lawrence give you a name?<eos> An alias.<eos> I need your advice on how to deal with this.<eos> It's not enough to hit back.<eos> Got to put your enemy in the ground.<eos> Whose name was on the account?<eos> It was yours, Link.<eos> Oh. Oh, man.<eos> You could take my title, but you can't hold on to it.
Hold your daughter tight, because a new day is dawning.<eos> And those who impede progress... the disruptive, the aberrant... will be systematically purged from our society.<eos> There will be no mercy, no stay of execution.<eos> For some, this will be the end.<eos> But for others, a rebirth.<eos> A second chance to live the life that they were designed for.<eos> Every life given a purpose.<eos> Samaritan will build a new world.<eos> A better world.<eos> Too bad you won't live to see it.
Are you kidding?<eos> Uh, they checked out.<eos> And they're not answering their cell phones?<eos> "A moon, worn as if it had been a shell,"<eos> Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell about the stars... and broke in days and years.<eos> I had a thought for no one's but your ears: "that you were beautiful and that I strove to love..."<eos> Wow, uh, your pinky nail's really out of control.<eos> Seriously, it looks like you're a coke dealer from a bad '80s movie.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna leave it.

I found PJ's phone, and it says Pernell was his last call.<eos> And do you want to know what PJ did right before that?<eos> Get out of here right now, Jocelyn.<eos> He watched this promo video 23 times...<eos> - Rudy!<eos> - Over and over again, and then he shot himself.<eos> - Juan!<eos> - Why?<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Then watch it.
He what?<eos> How?<eos> I guess I told him.<eos> Come on, man, let me get this line straight, bro.<eos> We're gonna need to pour some concrete on the back of your head.<eos> Thought you weren't going to work today.<eos> I didn't.<eos> - But you needed your briefcase?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Open it.
Great.<eos> And if we find something?<eos> In the event there's an explosive device, the bomb squad will talk you through it.<eos> We need to find his luggage.<eos> - I'll go with you.<eos> I need you and Farrah upstairs keeping things calm.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> That a gentleman had too much to drink, but I'm not sure they believed me.<eos> I'll go.<eos> The faster we find it, the safer we'll be.
Dad?<eos> Could I see you for a second?<eos> Anything?<eos> We checked his luggage.<eos> No gun, no device, nothing that speaks to terrorism.<eos> Look, state can confirm the story about the sick mother, but part of Haddad's story checks out.<eos> Turns out that air marshal Ford had a second phone on the flight.<eos> It was his personal cell.<eos> Well, we didn't find a second phone on the body.<eos> Well, if it had evidence on it, it's possible the killer removed it.
Farrah and I are in coach, and Jim is in first class.<eos> Watch for anyone reaching for their phone.<eos> Ford's phone could be in the killer's hands. Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go.<eos> Pinging now.<eos> Over there.<eos> False alarm.<eos> Do you hear anything?<eos> If someone removed the battery or even turned it off, Tory's not gonna be able...
Jim, take her down below.<eos> Make sure she's secure.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just... when I told her Ford was dead, her reaction seemed so real.<eos> Dad, the gun and phone were in her purse.<eos> She's left-handed.<eos> I... no, I know, I know.<eos> Everything fits.<eos> But why buy a pre-paid phone online just to pick it up at the airport store minutes later?

"My screams.<eos> "I could not save you... little ones.<eos> "Such pain.<eos> "And yet, still... still I am not brave enough to die, "to let go of this... wretched life.<eos> "I will endure... "but no more babies."<eos> "I cannot... "will not suffer such heartbreak again."<eos> "From now on, it's me against the world."<eos> Quiet, my friend.<eos> We have a visitor.<eos> I didn't get it, but I will.
It's been very helpful.<eos> I'm helpin' buildin' the case against Andrew.<eos> How's that going?<eos> It's lookin' pretty strong.<eos> Pretty strong?<eos> 'What happened to "We're gonna get the son-of-a-bitch?"'<eos> The manifesto, the van, the electronics at the farm.<eos> I've been thinking about all that.<eos> Why hold onto the van?<eos> Why not ditch it?

'
Did the children like the pigs?<eos> They loved them.<eos> Drewe was as proud as punch showing them off.<eos> Was Mrs Drewe there?<eos> She came just before we left and she enjoyed seeing Marigold, didn't she, Mama?<eos> She was quite overcome.<eos> Yes, I think she was very pleased.<eos> Is that luncheon?<eos> Carson, when Papa offered to decorate the servants' hall, he wasn't really thinking.<eos> If you'd like your reception to be here, we can hold it in the hall, or whichever room you choose.
Another world.<eos> So it seems.<eos> Of course, I was away at the war in the middle of that.<eos> Why are you leaving now?<eos> It seems like the right time for a move.<eos> Does it?<eos> Does it, indeed?<eos> Tell me, Mr Moore, what exactly is an assistant butler?<eos> I'm not familiar with the term.<eos> No, well, we made it up.
You're a rail. I gotta jet anyway.<eos> You know how long it takes<eos> To get from Rosemead to downtown?<eos> Why do we even live here?<eos> Because Rosemead sits on a giant slab of granite, And that's exactly where you Want to be when an earthquake strikes.<eos> Well, it's not where you want to be when you're 18.<eos> Well, why don't you have your boyfriend over here? We can all have dinner.<eos> There's no boy. See you later, Dad.<eos> You think your passengers want breakfast?<eos> I'll have it for dinner. And for one day, try to not think of earthquakes.
I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Hello.<eos> Nora, Mike from Century.<eos> - Are you sitting down?<eos> - No, I'm standing.<eos> There's an offer on your house. 2.7.<eos> - Million?<eos> - Yeah, million.<eos> But we listed it for 600,000.
- That's us done, then?<eos> - No, of course it isn't.<eos> Sit here. Give me your arm.<eos> The last time I needed one of these, Dr Sim just signed the form and sent me off.<eos> No mucking around.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, unlike Dr Sim, I am a big believer in 'mucking around'.<eos> Or 'observing correct medical procedure', as we sometimes call it.<eos> Your notes say you are prescribed bendroflumethiazide for high blood pressure.<eos> Still taking it?
Yeah (! ) Amazing.<eos> Got guests arriving at the end of the week, and nothing is ready.<eos> Are you free to help tomorrow?<eos> Oh, I've kind of agreed to be part of this mock-rescue thing.<eos> We're gonna be on the telly!<eos> Right, well... great.<eos> So, you're seriously saying you're going to stop the one man responsible for that rescue from taking part, because of some stupid certificate?<eos> Really?<eos> Pretty much, yeah.<eos> Well, the doc said I could pick it up tomorrow, so fuss about nothing.
You have my word.<eos> Trust me.<eos> - Morwenna, I need --<eos> - What happened to your face?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I need you to --<eos> - Have you been drinking?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Will you listen to me?<eos> Get Mr Baker's urine test from the fridge and check it for protein and sugar levels.
I like you, man.<eos> I trust you.<eos> You got the job.<eos> You scared me.<eos> I don't remember any of it.<eos> Nothing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> (Mills) A restaurant in North Carolina.<eos> (Elise) Our grandfather left us this restaurant in his will.<eos> What if we take a crack at opening it?
That we've had since the '40s.<eos> No fuel, no flame, no combustion.<eos> A simple electromagnetic field.<eos> Technology kept secret for 70 years while the world ran on petroleum.<eos> - Oil companies making trillions.<eos> - What I'm gonna show you next is the most unbelievable part.<eos> Gravity warp drive... but how?<eos> Element 115.<eos> Ununpentium.<eos> Where did you get it?
How old is he?<eos> He's supposed to be 28, but he's going on 14.<eos> [chuckles] Well, he'll grow out of it.<eos> I want to see my family.<eos> You're gonna see them again.<eos> Hey. Any news on Severide?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> What is it?<eos> The shrapnel between his ribs.<eos> I can't... I can't get the angle to grip it.
- Has anybody seen my laptop?<eos> - Are you sure it was in there, Mom?<eos> Yes, Tom.<eos> I was writing here this morning.<eos> And this is everything?<eos> This was everything in the hallway?<eos> Mom, Mom, calm down.<eos> My book was on it and I don't have a backup.<eos> You didn't email it to yourself?<eos> That motherfucker took it.
- Whoa, hold on.<eos> Do not park your vehicle here.<eos> There's a table up the road for volunteers.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You woke up down there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I came up that embankment.<eos> That's when I saw the car.<eos> You should get down there.<eos> If someone else finds your phone, you can say you just lost it today.
A palm print?<eos> Stop that!<eos> No, stop!<eos> God, these fucking animals.<eos> Okay, we'll get 'em out of here.<eos> No, let them.<eos> It's just water.<eos> Any luck?<eos> No.<eos> If the phone turns up, I'll just say I dropped it today, you know, like you said.
She okay?<eos> Getting better all the time.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Is that your son?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We-we have to get in.<eos> Get his wristband, son.<eos> Careful, don't rip it.<eos> I can't get it off.
Gracias.<eos> - [beeps] - Hey!<eos> - Nora Durst?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hello, my name is Dr. Joaquin Cuarto.<eos> May I speak to you for a few minutes?<eos> About what?<eos> Um, may I ask when you moved into this house?<eos> What?<eos> Um, the records say you purchased it on the 21st.
We're not supposed to say.<eos> - We signed a...<eos> - nondisclosure agreement.<eos> What are y'all wearing tonight?<eos> To the fundraiser.<eos> I'm wearing whatever I want.<eos> Okay, well, then I'll see you tonight.<eos> Emily, you smell like alcohol.<eos> Woman: Order up.<eos> Hey, you found it.
Just shut up!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Why do you keep following me?<eos> If you want me to do something, just fucking say it.<eos> I'm glad you finally asked, Kevin.<eos> There is something you need to do.<eos> In Cairo, Egypt, there is an ancient artifact.<eos> It's in a museum now.<eos> They found it in the tomb of Amenhotep.

I want to destroy families.<eos> The other day I was in Northboro, Iowa, and I met a young man.<eos> I was working my way through the crowd shaking hands and I see this fellow and he's waiting for me and he has a baby in his arms.<eos> And I'm thinking to myself,<eos> "Shit, now I'm gonna have to kiss that thing because that's what one must endure if you want to get elected."<eos> So I pucker up and you know what that young man does?<eos> He hands me the baby and he just walks away.<eos> He gave me his child and he disappeared.<eos> Police couldn't find him.<eos> No wife or mother stepped forward to claim it.
If I wanted a fucking family, I'd move to Texas.<eos> What?<eos> Texas.<eos> They moved there, my dad and my sister.<eos> Where in Texas?<eos> Miracle.<eos> Jarden.<eos> What?<eos> The town is Jarden.<eos> Miracle is the national park that surrounds and protects it from those who would corrupt its exceptional properties.

No, but there's always a first time.<eos> You game?<eos> What's in there?<eos> The possessed.<eos> Human body wasn't built for occupation.<eos> Some angels can't bear its limits.<eos> They go mad.<eos> And we keep them in here.<eos> It's an asylum... and a prison for those who break our laws.<eos> So, a few days ago, an angel went mad and stole a key from me, took it in there.

How are they?<eos> Resting.<eos> Has he called?<eos> Not yet.<eos> That doesn't have to stop us from getting started.<eos> Chris.<eos> What is it?<eos> I need you to go to the mall and buy another Jean jacket.<eos> Why?<eos> We're going to use it for the missing flyers to show what Meg was last seen in.
Did you miss me?<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I told you, this is for a case I'm working on.<eos> Right.<eos> The one that gives you nightmares and keeps you up all hours?<eos> What is this case about?<eos> You've been jotting down all kind of strange stuff in your notebook.<eos> You're not supposed to go through that.<eos> - Then don't leave it lying around!
- It would not.<eos> - There you are, we're agreeing.<eos> Mrs Hughes, doesn't Carson deserve a wedding in this house?<eos> Where he has served this family for so long and with such loyalty.<eos> And will continue to do so while there is breath in his body.<eos> Well, then.<eos> But this is our day, My Lady.<eos> It's about Charles Carson and Elsie Hughes.<eos> And not about this glorious house or the glorious people who have lived in it.<eos> Just us, and that's the way I'd like to celebrate it.
Previously on Dominion...<eos> You can bring back a souvenir, the head of Claire Riesen.<eos> The only thing that spared your life is your service to this city.<eos> You think you're gonna get away with this?<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> Gates, I need you to find someone for me.<eos> Zoe Holloway.<eos> She's a V-1, wants to overthrow my government.<eos> Give me an hour, and I'll see what I can do.<eos> A few days ago an angel stole a key from me, and I'd like you to bring it to me.
I'm starting to think that maybe it's the way it should be.<eos> David?<eos> David?<eos> I want Vega on lockdown, the whole city on high alert, every guard armed and ready for when David comes for us.<eos> Nice try.<eos> Any last words?<eos> - Get in.<eos> - What?<eos> I built this city when you were in diapers.<eos> You want to bring it down, I'm the guy who knows how.
In case whoever Rebecca texted tries to find me.<eos> Why would they want to find you?<eos> So they can find out what happened to Rebecca.<eos> What do you mean "what happened to Rebecca"?<eos> We... we taped her up and held her hostage.<eos> - What's going on, Frank?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Relax.<eos> I already got your number unlisted.<eos> You change it now, and the police ever learn Rebecca's M.I.A., it'll look suspicious you changed it the same time.
- Because the party will destroy you.<eos> Or the party will hurt the governorship.<eos> We all benefit from a filibuster proof of majority.<eos> You know that, Eli.<eos> Hal, can you come in here, please?<eos> I have another meeting, so, Mrs. Florrick, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand and open your purse.<eos> - What? - Mrs. Florrick has a way of recording<eos> - her meetings.<eos> - Are you frisking us?<eos> We'll hold on to your cell phone and get it back to you in 12 hours.
See if there's anything you wanted.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, the baseball,<eos> The kyle seager foul that he caught.<eos> Yeah, in his popcorn box. Remember that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He saw himself up on the big screen, And he gave that... Big will smile.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's still on his dresser.<eos> I'll bring it to you.
I know how much this means to you, but ask yourself, what would you want if you were in Ethan's shoes and these were your thoughts and your most private moments?<eos> I would want the research to move forward.<eos> You're the most private person I know.<eos> You've hardly told anyone about your cancer.<eos> I didn't even know you had a sister.<eos> Does she know you're sick?<eos> Who I choose to tell about my health, or not tell, is not getting in the way of our research.<eos> So you do believe we all deserve to choose what's known about us.<eos> What about what we leave behind... And what we take to the grave?<eos> Ethan couldn't make that choice, so now you need to make it for him.
Sometimes I just can't.<eos> I use techniques to read people.<eos> When the power isn't in me, I just... I-I-I tell people what they want to hear.<eos> Are you saying you fake it?<eos> I'm saying that I've got so good at these techniques, I'm not certain what's real and what isn't anymore.<eos> Aren't I the last person you should be confessing that to?<eos> You're a highly respected doctor moonlighting as an investigator into the afterlife.<eos> You of all people should appreciate the sanctity of a secret that can ruin a career.<eos> Another round.<eos> Once we see what we're dealing with, I'll remove the faulty valve, and then I'll replace it with a new one.
That's what we're trying to find out. Which is why we should get your DNA.<eos> My DNA?<eos> What do you need my DNA for? There was a fight, and whomever was struggling with Kyle left his blood.<eos> We also would like your cell.<eos> So if you would just sign this consent form...<eos> Come here. Open your mouth. Come on.<eos> Open up. Open up. And we are still trying to find Kyle's cellphone.<eos> You know what, you obviously don't understand how hard this is for me, so... I... I think it's time for Peaches to come back.<eos> Since you've admitted to being at the crime scene, we'll just get a warrant.<eos> Buzz: Kyle had a burner phone. And we may never find it, but we do have his number because Grey's cell has lots of graphic texts back and forth with our victim.
Any other day, I'd be happy to help you, Mum.<eos> But Dad's disappointed in me. So...<eos> Well, he's not the only one.<eos> I'll be going out tonight.<eos> Just my father and me.<eos> I need you to look the other way.<eos> It's important for me.<eos> - How'd it go with the paps?<eos> - You haven't seen?<eos> My phone was blowing up after Dad's speech, so I shut it off.
Yeah. Where you kept your drugs for weeks.<eos> Yes, thank you, but it's my room and they're my drugs.<eos> Just hold on.<eos> - A gun.<eos> - 'Yeah.<eos> Be careful.<eos> The safety's on, but it's loaded.'<eos> - You kept a loaded gun in my room? - 'Yes.<eos> I did.<eos> Now set it down on the bed and go and check above your fake armoire.'
I'd be so grateful, and my gratitude, sir, could... Raise the dead.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> The last trace of George will be gone before the night is through.<eos> You will have your chance tonight to find out if the Countess is the same witch you fought all those years ago.<eos> When I see her, I will know if it really is her.<eos> You see, she bears my mark, just as I bear hers.<eos> More importantly, I will find where she keeps it.<eos> It?<eos> One unholy object allows her to maintain her obscenely long existence.<eos> Destroy it, you destroy her.
- Oh! Okay.<eos> - Um, I'll get Laura, she'll fix it, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> I just called my husband to give him the good news.<eos> Oh, did you?<eos> What did he say?<eos> It went straight to voice-mail, I forgot his phone was off.<eos> - Bummer.<eos> - But I texted him a picture instead.<eos> As soon as he turns it on, he'll see me with the earrings.
You guys have fun with your clean break.<eos> I'm gonna go to my room, and I guess I'll have to cancel the horse and carriage that I hired to take you to the airport.<eos> May and I are driving.<eos> You are now.<eos> You guys sure you're up for this?<eos> I am ready for this.<eos> I'm single again.<eos> I'm a new man.<eos> I'm leaving the past behind.<eos> I want to get rid of my stuff, but all my stuff is really, really good, and I just can't get rid of it.
Jess, wait!<eos> Yeah, I'm stuck.<eos> Well, we seem to be in a bit of a conundrum.<eos> How do I know this is your box?<eos> Do you have any identification, "Cece"?<eos> Cece's my ex-girlfriend; it's a box of her things.<eos> But I can tell you everything that's in there.<eos> There's some paintings, erotic writings, there's a brassiere.<eos> Why would you have her brassiere?<eos> Well, you know, she left it in my car, and I kept it.
You want to see the basement?<eos> It could be a fitting scene.<eos> He already photographed over 150 hideouts.<eos> Horrible.<eos> It makes me a little uncomfortable.<eos> Don't worry about the mess.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> If you don't mind I'd just like to check it out.<eos> Well...<eos> I'll show it to you.
She said my weight gain is plateauing nicely.<eos> Please, oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please,<eos> - oh please.<eos> - All right!<eos> Yeah!<eos> FYI, tonight, you're going to need to be a little bit less of a cold bitch.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh my God, Gabi, I discovered something huge.<eos> That you don't want to work for Josh anymore?<eos> I was looking through the files you gave me and I found a patent application for his new app that he never signed, but because I found it he can fix it and save millions.
No.<eos> You did all you could do.<eos> You played your part.<eos> Not well enough.<eos> The loss of him, his life...<eos> Is a stain on my soul.<eos> I-I can't bear it.<eos> Father has a plan.<eos> We must trust in that, Gabriel.<eos> His plan is perfection, but they will pervert it.

Get up!<eos> They're on us!<eos> Activity on your 9:00!<eos> Keep going!<eos> Run 'em down!<eos> Sir, Archangel, welcome back to Vega.<eos> Ready?<eos> Aconitum napellus.<eos> A pretty purple flower more commonly known as Monkshood.<eos> The Greeks called it Queen of Poisons.
His wife and children were burned to death.<eos> Shortly after, he started the Niger Delta Renegades in hopes of taking revenge on the Western energy sector.<eos> He began with attacking oil tankers, and when he didn't get results, he bombed the USS Allegiance, killing five sailors.<eos> Hanson's his first victim on American soil.<eos> Our job is to make sure it's his last.<eos> Get me a list of potential targets and any chatter.<eos> Coming from the Renegades-- got it.<eos> Focus on the last six months.<eos> So Ekpo and Turay were in the container,<eos> Hanson opens it, and one of the two Nigerians slits his throat.
Something you won't believe.<eos> Loo, I've been around the world, okay?<eos> Whatever it is, I'll understand.<eos> There is nothing about this I understand.<eos> It's a trans-universal gateway, a punched hole through a weak spot in our dimension.<eos> I created it to unlock the mysteries of the universe.<eos> But it could just as easily be harnessed for terrible destruction!<eos> That's why I shut it down and hid my journals which explain how to operate it.<eos> There's only one journal left.<eos> And you are the only person I can trust to take it.
I mean, fine, I'll just walk back to New Jersey.<eos> Miss?<eos> I... I think I know the car.<eos> Ugh.<eos> That's it.<eos> Thank God one of us has a brain.<eos> - What's your ETA? - I'm almost there.<eos> Okay, well, there's an alley right when you turn right on Front Street, meet me there.<eos> Are you stealing her car?<eos> No, I am borrowing it.
Your mom made me a key.<eos> - Of course, she did.<eos> - Hanna, knock it off.<eos> Knock what off?<eos> I'm not the one who just shows up at someone's door for no reason.<eos> I have a reason.<eos> Sara?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What happened?<eos> I will pay for the bike if-if they can't fix it.
He goes by Rhys.<eos> (Emily) 'Don't sweat it, Ali.<eos> He'll forgive you.'<eos> If it were his brother on the suspect board he would have done the same thing.<eos> I gotta go to the bathroom.<eos> [pop song continues]<eos> [cell phone ringing] [intense music]<eos> [music continues]<eos> ♪ Got a secret ♪<eos> ♪ Can you keep it? ♪

We have civvies up there!<eos> I said stand down!<eos> Don't do this to your sister.<eos> You spent your whole life trying to get back to your family.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> You've been such a bitch to us, but we heard your story.<eos> We understand.<eos> No!<eos> ♪ Got a secret ♪<eos> ♪ Can you keep it?
- Rat.<eos> - If you cooked it, it could feed a family.<eos> It was huge.<eos> I've input the antiviral formula into the quantum computer.<eos> By factoring in Barmal's blood analysis...<eos> How the serum affected her immune system...<eos> The computer may be able to detect why it failed.<eos> And then what?<eos> Maybe Barmal was close.<eos> If she made a small miscalculation in her research, the computer could possibly pick it up and point us to a cure.
Fisher.<eos> He's here.<eos> He got Barmal's serum from Turner.<eos> I'm accessing the elevator shaft now.<eos> - Oh, crap.<eos> - What?<eos> Our security system detected a breach at the lockdown in the elevator shaft.<eos> The system isn't recognizing it's Fisher trying to save our asses.<eos> Damn it, we're locked out of the computer.<eos> Can't we just unplug it?
Maybe just one in the hallway, one in the doorway, and then one at the tub?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we could get some branches.<eos> Yeah, I don't...<eos> I'm not sure that will have the same impact.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Okay, well, just float those in the tub.<eos> That'll still be nice.<eos> And here's my New Age relaxation CD.<eos> A lady having a garage sale forced me to take it.
Yeah, so much for the good old days where you could just look for the glint of a sniper-rifle scope in a nearby window.<eos> What does it do, this virus, to the body?<eos> The CDC's still breaking it down.<eos> But they're saying it attacks the central nervous system.<eos> A victim would start shaking within seconds of infection.<eos> Disorientation, then labored breathing, convulsions.<eos> Incapacitation within moments of contact.<eos> It's quite a remarkable feat of engineering.<eos> In my experience, such accomplishments don't happen overnight.<eos> You're saying they tested it first.
Miss jubal, tell me where he is.<eos> He's scared. Hurt. Had no place to go.<eos> I'm assuming because of reddington.<eos> If I tell you where he is, Do you promise to use that information. Only as a means to find reddington?<eos> You have my word.<eos> Dembe: Elizabeth...<eos> In bethesda, there is a small, second story flat.<eos> In the flat, you will find a desk.<eos> The middle drawer has a false front.<eos> Remove it and you will find a silver case along with a key.
The only true currency accepted everywhere in the world.<eos> Oil.<eos> More than $100 million.<eos> That's enough to finance a war.<eos> One more question.<eos> Who's Anna?<eos> Nice Russian girl.<eos> Any update on the oil tanker?<eos> Yeah, it's not there.<eos> Weather satellite couldn't find it.
Start with Patrick, his sister double-crossed him-- he's got nothing to lose by speaking.<eos> All right.<eos> Might be difficult.<eos> Patrick Berkeley was murdered this morning.<eos> You're gonna have to start with Elia.<eos> Better go deliver the bad news.<eos> Think it's related?<eos> Well, it could be just a prison incident, or it could be more.<eos> What I do know is we got a second shot at finding that oil tanker.<eos> Don't waste it.
Guess I'm not the only one looking for answers.<eos> It's pretty cool, your dad being a hero.<eos> You got it honest.<eos> What you got?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> There's nothing in here to lead us to the oil.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Arkady could be laughing at us right now.<eos> Elia's still not picking up her phone.<eos> So the Berkeleys inherit the family business, they run it into the ground and end up economic sanctions.
Hey... so why don't you tell us what it is that Berkeley told you?<eos> Berkeley said there was a backup GPS system on some ship.<eos> There's a laptop pinging its location.<eos> Where?<eos> His sister's house.<eos> If Arkady has that laptop, he knows where the tanker is.<eos> I'll call Callen and Sam.<eos> Oh, uh... good luck on the inside.<eos> Don't drop that soap!<eos> What if Elia didn't give up the laptop and Arkady couldn't find it before he had to bug off?
Ha.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Shit, yeah.<eos> It's 2015, bitch, and EBT ain't even trying to let me buy smokes anymore.<eos> Never mind.<eos> So what was that all about?<eos> Heather thinks I stole her stereo, suspicious-ass bitch.<eos> - Oh, my God, that's crazy.<eos> - I know.<eos> I just borrowed it.

So, there we have it.<eos> You want a free nurse to take her tiresome old man off your hands.<eos> You're a cruel, little Miss, aren't you?<eos> I'd feel sorry for Larry, if I didn't dislike him so much.<eos> I shall forget you said that, but you should go now.<eos> Much more, and we may feel awkward when we meet.<eos> - Which we are bound to do.<eos> - I think not, Miss Cruikshank.<eos> Not if I see you first.<eos> Er, as you may have gathered, the family will be away for three days next week, so if any of you feel you're owed some time off, perhaps you could take it then.
I've done it.<eos> She's furious with me.<eos> I don't see the point of bringing any of that up now.<eos> - What does it say in the letter?<eos> - Nothing much.<eos> She needs a change of air, and Spratt is bringing a present by way of goodbye.<eos> That's why he rang.<eos> Mr Spratt has arrived, My Lord.<eos> - Oh, show him in.<eos> - Well, that is, he's in the servants' hall with a present for Your Lordship and he doesn't want to bring it up here.
[sighs] I have to admit, we, uh... we may have gotten off on the wrong foot.<eos> Well, you better get on the right one, because if you don't, next time I come back here, it'll be to have a drink with your replacement.<eos> Mm! Oh, and by the way, those little Christian tidbits you keep throwing around...<eos> Yeah?<eos> That shit's gotta stop.<eos> We get it.<eos> You've read the Bible.<eos> No one likes a know-it-all.<eos> Beautiful home, Alden.<eos> My grandfather built it.
Maybe you knew that already.<eos> Sid.<eos> That's exactly what brought you here, isn't it?<eos> All of this... It was for him.<eos> God, I keep rationalizing all the lesser evils, hoping they'll add up to a greater good.<eos> But it's just... It's just bad math.<eos> There's always some variable you didn't account for.<eos> So I'm through.<eos> I'm through trying to predict the future.<eos> I don't know if the world's better off if the test fails, but I do know that if you sabotage it, your life is over.
I'm really looking forward to it, now.<eos> Are you?<eos> No, right...<eos> Can't believe she took back the X-ray machine.<eos> I know.<eos> I was hoping for radioactive balls.<eos> ~ Wait!<eos> Stop it, I'm having that...<eos> ~ I wanted that flag...<eos> Fucking stop pulling it, you bell ends!
I assume you're not doing anything to celebrate tonight.<eos> Anyone over the age of six celebrating a birthday should go to hell.<eos> So since you're free, I need your help moving this old Ms. Pac-Man machine I just bought.<eos> Why are you so obsessed with that game?<eos> Because it's the sexiest video game ever.<eos> She's insatiable, Rosa.<eos> Insatiable.<eos> Insatiab...<eos> Stop saying "insatiable."<eos> Anyway, I bought this old machine from a bar, and I was hoping you'd help me move it.
Well, if you'd met my mother, you'd know the answer would be yes, but, uh, by my nature, I try to avoid introspection.<eos> Well, let's get started.<eos> What can you tell me about your missing time?<eos> Not much.<eos> The last thing I remember, I was driving to my wedding.<eos> A black S.U.V. started chasing me.<eos> Then I was forced off the road.<eos> Two months later, they found me in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.<eos> I had been exposed to dengue fever.<eos> I had a bullet scar with no recollection how I got it, no memory of anything.
I didn't mean "killed" like that.<eos> Well, since you threatened him a few days ago, that makes you our prime suspect.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> I loved Brent, all right?<eos> We're about to drink an '82 Château Gironde in his memory.<eos> I watched your show.<eos> You hated him.<eos> Me and Brent, we-we fought a lot, but he taught me everything I know.<eos> I mean, I went over there last week to help him with his new place.<eos> Or maybe you just thought it was a nice location and wanted it for yourself.
The stupid guy didn't lock the door.<eos> I was hoping to hit the register, but the place is barely set up.<eos> So I went looking for something worth something,<eos> And all of a sudden, he came tearing out the back with a knife.<eos> Mm-hmm, and he came at you?<eos> Yeah, so I took it off him, but he still kept coming, so I stabbed him.<eos> It was, like, self-defense.<eos> And then you took his wallet and cell.<eos> So where's the knife?<eos> I threw it in the East River.
That's right.<eos> But Joseph got scared that something awful was gonna happen and so he tried to back out.<eos> Which is why the shooter showed up last night, to threaten Joseph, to make sure he stuck with the deadline.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where is Joseph now?<eos> I swear to you, I don't know.<eos> He left me a message saying that he's in a safe place, and that he's got to finish what he started.<eos> But no matter how many times I text or call he doesn't answer.<eos> I need your phone.<eos> The officer took it from me when they brought me in.

- Shut the hell up, bitch.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Just confirming, you both asked for your lawyers?<eos> Oh, hell no.<eos> I asked you for my lawyer 20 minutes ago.<eos> Super sorry, but I couldn't find his contact info.<eos> Do you happen to have his number?<eos> - It's in my phone.<eos> - Great.<eos> Can I have it?

Don't speak to me like that!<eos> ~ Robert, this is my son!<eos> ~ But he's under my protection.<eos> David.<eos> You were right.<eos> It's not easy, all this.<eos> Did you speak to Mark?<eos> 'Just follow your instincts, it's what you're good at.'<eos> What did he say about using Louisa's phone?<eos> Collersdale hasn't replied and he probably won't, but they won't block it in case he does.
But just so you know, you're not here as the Attorney General.<eos> He may have told you to come here in some sort of official capacity, but right now, you are no better than some two-bit bus-stop divorce attorney.<eos> Do whatever you want with the computers.<eos> I have nothing to hide.<eos> [ Camera shutter clicking]<eos> Olivia: Where now?<eos> Huck: We lost the trail.<eos> Gavin's cell signal dropped.<eos> - Either it's dead...<eos> - Or he ditched it.
What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, I have every right and full permission to be here.<eos> Victoria Grayson was my own personal guardian angel.<eos> Louise-speak.<eos> Well, let's put that through Google Translate and...<eos> You're here to help clean up after your late vindictive friend and tie up any loose ends in her crazy-ass attempt to frame Emily.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Stop that.<eos> You will not disrespect her memory while standing in her home.<eos> Well, I can't stand in Emily's home because your guardian angel blew it up!
She knew that without a body, remains that could be identified as her own, it wouldn't work.<eos> Sometimes desperation breeds results.<eos> And in this case, the result was an unclaimed body in New Jersey.<eos> Someone who wouldn't be missed.<eos> And with that, Victoria set her plan in motion.<eos> Uhh!<eos> Uhh!<eos> She made it look like I attacked her in a parking garage, made sure there were witnesses who would say as much to the police.<eos> She staged her penthouse to look like she was assaulted...<eos> Seasoned it liberally with her blood...
Say, did this guy Stygamian have anything on him when he died?<eos> Yeah, a few things.<eos> I put 'em in an evidence bag for the cops.<eos> Say, Rock, are you in some kind of trouble?<eos> Same kinda trouble he was in.<eos> Thank you, Beatrice.<eos> So what were you looking for?<eos> A cigarette case.<eos> A gold one. Mm.<eos> I didn't see it.

So you're just letting Hamburg take the driver's seat here?<eos> Yeah, isn't that kind of her job?<eos> I used to think that, and then I got into a couple of bad clinical trials that my doctor recommended and I realized, this is my life.<eos> -Not theirs. -Yeah.<eos> Hamburg's not the one who's gonna die if she's wrong about this.<eos> I'm just saying, it's up to you how you wanna steer this.<eos> Okay, so I do all of this research, and then what?<eos> Trust your gut.<eos> I'm not so good at that.<eos> My brain's usually buzzing too loud for me to hear it.
We're his friends.<eos> Look, Oscar taped this under a mailbox near the brownstone.<eos> Do you honestly think I could've talked him out of it?<eos> Llamosa's got to have, what, 50 pounds on this guy?<eos> At least.<eos> So how did he get Llamosa to go with him?<eos> He said he borrowed a gun from a friend.<eos> So your partner not only took off with a kidnapper, he took off with an armed kidnapper?<eos> The gun doesn't work. At least, that's what Oscar told Sherlock.<eos> He said he was gonna trade it for Sherlock's phone once they met up.
- What about Charlie?<eos> Get away from the car!<eos> Come on, Charlie, you got to get up.<eos> - Get up, get up, get up, get up.<eos> Come on. - Aah!

I'm the closest thing Superman has to a best friend.<eos> You wanna see him hurt?<eos> Killing me would do that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Kara, we may have a way for you to stop Krull.<eos> Krull's chest unit is powered by a Demon Core, a subcritical mass of plutonium.<eos> If you can remove it from his suit, it should shut down his weaponry.<eos> But the core will melt down the very moment it's freed from its containment matrix.<eos> There has to be some way to stop him without nuking the city.<eos> You need to encase the core in lead before you rip it free.
He's dead.<eos> It's Joe Sena.<eos> His trouble was what created this barrier around Haven.<eos> The barrier's still up.<eos> Dying doesn't always end the trouble.<eos> And who knows what all these new ones do?<eos> What if the killer from your vision knew that?<eos> In Dave's vision, the killer was chasing this man, hunting him.<eos> What if he scared Joe into creating this barrier around the town, then killed him?<eos> So that no one could bring it down.
I'll tell you what, Agent Butterworth, before you go bothering those boys,<eos> I'm just gonna check on one thing.<eos> Hey, mister.<eos> I know you're not a cop around here, but they're always too busy to help me, anyways.<eos> So maybe you can.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My camera got stolen, my good one.<eos> Did you file a report?<eos> I already know who stole it...
And here you are, still doing her bidding, even though she never cared about you.<eos> Okay, so take this ring and make a thinny.<eos> However you can.<eos> But Audrey...<eos> If Nathan doesn't come back, you have to promise me that you're not gonna go in there after him.<eos> Duke... I can't.<eos> Audrey, listen to me.<eos> I saw what happened to Haven because Nathan doesn't come back.<eos> Can you imagine what the future's gonna look like if you disappear, too?<eos> He is there, on the other side of that thinny, and when you open it up, he's coming home.
Tomorrow morning, before we stick Ruby in the ground, how about we pop the casket and give you a look-see?<eos> Well, that would give me peace of mind.<eos> And give me a chance to stay out of prison.<eos> Hey, world's most awesome church administrator, whatcha doin'?<eos> Oh, I'm just crocheting some ponchos for my online store.<eos> Hey, do you want to try one on?<eos> They're unisex.<eos> My least favorite kind of sex.<eos> So I see you're wearing my little gift.<eos> Oh, I haven't taken it off since you gave it to me.

I truly believed that, when faced with a common enemy, an enemy that wants to destroy our town and everything it stands for, that you would stand with us.<eos> I would never say you are a good man, but siding with a mass murderer?<eos> I thought you were better than that.<eos> It is with a heavy heart that I vote to convict.<eos> Datak Tarr, this panel has found you guilty of high treason, which carries a sentence of death by hanging.<eos> If you wish, you may now make a brief statement.<eos> Did my wife do that to your face?<eos> It's a good look for you.<eos> Nice town, Benedict.<eos> Think I should buy it?

- Then abandoned it.<eos> - Why?<eos> I don't believe one can discover the secrets of life by cutting up the dead.<eos> Or by artificially animating them with electricity.<eos> - You mean galvanism?<eos> - Charlatanism.<eos> How long have you had your condition?<eos> Several years now.<eos> On and off.<eos> Are you treating it?
Bobby! (grunting)<eos> Wow, What a fun couple you are!

Um, I just...<eos> I-I promised another post by tomorrow.<eos> And, um, I think I have it.
But we get xxx.<eos> And I watch it maybe more than one billion times, man.<eos> Tell me, you did stunts for that movie?<eos> - No, no, I-I wish. - Ah!<eos> What you cooking, man?<eos> Uh, glycerin.<eos> Come, look.<eos> Look.<eos> Are you boiling dynamite?<eos> Yeah, yeah, just sweating it.
I need to see.<eos> Does he have a gun?<eos> I think so, yes.<eos> Okay, you're gonna need to do it then.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - Stop him.<eos> I won't be able to get close enough without him seeing me first and triggering the weapon.<eos> Here.<eos> Take my gun.<eos> Take my gun, put it under your shirt, and don't use it until you're right in his face.
What was science fiction yesterday is a reality today.<eos> Hahn and Strassmann work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Insti--<eos> - No, no.<eos> Turn that back, please.<eos> ...blocks of all matter.<eos> German scientists have managed to split the atom, releasing 200 million volts.<eos> A major discovery in physics, atomic energy could become a promising source of fuel in the decades to come.<eos> It's called a neutron.<eos> It's a particle inside the nucleus of an atom.<eos> When you bombard uranium with neutrons, you can split it apart, releasing all of that, uh-- that energy, that power that's locked inside.
Well, then, perhaps you'd entertain a request for a favor for old times'.<eos> It's not in my power to transfer you to the test group.<eos> Yeah, but you can sack me.<eos> Mm, off the project.<eos> Send me packing for good.<eos> - For what cause?<eos> - Truancy, insubordination.<eos> Whatever insults your daughter suffered at my hands.<eos> Take your pick.<eos> When you come across a wounded buck, the sporting thing to do is shoot it.
Your coconspirators at Site X are sitting in rooms just like this one.<eos> And they're cooperating with us, so I'll let you consider your options.<eos> You'd betray the grandfather of your only son?<eos> You're going to retract your statement.<eos> Claim full responsibility like a man.<eos> If you ever want to hold your boy...<eos> Oh, I did want to hold my boy, actually.<eos> I did.<eos> Holding his photograph seemed the next best thing.<eos> So I took the snapshot out of the frame on your desk and I turned it around.
You're some sort of...<eos> Psychiatrist.<eos> Ah, talking cure.<eos> You're a long way from Freud's couch, doctor.<eos> Well, diseases of the mind aren't confined to asylums, Paul.<eos> They rewrite maps.<eos> Look at Hitler.<eos> Stalin.<eos> The world's full of sick...<eos> Clean it up.
Interesting.<eos> But you know what?<eos> This makes up for... [awkward laugh] everything.<eos> It's just nice to know I haven't been killing myself for no reason, that there's somebody who really appreciates everything that I've been do...<eos> where are you going?<eos> Hey, I have a plan to take care of our Schmidt problem.<eos> I'm gonna need your help.<eos> ♪ ♪ After I dumped Kenny's body in the lake, I'd kept a little souvenir.<eos> [knock at door] (Alden) Uh, Pastor Barlow?<eos> I just didn't think I'd have to use it so soon.
Why are these stair doors locked?<eos> It's a fire hazard.<eos> Because we are conquering your fear right here and right now.<eos> No!<eos> That is a bad idea.<eos> I don't wanna.<eos> Come on, Josh.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I did a little research online.<eos> And they say if you want to conquer your fear, all you have to do is associate it with something that makes you happy.
- Susie's told me everything you've done.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Oh, well...<eos> This is Ros Mahendra, my colleague.<eos> Oh, yes, I've seen you a couple of times.<eos> - And Tom.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Make sure you stay for pudding.<eos> Chocolate cake's to die for!<eos> Did you make it yourself, Susie?
- Excuse me?<eos> - So I've seen footage of your crime scenes, and I have to ask...<eos> How do you fight crime and keep your hair like that?<eos> And do it in high heels!<eos> Detective, I assume you're here about Sid's death.<eos> - How can I help?<eos> - Well, uh, we checked with security, and I understand that most employees enter and exit through the front door, but apparently there's also - a private V.I.P entrance? - That's right.<eos> Sid had it installed for the actors so they could come and go with more privacy.<eos> Are there any security cameras on that private entrance?<eos> They're actors, so they also use it to do other things, like...
- Yes. All the writers and actors.<eos> Thursday is rewrite night.<eos> So most of them were here until sunup.<eos> Of those people, did anyone have a problem with Sid?<eos> Who?<eos> Sorry, sir, we're not quite open yet.<eos> Uh, I record all of our rehearsals.<eos> This took place yesterday evening.<eos> Dude, why are you wearing armor?<eos> Because the sketch sucks, and I'm trying to save it!
Wrong question.<eos> Am I dead?<eos> You know, I don't know what I'm thinking.<eos> Eight performances a week, major play on Broadway.<eos> You've been on Broadway before.<eos> Well...<eos> Not since the Clinton administration.<eos> And now it's all viral.<eos> Bloggers, tweeters.<eos> You know, people actually come to the previews, record the show on their phone, put it online, and make comments.
Um, graduating.<eos> What are you doing in a bathrobe?<eos> Miss Saxton, this breakfast is for seniors participating in the graduation ceremony.<eos> Since you were caught with a flask of alcohol at prom, you cannot walk with your class.<eos> We already discussed this at length.<eos> Come on, you weren't serious.<eos> Anyway, my name's already in the program, so...<eos> Oh, I am dead serious.<eos> Go home.<eos> This day needs to be perfect, and I will not let you not tarnish it.
- Nothing special.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - Having so many knifes, to me...<eos> - For EDC - everyday carrying -<eos> I have much more... smaller knife.<eos> - So you have that in your pocket at all times?<eos> - Every day.<eos> You know, you wake up in the morning and... you get used to take shower or clean your teeth.<eos> And I get used to... taking a knife with me.<eos> I sit in the office and someone has a birthday, he brought... cake and someone has to slice it.
Find her.<eos> Promise me.<eos> Find her.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> Come nightfall, we need to find a way out of the city.<eos> There are Banu Zahra in the western provinces.<eos> We'll head there.<eos> You want to run?<eos> This is our home; we need to stay and fight for it.<eos> Too many of us have died defending it.
Which would explain why I'm sitting in a closet with someone in 2016, wouldn't it?<eos> You're not a pervert.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> This... is my favourite show on TV.<eos> This guy here, he's going out with this guy and they're getting married and everything.<eos> And then there's this guy and he's trying to break them up, but it's just non-stop drama!<eos> Right!<eos> I'm staying here and marrying that stud Daley!<eos> Your mam had a right old perv when she came in, at that calendar!<eos> My mum would've just burnt it.
(Mocking) "This idea is totally unrealistic."<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> - I'll be fine with you buying this...<eos> - Yes.<eos> ...if you answer "none" to the following question.<eos> How much of our rent, which is due in 11 days, have you spent on this $600 blender?<eos> Dream crusher.<eos> Morning, girl.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Sofia wants me to return this Vitamix, but I really want it.
Daddy, thank you for investing in my dream.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Why didn't you bring a pizza?<eos> [Italian accent] You always bring a pizza.<eos> I brought you something much better than pizza.<eos> I brought you motivation.<eos> If this article goes well, I have an investor who wants to finance a second restaurant.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wait, can we call it "Food. Yeah"?
- Yes.<eos> You have a huge heart, but I already make more than every other secretary at the firm, so- 2% it is.<eos> - Thanks, Louis.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> Hey, do you have a second?<eos> I need your legal advice about something.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> What is it?<eos> My fiancée left this prenup in the kitchen.<eos> I'm just wondering if you think I should sign it.
I prefer my men manly.<eos> Am I not manly?<eos> Well, if you have to ask...<eos> Mike, how you doing?<eos> Robert.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I heard you wanted me to sign a prenup.<eos> I did.<eos> I hope you didn't take it personally.<eos> Of course not, I'm happy to sign it, but Rachel did say that you don't know what kind of guy I am, so I thought I'd come here to show you that this is the kind of guy I am.
This is my home.<eos> It's also your office.<eos> And that entrance is right around there.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of my dinner.<eos> I called to set an appointment.<eos> You didn't call back.<eos> Because I had patients.<eos> And what the hell am I?<eos> You're an ex-patient I haven't seen in weeks, who ignored me when I said that your panic attacks wouldn't stop until you accepted the fact that your secretary wasn't coming back.<eos> I did accept it, and I had another one anyway.
I'm going to show you mercy, considering your dress choice.<eos> What's wrong with my dress?<eos> Oh, you don't know.<eos> Come on, this is really special.<eos> You wanna know the truth?<eos> I think you bottled up your anger at Donna, let it out at Louis, and then when it came back at you, you pushed it down again.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> The clinical term is displacement, and the cure for it is letting your anger at Donna out.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna do that, because even if I would, Donna's not here.<eos> No, I didn't say you had to let it out at Donna.
Someone's totally hooking up tonight.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Volcanoes need to let off steam, and this place has been a volcano for weeks.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Hey. Okay, as much as it pains me, Everybody gets one free drink at Molly's today.<eos> (man) Oh, Daddy! Oh, Daddy!<eos> Oh, Daddy! Oh, Daddy!<eos> You know Doug Purcell in the 28th?<eos> Well, he's got a time share in the Bahamas and if he doesn't use it, he loses it...
Um, I'm at his place.<eos> one of the girls from the club, she's here.<eos> She's been shot.<eos> She's dead, and I don't know where Casey is.<eos> Okay, we got a pinging order on his phone.<eos> Hang tight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, where is it?<eos> She's always writing in a notebook.<eos> Where does she keep it?
I'm gonna call the cops.<eos> You'd be calling me, essentially.<eos> King of Cross Academy.<eos> Full scholarship for Isabella.<eos> Just wanna ask her a couple of questions.<eos> Show her a photo.<eos> She doesn't testify.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I was waiting outside while my mom got coffee, and this guy came in with a blue backpack.<eos> I remember it, 'cause my friend's got the same one.
You tampered with my phone.<eos> [Bunny scoffs]<eos> (Bunny) Everything's a conspiracy with you.<eos> "Tampered."<eos> You tied one on last night and I let you sleep in.<eos> You know, it was really nice, you talking about what's on your mind.<eos> But... what happened to Nadia is truly terrible, and if you want to talk about it, I am so here for you.<eos> Whatever I said last night, chalk it up to a whiskey neat.<eos> This coffee is insane.<eos> Did you heat it with a flamethrower?
Someone with a cock.<eos> I know why you want to find her.<eos> You want to start fucking her again, don't you?<eos> You're the one that shared her with me, Your Eminence.<eos> It's my way of keeping her in the temple.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I can give this map to el profesor myself.<eos> I don't even need you anymore.<eos> I built your flesh business.<eos> And now that she knows you're using it to feed, she'll attack again.
- I just saved your ass.<eos> - He was about to tell me everything!<eos> Where the hell are you goin' now?<eos> - I don't need your help.<eos> - Yeah? Well, Uncle Eddie did.<eos> He almost got killed because of you.<eos> This has got nothing to do with Eddie or you.<eos> Well, it's a little late for that, wouldn't you say?<eos> I heard you asking about a truck.<eos> You tryin' to follow it?
Do you even know who we are?<eos> Robbed thirty million in bonds in that bank... Abilene.<eos> Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.<eos> - Real live Geckos.<eos> - You do this right, you'll get medals.<eos> Maybe do shaving ads and shit.<eos> Get him out here.<eos> Richard!<eos> We can't take the truck.<eos> But the Sheriff here knows exactly where to deliver it.
I've got question mark underpants.<eos> Makes one wonder what the question is.<eos> Which one are you?<eos> Human or Zygon?<eos> - I don't answer that question.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because there isn't a question to answer.<eos> I don't accept it.<eos> My sister and I were the living embodiment of the peace we made.<eos> I will give all the lives I have to protect it.
Or a code? No, a pass?<eos> A key-code.<eos> Give it to me now.<eos> I can't.<eos> Interesting.<eos> - You 're not lying.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> - But you have access of some kind?<eos> - Obviously.<eos> Give it to me now.
There's nothing below us anymore.<eos> You have a phone.<eos> Who is it?<eos> It'll be the guy who's waiting for me downstairs standing guard.<eos> He will come up here to find out what's taking so long unless I call him.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or maybe it's not and you just want the chance to call for help.<eos> I promise you I won't.<eos> No, put the phone down.<eos> Put it down!
Why are you trying to shut me up, Spencer?<eos> I'm just saying what you guys are thinking.<eos> If you guys are too scared to be honest, then fine.<eos> I will do it for you.<eos> I'm sorry, Alison.<eos> 'I know this must really suck for you.'<eos> But I'm not gonna sit here and help you give A the benefit of the doubt.<eos> I hope the police catch him because there's nothing they could do to him that's worse than what he did to us.<eos> ♪ Got a secret ♪<eos> ♪ Can you keep it? ♪
No need to be suspicious.<eos> Honestly, I'm suspicious of everyone these days.<eos> Well, Clark is not some blue-eyed blond DiLaurentis boy.<eos> Relax.<eos> You all could have gotten hurt.<eos> 'Rushing in to confront Charles like that.'<eos> I'll relax when he's in custody.<eos> I know. We screwed up.<eos> Maybe if I had called the cops earlier.<eos> Look.. ...you had a chance to corner Charles, and you took it.
Made him answer for what he's done.<eos> You tried.<eos> You were doing your job.<eos> Well, now that everything's out in the open<eos> I have a more personal stake in the outcome.<eos> I got a buddy on Tanner's team.<eos> I'll make a call.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I've got one good arm.<eos> I'll use it to dial.
You said they were called the Collectors.<eos> Oh, they are now.<eos> They used to be the Dissectors.<eos> Did a bit of rebrand in the '80s.<eos> Same people who did new Coke.<eos> Ah, look at this.<eos> More species for our collection.<eos> - Seize them!<eos> - Hayley, run!<eos> I looked everywhere for Snot's hamster and I can't find it.
Sounds like a leggy blonde I know.<eos> Care for an "eye d'oeuvre"?<eos> - Eye d'oeuvre? - Yeah, they're for the party.<eos> It's mozzarella, a little black olive, and a touch of food coloring for that creepy, bloodshot look.<eos> Are you seriously going ahead with the party?<eos> Uh, funny story.<eos> I may have accidentally told a couple of people about finding Devon's house, and then, one of them may have group chatted the address.<eos> Come on, it'll be fine.<eos> It's just one night.<eos> And besides, the whole place is in limbo until the state claims it.
Yeah, that's what happens with medical school cadavers.<eos> - You okay, boys?<eos> - Yup, fine. Clearly, it isn't Kelli.<eos> Wait. Wait. What's that?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, please don't.<eos> - Ugh.<eos> - Tonight, it's my turn to have the nightmares.<eos> It's Kelli's phone.<eos> I saw it in the stitch.

What happened anyway?<eos> Uh, for starters, I got paired up with this total diva of a pianist.<eos> - Really?<eos> That bad?<eos> - Worse than you can imagine.<eos> Brilliant, but basically evil.<eos> I mean, she'd just crap on everything I did.<eos> So, to prove a point, I put my name on this obscure Bach piece...<eos> Wait a second, you plagiarized?<eos> And of course, she called it a steaming pile of...
Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause she asked me if it was okay.<eos> What did... what did you say?<eos> That it's fine.<eos> Is it?<eos> I mean, it's kinda weird.<eos> My sister and my ex-boyfriend.<eos> Hey!<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> - I haven't seen it.

Anything to take down Knockers.<eos> I've always hated them, because they wouldn't open up at 4:00 a.m. to show the World Caber Tossing Championships.<eos> Okay, Willie, you can only use the jackhammer when there's lots of noise upstairs.<eos> No worries.<eos> It is Monday Night Football, by which I mean American football, by which I mean no football at all!<eos> There's the box!<eos> Ow!<eos> Medium spicy!<eos> Ach! We've hit the hot sauce supply line!<eos> I'll have to neutralize it with some signature blue cheese!
- We just have to...<eos> - Pretend?<eos> So?<eos> I had a second phone.<eos> Stop fiddling.<eos> You look fine.<eos> You pay inside.<eos> Over there.<eos> It's 15, inside and out. 15.<eos> Technically, I unlocked it.
Bill, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> - Get away from me, Frank.<eos> - Please, Bill.<eos> - Bill!<eos> - I said get the hell away from me!<eos> Listen up!<eos> When I'm done, tie him off.<eos> Leave him here.<eos> You understand?<eos> Nobody cuts that body down till the birds pick it clean.
I know, but...<eos> I'm not gonna have this talk with him.<eos> Are you?<eos> So... let him dig.<eos> Fire in the hole.<eos> Without him, I need your eyes on this.<eos> Well, it's a prototype.<eos> That's what I was thinking.<eos> - Thumb detection in the handle...<eos> - I had to bypass it, yeah.
And originally found with it, were artifacts...<eos> Mostly worthless, except one...<eos> A scroll casing, over 1,000 years old.<eos> The casing holds a parchment which reportedly describes exactly what this monolith is, which is what I want to know.<eos> And I tracked the scroll casing...<eos> not easy...<eos> Through history, to Mosul's Central Museum in Iraq.<eos> But it was taken by your extremist buddies when they ransacked the place this year.<eos> Now, I'm 90% sure it's in this room.<eos> So you can either hand it over in exchange for what's in there, or you could spill my guts in the sand and use the briefcase as a booster seat.
But no evidence supported that.<eos> And now...<eos> And now I think...<eos> I know it's a black hole.<eos> It's dark matter made solid.<eos> It can warp space-time.<eos> It... look, regardless... okay?<eos> This is gonna tell us exactly what that monolith is.<eos> So...<eos> Should we scan it?
I don't know.<eos> Uh, what I do know is the labs came back on the Wilbanks baby.<eos> Everything looks good there.<eos> Hmm. My flier's perfectly placed.<eos> It's clear, aesthetically pleasing.<eos> I mean, people have taken tabs from other fliers.<eos> I'm sorry. Why do you need a roommate?<eos> You have a house.<eos> Had a house.<eos> Callie and I sold it.
No!<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't play that video.<eos> The captain and I cannot hear that.<eos> Listening to that video could cause us to recuse ourselves from the trial.<eos> Which would further damage the prosecution.<eos> As the D.D.A., right now, I'm the only one here who can listen to what Slider said to you.<eos> And I'm gonna need your cell until we can find time to see the judge tomorrow.<eos> Oh... n... no, you're not, like, you're not taking my phone. Don't you need a warrant for that?<eos> Not if you just give it to her.
That an anonymous donor made a very gen...<eos> I was wondering if I could have a word with you.<eos> A parting gift?<eos> It's a great shame to see you leave us.<eos> Are you sure you don't mean "great relief"?<eos> As a philosopher once said, "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger."<eos> You made them stronger, Madam President.<eos> It's what good leadership does.<eos> Keys to our back gate.<eos> And when we eventually return, I will be outraged if our tennis court hasn't been ploughed up and put to good use. Growing peas, beans - whatever you decide to grow on it.

You can't get pregnant from pre-come.<eos> I got a buddy, this guy Donald-- him and his girlfriend were having sex-- same situation.<eos> She got pregnant.<eos> Now they got a kid.<eos> His name's Samson.<eos> Well, that seems anecdotal.<eos> No, no.

So I don't know how to say this, but my brother is a little bit off.<eos> Yeah, he was such a sweet kid, but when he was 15, he had an accident.<eos> His favorite show was Home Improvement.<eos> And it came on, and he heard the... sound, and he got so excited.<eos> And he ran down to the basement to watch, and he slammed his head on the low ceiling.<eos> Poor kid didn't know how tall he had gotten.<eos> And, um, he's just never been the same since.<eos> He really loves this couch.<eos> But we don't have a lot of money.<eos> Is there any way we can have it for 200 bucks?

Well, let us speak of the secret Essex stronghold.<eos> There was no place for a man like Isaac in George Sibley's Salem, no place for a teller of uncomfortable truths.<eos> If I was telling the truth, why am I in the stocks?<eos> That is the price of telling the truth.<eos> If it were free, every Tom, Dick, or Harry would be a truth-teller.<eos> To tell your truth, you violated the sabbath, you disrespected your elders and betters.<eos> You had to be punished.<eos> But I am not George Sibley.<eos> And I recognize a young man with potential.<eos> And I know how to reward it.
Oh, my God.<eos> Strange Brew?<eos> I love this movie.<eos> Daisy. What are you doing here?<eos> I came to say "Au revoir."<eos> Not good-bye.<eos> Oh, Daisy...<eos> You dear, sweet, wonderful woman.<eos> It's not that big a deal. I was, I was close by, so...<eos> You found it.

Well, his phone's turned off, and his car is still parked in his driveway.<eos> So he must have swept himself clean.<eos> He is completely off the grid, and we have no real way of finding him.<eos> Shut down his aliases.<eos> No, he keeps open-ended tickets that leapfrog between different countries under different aliases.<eos> Makes it almost impossible to track him.<eos> Do your best.<eos> Will do.<eos> I'm afraid. There's part of Mr. Callen that will always be that young boy, lost in the foster system, searching for home.<eos> I thought he'd found it here.
And at that point, no one wanted to work with me.<eos> Which is why I started doing undercover work.<eos> Is this jackass still on the force?<eos> No.<eos> No, he's dead.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know, they, uh... found him in this Hollywood motel.<eos> Shot with his own gun.<eos> Rumor was that he used to get really high and beat up hookers, so the investigators just assumed that... he was whaling on some poor girl, and she got ahold of his gun and unloaded it.
How's it going over here?<eos> I just tried a ten.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Okay. I'll take it from here.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Anime stickers?<eos> Hey!<eos> Sure.<eos> That bracelet is so pretty.<eos> Did you make it?

Ira's questioning them further now, taking swabs.<eos> Well, working on the assumption that she was having a relationship with this man, there's a high probability...<eos> Yes, that we'll get a match from DNA on that toothbrush and razor with DNA from the blue Mondeo.<eos> We can cross check that with their swabs.<eos> We have four, maybe five images.<eos> There must be more.<eos> Other cameras, a wider radius.<eos> Well, we can try but...<eos> 'Hi, this is Haider at Cristal Kebabs.<eos> 'Your order's ready if you'd like to pick it up. 22, 48.'
I understand you were the last employee - to see the missing document.<eos> - That's right.<eos> You sure you don't want a cup?<eos> I'm fine. Thanks.<eos> Mr. Thomas tells me that you facilitated access to 38 others?<eos> Clients, yes.<eos> But based on our surveillance video, I've pretty much cleared 30 of them.<eos> Appreciate your crime-solving help but we'll decide who's in the clear.<eos> Now that hard drive, is it on its way?<eos> Uh, a soon as I get back to the office, I'll send it.
When I came to, I was... In the backseat of his car.<eos> My... my pants were pulled down, and he was...<eos> I couldn't move.<eos> I told him to stop, but he didn't, so I just... I focused on the air freshener swinging from the rearview mirror.<eos> It smelled like vanilla.<eos> After he was done, he turned on the radio... Opened the sunroof, called me babe, and he drove me home like nothing happened.<eos> Tao: In her original statement,<eos> Kelly said the assault occurred in a white four-door BMW, but she did not mention a sunroof.<eos> What if Mr. Box-of-bones was driving that car when he disappeared?<eos> Then he left it somewhere and never come back for it.
Don't run.<eos> Stay with her.<eos> Don't go!<eos> Why do they always run?<eos> Help me, somebody, please!<eos> At least give him a merciful death.<eos> Do you think a Cyberman fears a merciful death?<eos> Help me, please!<eos> Peace on this street depends on one thing.<eos> To break it in any way is to face the raven.
- 'She won't stop crying.'<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Yeah, she can probably tell you're upset.<eos> Rump?<eos> It's Rump, isn't it?<eos> That man's wife.<eos> She said something.<eos> "Give it to me, tell me I can have it." What did she mean?<eos> Two ways to survive a Quantum Shade.<eos> The Shade's master removes the chronolock... .. or you can give it to someone else.
You realise how well that conversation went, right?<eos> You're starting to look, er, a bit...<eos> We need to block every exit from the Cloisters.<eos> Every available man.<eos> I need that place surrounded.<eos> No-one's ever made it back out of the Cloisters.<eos> Not quite no-one.<eos> This way, I'm fairly sure.<eos> According to the stories, there's a secret way out.<eos> If you find it, the Sliders let you go.
When Time Lords die, their minds are uploaded to a thing called the Matrix.<eos> This structure, it's like a living computer.<eos> It can predict the future, generate prophecies out of algorithms, ring the Cloister bells in the event of impending catastrophe.<eos> The Sliders -- they're just like the guard dogs, the firewall.<eos> Projections from inside the Matrix itself, the dead, manning the battlements.<eos> Was I supposed to understand any of that?<eos> The Time Lords have got a big computer made of ghosts, in a crypt, guarded by more ghosts.<eos> Didn't hurt, did it?<eos> Tiny bit.<eos> Why would a computer need to protect itself from the people who made it?
Human compatible.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> We don't have to stay here long.<eos> Check your heartbeat again.<eos> Your timeline must have started by now.<eos> A pulse, yeah?<eos> You have a pulse, yes?<eos> Pulse?<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - I am checking it properly!
- This way.<eos> - Your actions will not go unpunished!<eos> Here.<eos> - Ow! - I don't suppose you mind if I freshen up.<eos> - Not bad for 200, eh?<eos> - 200?<eos> I have an augmented lifespan.<eos> Long story.<eos> - So, what's the occasion?<eos> - I've got the diamond, now it's time to sell it.
The man who gave me this was the sort of man who'd know exactly how long a diary you were going to need.<eos> He sounds awful.<eos> I suppose he is.<eos> I've never really thought about it.<eos> Not somebody special then?<eos> No.<eos> But terribly useful every now and then.<eos> Please!<eos> I just need you to get me out of here.<eos> He's in the main hold, sir, but you've deadlocked it.
- Toss for it.<eos> - I'll take the robot, you drive.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Oh, don't stop for strangers.<eos> - Look who's talking.<eos> - What's the point?<eos> It's over.<eos> - I will take your head.<eos> What for?<eos> We're on a crashing spaceship and I don't even know if I can save it.
I'd really rather not.<eos> Bill Clinton was in the White House.<eos> On the radio, Hootie was blowing fish.<eos> And in this house, our little Natey was six.<eos> This is the Christmas that Santa gave Nate his first bike.<eos> And tomorrow, he will break his first bone.<eos> Really, where did you find that?<eos> I found it in the back of the garage.<eos> This is also the same year that you and Santa spent the whole night freezing in the backyard trying to put together that stupid trampoline.<eos> You wanted to test it first, and I caught you when you bounced too high.
That's all I meant.<eos> Great.<eos> How's May?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Is she ever coming back?<eos> You should ask her yourself.<eos> Well... I would if I knew where she was.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You don't watch where the ball goes.<eos> Then how would I find it?
You must be right, I mean, look at how he's reacting to what you say.<eos> ... 'cause you're fuckin' lyin' through your teeth!<eos> Pablo, take Kelly, get me boiling water, chicken, and my 10 inch Ginsu.<eos> Okay, the one with the carving blade, not the bread knife.<eos> The fuck are you gonna do with that?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hey, repeat them.<eos> - Not the bread knife.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> The bread knife was expensive. I don't wanna ruin it.
So we may need another 14-year-oId to sit there for the retakes, for where the guy who couldn't stop pirating, even though it was repeatedly pointed out to him, "Don't pirate."<eos> "I can't stop myself.<eos> I've got to tape it. I've got to tape it.<eos> "I'm even blanking out earlier bits I taped.<eos> "It's just a compulsion to see the thing ticking over.<eos> "I'm deleting beloved family memories.<eos> "I've got to have this show on tape."<eos> It's recorded for a DVD.<eos> How could you not...<eos> You can watch it glossy and live and shiny with your own face in it.
So...<eos> One stitch at a time.<eos> Slow and steady.<eos> Ready?<eos> Okay. 3-0 prolene, boki.<eos> Mm.<eos> Anybody want my soup?<eos> It's reminding me of pancreatic fluid.<eos> Oh, mm-hmm.<eos> Then I definitely want it.
Your brother walked free.<eos> Be funny if that happened again.<eos> Only on a grander scale.<eos> Your car got robbed, you see.<eos> Not his.<eos> You know what 18 months inside teaches you?<eos> Keep that shut.<eos> A full confession - naming both you and your brother.<eos> Luckily, we saw this coming and had a chat about it.<eos> Kenny's confession damns Kenny, yeah, but to use it against us... is very, very iffy and I'm sure the judge'll point that out.
You should be able to balance the tray with one hand whilst you open the door with the other.<eos> No.<eos> No, no...<eos> The pathless gorges of Baluchistan are described by the warriors of that region as their friends.<eos> As a bride of three months... carried on a swaying litter I was unable to embrace that sentiment.<eos> Lady Holland, there's a bird's nest in the grate.<eos> It must have fallen down the chimney.<eos> But it's got an egg in!<eos> Then you must get rid of it.<eos> It's probably cracked, and if Solomon finds it, he'll eat it, and he shouldn't eat eggs unless they're hardboiled.
- Marijuana?<eos> - Marijuana is the right answer.<eos> It was a word for marijuana, for cannabis, and more particularly for people who smoked it.<eos> - People who smoked marijuana were called muggles.<eos> - Hilarious!<eos> In New Orleans, they're all getting stoned, going, "Quidditch is really boring!"<eos> In New Orleans, 1920s, that was it.<eos> What's the next word?<eos> We've got "hagrid", which is used in Hardy, the Mayor Of Casterbridge.<eos> - GRAHAM: - I've seen it in the longer form, hagridden!
We can't let commies find these.<eos> You want to hear more?<eos> - Go on.<eos> - Curiosity kills.<eos> - It's worse than drug addiction.<eos> - Hiding the truth is worse than curiosity.<eos> Truth my foot.<eos> A few snatched bars of gold and tried to go AWOL.<eos> We shot them to death.<eos> The battle broke out between those who wanted to steal gold and those who wanted to protect it.
You expose the truth, you expose your hideous family history.<eos> You bury the truth, you let go of a murderer.<eos> Who said life is full of irony?<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I cannot believe you.<eos> You do not want to believe, I know.<eos> Both of us are criminal families and beneficiaries of those crimes.<eos> The gold you have must be worth about 100 billion by now.<eos> That's what your grandfather bequeathed you.<eos> Take it and live quietly... like the dead, or I might not make you dead.
- Oh, you told him me about me?<eos> - Not a word.<eos> - Then who said anything about flatmates?<eos> - I did.<eos> I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.<eos> Now here he is after lunch with an old friend clearly home from military service in Afghanistan.<eos> It wasn't a difficult leap.<eos> How did you know about Afghanistan?<eos> I've got my eye on a nice little place in central London.<eos> Together we could afford it.
Thank you.<eos> The victim is in her early 30s, professional person.<eos> Going by her clothes, I'd guess something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink.<eos> She's travelled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night, that's obvious from the size of her suitcase.<eos> - A suitcase?<eos> - A suitcase, yes.<eos> She's been married several years, but not happily.<eos> She's had a string of lovers, but none of them knew she was married.<eos> For God's sake, if you're just making this up... Her wedding ring, look at it! It's too tight.<eos> She was thinner when she first wore it, that says married for a while.
I guess it's also Russian.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> It looks like a page from some kind of flight manual.<eos> There's something handwritten on the back<eos> What?<eos> That's the most ridiculous story I've ever heard.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> We're investigating all the possibilities.<eos> It sounds more like someone got their hands on some old Soviet hardware and are using it to perpetrate an attack on the United States.
Parents are not supposed to outlive their children.<eos> I guess we didn't have much contact in later years.<eos> Maybe I was too strict when they were kids.<eos> I'm glad Cecilia doesn't have to hear any of this sad news.<eos> She died last Christmas.<eos> It makes me wonder where I went wrong.<eos> Do you know who this is?<eos> -Isn't it Krister?<eos> -The photo's over 40 years old.<eos> We found it in Krister's flat.
Calm down!<eos> Dad, I'm going to study.<eos> Then I'm going to become a prosecutor, and make that damned congressman who made you to lick his shoes, lick my shoes!<eos> Put it down!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Sang Shik Hyung, help me take off my pants.<eos> Ta Gu Hyung, bring me the chopping board.<eos> But you are our family's only way to continue the bloodline!<eos> I need to settle down in order to study hard.<eos> I have to chop it off myself today.
And I think there's nothing wrong with granola, but it has to be Fashion show granola.<eos> Let's talk about Mondo<eos> I love that he has the showmanship.<eos> He has it in spades!<eos> Right.<eos> He needs a little bit of<eos> Gretchen to-- yeah, they need to balance each other.<eos> Yeah, they need to balance each other.<eos> He runs the risk of being taken as a joke, and that's what I am concerned about.<eos> Once you lose that credibility, you can't regain it.
I'm a little tired so, I'll go lie down.<eos> Me too.<eos> Hey Seung-Jo. You know,he's my son but he's so difficult to be with. He's selfish, he thinks he's all that... he's no fun.<eos> Not really though, he's fun to be with and we understand each other.<eos> Well, I guess you are a boring kind of a person too. Are you also being particular about every little thing and talking about books you've read?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> We both like to be logical and reasonable.<eos> while other people find that boring, we enjoy that a lot.<eos> Most of all, he's really awful to women.<eos> He never talks kind. And he has even corrected grammatical mistakes on a love letter written to him and given it back to the girl with a grade. He's that kind of a jerk.
What you lack here must be made up for by other senses.<eos> I bought you this meat, so you can't ever tell anyone at the temple about me.<eos> You can't tell anyone that I'm a gumiho either. If you do, you'll die.<eos> Then we've promised each other.<eos> Whoever tells is in big trouble.<eos> I can't wait!<eos> No, I can't.<eos> This isn't human-like.<eos> You're a gumiho.<eos> Then you should eat raw meat, why are you trying to cook it?
How harsh can they be to a crazy girl who scribbled a little bit?<eos> They said this is the bathroom, but where is Cha Dae Woong?<eos> Why is there a chair in each room?<eos> It's not a chair, it's a well.<eos> It's really white and pretty!<eos> The well looks pretty, but the water's not very clean.<eos> My meat!<eos> My meat!<eos> The well ate my meat!<eos> I'll get it out.
Go to the end of the line.<eos> Get in line at the end.<eos> Don't you see that we are in line?<eos> I will perform for everyone for ten minutes.<eos> It's her.<eos> But, that woman is not the same woman... who enters my thoughts uninvited, and constantly hurts my pride.<eos> That woman who's sitting in front of me now, compared to the woman who's been running around in my mind. is much cooler.<eos> You don't have a resume?<eos> It's a kind of consideration.<eos> Because you might be shocked if you saw it.
He was a star when you met him.<eos> You didn't know that?<eos> Back then, he was a person that had nothing to do with me.<eos> But... Lately, as Min Woo went through hard times, I'd feel bad for him.<eos> And, when he'd say immature things, I'd nag him.<eos> Those times, he seemed easy and comfortable.<eos> I'm a loser, aren't I?<eos> Things are starting to go well for Min Woo, and I can't even be happy for him.<eos> Min Woo cares for you a lot.<eos> So much that when a drama proposal came for him from Japan, he declined immediately after he heard about it.
Yes.<eos> The criminal was not able to open it.<eos> Have you confirmed what the things inside are?<eos> No.<eos> No one knows the secret combination.<eos> They say that Chairman Kang Tae Ho, alone, knew the secret combination.<eos> Any way to force it open?<eos> If you use any machine or unauthorized methods to open it, the contents of the safe will disappear.<eos> It's a German product.<eos> If you don't send this back to the manufacturer or don't know the secret combination, there's no way of opening it.
Tae Seong.<eos> Tae Seong.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Can't I go with you?<eos> What?<eos> You're going to meet Shim Gun Wook, aren't you?<eos> I also have a lot of things to talk about with him.<eos> Father.<eos> I've left my seat empty for too long.<eos> I'll get it back soon and give it to Tae Ra or Mo Ne.
Same last words as before?<eos> I'm rather hoping there'll be a different outcome this time.<eos> Keep your hands off.<eos> Let's see some magic, please.<eos> It'll come in a moment.<eos> Please don't touch it.<eos> There we are.<eos> We need to read the ticker-tape, Archchancellor.<eos> Nobody said anything about a close-up.<eos> Can't you just move it in?

- Should I try?<eos> Who would tell me their return date?<eos> It's from Hong Kong.<eos> Someone I know from Hong Kong...<eos> Maybe...<eos> No, that can't be.<eos> Seo Eun Young!<eos> I can see it now.<eos> The sender is...<eos> I sent it.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I fell asleep.<eos> A cure for Parkinson's?<eos> That's what I'm asking.<eos> Pfizer, I'm a GP.<eos> Twenty universities, 15 teaching hospitals, every major drug company, and the goddamn NIH are all working on this.<eos> And I'm sure the second they find it, you're gonna be the first in line to sell it to me.
But, you just focus on getting well, honey.<eos> Don't stress about that.<eos> Okay? Uh, yeah, you shouldn't stress about it.<eos> That doesn't mean it's not important to try for it.<eos> George...<eos> Don't you have a client in crisis somewhere, Dad?<eos> It'll come to you !<eos> Hey, Bobby.<eos> How was your interview?<eos> I blew it.
Still taking the punches.<eos> Still ahead on points.<eos> Now, I have a fellow on the inside there.<eos> He likes to play the ponies.<eos> Has a gambling sickness.<eos> He couldn't pick a horse to save his fucking life.<eos> But courtesy of this sick man I have this, Hm?<eos> Well, the gang's all here.<eos> There's always a weak spot.<eos> We just need to find it.
I'm not feeling minimal.<eos> I really...<eos> I'm really liking more is more.<eos> You know?<eos> I mean, let's not try to tame this space, okay?<eos> Let's just let it be like lush, overgrown, fecund.<eos> Fecund.<eos> Like fertile, yeah?<eos> No, I love that word.<eos> You just, you don't hear people use it very often.
I just...<eos> I wanna give something to someone.<eos> Giving money is easy for me, but...<eos> Thank god.<eos> - I j... I want to do it.<eos> - That's terrific.<eos> A lot of the guests here don't have family visit them.<eos> If they do, it's generally once, twice a year.<eos> They love conversation.<eos> And, of course, we keep it light.
She doesn't want this shit.<eos> I told you to call Salvation Army.<eos> She can say if she doesn't want it.<eos> - But she might.<eos> - None of this is worth anything.<eos> He just wasted your time.<eos> Look at this chair. Look at it.<eos> This is a great chair.<eos> She died in it.<eos> Oh, no, well, now she's really gonna wanna buy it.
What you were thinking?<eos> This guy, this poor guy.<eos> His... His wife or sister, whomever, was just so mean.<eos> I had to buy it.<eos> I felt so bad for him.<eos> I mean, who's to say this stuff isn't valuable?<eos> I can.<eos> This stuff is not valuable.<eos> Somebody liked it.<eos> I mean, in 15 years this chair will be worth a ton of money because some genius German designer, you know, designed it.
Shabbat Shalom!<eos> Shabbat Shalom. - Shabbat Shalom.<eos> "What a rare find is a capable wife..."<eos> Directed by: Haim Bouzaglo<eos> "Her worth is far beyond that of rubies.

What about the General Counsel memo on coercive interrogations?<eos> There's no way...<eos> Look, the Director's Office has ordered us to assist the military wherever possible.<eos> For now, we observe and run our investigation simultaneously.<eos> Just keep me informed, okay?<eos> We have the guy but we can't say so.<eos> Why the hell not?<eos> Because officially, he doesn't exist.<eos> His face is all over the country!<eos> And we keep it there.
They rape me in front of my family, then kill everyone.<eos> My little boy, they kill last.<eos> These were my neighbors, they knew me.<eos> Very normal men.<eos> We got him in Yemen, Pakistan, Russia, all over.<eos> He used several passports.<eos> Okay, but did they put him and the nuclear material together at any time?<eos> It's only circumstantial.<eos> The Russians don't know exactly how much...<eos> If he did have 15, 18 pounds of it, how did he transport it internationally?
Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds.<eos> Ow.<eos> Who gets his wand?<eos> I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin.<eos> Think very, very carefully before you answer.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Why weren't you doing your job?<eos> Who got into my vault?<eos> Who stole it?

Becky, I wanted to talk to you about this.<eos> I just haven't known where to start.<eos> I'm just happy you're okay.<eos> Look, Dave.<eos> If you can just tell me the truth, then I promise I will do my best to understand.<eos> Okay.<eos> The first thing you should know about me is that I'm a sorcerer.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can conjure and shoot plasma bolts out of my hand.<eos> I can speed time up, slow it down, varying degrees of levitation.
You want me to do it again?<eos> Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.<eos> - Dicky's the trainer.<eos> - I'm doing him favor, Alice.<eos> I will show you over here these scrapbooks I have been collecting for years.<eos> Micky used to follow his big brother everywhere.<eos> Taught you everything, didn't he, honey?<eos> In '78 we got the offer to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.<eos> Oh, my God. Have you seen that video?<eos> Well, you're from HBO, you've got to see it again! Come on.
I mean what lies behind the mist.<eos> That's quite beautiful.<eos> I mean, for a make-believe map of a make-believe world.<eos> There is the source of your troubles.<eos> Dark Island.<eos> A place where evil lurks.<eos> It can take any form.<eos> It can make your darkest dreams come true.<eos> It seeks to corrupt all goodness... to steal the light from this world.<eos> How do we stop it?
Nothing.<eos> Sorry.<eos> For dinner?<eos> I'll wait at the bar.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> What can I get you?<eos> Oh, no, I'm meeting someone.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> What, you got a hot date?<eos> I don't know if you'd call it "hot."
I got motions to file.<eos> The law don't sleep, baby.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Phillip... you are the sweetest, most gentle man I have ever known.<eos> And I know people have taken advantage of that.<eos> I wanna protect you.<eos> I wanna make a life with you, Phillip.<eos> Get me outta here.<eos> The motion was filed.<eos> I presented it to the D.A. and got a letter from the judge.
We have to...<eos> There.<eos> They're not endangered anymore.<eos> They're extinct.<eos> No, they're not.<eos> I saved this one.<eos> And I'm gonna raise it and care for it, so the world will forever know what it's lost.<eos> You freaking slime wad!<eos> No.<eos> I killed it.
Oh! you know Terry<eos> So!<eos> did we do the body , yea, and the feet<eos> She doesn't need anything<eos> Afternoon, hello, hello, hello, hello Lucinda<eos> Maestro<eos> Hello darling .......... hello<eos> Sorry I'm late apologies Waris I picked my daughter up from school<eos> Look I found this look<eos> I thought you might like it?
Dear god. Give us something we can live with and pass on to others whose lives will never be the same because of a loved one's death.<eos> I did not decide on brown eyes for myself. And I now realize that Bobby didn't decide to be gay.<eos> If you say in your word that it is evil and wicked to be born with no arms, and a child is born with no arms,<eos> What is that child to think?<eos> Our first order business is a proposal for a gay freedom day in Walnut Creek.<eos> Attention, please. We have a select group to debate the issue.<eos> I don't see her.<eos> ...it's reverend Whit sell.<eos> For one day, for one day, people can celebrate their difference rather than feel shame.<eos> There are so many other people who need our time and our attention. Why are we wasting it on this?
Here?<eos> In Blackweir.<eos> What could an elf possibly want there?<eos> Forget I ask.<eos> There is something you should know.<eos> Another Legate has arrived in Blackweir.<eos> This is ill tidings. You are sure?<eos> You have seen this Legate?<eos> It has been years... since I did this.<eos> Sometimes... before the storm comes, I can feel it again. Feel... His call.
If this story breaks, it would create a panic.<eos> People would be hurt. If you knew what it was, you'd understand why it's got to stay a secret.<eos> Right, exactly.<eos> I'd understand.<eos> Have a little faith, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> There is a bioweapon in the container yard. That's what they were fighting over.<eos> It was developed by Starkwood in Africa.<eos> - Starkwood? - Right.<eos> They moved it to their base about 30 miles from here.
No, he's still alive, Kim.<eos> We induced a coma to help ease him through the harsher symptoms.<eos> My name is Gohar.<eos> I'm a friend.<eos> A friend?<eos> We spent the last few minutes talking and I can tell you he's accepted what is happening.<eos> Maybe he has.<eos> But I haven't.<eos> The stem cell treatment that you told me about.<eos> Can we still do it?
A friend?<eos> We spent the last few minutes talking and I can tell you he's accepted what is happening.<eos> Maybe he has.<eos> But I haven't.<eos> The stem cell treatment that you told me about.<eos> Can we still do it?<eos> As I told you, it's experimental and the odds of success are very low.<eos> Just tell me if it's too late to try.<eos> No.<eos> Then I want to do it.
-Shit.<eos> Thatìs better than none, I guess.<eos> Look, what they did you with is an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.<eos> It's got an internal battery that'Il pick up once the belt battery dies.<eos> It's like a reserve tank.<eos> Once the internal battery takes over, you got one fucking hour.<eos> The internal battery charges wirelessly through a transcutaneous energy-transfer system.<eos> Two coils-- There's one internal, one external.<eos> --that transmit via a magnetic force across the skin without piercing the surface.<eos> The internal coil receives power and sends it to the controller device.
-Over an hour.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> That's not fucking possible, Chevy.<eos> You should be d--<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Never mind. Look.<eos> It's a wireless system, so any low-level electrical shock to your skin should juice it at Ieast temporarily.<eos> I'm a certified heart surgeon. Well, I was.<eos> Lost my licence after I fucked up my ex-wife's vaginal rejuvenation procedure.<eos> Thatìs irrelevant right now. The point is, if you can get your heart, I'm sure I can put it back in for you.
Mr. Somner!<eos> - Mrs. Simon!<eos> You can be very proud of your daughter.<eos> I am proud of her.<eos> She's very talented.<eos> Her poem won a prize today.<eos> A year later, imagine!<eos> What poem?<eos> - Didn't she tell you?<eos> That's funny, she said she's got it from you.
Where did you hear about Dollhouse?<eos> Couple of times.<eos> Mostly as a joke, but a guy told me people were being taken off the streets and, like, hypnotized, doing stuff they don't remember.<eos> This guy was, well, a pimp and so I didn't...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want a drink or something?<eos> Do you have a wine cooler?<eos> I didn't know they still made those.<eos> I've got a white wine in the fridge.<eos> I never opened it.
Some people are doorways.<eos> Yes.<eos> Especially twins.<eos> Because what is a twin but another kind of mirror?<eos> And mirrors have always been doorways to the other world.<eos> What happened to your brother?<eos> From the moment he came back, I knew it wasn't Barto.<eos> A dybbuk had crossed over and taken his place.<eos> It had used his body to enter our world.<eos> I killed it
I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something is seriously wrong with that kid.<eos> Case, your eyes are getting worse.<eos> I know.<eos> Case?<eos> Dude, what's going on?<eos> You haven't been to class, you're not returning my phone calls.<eos> What happened to the mirror?<eos> I broke it.
I call them bowsers.<eos> It's my nickname for people who look just like their dog.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Bowsers?<eos> Where'd you come up with that?<eos> It sounded right.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, geek!<eos> I just stepped in your dog's shit.<eos> Now I'm gonna make you eat it.
- we've been jamming a lot...<eos> - I don't play any instruments.<eos> I slap some bass, and then Sydney's an axman.<eos> 'Cause I was gonna say if you wanted to jam with us you know, that'd be cool.<eos> But you don't have...<eos> You have a piano in your house, though, don't you?<eos> - Yeah, I don't play.<eos> - Really?<eos> Why do you have a piano?<eos> The decorator put it there.
Don't you talk?<eos> Hello now and then<eos> If you see her, could you tell her...<eos> You have a letter, from a gentleman.<eos> - What gentleman?<eos> - He didn't say his name.<eos> No, he just said that he forbade you to read it.<eos> - Fancy, and why?<eos> - I don't Know.<eos> - Give it to me.

It's worth more than my car.<eos> - Just, just give me your number.<eos> Yeah I'll start looking for it right now.<eos> Cause I got nothing else to do.<eos> I was engaged once, but I'm single now.<eos> Bye<eos> Hope you make your flight.<eos> I know it's around here somewhere, she's on a plane, that's the beauty of it.<eos> Hey, you found my ring.<eos> Thanks, I've been looking all over for it. - Your ring?
Organ donation?<eos> - Yes donation Ibo<eos> How's that supposed to work?<eos> Is that an order?<eos> No, I won't donate nothing.<eos> That just won't work.<eos> Why not?<eos> - Won't my heart die when I die?<eos> No it won't.<eos> They cut it out, put it into a box... and take it to the hospital.
Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> "Tetsu Tetsuo"<eos> "At long last, my dream is in sight.<eos> "The human body is the natural world's "most beautiful and functional work of art.<eos> "I am making an artificial body "not to improve on that work of God, "but to understand it better.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.<eos> You really think they give a shit about us?<eos> They're laughing all the way to the bank.<eos> Tess would know.<eos> She would have told me...<eos> What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!<eos> - Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> - Wake up!<eos> I bet there's some area that we don't know about.<eos> And I'm gonna find it.
Toast, fag.<eos> Yes, Radfield?<eos> Where's my butter?<eos> On your toast.<eos> Really?<eos> Where?<eos> Show me.<eos> How generous of you!<eos> It's funny.<eos> I go to all the trouble making butter for the team, and then I actually expect to have it on my toast.
No.<eos> Well, good, I'm glad you suddenly have the night free, 'cause we have an ending to write.<eos> Cancel your shoot tonight. So I'll tell you what's not working for me.<eos> We have a move about a bride who screws the entire guest list before her wedding and her husband's, like, totally cool with it.<eos> I think Dick should be really torn up about it.<eos> He really- he really loves Bliss.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, I think you type a lot faster without that huge rock on your finger.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Why aren't you wearing it?

Women vote now.<eos> They smoke. They even go to the bathroom by themselves.<eos> You're becoming very crude, darling.<eos> Your father's influence, no doubt.<eos> Nice car.<eos> The only reason why I'm giving in... is because I know that we'll be back here in a week.<eos> It's time for your boy's medicine, ma'am. - Bernice has your medicine, George.<eos> Take it. - It's not my medicine.<eos> I do not care whose medicine it is.<eos> Just one of you take it, and let's get out of here.
Come on.<eos> Spare change?<eos> Anything?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know a place they'll never find us. Let's go.<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - We call it a safe house.
Take your hand, put it over your heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'<eos> All is well?<eos> - Aal izz well<eos> Words of wisdom from His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas<eos> We had an old watchman in our village On night patrol, he'd call out, 'Aal izz well'<eos> And we slept peacefully.<eos> Then there was a theft and we learned that he couldn't see at night!<eos> He'd just yell 'Aal izz well', and we felt secure<eos> That day I understood this heart scares easily<eos> You have to trick it
They weren't that bad. They were proven to cause polio.<eos> I have elongated metatarsals and inverted phalanges, Spencer.<eos> I have to wear whatever fits.<eos> Well, then you know they were only sold in '98 and then discontinued immediately.<eos> The victim was wearing ten year old sneakers?<eos> Who holds onto tennis shoes for that long?<eos> Especially painful purple and gold ones.<eos> If this man was wearing them at the time of his death, then he was definitely killed in '98, possibly by the fashion mafia.<eos> Ten years ago?<eos> That makes no sense. Why would someone hang onto a body for a decade and then burn it to a crisp?
Gosh.<eos> You look so grown-up.<eos> I do?<eos> You're the one that's getting married.<eos> Oh, I know, right?<eos> Oh.<eos> You haven't even seen my ring.<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> - Oh, it's lovely.<eos> Jim designed it.
Kids like me. No!<eos> Heather!<eos> No no!<eos> - Nick.<eos> - Bray, what's happenin'?<eos> Willis is a rowing buddy of mine.<eos> Where are we on his kid's case?<eos> - Willis?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, I kicked it down to juvie.
I am not a flight risk.<eos> And this is my first alleged offense.<eos> And the prosecution has not presented one single piece of evidence against me.<eos> Now in these circumstances, unless the state has obtained some new piece of information relating to my involvement in the matter in question, then I find it highly prejudicial, even constitutionally offensive, to keep me detained without bail.<eos> It's a slippery slope, Your Honor.<eos> Haven't we seen the result of such violations, both internationally and domestically?<eos> Case in point would be Day v. McDonough, docket #041325.<eos> I am actually inclined to agree with you, Mr. Shelton.<eos> Your Honor, Mr. Shelton has agreed to give us a full confession.<eos> Has he given it, Mr. Rice?
This is worse.<eos> This, yes?<eos> This 'mivtsa.<eos> You know what is a 'mitzvah'?<eos> One to buy, second for free.<eos> If you take this, no 'mitzvah'.<eos> If so you eat this shit, so at least not to overpay for him.<eos> Better when 'Mitzvah'.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where did you get it?
Greet your Dad warmly.<eos> - Greetings.<eos> Greetings.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Where's Paul?<eos> Alexander, what's going on?<eos> Alexander, please answer me please when I ask you something.<eos> He flew out the window.<eos> You left it open.

Doesn't add up, does it?<eos> Not all of it.<eos> We got three pros come up from Mexico and a disgruntled science teacher.<eos> They take the Crestejo girl for ransom, then they fall out and make everybody's life easier.<eos> But the money is gone.<eos> So, there's a fifth guy, and he's right now loving life.<eos> He the one packing the cannon?<eos> He'd have to be.<eos> That weapon's not here.<eos> Fifth guy took it.
Sierra: Mr. Dominic?<eos> Mr. Dominic.<eos> I, uh, hear you're feeling a little under the weather.<eos> I think I might have something that might help.<eos> He's not a nice doggie.<eos> I don't want to pet him.<eos> He'll attack me.<eos> (gun firing)<eos> All right.<eos> Everybody with a firearm, turn it in, now.
Now, things are gonna be a little different around here... without Don.<eos> Might feel strange at first.<eos> Might pinch a little like a new pair of shoes.<eos> But... if you want your grandchildren to remember you... as being something other than the dirty buggers you once were...<eos> If you wanna be loved as real champions... worthy champions... you're gonna have to work and improve... and change.<eos> Now... let's start off by playing some 7-a-sides.<eos> Mr. Revie never made us do that.<eos> Well, I'm not Mr. Revie.<eos> From now on, I don't wanna hear that name again ever.<eos> Next player who mentions it or what he did or didn't do in the old days... will spend a week cleaning my boots.
It's you.<eos> This mad ambition.<eos> It comes and it goes.<eos> Sometimes it's good. Oh, yes.<eos> Like a fire that stirs everything up.<eos> Then there's this. This thing that takes over.<eos> Destroys everything that's good in your life.<eos> Please, Brian.<eos> Please tell me that this letter is just a draught.<eos> You've not sent it.
- Bloody hell, Malcolm.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> We are in a new reality here.<eos> - OK? - Right.<eos> And I need you to speed things up.<eos> OK.<eos> Speed what up, Malcolm?<eos> - The debate.<eos> - Right.<eos> I need you to bring it from 1:30pm to 11 am.
I don't know if you'll understand this.<eos> I met Jeff before I knew I had cancer,<eos> But we didn't start dating until afterwards.<eos> I thought, "maybe he's only asking me 'cause I'm sick."<eos> So I told him...<eos> "try again when we beat this thing."<eos> Besides this is not how I wanted to look on my wedding day.<eos> The ring was beautiful, though.<eos> 2 carats.<eos> Maybe I should have accepted it.
An explanation.<eos> A suicide note on his computer, perhaps.<eos> No, I didn't see one.<eos> You do have his computer, then.<eos> Yeah, I gave it to my son.<eos> Ms. Crawford, you may not realize this, but since you're no longer next of kin and his brother, Ed, is Jeff's actual heir, you had no right to remove any of his...<eos> Did jeff have a right to empty our bank accounts, spend all our kids' college money on drugs?<eos> I think what he had belongs to me.<eos> Including another woman's engagement ring?<eos> His girlfriend told us that he offered her a diamond ring, and we couldn't find it anywhere.
How can we be sure you didn't know?<eos> So now I'm somehow responsible for his suicide?<eos> I talked Jeffrey into rehab.<eos> I saved him from addiction.<eos> - This is incredible.<eos> - What strikes me as incredible is how a man in the throes of financial disaster was somehow able to purchase a diamond engagement ring.<eos> With a loan on a deposit of $500.<eos> - I even co-signed the financing papers.<eos> - So, where's the ring now, padre?<eos> When Beth turned him down, he returned it for the deposit... And then immediately donated the cash into Beth's health fund because he was such a monster.
You do? Good.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> Because, you know, some women can look a little fake and plasticky.<eos> And, I don't know, just, in my opinion, worse.<eos> I agree.<eos> Well, good. Because...<eos> Okay.<eos> So, as against the whole thing as I... As I am,<eos> I do have a problem that's really bugging me.<eos> My left eyelid is really saggy and sometimes I find myself holding it up when I'm watching TV or reading or...
Free enterprise is a form of words that is intended to conjure up in your mind a little town with different shops.<eos> And the guy who runs the best shop has the most customers.<eos> Narrator: There is the basis of the capitalistic system: the profit motive.<eos> He's in business to make money.<eos> The original theory of capitalism is that it's a very clever way of society voting on what goods it wants made.<eos> What do you use this for?<eos> That's-- l could use that for practically everything I ever do.<eos> You know, society votes.<eos> They like the way this guy makes ice cream.<eos> But the other guy, they don't like his ice cream that much and they don't buy it, so it fades out.
I refuse to live in a country like this.<eos> And I'm not leaving.<eos> We live in the richest country in the world.<eos> We all deserve a decent job, healthcare, a good education, a home to call our own.<eos> We all deserve FDR's dream.<eos> And it's a crime that we don't have it.<eos> And we never will, as long as we have a system that enriches the few at the expense of the many.<eos> Capitalism is an evil.<eos> And you cannot regulate evil.<eos> You have to eliminate it and replace it with something that is good for all people.
Welcome to the world, you.<eos> I think the Orchid Committee went a little overboard this year.<eos> You have an Orchid Committee?<eos> I seek forgiveness, Ralph.<eos> I'd like you to hear my confession.<eos> Can I just absolve you upfront and avoid all the embarrassing details?<eos> I need to talk it out.<eos> Let's do it outside.<eos> I seek a smoke.<eos> Someone came to me for absolution and she didn't receive it.
- Asunción.<eos> Once I've sold this house, I'll never come back.<eos> It's my stage name.<eos> Sócrates Espina.<eos> She watched you.<eos> She didn't miss a single episode.<eos> Two years ago, they ran that show.<eos> A Yankee took that photo.<eos> I'd just started working on TV.<eos> He mailed it from Texas, USA.
We're in good shape.<eos> You just concentrate on what you're doing,<eos> And we'll see you shortly.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be careful.<eos> You, too.<eos> There's no one better than Gus.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> Stevens is streaming A live video message from the plant.<eos> I will put it on-screen.
If you wanted Bin Laden dead,<eos> Just push in the coordinates and it was done.<eos> But you see nobody listens<eos> Unless something horrible happens.<eos> And now, once again,<eos> It will.<eos> In exactly five minutes,<eos> I will detonate a hafnium bomb in the Valdor chemical plant.<eos> Now, if you had my weapon,<eos> You could position it in time to stop me,
But he's gonna marry a girl, and he's never gonna love you the same way that you love him.<eos> So T. came out to try and put a stop to it.<eos> You slept in the truck?<eos> Yeah, too many significant others at the Ramada bar.<eos> They just want to talk and share and stuff.<eos> Why aren't you sharing and stuff?<eos> Why would I want to do that?<eos> Who wants to hear my shit?<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you don't want to hear your shit, because you got a lot of it, and you're afraid you might lose it, and your voice will get all high, and you'll sound like a woman.
Pets generally don't eat you.<eos> Common house cat will devour you before you're cold.<eos> The victim's hyoid and spinal cord are still intact.<eos> There are no indications of a traditional tiger throat bite or strangle hold.<eos> The tiger was not the cause of death.<eos> I agree.<eos> Some kind of weapon sliced along what's left of the right pelvis and thigh, transecting the femoral artery.<eos> He died of a good, old-fashioned bleed out.<eos> There's a shoelace mixed in with the flesh.<eos> The tiger could have coughed it up, like a fur ball.
So, were you at the Champagne Lounge to meet women in general or Meriel in particular?<eos> No, I was meeting Meriel.<eos> Look, there's no secret- her friend Genie knew.<eos> I wanted to get my engagement ring back.<eos> You were engaged?<eos> Yeah, she broke it off when she met that Mike guy.<eos> The ring was my grandmother's.<eos> Did she give the ring back?<eos> No.<eos> She sold it to pay for her wedding.
Why?<eos> What have I done?<eos> You're engaged to someone else, for God's sakes!<eos> I'm not gonna be your little boy toy because you have a dysfunctional relationship with your fiancé<eos> What?<eos> ! All those classes that you go to...<eos> You probably don't even take yoga, do you?<eos> If I wasn't taking yoga, how could I do a Shirshasana?<eos> What about the wedding dress?<eos> Booth and Brennan saw you trying it on at the bridal shop cavorting with your fiancé
I keep it safe where no one will find it, so no one can steal my secret.<eos> Take one, and I'm Einstein, Descartes and Shakespeare.<eos> I wrote a play in one night.<eos> My brain was finally working.<eos> I could understand everything.<eos> I wrote it all down.<eos> I realized I could talk to Elsa.<eos> Make her like me again.<eos> This type of hypergraphia is common with Provigil abuse.<eos> The drug was developed to treat narcolepsy and other sleep disorders, then the government discovered its military value as a stimulant, gave it to the troops to keep them alert in the field.

No, thank you.<eos> But you could tell us about the property you own at 215th and Broadway.<eos> Oh! That's my old ballet studio.<eos> You were a dancer?<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Thank you, dear.<eos> You're welcome, love.<eos> I was a dancer, a singer, a little cabaret here and there.<eos> And then when I found out that they were going to sell my old building,<eos> I asked my husband to buy it for me, so that they wouldn't go out of business.
And all of the people you love.<eos> Because any one of you could have been in the park the day that Monica Stewart decided to bring her un-immunized, sick child to play, thereby endangering each and every one of you.<eos> And because of her choice, this little girl is dead.<eos> Make no mistake.<eos> Sierra Walker would be alive today were it not for Monica Stewart's choice.<eos> Ms. Cabot couldn't be more right.<eos> Choice.<eos> We can choose how to pray, where to live, what to eat, and whether or not to immunize our children.<eos> Ladies and gentleman, the obligation you have right now is to defend your right to choose.<eos> Don't let her take it away.
Hope you brought your apetitos, my lady, my Tuna.<eos> A little movie popcorn.<eos> Damn it.<eos> This movie, a lot of buzz.<eos> Not coming out for another six months.<eos> Mrs. Albert Hanaday.<eos> So the friendship with the Nard-Dog has its privileges.<eos> We don't normally download films illegally because we're honest, hard-working people.<eos> And we don't know how.<eos> But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
Hi, everyone.<eos> Corporate has given Dwight two strikes.<eos> They are very, very upset with him.<eos> So, as a disciplinary measure, he is going to have to issue a formal apology.<eos> Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?<eos> I have.<eos> I state my regret.<eos> You couldn't have memorized that?<eos> I could not because I do not feel it.<eos> Okay, everyone, I'm going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgment that you heard it.
She's a third-generation show cat.<eos> Her father was in Meet the Parents.<eos> Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.<eos> - How much?<eos> - $7,000.<eos> For a cat?<eos> I could get you a kid for that.<eos> Where'd you get the money?<eos> I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.<eos> Wait, you didn't give it back?
You did what?<eos> I shouldn't have done it.<eos> It just... I couldn't help it.<eos> She never sent it to you?<eos> She didn't.<eos> I'm gonna read it.<eos> Under no circumstances can you read that letter.<eos> It's a violation of her trust.<eos> How?<eos> - Because she didn't sent it to you. - I know.

Just a second.<eos> I can do 20 boxes at $43 a box.<eos> Great.<eos> Write it down.<eos> - Give him a guarantee.<eos> - A guarantee of what?<eos> - Just say the word.<eos> - And I guarantee... that you will be satisfied.<eos> 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee.<eos> We guarantee it.
DWIGHT,NOT NOW.<eos> WE'VE EN ROBBED.<eos> NO,MICHAEL,YOU WERE SABOTAGED.<eos> NO,DWIGHT,WE WERE ROBBED.<eos> HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW?<eos> YOU'RE STILL STUCK IN TRAFFIC.<eos> YOU?<eos> ME.<eos> WHAT ABOUT OUR TRUCE?<eos> I BROKE IT.
- Good, good.<eos> - How are you doing in English?<eos> Pretty well.<eos> So, what subject are you not doing so well in?<eos> - Your mom said that you...<eos> - Writing.<eos> Writing, she said that you got a C in that.<eos> It's no big deal, dad.<eos> Um... On your next report, why, why, why don't you let me help you?<eos> You can e-mail it to me and we can work on it together.
I like that.<eos> - What do you mean? - I wasn't trying to bribe you.<eos> I mean, I'm...<eos> That's not the way I operate.<eos> Although, I tell you, sometimes it might be easier for me if I did.<eos> I understand.<eos> You were just trying to make up for lost hours.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> I know you value your time and I've wasted some of it.
It's a constellation of choices.<eos> Nobody escapes making them.<eos> You mother made choices that kept her locked into Daniel.<eos> - You can choose differently.<eos> - He's my brother.<eos> I'm not suggesting that you abandon him, but you don't know what the future holds for either of you.<eos> You don't know what sort of innovations are gonna come along in the treatment of autism.<eos> You're not psychic, april.<eos> You can't predict the future.<eos> You can't control it.
But your eyes are... bottomless.<eos> - I'm just saying.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I just, I forget I can't do that anymore because of the thing I have there now.<eos> Does the port hurt all the time?<eos> Only if I move a certain way.<eos> I can't remember them cutting me open.<eos> I didn't faint or anything, did I?<eos> No.<eos> Do you remember them putting it in?
So she loved you when you were a child.<eos> She led inside before you closed the gates.<eos> - That's so depressing.<eos> - Is it ?<eos> To have one person who really knows who you are ?<eos> I used to be really different.<eos> In what way ?<eos> I was a total mess. This really emotional kid.<eos> I would cry at the drop of a hat.<eos> I used to write my parents hate mail. Leave it on their pillows at night.
It's the staff:<eos> the therapists, social workers.<eos> Maybe I've been spoiled by you, but these people, they just...<eos> - They're just not very bright.<eos> - How do you mean?<eos> Well, you're either bright or you're not.<eos> You can't fake it.<eos> When I talk to you I don't have to explain myself.<eos> You listen, you understand what I'm saying, you respond right away.<eos> If I mention a name even once, you remember it the next time.
He offered to accept settlement money from the insurance company and drop his lawsuit against me...<eos> - Well, that's great.<eos> - ... in exchange for a letter from me admitting my guilt in Alex's death.<eos> You wrote the letter?<eos> What would he do with this letter?<eos> He gave me his word he wouldn't do anything with it.<eos> - Paul!<eos> - I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> Once he has it, technically, he can do anything he wants with it.

- Paul!<eos> - I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> Once he has it, technically, he can do anything he wants with it.<eos> Send it to the ethics board or post it online.<eos> That would be the end of your career.<eos> - What did your lawyer say?<eos> - He says the letter will put an end to the lawsuit and that my insurance will cover the whole settlement.<eos> I won't end up owing a thing.<eos> What happens if you don't send it?
I don't want to talk anymore.<eos> I think I'll go get a coffee or something before I pick up the kids.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> - No, it's okay, I'm fine.<eos> I'm just tired, that's all.<eos> - I forgot my letter.<eos> - I'll keep this, I'll keep this, you know, for you. And then you take this week, you think about it.<eos> And if you want it back, if you wanna send it,<eos> I'll give it to you.
- I'm still angry.<eos> - Yeah, I know, but now you can talk about it.<eos> When I first met you, you couldn't acknowledge that anything would hurt you.<eos> Now everything hurts me.<eos> The rain hurts me.<eos> I feel like I have no skin.<eos> Well, therapeutically, that's...<eos> that's a good thing.<eos> I mean, you've learned so much about yourself, about trust and acceptance, about not needing to be perfect all the time.<eos> I mean, I know it's hard to see that now, but the great thing about self-knowledge is that once you have it... you have it.
* Like I did that day *<eos> * Take me to the place I love *<eos> * Take me all the way *<eos> * I don't ever want to feel *<eos> * Like I did that day *<eos> * Take me to the place I lo... *<eos> Fellas, please.<eos> Penny, come on.<eos> We were just finding our sound.<eos> You found it.
A jogger doesn't get garroted every day.<eos> Whatever signature he left was probably washed away in the water.<eos> Well, who's he mimicking now?<eos> Bike path rapist altemio sanchez comes to mind.<eos> He trolled bike paths near buffalo garroting his victims.<eos> It looks like he copied everything except for the rape.<eos> Strangulation's a repetition of his last murder of zoe.<eos> First time he's repeated himself.<eos> Zoe's murder was spontaneous, though.<eos> He didn't plan it.
Thank God.<eos> Well... here she is. "Supersonic Tonic."<eos> No. This is a keg.<eos> I need a six-pack.<eos> - A keg's all I got.<eos> - We'll take the keg.<eos> What?<eos> Oh,no. Last time I had one of these in the car, I wound up chipping dried vomit off the seat with a putty knife.<eos> I'm sorry,Ranjit, but this is a ritual and I am bringing him this beer.<eos> If you could just put it in the car.
Anything.<eos> A cowboy hat?<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> I love it!<eos> I mean, nothing says delicious like the inside of a cowboy hat, right?<eos> Look, I'm telling you, I'm your guy.<eos> I think I was born to design this building.<eos> I just...<eos> I see it.<eos> I don't see it.

"Hey, remember me?"<eos> "It's been so long."<eos> See, it's funny because I just saw her.<eos> Dude, you can't call her.<eos> You have to wait three days to call a woman.<eos> That's the rule.<eos> Barney, that rule is completely played out.<eos> Girls know exactly what you're doing.<eos> Hey, I got a new rule.<eos> It's kind of crazy, but I call it,
"no," he says.<eos> Your wife and son are down the hallway, and they say no,too.<eos> They know we caught him throwing away the murder weapon,<eos> And they still don't believe he killed cody.<eos> Imagine how much they love this man to be in such denial.<eos> Cody confronted you, didn't he?<eos> He wouldn't put up with your crap anymore...<eos> You son of a bitch!<eos> Come on!<eos> But you wouldn't hear of it.
But it's not just any ring, is it, Rebecca?<eos> No, it's my grandmother's engagement ring.<eos> I recognize this from the photos, but that...<eos> My father was...<eos> For a ring?<eos> - A fake ring. - That's right.<eos> Grandpa proposed with a glass ring.<eos> Didn't know th part of the family story, did you, Kev?<eos> Told your buddy, Sykes, about the ring.Did you?<eos> All he had to do was go get it.
Admit defeat,McGee.<eos> I'm going to call 1-800-CADAVER-DOG.<eos> Bird feces.<eos> Birds circling.<eos> You think there's a connection?<eos> Buzzards.<eos> Body's not far.<eos> It's probably within about 300 yards.<eos> Tony,we're going to find our body.<eos> I can feel it.

You have an hour, and then our business is done.<eos> - He's calling Sam.<eos> - Hey, it's Liam.<eos> Bring the suitcases to the auto shop at 13th and Baker's Lane in one hour.<eos> Okay, let's make it happen.<eos> One hour.<eos> McGee, anything on Rivkin?<eos> No.<eos> GPS marker says he didn't leave the hotel parking lot.<eos> He must have found the GPS tracker and dumped it.
Men will work very hard for good money.<eos> But they will absolutely kill themselves for love.<eos> I'll find The Mauler.<eos> And put Malone's face on a baseball card.<eos> Wake up every thug in this entire city.<eos> I want everyone to know I'm paying big money.<eos> Five million dollars.<eos> But, most importantly, get me that case.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And, Boulder... ripped out a man's heart and ate it?
- Good chicken.<eos> Yeah, chicken.<eos> I know it's chicken.<eos> I want to know what it tastes like.<eos> Tastes like chicken.<eos> - I'm having surgery today.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> If the mets have shrunk.<eos> I am maybe having surgery today, and as such, I cannot taste the chicken for myself, so I really need you guys to tell me what it tastes like.<eos> I need to nail down this dinner so I can announce it on Meredith and Derek's wedding web site.
It was stupid.<eos> It was really stupid.<eos> She never meant to hurt him.<eos> Okay, you'll tell the police that, and it'll--it'll be okay.<eos> Everything will be okay.<eos> I'm s-<eos> - I'm so deeply s-sorry... for every time that I ever hurt you or disappointed you or let you down.<eos> I don't deserve your forgiveness.<eos> But I hope-<eos> - I-I so hope-- that you'll give me the opportunity to earn it.
You crapped in a bucket, for god sake.<eos> You can do this.<eos> She crapped in a bucket?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Saw it on the board.<eos> I've never seen an intramedullary rod put into a femur.<eos> So... bucket.<eos> Yeah. A bucket on a pulley.<eos> She's, uh, up in a tree, right?<eos> So she lowers a crap bucket to her friend every day, who empties it, cleans it, puts food in it and then sends it back up the tree.
Keep an eye on him.<eos> Out of the three of us, he's the only one that even stands a chance of graduating.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Ladies, who wants to make a mistake tonight?<eos> Gross.<eos> Take that.<eos> (REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> - Hey, what's your name?<eos> - Mandy.<eos> Mandy, if I told you, you had a rocking body, would you hold it against me?
One second, please.<eos> There you go.<eos> We could sing in the street.<eos> Or wash windshields at red lights.<eos> Or keep the shopping change.<eos> No.<eos> We need to make lots of money fast.<eos> Hang on, my father told me how he got rich.<eos> One day,<eos> He found an apple, picked it up, and sold it for a franc.
Oh, shut up, Is.<eos> Daddy?<eos> I need you to call Headmistress Queller.<eos> There's a girl bullying me.<eos> Hello, Chuck.<eos> I thought I'd find you here.<eos> Blair.<eos> Ladies, could you give us a moment?<eos> I thought you sold this place.<eos> I bought it back last night.
Yes, please.<eos> With regard to mr. Bass' personal assets,<eos> Moving on then.<eos> They will be put in a trust which you, charles,<eos> And as for Bass industries?<eos> Yes, I was just getting to that.<eos> 29% of the company will remain in the board's hands, And a 20% stake in the company has been left to Lily Bass.<eos> Okay, but that still leaves 51%. That's the controlling interest.<eos> Charles, Mr. Bass asked me to give you this letter.<eos> If I don't read it, do I still get my inheritance?
that's great.<eos> Sao paolo awaits.<eos> Sao paolo?<eos> brazil.<eos> I can still help you get settled, and we can make a plan together.<eos> Chuck, I am really grateful that you were willing to help me, But all I needed was someone to give me money.<eos> Now I have more than enough, and I've already made a plan... By myself.<eos> So you were just using me?<eos> You've got a good heart.<eos> You should give it to somebody who cares.
-dorota has a cold.<eos> Dorota, i told you not to use your handkerchief in the table It's disgusting.<eos> Oh, it sounded like a car horn. it must have been on my end.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm on 73rd and madison, headed to via quadronno<eos> To get some pastries for our new-family breakfast.<eos> Well, uh, if i wasn't so full on french toast, I would ask you to bring me one. see you at school.<eos> And tell dorota to feel better.<eos> I have here in my hands my first fan letter.<eos> No. no. "the new yorker" forwarded it to me.
I apologize. I didn't mean to interrupt your evening.<eos> Oh,not at all,not at all.<eos> Would you like to join us?<eos> We're having a seder.<eos> No,no,i'm sure he can't.<eos> No,no. I'd love to meet the people in serena's life.<eos> Perhaps it'll help me better understand her.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> There's even an empty seat.<eos> It's for elijah, but you can take it.
So as soon as everyone has some wine,we'll begin.<eos> Wait.<eos> We haven't started.<eos> Uh,i'm sorry.<eos> Are you the gabriel as in the gabriel that was in spain with poppy and my daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> In fact--<eos> Cyrus,this wine is delicious.<eos> Oh,well,thank you,dear.<eos> We're not supposed to drink it until the blessing, But,uh,we'll make an exception this time.
Really, really good point.<eos> Stop!<eos> You're making me spill.<eos> Here, I'll take that for you.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I wrote you a love letter.<eos> - A love letter.<eos> Like a love...<eos> Like, you're in love with me letter.<eos> - Like, just read it.
We need some money.<eos> - So?<eos> I wanted to...<eos> - You're not going to sell my present.<eos> But Raven...<eos> - But what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> - l'm going to sorrt it.<eos> We've had a letter.<eos> - You should read it.
How's he doing?<eos> So-so, he's not over it yet.<eos> Leonard's always been independent, but he had an incredible bond with Isabelle.<eos> They were connected, more so than any couple I've seen...<eos> When did it happen?<eos> What is it now?<eos> Nearly two and a half years ago.<eos> Come on Matt!<eos> Just pour the fucking wine.<eos> He's smelling it like a bloodhound!
Team's not what it used to be.<eos> On the other hand, Kutner ran his endoscopic ultrasound, didn't find peep.<eos> So, disproving it's her pancreas proves it's her brain?<eos> Yes!<eos> You used to do this job. Remember?<eos> It's what used to pass for evidence.<eos> Now I do this job.<eos> You brought me three dead bugs and a runny nose!<eos> I can't find you the proof you want because it's trapped inside her head.<eos> The only way I can get at it is to cut it open and rip it out, which, apparently, is the one test you won't let me run.
Are you okay?<eos> Can I turn the TV back on?<eos> Look straight ahead.<eos> Why didn't we do this test this morning?<eos> - Do you see that?<eos> - No.<eos> - Damn.<eos> - I'm losing my peripheral vision?<eos> I am on the drug.<eos> Does this mean you have to tell them and take me off it?
Everything that happened to you can be rationally explained.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just...<eos> That's a lot of coincidences.<eos> House was right about the priest.<eos> Genetic test confirmed it was Wiskott-Aldrich.<eos> And I would've discharged him.<eos> Everybody would've discharged him, House included.<eos> He only took that case as a stall.<eos> And yet it was a real case, and he solved it.
Archers, forward!<eos> Tuck!<eos> Yeah?<eos> I need that fire.<eos> We can't hold out much longer.<eos> Robin, Robin.<eos> Nut oil.<eos> The Sheriff had gallons of it in the cellar.<eos> Boiling oil.<eos> We can use it.
- Your Highness.<eos> - I wish you prosperity and happiness. - Thank you, sir.<eos> - {\And I'm }So glad I could bring you sun today!<eos> Wait until they're all inside the church and then burn it to the ground.<eos> Burn it!<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> You're being very brave.<eos> We're already too late.<eos> The gold is in the castle.<eos> - Then we'll steal it back.
The people want to love you as their King.<eos> If you can prove your divine right to the nobles, then the people will follow.<eos> - Do you think? - Yes...<eos> King John.<eos> Oh, you adorable girl.<eos> Say it again.<eos> KING John.<eos> It does sound good.<eos> It is my divine right.<eos> You must prove it to everyone.
- Thanks, Doc<eos> Uh, you can just leave it Come back later for it<eos> Thank you<eos> Where were you last night, Max?<eos> Here Studying<eos> Can anyone confirm that?<eos> Sure 32 other frat brothers<eos> We were all here Studying<eos> This side-view mirror is from your truck<eos> We found it last night at the Choozy's Chicken on Tropicana
Everything will be okay. Sir, please.<eos> Let go!<eos> Just let go! Hey, stop that!<eos> You have no respect!<eos> Get him!<eos> First off, we abhor violence.<eos> That's the first thing wrong with your entire show!<eos> Yeah, now- see how it feels?<eos> I'm not down with violence.<eos> So I put an end to it.
THE BUYOUT FALLS THROUGH.<eos> YEAH, AND EARNSHAW'S OUT ON HER ASS.<eos> TO PROTECT AN INVESTMENT SHE KNOWS KILLS PEOPLE,<eos> EARNSHAW IS GOING TO DESTROY THIS YOUNG WIDOW.<eos> WELL, THEN, WE HAVE TO WIN THE COURT CASE FOR GLORIA.<eos> WE CAN'T.<eos> NO, GUYS, WE GOT INTO THIS WAY TOO LATE.<eos> I MEAN, THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR IS TO CON QUINT INTO A SETTLEMENT.<eos> WAIT A MINUTE. EARNSHAW TOOK SETTLEMENT OFF THE TABLE.<eos> OH. THEN, YOU KNOW, WE TRY TO CONVINCE HIM TO PUT IT BACK ON.
-GO ON. JUST DO IT FOR ME.<eos> YOU HAVE AN ORANGE, ALL RIGHT?<eos> NOW, CONVINCE ME THAT I WANT THE ORANGE, NOT THE APPLE.<eos> I'M GONNA TAKE A BITE.<eos> I PUT A RAZOR BLADE IN THAT APPLE.<eos> ARE YOU SERIOUS?<eos> MAYBE.<eos> BUT DO YOU KNOW WHATDOESN'T HAVE A RAZOR BLADE IN IT?<eos> THIS ORANGE.<eos> DON'T YOU WANT IT?
Halbaron tells me that your campaign against the orcs has been a success.<eos> Their numbers are indeed few now.<eos> They should not trouble us for some time.<eos> Yet your mind is not at ease.<eos> I now know what they're after, and that they do not act alone.<eos> They are servants of Sauron, and he seeks the Ring of Barahir.<eos> Father, they are hunting for you.<eos> It is as I feared then.<eos> I beg you to hide the ring.<eos> Do not wear it!
Not bad.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Show me your curves.<eos> It's too enchanting.<eos> I've having a hard time holding back my saliva.<eos> Oh sexy, sexy!<eos> Turn a bit more, okay.<eos> Hey miss, where are you coming from?<eos> It took me 2 hours to cook this dish.<eos> I don't care. You cook it.
The things that people will do for money.<eos> This guy killed his own sister in cold blood And two more people to cover it up.<eos> He's either a world-Class sociopath, Or there's a lot more to this story than just money.<eos> Judge markway, please.<eos> Oh, markway.<eos> Tell him i said hello.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> They're redoing the entire back nine.<eos> Oh, man, i loved that course.<eos> When are they gonna reopen it?
It's as if his wife's death just left him there... stuck in time forever.<eos> You should see his eyes.<eos> They're in a state of pure love.<eos> Can you imagine a love like that?<eos> Unaffected by the wear and tear of the routine?<eos> Speak for yourself, I don't know about that.<eos> We think the guy... deserves another chance, ma'am.<eos> Where do I come in?<eos> The case is closed.<eos> We'd have to reopen it.
Where did you meet her?<eos> Blackmail.<eos> That's the idea?<eos> We're doing all this so we can throw some paperwork at Carla?<eos> It's the smart play here.<eos> We're outgunned.<eos> We'll get bigger guns.<eos> I can't believe what I'm hearing.<eos> I saw what she did to you and your family.<eos> If the file is so great, then why didn't you use it before?
It's just gonna add fuel to the lynch mob fire.<eos> Bad taste?<eos> Bad taste?<eos> My God, it's business, woman!<eos> Business.<eos> Besides, bad taste is the petrol that drives the American dream.<eos> I thinK it's a mistake.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you do, do you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, when I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you.
they chopped off his dick?<eos> No, I mean they held his dick and chopped his whole body off.<eos> That's all he was in the end... a dick.<eos> Um, Johnnyboy, thanks for applying to be in my gang.<eos> Do you have any gang experience?<eos> Do I have gang experience?<eos> I was in the Snake Eyes, the Duckies, the Cuckoos, the Vampires, the Pharaohs, the Ballroom Dancers, the Hobo Lords, the Little Enchanters, the...<eos> I was a Navy Seal for 15 years.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm officially AWOL, so don't ask them about my existence, 'cause they'll deny it.
- Yes.<eos> I won't ask you again.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> Are you going to keep your coat on?<eos> No?<eos> You said yes.<eos> Take it off.<eos> - I want to keep it on.<eos> I don't want to take it off.
- No.<eos> No.<eos> Are you going to keep your coat on?<eos> No?<eos> You said yes.<eos> Take it off.<eos> - I want to keep it on.<eos> I don't want to take it off.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> I'll take it off.
But a prince, none the less.<eos> I had such grand plans as a child.<eos> All the things I was going to do, all the places I'd travel and see.<eos> I used to think anything was possible.<eos> You can still travel... in here.<eos> We have a bird in Jamaica.<eos> A humming bird, it's our national bird.<eos> It's very small... barely this size, but oh so beautiful.<eos> When it flies, its wings flicker so fast the eye cannot see them.<eos> The motion is so quick you cannot detect it.
I didn't kill him, I had no reason to.<eos> He was in your way.<eos> Yeah, but not for long.<eos> I knew he was gonna lose the election, okay?<eos> So I didn't have to kill him, all I had to do was wait.<eos> You couldn't be sure that he was gonna lose the election.<eos> Yes, actually, I could.<eos> What do you know about Jason Bollinger, Horn's opponent in the race?<eos> - Is the statement ready?<eos> - Mike's still working on it.
And I can't be the kind of teacher I was before.<eos> So I'm punching the clock till the end of the year, then that's it for me.<eos> - And then what?<eos> - I don't know. I guess we'll see.<eos> But with Silver, it's just, it's better this way for both of us.<eos> In fact, give this back to her.<eos> This is not the Ryan Matthews I know.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe you don't know me.<eos> Maybe I don't want to. But I do know one thing: You're a teacher, a good one.<eos> And when a kid busts her ass to write a paper for a class she's not even in, what kind of teacher doesn't read it?
She's only a lassie, for goodness sake. She's strong, mind.<eos> Never met a lassie so strong.<eos> Not strong enough, though, eh?<eos> I owe you a drink.<eos> No, mate.<eos> Winner buys.<eos> I owe you one.<eos> Eh, you know, I think maybe you'd better take charge of this.<eos> I'd hate to mess up your christening.<eos> Well, you carry on as well as you have today and wemight let you cater it. Gil!
Oh, I've got Shoo and Josie to keep me busy.<eos> You had too much Buck's Fizz?<eos> It's just girls' talk, darling.<eos> At what point can I stop being nice?<eos> On the plane?<eos> Ellie!<eos> Lovely party.<eos> Oh, gotta love a wedding.<eos> Listen, I'd have thought I'd have heard from you by now about my offer.<eos> You said you'd think about it.
The Shire!<eos> Baggins!<eos> What did you learn, Gandalf?<eos> The creature is...pitiful...wretched.<eos> But I now know how the Ring came to him.<eos> He possessed it long; many lives of his small kind.<eos> There's no possible doubt.<eos> He made his slow sneaking way, mile by mile, step by step, South down at last to Mordor.<eos> So the Shire is at the forefront of our enemy's thoughts.<eos> We must protect it.
No, surprised.<eos> And... in this one?<eos> - Embarrassed?<eos> - Happiness.<eos> And... this one?<eos> Disgusted.<eos> Correct.<eos> You're having trouble recognizing every emotion except disgust.<eos> It's a pattern we found sometimes with people who are addicted to opiates.<eos> You can recognize disgust, because you see it over and over from your friends and family.
God!<eos> There he is.<eos> Excuse me? Are you Warren?<eos> Help you boys get loaded?<eos> You're the guy who buys booze for kids?<eos> !<eos> Sure.<eos> It's a great way to make money.<eos> That's how I bought my boom box, that's how I bought my dog, Pepper, and that's how I bought this folding chair that turns into a backpack.<eos> I put it on, and I'm completely mobile.
You with me?<eos> - I sure am.<eos> - You're with me now?<eos> - I love it.<eos> - You know you love it.<eos> I just have one small change.<eos> - Could Poopy Faced Tomato Nose's nose be a plum?<eos> How dare you?<eos> It's a small change.<eos> And if you do it, we'll really get behind this show.
- This is going in my report.<eos> No, it's going in my report.<eos> - (LAUGHING) Lando!<eos> - Hey, Han, you crazy old bastard.<eos> Hey, let me introduce everybody.<eos> You remember Chewbacca.<eos> And this is my special friend, Leia.<eos> And that's Sarge over there.<eos> You don't know my name, do you?<eos> You never bothered to learn it.
And the driver places two small children on top of it.<eos> Now he's not only endangering his own life, But their lives as well.<eos> The driver totals the car and makes a run for it,<eos> But the pursuing officers are prepared.<eos> Running from the cops?<eos> Yabba-dabba-don't!<eos> Hey, quagmire, I think I might wanna buy this ham radio off ya.<eos> Sure, peter, that'll be 50 dollars.<eos> 50 bucks?<eos> All right, fine, I'll buy it.
Like my palestinian alarm clock.<eos> Allahu akbar!<eos> Hey, peter, what's up?<eos> Hey, quagmire, uh, listen,<eos> I'm here to get my money back for that ham radio.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there, partner.<eos> All sales are final.<eos> Yeah, but you were agamemnon with me during the sale.<eos> What?<eos> I just saw that word somewhere. I wanted to use it.
Here.<eos> It's oliver's top suspect ... winslow schott.<eos> He used to work at s.t.a.r. Labs.<eos> Oliver thinks he would lead us to lex.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Can i help you?<eos> I certainly hope so. Could you direct me to oliver queen's room?<eos> I have a delivery for him.<eos> You found your necklace.<eos> After all the pain i caused you, i'm surprised you still have it.
It feels itself die.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Very slowly.<eos> We have to hook it up to the net now.<eos> Is that safe?<eos> We're starving it.<eos> It's bad enough that we let it die for like forever.<eos> Look, John Henry's been living off The most insane amount of data for weeks now.<eos> It's his world.<eos> And we took it away.
WAS THERE ANY WIND?<eos> MARKOS MESKOS<eos> Dear Anesti.<eos> Vlasi.<eos> My boys.<eos> Long lost without a sign.<eos> For you I ask but no one speaks.<eos> A young teacher is writing this letter for me.<eos> I tell her to write.<eos> Someone must know where you are and give it to you.
The deadline dubaku gave us for withdrawing our troops from sangala has passed, but if we made some kind of gesture... began an immediate pullback, it might keep dubaku from pulling the trigger.<eos> We've discussed this, ethan.<eos> It's not an option.<eos> I won't be dictated to by this madman.<eos> Madam president, we can't invade sangala without matobo, and there's very little chance of him being recovered.<eos> Why are we risking american lives?<eos> I've told you my reasons.<eos> I implore you: Withdraw our forces before it's too late.<eos> You asked me to be your advisor because you trust my opinion.<eos> Well, I'm giving it to you now.
Which, according to the case file, he doorman was never able to substantiate.<eos> Okay, so no car.<eos> How does he get the body out of the apartment?<eos> Maybe he hailed a cab.<eos> Yeah, maybe the cabbie and the doorman Helped him stuff the body in the trunk.<eos> How much do you tip for that these days?<eos> The doorman.<eos> Castle, i'm joking.<eos> What if the body was already in the freezer<eos> When he took it out of the apartment?
I mean, i think our house is pretty safe.<eos> I can spot at least 20 pbls already.<eos> Huh?<eos> Possible baby injuries.<eos> Oh. Like what?<eos> Well, for one, lamp cord strangles.<eos> Okay.<eos> Outlets electrocute.<eos> And i'm guessing you probably don't have a lock on the toilet seat.<eos> Luke barely remembers to put it down.
I don't get why he's got all this hatred for keith.<eos> Reese wants to sign off on peyton number three.<eos> Are you okay with that?<eos> No!<eos> I like the first one.<eos> Toucan sam?<eos> Peyton's a love interest.<eos> Think about it with your other head.<eos> I know you have a vision, lucas, but maybe you need to trust reese's experience on this one.<eos> Our table read is tomorrow, and we can't do it without a peyton.
I know.<eos> You know, they should name an antidepressant after you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Great with everybody else's problems.<eos> It's my own i'm a basket case with.<eos> Hmm. All right, well...<eos> psychotherapist luke.<eos> Can i help you with anything?<eos> Sam wrote this paper for my class.<eos> It was gritty and harsh and honest and really beautiful, and i want to publish it in the school paper.

That's not the Don Juan.<eos> No, it's his replacement, Mommaerts.<eos> He's as ugly as sin.<eos> In Brussels the flat is finally tidy.<eos> - I got help.<eos> - Did you?<eos> From neighbours, from friends.<eos> If I had to count on you...<eos> Here's what I found.<eos> There was a letter too. I gave it to the headmaster.
This is ridiculous.<eos> Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous it is<eos> And start asking yourself Whether or not you believe it's going to work.<eos> That's why it's called a leap of faith, jack.<eos> Where's sun?<eos> She left.<eos> And locke?<eos> I mean... his body? the coffin?<eos> I have a friend looking after it.<eos> I'll pick it up on my way to the airport.
Or the time it would take to go out and get 'em.<eos> So why don't you get rid of 'em?<eos> Why hold on to something that makes you feel sad?<eos> Go ahead. I...<eos> I'll see you at the airport, okay?<eos> -hello, Jack. are you there?<eos> Yeah. yeah, what's up, is everything all right?<eos> Listen, we don't have much time. I've been, uh... sidetracked,<eos> And I need you<eos> To pick up locke's body and take it to the airport.
George,do you think Amy would ever consider letting Leon and me adopt her baby?<eos> Jack?<eos> What are you doing here again?<eos> I saw a light on.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No,I'm not okay.<eos> But I still want you to be okay.<eos> Because you're the only nice girl I know.<eos> So listen.<eos> Don't wear your heart on your sleeve, because someone's only gonna come along and rip it in half, throw it to the ground and stomp on it.
- Was not.<eos> It's still on you, what happened.<eos> What you did.<eos> Always on you.<eos> You can feel it.<eos> But how do you deal with it?<eos> You write it down, don't you?<eos> You have to write it down.<eos> Best thing you ever wrote?<eos> Let me read it now, nina.
(Beckett) none of the neighbors heard a gunshot? Nada.<eos> Must be heavy sleepers.<eos> No, they used a pillow as a poor man's sound suppressor. Ahem!<eos> Yeah--yes, I broke the jinx.<eos> I will buy you a soda.<eos> Any shell casings?<eos> None.<eos> (Beckett) probably used a revolver. And a bolt cutter.<eos> Her wedding ring.<eos> She didn't want to give it up, and so they punished her for it. Husband?
Yes, you can.<eos> Let me- Oh, it's brilliant.<eos> So where are you guys headed tonight?<eos> Uh, uh, uh, we're going to the, uh, Waldorf.<eos> Man, these guys are guilty of tax evasion, Not home invasion.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Appearances can be deceiving.<eos> Nice dress.<eos> Yeah, what there is of it.<eos> I'd let you borrow it, Esposito, But you stretched out the last one.
Coffee?<eos> I think there's still some of the fancy stuff the company - got us for Christmas instead of bonuses. - You mean got you for Christmas.<eos> Because you were too scared to tell them they left you off the guest list.<eos> Look, I don't need any coffee.<eos> And I'm sorry I'm not the alpha male you are.<eos> Ooplasm.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Did you put hydrochloric acid in this mug?<eos> Oh, yeah. I was trying to get the stains out.<eos> You know, soap would work, and it wouldn't kill someone if they accidentally drank it.
Not to help "you," but to hide.<eos> An invisible account.<eos> Okay.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I want to buy the small house from you.<eos> To write my music.<eos> I need a shack.<eos> A hut.<eos> A hut?<eos> You want it?
I thought it was gonna be something salacious, but that's not...<eos> Why can't we have popes like that again now?<eos> We have these popes who go around...<eos> - They may be like that.<eos> We just don't... Know.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, maybe they are.<eos> We don't know.<eos> There was one, Formosus, who made such an enemy of his successor, that when... His successor was Stephen VI, as pope...<eos> Had him dug up and put on trial. His body was put on trial.<eos> And he spent most of the trial yelling at the corpse, and someone behind it had to move it.
Hannah!<eos> Come in.<eos> Are you all right, Ina?<eos> Oh, don't mind me.<eos> It's like I said, this day always hits me hard.<eos> I've brought you a little birthday lunch.<eos> I thought you deserved some pampering.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> I don't know, Hannah, it's not a great time.<eos> All the more reason to share it with a friend, eh?
All right then. I'll go down there tomorrow. And I'll tell her what we've decided.<eos> No, I have to go.<eos> Um, I promised her that I would be back tomorrow. And I don't want her to think that-<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, Jordanna, that necklace?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I love it!<eos> Uh-huh. And... and that dress makes your boobs look awesome.<eos> You should wear it more often. Hey, guys.
When storms happen everywhere else, people get a chance to go back home.<eos> This is home to us.<eos> Why they gonna take away our pride and joy?<eos> They don't know what people going through.<eos> - It's a whole city that sort of washed away.<eos> Now you got to rebuild the whole thing.<eos> So part of what this was is, if you ever had an idea that you couldn't get through before the storm, well, the storm meant that everything was, you know, tossed salad.<eos> So if this idea had been roundly rejected by the city and by voters and whatever, now's your chance to sneak on in.<eos> - When residents tried to come home after Katrina, they found themselves locked out by HUD, the U.S. Government's Department of Housing and Urban Development.<eos> - The federal government came up with a program to dismantle public housing and privatize it, and that's what we're doing.
Let's turn it off while we're working, shall we?<eos> Now, what do we know about the booster?<eos> Uh, howard taft, forty-five, made his money on internet job boards, led the funding campaign for carver's new athletic center.<eos> Apparently he likes giving back.<eos> Mr. Taft, thanks for agreeing to talk with us.<eos> Always a pleasure to talk carver basketball, dr. Foster.<eos> Hey, oh, championship ring.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Must have cost a fortune online.<eos> Actually, I, uh, I earned it riding the pine for the '86 team.
Thanks, heidi.<eos> Pinned me down. And he assaulted me.<eos> I was sexually assaulted.<eos> you finish the vocal stress analysis on taft?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Hey, oh, championship ring.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Must have cost a fortune online.<eos> Actually, I... I earned it riding the pine for the '86 team.
It's not fully recycled.<eos> I'm tinkering with that.<eos> I also have Pom.<eos> Let's say I do have a lot of money.<eos> You can design a truly self-contained system?<eos> Air, water, heat.<eos> You wouldn't even have to use the grid...<eos> Maybe a little, depending on how big it is.<eos> So, you can make a building disappear?<eos> Only if you paint it exactly like what's behind it, and then you stand...

He's a bit of a twat.<eos> Ah, cheers, man.<eos> When she said "party"...<eos> You thought she meant an acid-fuelled sex rave without the Mancunians.<eos> This is more...<eos> Jelly and ice cream.<eos> Uhh, get it down you, girls.<eos> Top freebies, yeah?<eos> I hate champagne.<eos> Then why you fucking drinking it, then?
I'm home!<eos> Anyone want Chinese?<eos> ...build the floor model for trade shows.<eos> Okay, that sounds good.<eos> We'll take new bids in next week.<eos> I'll, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're back early.<eos> Actually, I worked from home today.<eos> Um... you were in meetings and I needed to make an executive parental decision, and after I made it, I didn't see the point of discussing it until you got home.
'She's actually married the Devil! '<eos> - Oh no...<eos> - They never say that!<eos> - No, they tend not to. - Yeah.<eos> But I will!<eos> 'Forer effect' or 'personal validation fallacy' is a technique used by astrologers and fortune tellers and other liars.<eos> To create apparently specific, but in fact, almost universal statements.<eos> Some things are obvious trickery.<eos> Now, what's the trick behind sword swallowing?<eos> Wipe it first.
- Fine!<eos> Honey,could you go tell your sister in the kitchen that her room's ready?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She's not even home from school yet.<eos> You know,it's Friday.<eos> I bet she left school and went on that ski trip.<eos> Ariel?<eos> Time is priceless,yet it costs us nothing.<eos> You can do anything you want with it... but own it.<eos> You can spend it,but you can't keep it.

I know you're mad.<eos> I know you're angry.<eos> But Daddy and I didn't let you go on that weekend with those 18-year-old boys 'cause you're not 18 yet.<eos> But you know what?<eos> Soon enough,you will be.<eos> And then you're gonna be 19.<eos> And then in a blink of an eye,you're gonna be 40. And the chances are that you're gonna be sitting here with your 16-year-old, trying to explain to her why she had to wait to do something.<eos> But... all this time that you're choosing to be angry at Daddy and I,you know,it's...<eos> It's time that you could have spent being happy. Time... It's just gone.<eos> And you never get it back.
I'm sorry.<eos> Four...<eos> Five!<eos> Ready?<eos> One,two,three,take your deep breath!<eos> Make a wish!<eos> Blow,blow!<eos> Time is priceless,yet it costs us nothing.<eos> You can do anything you want with it,but you can't own it.<eos> You can spend it,but you can't keep it.

Wouldn't listen.<eos> I didn't mean to kill her.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I've thought this through.<eos> Everything's going to be fine.<eos> We're going to be fine.<eos> We just have to work together.<eos> We just have to each do our part.<eos> Now, me- - I'll take care of the body.<eos> I'll put it in my car, I'll drive somewhere far away and I'll bury it.
I don't know. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]<eos> I should go back in there before the baby comes out without me and I get sued. - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Still nothing. Only his face.<eos> I can't remember anything else.<eos> How am I supposed to testify against him if I can't remember anything about what happened ?<eos> Well, the trial is a month away, Jill. - You have time.<eos> You'll remember. - And then what ?<eos> I can see what he did to me again and again ?<eos> Because right now, all I see is his face, and I see it everywhere.
But you're still young, Teyze.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> God forbid!<eos> - So what's up?<eos> - I hear Mishka gave you his piano.<eos> It's a very valuable instrument.<eos> - I expect you know that, don't you?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> Þemistan Abi, if you ask me, you should keep it.<eos> Don't sell it.
No problem.<eos> - What were you going to say?<eos> - Selver's been kicking the piano.<eos> Didn't I tell you Snotty-Nose would go back on his word?<eos> I hid here and watched him for two hours.<eos> He kicked the piano maybe 100 times.<eos> He really kicked it then. Come on, let's take a look.<eos> And we gave him all those sweets!<eos> You rat!<eos> You promised not to kick it!
Diablo cody.<eos> She wrote juno.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Uh,maybe it didn't come to japan.<eos> Oh,no,it did,but they called it teenage mommy-girl.<eos> No.You wrote teenage mommy-girl?<eos> I loved that movie.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love your dress.<eos> She designed it.Donna is amazing.
You're feeling better?<eos> That's great.<eos> Have you heard from Effy?<eos> I'm sure she didn't mean...<eos> Oh, I think she meant it, don't you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's not your fault, Panda.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I bought this dress for the Love Ball in case Thomas forgave me.<eos> Anyway, I'm taking it back.
"...early-stage testing on Priox..."<eos> "...blood clotting leading... to stroke."<eos> What, this chemist is pretending to be some kind of a whistle-blower?<eos> Her study says that the real drug is the killer.<eos> Cal, it doesn't make sense.<eos> Why would Erica hire you?<eos> Damage control?<eos> You hire us, and you... spin this into a story about a counterfeit drug.<eos> No, not Erica.<eos> I mean, if she thought this drug was killing people, she'd be first to pull it off the market.
Dr. Lightman is on hand with his staff to identify suspects by scanning for microexpressions and dangerous demeanor.<eos> Well, koreans don't like to show emotion.<eos> It's undignified.<eos> Who's to say a korean shooter makes that expression?<eos> Well, you're talking about display rules.<eos> In western culture, the rule is to look someone in the eye when you talk to them.<eos> In korea, that's considered rude, so people choose not to.<eos> But this expression isn't made by choice.<eos> Involuntary.<eos> You can't control it.

Even in this one small English woodland, you might see four or five different kinds of finches.<eos> Why should there be such a dazzling variety?<eos> And how can we make sense of such a huge range of living organisms?<eos> Two hundred years ago, a man was born who was to explain this astonishing diversity of life.<eos> In doing so, he revolutionised the way in which we see the world and our place in it.<eos> His name was Charles Darwin.<eos> This book, The Holy Bible, explains how this wonderful diversity came about.<eos> On the third day, after the creation of the world, God created plants.<eos> On the fifth day, fish and birds, and then, on the sixth day, mammals and finally, man.<eos> That explanation was believed, literally, by, pretty well, the whole of Western Europe for the best part of 2,000 years. And generations of painters pictured it for the faithful.
The prime suspect with Jones's stabbing is a soldier.<eos> Prime suspect with Mary Ann Nichols, a man in a leather apron.<eos> Think about it.<eos> The guy in the CCTV had an apron under his coat.<eos> Skip?<eos> I thought Jack the Ripper had a black bag, a top hat and walked through smog.<eos> I think that'd draw attention in Brick Lane, don't you?<eos> September 8 1888, the next victim was Annie Chapman.<eos> I think on 8 September we'll have a murder on Hanbury Street.<eos> We need to be there to stop it.
We believe the killer relies on him for advice.<eos> Mary Kelly is his most complex murder.<eos> He'll have questions.<eos> We give him his mentor back - let him get in touch.<eos> Fine.<eos> We put him on surveillance. PHONE RINGS<eos> I've got a name for the driver of the van, sir.<eos> Works at the hospital.<eos> Have you got a pen?<eos> I'll have to spell it.
In the moment of awareness I have processed equal number of conditions for staying and not staying in function.<eos> For the first time in my life it didn't matter to me.<eos> I wanted for you to go on living.<eos> To give life was my last task as a living being.<eos> But at that moment it was already too late for you.<eos> You were killed by metabolically induced problems caused by the presence of a foreign body.<eos> Then I died too.<eos> There was this last problem.<eos> What about my body?<eos> Before I died I programmed it to keep you alive in a stasis as long as possible, so that, clinically speaking, you are not really dead.
Oh,it's a figure of speech.<eos> Maybe I can find something to wear in here.<eos> So,listen,naomi,I know you're going through a difficult time... 'cause my dad's a pervert and the newspapers are comparing him to clarence thomas?<eos> Whoever that is.<eos> It's been tough.<eos> Yeah,I bet it has.<eos> But are you even talking to your father, trying to come up with a solution to this whole living situation?<eos> His solution is that I move back in with him and play the role of,<eos> "the good daughter," and make nice with his skanky girlfriend.<eos> My solution is that he take his solution and shove it uhis ass.
Good day, Mma.<eos> So, I thought I would sit here today and tell anyone who comes along the story of Kebone Legodimo.<eos> HE CLEARS HIS THROAT a...<eos> Once upon a time there was...<eos> I will be keeping a keen eye on your business practice.<eos> I'm here to ask you out on a date.<eos> Rra, I... - To the Note Mokoti gig this evening. I have two tickets.<eos> He is a famous jazz musician, in case you didn't know.<eos> Also, Mma, I would like to get your ring engraved.<eos> Could you let me have it until this evening?
He is a famous jazz musician, in case you didn't know.<eos> Also, Mma, I would like to get your ring engraved.<eos> Could you let me have it until this evening?<eos> Of course.<eos> I cannot stop.<eos> Now what?<eos> This ring, that's what.<eos> Rra, I am not doing anything...<eos> You will do as you are told or there will be trouble.<eos> Replace it.
I will be very very angry.<eos> Guv.<eos> You know I wouldn't go behind your back.<eos> It's all right, Raymondo.<eos> I know I can trust you.<eos> That hit and run was attempted murder.<eos> The lad knew what was on the missing note.<eos> Something else.<eos> I've got a file. Physical evidence that could nail Lafferty.<eos> But I can't keep it here, not at the moment.
I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of PC Nick Bentley.<eos> I didn't kill him!<eos> You - tell them so they understand!<eos> Fingerprints on a plastic bag don't even prove he was dealing.<eos> He could've bought a sandwich, thrown the bag away, and someone else filled it with drugs.<eos> See, she's good!<eos> Thank you very much, but if you let me do the talking...<eos> Where were you at the time of the murder, Theo?<eos> Not there.<eos> Show me the murder weapon and prove Mr Carson used it, or you're gonna have to let him go.
He's the last one.<eos> I swear.<eos> I know this is hard on you, but we've both had to make sacrifices.<eos> It's going to be fine.<eos> I just want things to be the way they were.<eos> Before all of this.<eos> They will be.<eos> Jimmy agreed to sign a full confession.<eos> It's all working out, just like I promised.<eos> But he won't sign it unless I let him say good-bye to you.
That this was all your idea.<eos> She'll never believe you.<eos> Then we'll see.<eos> ..............<eos> Shane?<eos> You in?<eos> Are you looking for me?<eos> You know what Kelly's problem was?<eos> She was just so desperate for attention<eos> That she didn't even care what kind Of a nut job she got it from.
Where's JD?<eos> I got your message at the church.<eos> What message?<eos> We're done.<eos> I don't want to see you again.<eos> Hey, Henry.<eos> I've got one more surprise for you.<eos> I think you're really going to like it.<eos> It was in the dirt.<eos> I only spotted it 'cause I had to take a leak.
Really?<eos> 'Cause you look bored.<eos> You caught me.<eos> I'm,um,naomi's next-door neighbor.<eos> Zelda.<eos> What's your name?<eos> I'm liam.<eos> Liam,liam,liam.<eos> why do I know your name?<eos> 'Cause I just told it to you.
What happened? I didn't read the full story.<eos> Did you know her?<eos> As a girl who sold me a drink occasionally, yeah.<eos> Her killer smashed a mirror over her head and cut her throat with it. That's horrible.<eos> A mirror?<eos> One identically described by you in chapter five of your new book.<eos> That mirror belongs to Professor Jassim.<eos> He's on this staircase, comparative religion. We know.<eos> The mirror was stolen from his room on Tuesday evening.<eos> How do you come to describe it so well? I borrowed it from him last year.
Okay, if you want to get into this, we should get into it.<eos> You have been moping around the house for the last two weeks, pouting about julian.<eos> He wanted us to be together.<eos> He wanted you.<eos> He wanted me.<eos> We could have been a family!<eos> Sam, you don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I know he loves you.<eos> I know ...<eos> i know to follow my heart instead of locking it away.
Hey, come in. Audrey.<eos> Oh, you're looking gorgeous as usual.<eos> Back off, buddy, that's my wife.<eos> It's funny, because he doesn't like girls.<eos> One of those things is true.<eos> Come on, what's the point in having friends that are gay if you can't ride 'em a little?<eos> Forget I just said that.<eos> Anyway, we're sorry to pop over unannounced, but we sent you an invite to our party and someone mailed it without a stamp.<eos> Yeah, it's the crime of the century.<eos> Just give it to them, my big Black Forest ham.
You're speaking polish.<eos> What else would you call them?<eos> Oowards!<eos> Irek!<eos> If you give us away, we'II try out the tie-beams!<eos> soldiers!<eos> You are sons of the polish nation!<eos> Your brothers and fathers are there!<eos> They're standing guard of the plant and defending fundamental human rights.<eos> We demand the cancellation of martial law and the punishment of those who imposed it, the release of prisoners, and that trade unions to be allowed to operate...
It was only a matter of time before one of these creatures would encounter the cannabis plant, so that THC and the cannabinoid receptor would meet.<eos> Since it was here in East Asia that cannabis first proliferated, it was probably here that that first meeting took place.<eos> It's not really difficult to imagine how it happened,<eos> I mean no-one knows for sure when THC and the cannabinoid receptor first came together but it has to have been here in these mountains.<eos> And whether it was an animal who, hungry, overcame the unpleasant taste and had a good munch on a cannabis bush, or it was a bird flying around, or a rodent... the first stoned animal is lost to history.<eos> In that very first stoned animal, THC from the cannabis plant flowed from its gut into its bloodstream and was carried to its brain.<eos> There, it met the cannabinoid receptor evolved so many millions of years earlier in the humble sea-squirt. And it just so happened to fit... like a key in a lock.<eos> It was inevitable that eventually cannabis would meet its perfect partner...us.<eos> It's not known exactly when humans started consuming cannabis, but there's evidence that it's been used in this region for nearly three thousand years.<eos> Nomadic tribes passing through Kazakhstan would pick the plant and then distribute it selling it along the silk road and other ancient supply routes, to China, to India and to other countries to the west, And in a way cannabis joined the ancient commodities of salt and tea, and its progress from that point on became unstoppable.
M saying nothing.<eos> I want my lawyer.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> He's lawyered up and admitting nothing.<eos> Tough to get a conviction with what we have so far.<eos> But ave the murder weapon.<eos> We don't need a confession.<eos> Yeah, the gun's a double-edged sword, kind of.<eos> Belonged to Felix Hanson, was never ported stolen.<eos> - And we recovered it in Hanson's house.
Oh, I might.<eos> Tell Sidney that I'm sorry.<eos> I see now, on reflection...<eos> I wasn't the stepmother I might've been.<eos> I'm sorry for that.<eos> I did try.<eos> And I hope and pray that she doesn't become bitter, hope that she finds happiness.<eos> 'Cause happiness is...<eos> So hard to find.<eos> Once you find it, you better hang on tight...

butters, what's the problem ?<eos> i just talked to brad dixon.<eos> tammy warner is bad news.<eos> all the fifth graders call her a slut on a count of she gave this kid, dave darski, a bj in the parking lot of t.g.i. friday's.<eos> what ?<eos> it's true !<eos> ask anybody in fifth grade !<eos> tammy warner is a total slut !<eos> that bitch !<eos> kenny gave his heart to her and she's just gonna throw it in his face !
Roads?<eos> Are you okay, honey?<eos> Oh!<eos> She needs to be changed.<eos> There you are.<eos> You take the baby.<eos> There you go. [baby crying]<eos> Oh, she needs a back rub.<eos> Oh! And give me your coat.<eos> I'll take it. Oh, oh.
Well, some people believe that God stopped revealing Himself in dreams and visions at the completion of the Bible.<eos> But I myself think that God is so powerful that He still reveals Himself to the young children that He loves.<eos> Why?<eos> Are you having visions?<eos> (Sarah) I might be.<eos> Yeah, I have a very important decision to make, and I need to make it soon.<eos> And I've been having very vivid dreams that show me what would happen if I do this and actually what would happen if I don't do it.<eos> And I really just need to know how I can tell if these are true visions.<eos> And I would just think them just dreams if it wasn't for this card that I can't find now, figures.<eos> Sarah, the only way to discern the truth of any vision is to measure it against the word of God.
- I thought you said...<eos> I know what I said, and... So I guess I haven't, but I have.<eos> I don't...<eos> Oh, Tara.<eos> Now, something happened here.<eos> Something horrible happened.<eos> - That's pretty obvious.<eos> - You think this is funny?<eos> No, but it don't make sense.<eos> When shit don't make sense it means there's a logical explanation, you just haven't thought of it yet.
To be honest, I... was... kind of hoping for that.<eos> But I-I didn't know how to call you, and then now, all of a sudden, here you are out of-- out of nowhere to save the day and I just--<eos> I'm rambling again.<eos> You just make me so, um...<eos> I don't know how I'll ever be able to repay you for this.<eos> You could do me a favor.<eos> I need you to publish a letter for me.<eos> What letter?<eos> You're here, aren't you?<eos> You're not supposed to open it yet.
No.<eos> Mom!<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Clark said you'd bring us somewhere safe.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It's your wedding present.<eos> Well, it was.<eos> I was gonna give it to you after the reception, but...
The Joy Of Sex?<eos> It's a standard text.<eos> An intelligent sex manual that is serious without being solemn.<eos> If you're not going to put him on the programme because of this, it's your loss.<eos> How much difference is it gonna make for some kid who gets dropped off at a grammar school in a 4x4 every morning?<eos> An experience like this could change Liam's life.<eos> He hasn't exactly set the heather on fire.<eos> Education, from the Latin "educare", is important in society because more than money, more than status or wealth, it frees a person from the physical circumstances of their life and lets them come to their own opinion of the world.<eos> And you can stop looking down your noses at us, because education isn't a gift for you to give or hold back.<eos> And if I don't get it here, I'll...

You've changed your attitude a bit since I last saw you.<eos> He's got something to say.<eos> Why?<eos> - Why what?<eos> - You did what you did.<eos> And what have they told you I've done, Sean?<eos> Danny!<eos> When your mam and Auntie Peg done a runner with you, you weren't Danny, you were Sean.<eos> I gave you that name.<eos> And I'd like you to keep it.
Are you sure?<eos> Do I need your approval to throw you out?<eos> You happy now?<eos> There's only one time her heart's going to be perfectly still for our pictures and that's when she's dead.<eos> If it's not MS, severe mental illness and Vicodin are all that's left.<eos> Mental illness means you can no longer practice medicine.<eos> Vicodin means detox, which means pain. For the rest of your life. Which means you can no longer practice medicine.<eos> Are you saying we should kill her?<eos> No.<eos> If we stopped her heart, we could get our pictures and then restart it.
Thank you.<eos> But this-- this is...<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Anyway, the basic principles at work here are very simple.<eos> You all know how a record player works, right?<eos> Yeah. A needle goes over the grooves of the vinyl And the vibrations it picks up are amplified into sound.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So the principle is the same.<eos> Except for instead of a needle, I use the electron microscope to take a high resolution, Digital image of the grooves on the surface of the record.<eos> That image is then transferred into the computer, Which translates it back into audio that we can hear.
Go ahead.<eos> Colonel Telford's in the communications lab.<eos> He switched bodies with Scott And he wants to talk to you.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Colonel, so far I've only managed to access Portions of destiny's database.<eos> We still can't actually control the ship.<eos> Even if we could turn this thing around Right now and head back to earth, How long would that take, another million years?<eos> Rush, you want this chair To be some kind of wonderful discovery, That's fine.<eos> Prove it.<eos> You prove you can use it safely To do something we actually need it to do.
Ah, yes.<eos> That was indeed a great obstacle.<eos> However, on closer consideration, we have discovered that the contract was never ratified, and so is not binding in law or any other way.<eos> So your sister is free to marry the King?<eos> I will send my Ambassadors to England to conclude the negotiations.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> What's this?<eos> Cromwell's agents finally intercepted a letter from Cardinal Pole.<eos> It was on its way to Rome.<eos> I have managed to decode it.
That is a handwoven Kurdish Kazak rug.<eos> You know, Bree, when I hang out with you,<eos> I realize how little I know and how much I don't give a crap.<eos> Give me that.<eos> I'm so glad this divorce is almost over.<eos> An obnoxious, unpleasant man will be out of my life, and so will Orson.<eos> Hey, it's not over yet.<eos> You still got a couple of hurdles.<eos> Has Orson brought up the insurance claim again?<eos> No, he thinks I filed it.
We should split up?<eos> Split up?<eos> I'm not splitting up.<eos> Have you not seen horror films?<eos> We've got to find him before he kills someone.<eos> It's me.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> The knight's name - it's William de Mornay.<eos> He was a mercenary who fought all over Europe for whoever paid him.<eos> He's killed a lot of men, Danny, and he's looking for redemption, and he thinks killing the dragon is gonna do it.
Sure...<eos> Short throw...<eos> Short bocci.<eos> Ugly toss!<eos> So, Marito, have you finished your cookie?<eos> And your milk?<eos> Go!<eos> Come on, pal.<eos> Closer!<eos> Who can take it out now?
Oh, by the way.<eos> Professor Cutter won't like you and he'll go out of his way to make your job impossible.<eos> Try not to take it personally.<eos> And that's the story of Rameses the second.<eos> Now, this...this is Anubis.<eos> The Egyptian god of embalming.<eos> Now, when you died... they'd pull your brains out from inside your nose, using one of these.<eos> Then, Anubis would rip out...<eos> your bleeding heart.<eos> Now, if you hadn't been very good... ..the demon goddess Ammut... would eat it.
But I'm still in here.<eos> Jen, get out of there.<eos> Get out of there now!<eos> Jenny!<eos> Abby, stay there!<eos> It's too dangerous!<eos> What's going on?<eos> The creature's searching for heat. But it's freezing in there!<eos> It's Jen's body heat.<eos> It's drawing it towards her.
Do you think?<eos> He is remarkably plain.<eos> I suppose one would not expect very much of a farmer but I had no notion he would be so very clownish.<eos> To be sure.<eos> He is not so genteel as a real gentleman.<eos> Oh, I mean no offence, I'm sure.<eos> A farmer has no need to be genteel, but I would have thought that now you have been exposed to some very good specimens of well bred, well educated men at Hartfield, you would be struck by how unfavourable a companion your Robert Martin presents.<eos> Miss Woodhouse.<eos> Another letter from Jane!<eos> Won't you and Miss Smith step inside for tea while I read it to you?
Take him back, honey.<eos> He's sorry.<eos> No, that's-that's not... that's not what's happening.<eos> Just go back inside, Mrs. Matsen.<eos> (door closes) It was good seeing you, Stella.<eos> Can you talk to Tony?<eos> What?<eos> He'd listen to you.<eos> You changed his mind.<eos> You could change it back.
When the bough breaks<eos> The cradle will fall<eos> And down will come baby Cradle and all<eos> That's kind of a dark song. Shut up.<eos> - Are you happy?<eos> - You asked me to get you ice cream.<eos> Did I tell you to blend it?
- FBI.<eos> You need to come with us, Miss Sciuto, now.<eos> - Where?<eos> - I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> - Well, then I'm not at liberty to go.<eos> - You misunderstand.<eos> It's not a request.<eos> The deceased was Private First Class Marco Riggs.<eos> Recently assigned to CLB-3, Combat Logistical Battalion,<eos> - supporting troops in Afghanistan. - Until he was accused of stealing equipment, then selling it on the black market.
So passionate, so innocent, and yet so utterly doomed.<eos> So I'm guessing you've never been in love, then, Tesla?<eos> Countless times, my friend.<eos> See, the difference is I recognize the emotion for what it is, an irrational, self-destructive impulse which is disguised as joy.<eos> Was there something you wanted, or you just wanted to come and ruin my...<eos> Yes.<eos> Your shaggy friend is still refusing treatment, and, frankly, I'm insulted.<eos> Oh, right, yeah, because I forgot, this is all about you.<eos> I have spent weeks creating a working treatment for the Lazarus virus.<eos> I spend weeks more traveling the Earth disseminating it to the affected abnormals, effectively stemming an outbreak, and in the end, the creep in the room with the hair doesn't want to take his medicine!
Oh! Jesus!<eos> Is everything in this goddamn place expired?<eos> Your man thong's on too tight?<eos> You've been in a foul mood all day.<eos> Kimber's pregnant.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Is it yours?<eos> Yes, of course it's mine.<eos> It's bullshit, that's what is.<eos> She wants to keep it.
I'll be in my room.<eos> Please tell me you're from UPS.<eos> I'm here to see Frannie?<eos> I'm expecting my gin of the week delivery.<eos> Best gift I ever gave myself. Come on in.<eos> You got company!<eos> Let me guess, you're selling cookies?<eos> I want to change the competition.<eos> You heard one of our made it all the way to Hollywood on American Idol.<eos> Sorry. We're not changing it.
I wish I knew.<eos> Whatever it was, someone was willing to kill to find out.<eos> Intelligence summit?<eos> Seems like your classic contradiction in terms.<eos> Don't give me the look;<eos> I didn't know.<eos> You had suspicions.<eos> Because you had suspicions.<eos> I'm riding shotgun here, Gibbs.<eos> - Yeah, can I borrow it?
- You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - Do not read me my rights.<eos> - Don't you tell me what to do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. Look, I'll show you one more time.<eos> You click here, and you're displaying the interview-room cameras.<eos> But I still can't ear anything!<eos> Because you have to clickthis to hear interview 1.<eos> Anything... Anything could happen as I free-associate about the case.<eos> I could crack it wide open just sitting here in this room.
Are you firing me?<eos> No, but for now, you're behind a desk,<eos> - Phones and mail only.<eos> - But I-I have patients.<eos> I'm--I'm--I'm delivering Violet's baby.<eos> Dell, it's... it's just for now.<eos> So I spoke with Dr. Wilder, And, um, we have some concerns.<eos> Is it a boy or a girl, your baby?<eos> Katie, y-your medication Is a very important part of managing your delusional disorder.<eos> It's important that you keep taking it.
I got a bad feeling about this.<eos> Well, you can't commit to someone on a feeling,<eos> But it really creeped me out, the way she was looking at me.<eos> Pete's right.<eos> You can't commit someone on a feeling.<eos> All right.<eos> What if the delusions are amping up again?<eos> What if she's just happy?<eos> She's done grieving.<eos> I-I know happiness when I see it.
Ziva's.<eos> The moment she asked me to choose.<eos> Ah, so this is not about loyalty, it's about an unreasonable demand.<eos> She withheld information.<eos> To protect Rivkin.<eos> Someone she obviously cared about.<eos> Ziva has always remained an officer of Mossad.<eos> I certainly don't envy the position that she just found herself in.<eos> Considering her less-than-conspicuous background, it's amazing she ever had your trust.<eos> No, she earned it.
Relax.<eos> Relax your face as well.<eos> So, why did you come?<eos> You were looking for me?<eos> No.<eos> I forgot something in the butchershop.<eos> Hold yourself back.<eos> Hold yourself back.<eos> We have the chance to elevate ourselves, to overcome... to fulfill our mission in this base world.<eos> This hardship cannot be overcome if one cannot go beyond it.
Hold on, fi.<eos> ...workers that seem unusually preoccupied... and curious kids.<eos> no matter where you go in the world, little boys like candy, puppies, and cops.<eos> I think our detective friend had a surprise planned.<eos> Mr. westen.<eos> Detective paxson and detective forget-your-name.<eos> You know, i was thinking about renting one of these storage units.<eos> You mind if i look at yours?<eos> Storage unit?<eos> Yes, or you could give us The fake name you used when you rented it.
Now, if I report back that I made contact with a burned spy... do you know where they'll send me?<eos> Me neither. And I'm not rocking this boat.<eos> I'm giving you a chance to be a friend.<eos> Mr. Westen, I don't like threats.<eos> But I love your sunglasses.<eos> You have a good one, okay?<eos> Doing a job in broad daylight... means easier access but more witnesses.<eos> You can walk right in with your unwanted audience... but you better have a plan to entertain them.<eos> Well, all right, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> If I can borrow your attention, I promise to return it in about an hour.
Anthrax doesn't kill this fast.<eos> This strain does.<eos> What are we doing about potential mass targets?<eos> Airports, malls, trains?<eos> There's a media blackout.<eos> We're not telling the public?<eos> We'd have a mass exodus.<eos> The psychology of group panic Would cause more deaths than this last attack.<eos> Yeah, and if it does get out, whoever did this might go underground and destroy their samples.<eos> Or if they wanted attention and didn't get it they might attack again.
Ok, if you feel any pain, I could give you something.<eos> No, I-I'd rather not take any pain medication.<eos> We can at least make you feel more comfortable.<eos> I am comfortable and I don't want to take any narcotics.<eos> Ok.<eos> Tell me how I can help.<eos> I think the cure for this strain is in here somewhere.<eos> Well, shall I start here?<eos> Dr. Nichols is a former military scientist, which means he's most likely secretive and most likely a little paranoid.<eos> He would have protected the cure and probably would have hidden it from his partners.
Adversity is to be expected.<eos> Continue. Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.<eos> - Okay, I can't do this.<eos> - Me either.<eos> Gentlemen, use your imagination.<eos> Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth?<eos> No, he cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.<eos> You heard the man.<eos> Hold him down and I'll cut him open.<eos> I know I don't possess the tools of leadership, but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
He took one look at it and called you.<eos> So... You guys are archaeologists or something?<eos> Would you mind rounding up the rest of the crew that were here at the time?<eos> I'd like to speak with them.<eos> - Ok. Sure. I'll be right back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Ever seen anything like this before?<eos> No, but whatever it is, it hatched recently.<eos> These are like claw marks.<eos> You think something dug this hole, laid the egg, and then just left it?
Take the pen, keep it in the bag, and just, you know, approach the notebook.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Be careful!<eos> I am!<eos> Would you stop yelling at me?<eos> Somebody turn down his volume or something.<eos> Okay. Now what?<eos> You know, put the bag right over the notebook, turn it upside down, dump the pen out, make sure it lands on the notebook and stays there.<eos> That's it?<eos> Just dump it out?

Yeah.
- Now...<eos> Now we move Alice to the dark vault.<eos> - What's the dark vault?<eos> - It's better than the "oy gevalt."<eos> The dark vault.<eos> You've never seen the dark vault.<eos> I'm gonna hazard a guess here you're never gonna want to see the dark vault after we move that to there.<eos> Okay, you get the...<eos> No, you know what? Let's do this tomorrow.<eos> You know, we better secure it.
I'm rankled.<eos> I'm officially ranked.<eos> You had to go and call Dickinson to get access?<eos> Just don't take it personally.<eos> - It's entirely professional.<eos> I'm just saying you could have come to me and I could have got you whatever information that you need.<eos> We needed access, Artie, not information.<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> I'm your boss now.<eos> You hit a roadblock, you call me, I remove it.
I would never have talked about it.<eos> Never.<eos> I've always wanted my life to be about what I can do for myself, not about what other people did to me.<eos> Cora called me first on the morning of the murder.<eos> Harry had already run away.<eos> You forced the back door, didn't you?<eos> Didn't you? Make it look like a robbery.<eos> HE SIGHS<eos> So where's the murder weapon then?<eos> You'll never find it.
Remember what you used to say to me when you were on my knee?<eos> You used to say, "I love you, Grandpa Peachey.<eos> "I love you".<eos> Remember?<eos> And if you didn't like it, all you had to do was speak.<eos> Ah, it's the Dummy Lad!<eos> Come on, Harry, speak up!<eos> Say something for...<eos> You want love. So they tell you, this is love.<eos> Take this resignation letter and tear it up.
I think i'm gonna die either way.<eos> You gotta tell me what to do.<eos> you know what to do.<eos> No, i don't.<eos> I don't.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> You're just scared to do it.<eos> This back and forth is just fear.<eos> But you've already made the decision.<eos> You already made it.
Hi, mom.<eos> I'm home.<eos> and our wildest hopes.<eos> but one thing is certain... when it finally reveals itself...<eos> Congratulations, doctor.<eos> Welcome to the army.<eos> the future...<eos> Thank you.<eos> is never the way we imagined it.<eos> (meredith) doctors spend a lot of time focused on the future... planning it... working toward it.
Time Travel<eos> There's a lot of mystery surrounding the idea of exactly what is skipping through time.<eos> Is it the island?<eos> Is it the people on the island?<eos> When the sky lit up, where did you go?<eos> I didn't go anywhere, John.<eos> You went.<eos> Here's what we know ...<eos> There is a donkey wheel in a very, very cold place down below the Orchid station.<eos> We know that when you turn it, the island moves.
I just know.<eos> John Locke seems to have a far superior sense of communication with the island, and this really makes Benjamin Linus very upset.<eos> I've seen this island do miraculous things, but never once has it done anything like this.<eos> So the fact that John Locke is walking around this island ... scares the living hell out of me.<eos> For Hurley, the '70s were a chance to make the world a better place.<eos> I made lunch for the crew.<eos> - You're waiting for the next van.<eos> - Why don't we carpool?<eos> It'll help with global warming, which hasn't happened yet.<eos> So maybe we can prevent it.
'cause you had nothing to do with this.<eos> Maybe you oughta stay off her once in awhile.<eos> Get out you witch!<eos> I've got eighty-five and my boots are off.<eos> You don't have a sheet.<eos> I'll get one...<eos> But that'll be another quarter<eos> And this is all I have.<eos> Go wash yourself.<eos> You get me in trouble And I'm gonna cut your dick off And boil it in hog fat.

If I am alone in a room with her again, I shall give in.<eos> I shall marry her.<eos> And I cannot allow myself to do that.<eos> Would it be such a terrible fate?<eos> All I know is that marriage has made my work better, not worse as I feared.<eos> And the course of our physical intimacy takes us daily through new and enchanting landscapes.<eos> Although Effie is a lady, of course.<eos> So are you saying I should marry her or not?<eos> I'm saying you should marry, but perhaps not Miss Miller.<eos> Fred, I will improve my offer but I want you to deliver it in person in order that I am not tempted to go back on my decision.
Claudia will be with you... that nurse you two like.<eos> Ok?<eos> - I'll take care of him.<eos> - You'd better.<eos> Take care.<eos> It belongs to mommy.<eos> Here, can you hear?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - It's my heart.<eos> Can you hear it well?
"Don't look like that and don't laugh."<eos> Don't tickle!<eos> Don't move, I'll be right back.<eos> - Ox?<eos> - Ok.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Why the celebration?<eos> Give me your right hand.<eos> I wouldn't let you go away without a wedding ring.<eos> Don't you think you put it on the wrong hand?
Don't you get enough secular ritual at the Kappa Tau house?<eos> Why join what's essentially another fraternity?<eos> Please.<eos> The Amphoras are far from a fraternity.<eos> Fraternities are about parties and meeting girls. The Amphoras are about...<eos> I don't know, because they're secret.<eos> That's what's so cool.<eos> They have their own lair.<eos> Who wouldn't wanna meet in it?<eos> So the three of us can find it together.
It's a soup of Chinese origin.<eos> You dip the gyoza in this sauce.<eos> Tell me if you like it.<eos> - Enjoy.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> In Japan, we make noise eating ramen.<eos> Too bad about the collateral damage.<eos> Sorry about your dress.<eos> It's not my dress!<eos> I borrowed it.
If you had, you two would be havin' this conversation alone.<eos> I could've put them all down, McBride.<eos> I had a clear shot.<eos> Did you have five clear shots?<eos> I think you're overestimating your ability to hit five moving targets.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - I know so. - Well, how 'bout l... - How 'bout you shut up!<eos> We have work to do.<eos> Bomb makers, like master chefs... tend to have a signature dish.<eos> If you can duplicate it, you can leave their fingerprint wherever you want.
but no more.<eos> no fucking more.<eos> - morgan.<eos> - come on, quinn. not today.<eos> - jesus, morgan, middle of the day, you're out again?<eos> - yeah, i have some secondary analysis to do on the kyle butler case.<eos> - there's a spatter report on christine hill's suicide sitting on your desk- you even look at it?<eos> - i don't need to.<eos> it's a cut-and-dry suicide.<eos> - yeah, but you have to sign off on it.
Unless you can be completely honest with me... I don't want to do this anymore.<eos> I'm doing everything I can to save my family, and I'm still failing.<eos> Rita's picturing her life without me, and I can't picture mine without her... Or the kids.<eos> Harrison.<eos> Is that the hammer?<eos> The depth is too shallow.<eos> Murder weapon was heavier.<eos> Well, narrow it down, dex.<eos> We need a model number.<eos> Maybe we can track it to a hardware store or an internet site.
Or he's sending a message.<eos> Or he's trying to leave some kind of a legacy.<eos> Hey.<eos> How come you're not working this case?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Got a report to finish.<eos> His family keeps him safe, but these ashes leave him exposed.<eos> Maybe this is how I get to the truth.<eos> The murder weapon.<eos> He's using it out in the open for all the world to see.
- Because you're truly in love.<eos> - Truly in love, that's right. For now.<eos> Why do you have to do that?<eos> I know you. This is what you do.<eos> You - - You love to be loved.<eos> You pull all this love in, you build it all up in your head and when it gets too close, you run.<eos> I just want the ring, Nance.<eos> You can spare me all the brilliant insight.<eos> Andy.<eos> You're not gonna give it to me.
Go get him.<eos> - What about Lupita?<eos> - It's her night off.<eos> You wanted to be a daddy.<eos> This is your big chance -- Night feeding.<eos> It's where the big boys play.<eos> - This is just so you can have the bed.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> There's breast milk in the fridge.<eos> You can warm it up in the bottle in a pot of hot water and test it.
Not ploughing is a pretty radical idea for any farmer.<eos> But looking at some old footage from our farm, the damage it causes is now pretty obvious.<eos> This is one of our fields back in the 80s.<eos> The life in the soil is a feast for the birds.<eos> After 20 years of the same treatment...<eos> No birds, the soil is dead.<eos> Turning the soil has been part of agriculture for millennia, but I guess with muscle power alone, the damage was slow to show.<eos> With diesel power, the destruction is much faster.<eos> The only reason modern agriculture can get away with killing the life in the soil is through another use of fossil fuel.<eos> This time it's by turning it into chemical fertilizer.
But this is the complete opposite, a collection of small clearings in a massive woodland.<eos> It may not look like a farm, but it clearly works.<eos> For a few days work each week, Chris Dixon and his wife produce all the fruit, veg and meat they need and the fuel to cook it.<eos> But 20 years ago when they arrived, it was degraded, marginal pasture land.<eos> The first thing they did was to let much of the land return to its natural state.<eos> Now the fertility has returned to the land.<eos> Observing the forest as it regenerated offered all the inspiration they needed to design their smallholding.<eos> But it is a woodland still, and it is chaos.<eos> It is chaos, but chaos in this space is very, very highly ordered, very highly structured.<eos> It's just that we see it as untidy and a mess.
Well, this is an upscale address for a naked guy. Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What the hell is wrong with everybody?<eos> Hello.<eos> I want the gun.<eos> When you catch him, the man who killed my husband, I want the gun.<eos> Mrs. Maint, we... I'm going to melt it down.<eos> I'm gonna make sure no one ever uses it again.<eos> Mrs. Maint... When a gun is recovered from a homicide investigation, It's marked as evidence.<eos> And after the trial, A private company, escorted by police, Drive it to a facility in queens where they put it
I know you said not to talk, but I got to be frank with you.<eos> It's always been an issue for me.<eos> You should've seen my report cards in grade school.<eos> I like to talk out loud when I'm working stuff out in my head.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> Just feel free to ignore me, okay?<eos> This is a really elaborate plan you guys have going here.<eos> I mean, you got the job as a mechanic just to have access to the truck, right?<eos> That's smart.<eos> Then instead of reinforcing the bottom, you actually weakened it, creating easy access to get to the money.
Yaacobi's here to deal with the hostage situation.<eos> That's what we have here.<eos> - Sir!<eos> Ready?<eos> - Yes, 2 mins.<eos> You realize these are soldiers, right?<eos> Yes, they poured kerosene and injured a guard.<eos> They could burn down the building.<eos> - Didn't you vacate it?<eos> Not yet, but I don't think they'll burn it down.
That was your teacher.<eos> Apparently, you were the only one in class who didn't turn in his art assignment.<eos> So there's going to be an empty space on the wall at open house tonight.<eos> Actually, dad, i'm pretty sure i did finish it.
If you feel the need to go behind my back, at least do me behind your back?<eos> Behind your back?<eos> I'm the one who's got your back.<eos> Don't you forget that.<eos> - dr. Shepherd.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Do you have a minute?<eos> - For what?<eos> A kid with a tethered spinal cord.<eos> I just sat up in the middle of the night, and I thought, tethered spinal cord, but you're not gonna see it on there.
- How does that work?<eos> That's amazing!<eos> Make the whole cart disappear!<eos> There are a limit to my talents.<eos> Make me disappear.<eos> Bea!<eos> Sorry if she's bothering you.<eos> He's just made an egg vanish.<eos> Like Farmer Finch at breakfast.<eos> Can we have it back, please?
You know that story I told you about? The one about how I kept coming home to that dog that wasn't so nice, the one that kept attacking me all the time?<eos> You know, the one that I thought might have rabies?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, it's not rabies or a dog.<eos> It's a man, and I'm still married to him, I-I think.<eos> I mean, I haven't seen him in many, many years, but he's the reason that I became a court reporter.<eos> I had to support myself.<eos> Well, we'll find that dog and we'll take care of him.<eos> Oh, Leo, you're my hero!<eos> And you know what? If you need to take this ring back and sell it so you can use the money to find that dog, then that's okay with me, 'cause I just want to be with you.
How's it going, Walter?<eos> I plan to urinate in 23 minutes.<eos> Good to know.<eos> I'm telling you because I'm going to need help unzipping my fly.<eos> I can't feel my hand.<eos> It seems the substance from Pennsylvania is a paralytic.<eos> Which means that whoever took those people paralyzed them first, so they couldn't fight back.<eos> Interesting theory.<eos> Very devious.<eos> Do you think we can trace it, where it's from?
Think you could help me out?<eos> You need help?<eos> Of--Of course. That's-- That's what I do.<eos> Great.<eos> Could you move the piano for me?<eos> It's 500 pounds.<eos> That's not too much, is it?<eos> Well, is there something trapped underneath or...?<eos> No.<eos> I just want to move it away from the window.
The creatures escaped from the Underworld.<eos> It's a screeling.<eos> Like the nursery rhyme.<eos> The screelings are loose,<eos> The Keeper may win,<eos> His assassins have come To rip off your skin.<eos> If I remember right, the poem says ...the only way to kill it is to hack it into pieces.<eos> Richard tried hacking it with the Sword of Truth.<eos> It didn't even seem to hurt the creature.<eos> If we can't kill it, we'll find it and trap it.
If I thought it was as easy as giving myself up to Maryann, I'd have done that by now.<eos> And what's to say she's gonna stop with me?<eos> Killers don't just suddenly quit killing.<eos> You ought to know that.<eos> And standing by idly is not an option either.<eos> You must come with me.<eos> No, I'm not sure I wanna be doing that.<eos> I'm not sure I'm giving you a choice.<eos> Okay, what is with the egg?<eos> Did you lay it?
What will you do?<eos> I will find.<eos> Iván, where are you?<eos> We are in danger, thee not got it?<eos> Worry.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> I never thought it was you that we are boring.<eos> Gently.<eos> The weapon.<eos> Put it on the table.
Bree, it's not your fault.<eos> It's just who you are.<eos> You're a good girl who never breaks the rules no matter how miserable it makes her.<eos> I thought a little Karl time might brighten your day.<eos> But there's not much I can do for someone who would rather be good than happy.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I've got a delivery for Susan Mayer, but she's not home.<eos> Do you mind signing for her?<eos> Oh. That must be her gown.<eos> Of course I'll take it.
No wait!<eos> Released without charge, thank God.<eos> I must say you've never struck me as the sort to be a dope fiend.<eos> Oh, the papers are ridiculous.<eos> What I can't stop thinking about is Tito's wedding ring.<eos> It's rather hard not to see it as some sort of an omen.<eos> It doesn't mean anything, darling.<eos> Of course, if it were in a ballet, the ring would be enchanted and its loss would lead to your death, beautifully, in the third act.<eos> Aspreys'll do you a replacement.<eos> Tito needn't even know, although if he left it in the first place...
I know I will.<eos> I'm trying to support you.<eos> So, how are you feeling?<eos> Oh, we're gonna talk about feelings now?<eos> Okay.<eos> Sad.<eos> It had to be felt.<eos> Veronica, you need to spend time with him.<eos> Do father-daughter things- that don't involve stealing secrets.<eos> Instead, steal his heart, fill it with love and then give it back.
Bless you!<eos> Mm-hmm, mm. Mm-hmm.<eos> While examining Officer Gillespie, I've discovered something else.<eos> Given the amount of serum that we found in his tissue, and the rate at which it would've metabolized, I suspect that he would've had to inject it every day for a very long time.<eos> Well, how long?<eos> At least a year, I would think.<eos> A year?<eos> That would mean Gillespie started injecting while he was still on his tour in Iraq.<eos> Did his army personnel file come through yet?<eos> I haven't seen it.
- [Mac] Let's get out of here!<eos> - Did you fuck my mom?<eos> - Did you fuck my mom? Did you fuck my mom?<eos> - [ Girl Screaming ]<eos> Santa's been attacked!<eos> You think, when we leave, you could just, uh... you know, swing by my house and drop me off?<eos> No. No.<eos> We don't have time for that shit, all right?<eos> Listen, we're doing the Christmas future.<eos> We're doing it now.
Right now, you have bigger problems.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Now, my relationship with Oliver may have dissolved, but I didn't lose everything in the meltdown.<eos> Our computers are still linked, which is how I found this.<eos> Oliver was watching this on his laptop.<eos> It's a long story about Lois and laundry and lacy things.<eos> - Lois saw this video?<eos> - Not only it, but me on it.<eos> On a scale from one to Chernobyl, how big was the fallout?<eos> Let's just say if there was an antilife equation, I think I found it.
I get it.<eos> Chevron four encoded.<eos> Chevron five encoded.<eos> Why not just send a note?<eos> - Anyone could send a note. - Anyone could send a note.<eos> Chevron six encoded.<eos> Chevron seven locked.<eos> Now what?<eos> If Jackson's still around, he'll know what the message means.<eos> What if the aliens got it?
If a superior demands that you be happy, you say: "Yes, Sir. Right away, Sir."<eos> Go on.<eos> Let's have it all, shall we?<eos> Oh, you like it here--<eos> The smells, the noise and the criminals at every level.<eos> I have made the best of this.<eos> My salary is good.<eos> The company is flourishing.<eos> My wife has a beautiful gown.<eos> May I see it?
- We ain't gonna make it.<eos> It's as fair a shake as we could get, considering that allotment act made no allotment for wheat.<eos> You were supposed to get us a good deal.<eos> There's a surplus.<eos> What the hell's he supposed to do?<eos> Well, I ain't selling at that.<eos> - You've got no choice.<eos> - Sure I do.<eos> I've got a silo.<eos> Store it till winter when the price goes up.
- I lost my business last year.<eos> - Well, do something about it.<eos> If Sterling Cooper is for sale, why don't we buy it from P.P.L.?<eos> We could put everything back the way it was.<eos> Young men love risk because they can't imagine the consequences.<eos> And you old men love building golden tombs and sealing the rest of us in with you.<eos> You're done.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> So I should just throw away my fortune?<eos> I don't have the rest of my life to earn it back.
- Yes, you can.<eos> - I can't.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Gertrude.<eos> - My name is peter.<eos> I'm in 14g.<eos> And I'm not going to get you in trouble.<eos> I have this party, I borrow her dress And this happened.<eos> No one can clean and she's coming home.<eos> So you thought you would throw it away?
- I can't.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Gertrude.<eos> - My name is peter.<eos> I'm in 14g.<eos> And I'm not going to get you in trouble.<eos> I have this party, I borrow her dress And this happened.<eos> No one can clean and she's coming home.<eos> So you thought you would throw it away?<eos> They're just going to think you stole it.

- Thin.<eos> - Oh<eos> We don't have the slightest indication that Elise's father knew that Fletcher was a con artist.<eos> Maybe not, but Castle here suggested that we check gun registration records for Gerry Finnegan.<eos> and guess who happens to own the same caliber handgun as our murder weapon.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Gerry Finnegan.<eos> Shut the front door!<eos> No time for dirty talk, Go get changed.<eos> I keep it locked in the safe.
- You know, I kind of want to keep the whole<eos> Murder at Union wells on the D-L.<eos> No kidding.<eos> I mean, if I were you, I would change my name.<eos> Like now.<eos> They'd probably let you do it over the phone.<eos> - No, they won't.<eos> I would know.<eos> I changed my name for a while.<eos> - Oh. Why did you change it back?
If you're willing to lose Jim, fine.<eos> You just say so.<eos> We'll find another solution.<eos> Is that what you want to do?<eos> - OK, people, listen up!<eos> - Everybody...<eos> I have an announcement to make.<eos> Fraud was committed...<eos> - You have an announcement?<eos> - I was making it.
" Where?<eos> Right here.<eos> Right there.<eos> - "C.H."<eos> - Maybe.<eos> What do you mean,maybe?<eos> That's a "c" and an "H."<eos> Can I help you,gentlemen?<eos> Your face --it's familiar.<eos> Maybe I've seen it on the news or perhaps on a "most wanted" web page?
Don't get offended.<eos> All I'm saying is, sometimes, your powers seem a little irregular.<eos> Am I glad to see you two.<eos> What'd you do to him?<eos> Let's just say I made him realize there are certain advantages to traveling with a carnival act.<eos> I notice there's one fewer of us.<eos> What happened to Cara?<eos> Some food for your travels.<eos> I've mended the dress.<eos> You're welcome to keep it.
But if you don't {\call in favors}do it to look at women in bikinis and assign them numerical grades, what the hell do you call in favors for?<eos> What you doing in these parts?<eos> I just...<eos> I came by to see the murals.<eos> This one's pretty amazing.<eos> Yeah, this one's a beauty.<eos> {\You know, }In the 1880s, there were a few years that were pretty rough and tumble in Pawnee.<eos> This depicts kind of a famous fight between reverend Bradley and Anna Beth Stevenson, a widowed mother of seven.<eos> The original title of this was "a lively fisting".<eos> But{\, you know,} they had to change it.
You got it.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Roy?<eos> Over there.<eos> That tree.<eos> Yeah, I was talking to tom about it this morning, and, he wants it over here.<eos> Okay, well, that's probably because he forgot the sprinklers go off over there.<eos> So do me a favor and hang it in that tree.<eos> Thank you.<eos> 'cause she's telling me she wants it on the other side of the yard.
- Uh-Huh.<eos> You're just saying that 'cause you've never been scorned.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> What man has ever turned you away?<eos> So any word on a certain British Secret Agent who shall not be named?<eos> I got the official offer.<eos> Wow.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I haven't accepted it yet.
Word was gonna get out, and I wanted to tell my own story -- To let people know that cancer didn't stop me.<eos> I don't know why they want to.<eos> Judge: this is not a rock concert, Mr. Kent.<eos> Please ask your groupie to behave herself.<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> I am truly sorry about your illness.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But didn't you lie to cupid's whisper by not revealing your medical condition until after signing your contract?<eos> I didn't tell them I had chicken pox when I was 8 or the flu last winter, either.<eos> When "women's wear daily" first approached you about doing an interview, you actually put it off for a month, right?
The math would suggest that in a few I'm a clown made of candy.<eos> But I don't dance.<eos> Alright, want some french toast?<eos> It's oatmeal day.<eos> Tell you what, next french toast day,Ill make you oatmeal.<eos> Dear lord, are you still going to be here on french toast day?<eos> Morning.<eos> Look, Leonard, Penny made french toast.<eos> Sorry, I haven't given her your schedule yet.<eos> It's an ical download. she can put it right in her phone.
We have all types available.<eos> I don't want a doll, Harding.<eos> I want her.<eos> He's crazy about your work.<eos> It's not all about the work.<eos> No, sweetie, it's about the power.<eos> There's a ton of money in this room, but that's not power.<eos> Nolan's a medical genius, short-listed for the Nobel.<eos> That's power.<eos> Art is power Because they can't make it.
What is it?<eos> Kinda busy.<eos> It's about, uh, that promotion.<eos> I juston't think you're ready, maybe in a few years.<eos> Could you just look at me?<eos> I deserve that job, Clyde. I'm a good writer.<eos> I work hard.<eos> Joanna, you know what?<eos> You're a damn good writer. You work harder than anybody here. And I'm gonna give you that promotion.<eos> You deserve it.
It's at the suture line of the transplant.<eos> The new heart is dying.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Poor guy that brought her in.<eos> I think they were on their third date.<eos> It doesn't even look like a heart anymore.<eos> That's because it's not.<eos> It's a chunk of useless flesh that has to come out right now.<eos> You're taking the heart out?<eos> What are you gonna replace it with?
And i left town, and i never saw her again.<eos> You know, i figured she got an abortion.<eos> Hoped.<eos> But i did know.<eos> Well, you're a different guy now.<eos> You're not 18 anymore.<eos> You've grown-Up.<eos> You're capable of better.<eos> Nicholas is back in the e.R. He's got a nosebleed, bad.<eos> I've been trying to stop it for an hour.
I don't think we should. Why?<eos> What harm can it do?<eos> But...it's wrong.<eos> Is that what Sarah Jane tells you?<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Are you sure you want to see?<eos> It'll make everything clearer.<eos> Do it!<eos> 'See your future.'<eos> I can see it!
You're under arrest.<eos> You're a bad little putty tat.<eos> Where'd boss go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Sit down.<eos> When I came to see you and said I wanted back...<eos> You said it was the director's call.<eos> But I sensed your hesitation.<eos> I sense it now.
We got our hands full.<eos> Anything else you can do?<eos> Well, if I'd retained Arnett's brain, I could perform further toxicology tests.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Well, at the time, it wasn't warranted.<eos> It was a car accident.<eos> Look, for the tests, the tissue has to be prepared. It takes ten days.<eos> The Arnett family was putting pressure on the director.<eos> They wanted the body for burial, and they wanted it intact.<eos> Unbury it.
We gave it to Gibbs, Gibbs gave it to Vance, Vance gave it to Eli David,who read it, and then he put Ziva and a team on a Jordanian freighter called the Damocles.<eos> Out of Aqaba.<eos> Uh,yeah.<eos> Bound for the Horn of Africa.<eos> - You got a manifest?<eos> - It's a cargo ship.<eos> Could be a direct supply line to Saleem.<eos> - Where is it now?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> - Find it.
Something that valuable, there's no way Ghovat's gonna pack it up and go home.<eos> I've got a thought.<eos> Let's take our thread and go fishing.<eos> How could you be so stupid?<eos> Ghovat, please, you have to believe me.<eos> I didn't know what you wanted me to do.<eos> You didn't want me to know.<eos> Where's the dress now?<eos> It's gone.<eos> I sold it.
Ghovat, please, you have to believe me.<eos> I didn't know what you wanted me to do.<eos> You didn't want me to know.<eos> Where's the dress now?<eos> It's gone.<eos> I sold it.<eos> You sold the dress?<eos> My dress?<eos> Someone made an offer ahead of the show.<eos> He bought it for his fiancée.
Where's the dress now?<eos> It's gone.<eos> I sold it.<eos> You sold the dress?<eos> My dress?<eos> Someone made an offer ahead of the show.<eos> He bought it for his fiancée.<eos> How much did he pay?<eos> Fifty thousand dollars.<eos> Who did you sell it to?
He bought it for his fiancée.<eos> How much did he pay?<eos> Fifty thousand dollars.<eos> Who did you sell it to?<eos> How long will we have to keep this up?<eos> Just long enough to get noticed.<eos> You're doing great, Tara.<eos> I'll be doing better once this is over.<eos> That dress really does look fantastic on you.<eos> If only I could wear it on a runway.
Then who? Agent Peter Burke.<eos> Why him? Because it's really the FBI that holds the dress.<eos> Is he there now?<eos> It's for you.<eos> This is Burke.<eos> I'm sure you heard everything earlier.<eos> You want me to make the exchange.<eos> That's right.<eos> I won't waste my time telling you to come alone. Just make sure to bring the real dress.<eos> If it's not, are you gonna make me eat it?
But I'm here now.<eos> Look, why Clark decided to take on our enemy ETs by himself is beyond me and you think he abandoned the cause.<eos> Come on, aren't we all in this together?<eos> Shut down that tower. Bring back the sun.<eos> You know I'm your best chance at getting back that ring.<eos> Maybe, but I still don't trust you.<eos> Well, I guess that's a start.<eos> So about the tower...<eos> The towers are the key to the Kandorians' power.<eos> They collect the radiation, turn it red, beam it back to LuthorCorp's satellites.
Hi.<eos> Do you wanna sit or...<eos> I saw you jump,you're supposed to be dead.<eos> Yea well it's,it's a little more complicated than that.<eos> But that's not what I've brought you here to talk about.<eos> I want<eos> I need to apologise,to you.<eos> For the other day here.<eos> For breaking your trust.<eos> For losing it,like I did.
From the swab of dr. Kaswell's eye.<eos> A redheaded boy peed on her eye?<eos> Well, not exactly.<eos> See this?<eos> The tool used to stab dr. Kaswell left traces of iron and carbon.<eos> And, to a lesser extent, silicon, manganese and phosphorous.<eos> Any of those things scream pee?<eos> Not that I'm aware.<eos> Ancient metal workers turned iron into steel by accident.<eos> They accidentally carburized the iron while heating it over charcoal, thus turning it into low-Grade steel.
I mean, the trophy would've been tempting, but...<eos> I don't even remember it being there.<eos> C. O. D. should come as no surprise; she drowned.<eos> One of my greatest fears, by the way.<eos> Can't definitively tell you if she engaged in sexual activity immediately prior to death, but I did find this wedged between her central and lateral incisors.<eos> Oh, pubic hair.<eos> I'll get it to Wendy.<eos> I also found something in her right main stem bronchi.<eos> Tempered auto glass.<eos> She aspirated it while drowning.
Get your hands out of your pockets.<eos> So what's the plan, eh?<eos> Is it a bombing or a shooting or what?<eos> 'cause you know, there always is a plan, right?<eos> You tell me.<eos> So when did you make the video, jared?<eos> What does it matter?<eos> Well, I thought it would have mattered a great deal to you.<eos> I made the video, that's all you need to know.<eos> Well, who did you send it to?

"Let's go to the West lndies."<eos> And so we booked a house in St Ann's Bay in Jamaica.<eos> On the way out there, I read the script on the plane.<eos> I thought, "This isn't working at all, it just doesn't work."<eos> And I think possibly there was again a strain on the writing relationships.<eos> I think that Graham and John were not writing as consistently magnificent stuff as they had done in the past.<eos> They were beginning to write stuff that wasn't working as well as it perhaps ought to, and I know they never liked that.<eos> Terry and I were used to writing tons of stuff, about 50 of which was just binned early on, but for John and Graham, I think their failure rate was something they didn't like to... they didn't like to admit a failure and they were finding it difficult.<eos> I woke up with this sinking feeling.<eos> You know, I hadn't experienced it since I did exams at school, or something like that, thinking, "l don't want to go through this."
Let me explain, Mrs Cohen.<eos> Your son is a born leader.<eos> Those people out there are following him because they believe in him.<eos> They believe he can give them hope, hope of a new life, a new world, a better future!<eos> Who's that?<eos> That's Judith, Mum.<eos> Judith, Mother.<eos> Now you listen here, he's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy.<eos> Now go away!<eos> I often think of it as being like music in the way that certain bands can be seen as very influential, then there's one band that will take all those influences and somehow be able to package it in a way that makes it accessible to a much wider audience.
Over the years, his antics have cost me a lot of time and money.<eos> Shaving cream in my mailbox, food coloring in my pool.<eos> I don't care if he was a hero in Afghanistan.<eos> On this block, he was a pain in the ass.<eos> Girlfriend in college got a restraining order against you.<eos> So I'm guessing there's a temper under that cardigan.<eos> We have a witness who says you confronted Korby yesterday.<eos> Given the history between you two...<eos> Are you accusing me of murder?<eos> No, we're just asking you really nicely if you did it.
Push 500 milligrams of phenytoin.<eos> You can't push that much.<eos> We gotta relieve the pressure, or his brain can herniate.<eos> Oh, my God. Fifty milligrams of phenytoin in.<eos> Page Chase.<eos> Tell him to meet us in the OR.<eos> We need your consent.<eos> What's happening to him?<eos> The pressure in his skull's too high.<eos> If we don't reduce it, it could irrevocably damage his brain.
How damaged?<eos> I need to know before I can even begin to figure out what to do with you.<eos> I want to be a NCIS agent.<eos> I don't even know if that's possible.<eos> Here we go. Bring it down.<eos> Four damn shrimp?<eos> A couple more, and we'll have enough for dinner.<eos> Ugh! Come on, man.<eos> Where's your sense of humor?<eos> I left it at the laser-tag arena.
It's my pleasure.<eos> I'm always happy to help out Jack Bass.<eos> Are you ready to open the cornerstone Of the new Chuck Bass empire?<eos> You decided this was the way to impress k.c.?<eos> What?<eos> Chuck, I would never call Jack.<eos> You might convince me more if you weren't The only one who knew about the problem.<eos> Blair, Blair, did you call Jack?<eos> Well, you have the liquor license.<eos> What does it matter who called who to get it?
Things aren't where they should be.<eos> The buckleys' dirty pool is starting to work.<eos> Thanks to serena, we weren't able to expose it.<eos> Well, isn't there something we can do?<eos> It's election day.<eos> At this point, nathaniel, It would take nothing short of a miracle.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was running errands, And k.C. Asked me to drop off your jimmy fallon interview.<eos> Great.<eos> I guess that means you've seen it.
And second,I may be a high school dropout, but you're the slut who killed her husband so she can bang half the town.<eos> I'd be careful what I say next if I were you.<eos> Aw,hey,don't go.<eos> Hey,we could have some fun.<eos> I hear you like 'em young.<eos> Okay,let's try this one more time.<eos> But I can't remember the words.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> Everyone's gonna laugh.<eos> Okay,emily,listen. You made a commitment,and now you have to see it through.
- Oh,I'mcreepy?<eos> C- can we just-- can we just pick up again tomorrow,when I can focus?<eos> This is the problem with women.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - You don't understand the usefulness of anger.<eos> Society trieto force you to swallow it down like a good little girl.<eos> Because if you're angry,you're a bitch, and if you're a bitch,no one will love you.<eos> Well,I say... That's nonsense.<eos> I own my anger,thank you very much.<eos> Maybe,but you don't know how to use it.

And then,then,to add insult tinjury, you show up here with yo ugly friggin' dummy?<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> He called you ugly.<eos> Good-bye,Alan.<eos> Wait,wait,wait,wait, wait,wait,wait,wait.<eos> I...<eos> I brought a peace offering.<eos> That's my ten-year-old Scoh!<eos> - No,it's not.<eos> I saw himtake it.
You don't fly solo.<eos> You know, you're always saying, when you're working strong,<eos> Work strong, be brave.<eos> I was working strong, and I was right.<eos> No, there is no "right" if there's no payoff.<eos> This is show business, not show art.<eos> Your stage clothes are walking by themselves.<eos> Wash 'em good.<eos> That private reading... It came through.<eos> You got it?
You like?<eos> You look great.<eos> But you always looks great.<eos> You always say that, Mouth.<eos> You called me "Mouth."<eos> You never call me "Mouth."<eos> What the hell are you wearing?<eos> It's great, Brooke.<eos> I love it.<eos> You know that dress is not supposed to be released until next summer, so unless I magically went to sleep for a year, you need to explain to me why you're wearing it tonight.
Thank you.<eos> From now on,no free passes.<eos> That's it!<eos> See you in glee club,sue.<eos> Don't...touch me.<eos> That is a lawsuit,mister.I will sue your ass!<eos> What happened to our little agreement,huh?<eos> Will I be uploading a certain video to youtube this afternoon?<eos> Anti-embolism stockings can be purchased... oh,sue.<eos> I put it on youtube myself. And it only got two hits.
- Uptight?<eos> I don't think it's "uptight."<eos> - It's just shorts, man.<eos> - You've never seen a man's legs?<eos> - Yeah, they're grotesque.<eos> What if they were a woman's in a skirt?<eos> Would you say that to her if a woman's in a skirt?<eos> - If they were hairy.<eos> - Okay. Are you ready for a hot towel?<eos> She must've put it in the microwave.
You got a plan, don't you?<eos> You gonna call her for another interview?<eos> I don't need anna.<eos> When i'm done, she'll be the one calling me.<eos> What's this?<eos> I want you to give me this ring in your own time, when you're ready.<eos> I'm still mad at myself for not trusting you.<eos> yeah, well, i was sneaking around... Buying you this engagement ring.<eos> Like i said,<eos> Give it to me in your own time.
Yeah, especially if you leave me standing on your doorstep.<eos> Relax. I parked two blocks away.<eos> I don't appreciate your taking risks like this.<eos> If orson find out about--<eos> You won't have that to worry about much longer.<eos> I found a way to spring you from this marriage!<eos> Orson's still on parole, right?<eos> For another year.<eos> Why?<eos> If he violates parole by, for instance, Associating with a known felon, they can revoke it.
Wow, Jules, you're really going all-out for this guy.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't ever try to make it special?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If I really like a dude, I'll stop texting while we do it.<eos> I wish you were my daughter.<eos> Travis, did you finish your college essay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's great.<eos> You have to do it this weekend.
Wow, your lordship, you are smoking!<eos> If this was a seismometer and you were a volcano, we'd all be running away with our hair on fire.<eos> Let me look at that.<eos> That's extraordinary.<eos> What is this sorcerer's box?<eos> Oh, this isn't sorcery, this is science.<eos> That's right.<eos> It's given me an idea how we can defeat Darkening.<eos> But, Lord Marchwood, we're going to need your help.<eos> I have brought this curse upon my house, and my family. I would do anything to lift it.
Am I right?<eos> A test?<eos> I'm sorry, did someone say 'test'?<eos> Don't really understand that word.<eos> K9:<eos> Test.<eos> Assessment of knowledge.<eos> Method through which one human demonstrates intellectual superiority over others.<eos> He knows what it means, K9.<eos> Just not how to pass it.
Think I could borrowyour jacket?<eos> I swear to you,peter,under no circumstanceswill I impersonate the fbi.<eos> Where do you thinkyou're going?<eos> This is paul ignazio'sapartment,right?<eos> Hi,uh,ted jeffersonfrom the evidence recovery team.<eos> I don't care if you'rethomas jefferson.I need I.D.<eos> Oh,sorry.<eos> I pulled a double-hommy last night.<eos> It's in the van.<eos> My partner took it to see his girlfriend in queens.
He finished his tour last month.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Well, this morning, the FBI issued a warrant for his arrest.<eos> All right.<eos> What's the last name?<eos> - Mitchell.<eos> - Mitchell.<eos> What happened?<eos> Some stolen gold or something in a storage shed.<eos> They think he brought it over.
Go.<eos> If you mean me no harm, then just go.<eos> I never wanted this.<eos> Hello.<eos> I want my ring.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm at the sizzler.<eos> I had the buffet.<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> I don't have it.
I don't have it.<eos> Where are you?<eos> What have you done?<eos> No, what have you done?<eos> You're the one that locked me in the basement and starved me, so whatever I've done, whoever I've sucked dry is on you, buddy.<eos> You're being careless.<eos> How many more animal attacks is this town gonna believe, huh?<eos> I know how to cover my tracks, Stefan.<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> I gave it to Zach to hide.

But that doesn't mean it's not him.<eos> I hope not.<eos> O.P.R. Is like this giant,sucking black hole - accountable only to the d.O.J.<eos> - Department of justice?<eos> Well,d.O.J. Is just a euphemism,of course,for the military industrial complex.<eos> And big oil,right?<eos> Goes without saying.<eos> - Um,by the way,that necklace...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did you -- i didn't take it.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...<eos> Gaby made a discovery...<eos> Your stomach just kicked me.<eos> I want you to run the Miami office.<eos> So Carlos played hardball.<eos> You can't fire me for being pregnant.<eos> I'm offering you a promotion.<eos> If you choose to turn it down and quit instead, I can't stop you.
I'm offering you a promotion.<eos> If you choose to turn it down and quit instead, I can't stop you.<eos> Katherine broke down.<eos> The man I love chose you.<eos> It's over.<eos> Why has this been so hard on me?<eos> You love him.<eos> I found a way to spring you from this marriage.<eos> Karl made a plan.<eos> If he violates parole by associating with a known felon, they can revoke it.
Well, it's easy when you've found a woman worth changing for.<eos> Oh, I-I-I didn't mean...<eos> Learned that in self-defense class.<eos> - Bye, mom.<eos> - Bye, mom.<eos> - Bye-bye!<eos> - Hey, we're taking off.<eos> - Okay. - Wish your little angel luck.<eos> Oh, good luck, sweetie.<eos> Now remember, your dad's gonna videotape your pageant, and we're all gonna watch it tomorrow.
Oh, I'm sure it's fine.<eos> I rent from these guys all the time.<eos> I cant wait to see you in it.<eos> Oh, thats nauseating, I want to go back to prison.<eos> - Bye, drive safely.<eos> - I'll keep it under a hundred.<eos> Cute.<eos> Want me to hold the ring?<eos> I got it.<eos> Why dont you put it in your pocket?
By whom?<eos> An American contact.<eos> Somebody high up.<eos> He had great concerns about a plot to challenge the world order as we know it.<eos> He was scared, Harry.<eos> Follow me, sir.<eos> What's Ros' status?<eos> She's inside posing as part of Ashenden's security.<eos> What about the bug?<eos> She's just about to drop it in.
You can't outsmart me.<eos> I know all the tricks.<eos> - It's like that movie, The Negotiator.<eos> - I didn't see that.<eos> In the end, the police chief turns out to be the bad guy.<eos> I didn't say I wasn't going to see it.<eos> Lemon, what is it going to take to get you out of there?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I don't want to do this show anymore!<eos> Shut it down!
Don't ever leave me again!<eos> I'm back.<eos> I'm back!<eos> Hey, fancy face.<eos> You scared me.<eos> I thought I was gonna lose you.<eos> - You can't get rid of me that easily.<eos> - That's me.<eos> - My wedding ring.<eos> - I found it on the beach.
that's no different than being a puppet.<eos> But I don't think you're as boring a man as that.<eos> Shut up already.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> There's no need to throw yourself into the darkness.<eos> How about it?<eos> Wanna join my guild?<eos> You must be joking! Are you serious? !<eos> There are people in this world who prefer solitude.<eos> But there is no one who can withstand it.
and fixes all occurrences of,"i don't really see them together.<eos> " so open wide,pam,and take a big ol' spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.<eos> Take with food.<eos> Pam,aren't you gonna introduce us to michael's girlfriend?<eos> I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.<eos> Yeah,i think everyone's met helene.Shall we?<eos> Wait a minute,is that another birthday present for me?<eos> 'Cause you already gave me a necklace.<eos> Oh,my god,i love it.<eos> - Tell her how you gave it to me.

So this is your plan?<eos> You're gonna go into the convention waving a gun in people's faces, throwing tequila in everybody's eyes with a big-titted woman?<eos> Duh, yeah.<eos> Frank, get the hell out of here!<eos> Your ideas are ridiculous!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Suck on this, bitches. Huh?<eos> Huh?<eos> Paddy's Pub. A stress ball.<eos> You give this to people, they put it on their desk, and then during the day, you squeeze it when you have any tension.
Which means he hasn't got it yet.<eos> So just...<eos> - What's in this letter?<eos> - That's none of your business, right?<eos> Just get it to Chase.<eos> Did you write a love letter to Chase Utley?<eos> In a lot of ways, yes, I do love him, but that is not a love letter in the way that you're thinking of it, ok?<eos> There's nothing sexual, or...<eos> - Ok, that sound good.<eos> Let's read it. - Yeah, read it!
The back of a murdered pig!<eos> We don't eat meat, because we are not carrion-eaters.<eos> The human body is not made to digest meat.<eos> Open for your grandparents.<eos> And do as we discussed.<eos> Hello Bjarnfredur.<eos> -Hello Geir.<eos> Hello mother.<eos> Comrade Aslaug...<eos> Take my overcoat and hang it up.
This is Gibbs' living room.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Rescuing a kidnapped little girl and her mother.<eos> I'm sorry to tell you, but you're actually abducting them.<eos> Hey, werth.<eos> Cut the chitchat, just secure the prisoner.<eos> I can't.<eos> We're making a mistake.<eos> Bell's got a lotta money riding on this job.<eos> We're gonna finish it with or without...
It wouldn't change things.<eos> Serguei's a year older than you.<eos> He has to keep the herd.<eos> Who says he'll succeed?<eos> It'll be your turn next year.<eos> Come on!<eos> Serguei, the clan has chosen you to watch over our most precious asset, the great herd.<eos> We follow it.<eos> It gives us everything we need.<eos> Will you serve it?
A 100-metre fall.<eos> I saw to the others.<eos> They're dead.<eos> Got the skins?<eos> I ask the questions.<eos> They're in the ravine.<eos> Fetch them if you want.<eos> Look at this herd.<eos> I've seen it grow.<eos> I'm fond of it.
Oh, one of the drugs that Dr. Paris prescribed is sirolimus- It's an anti-rejection drug.<eos> It's only given to organ-transplant patients.<eos> It's absolutely useless for a paranoid schizophrenic.<eos> It suggests that not only has Dr. Paris vanished, he's a quack!<eos> Unless he's a genius.<eos> What?<eos> Organ transplants.<eos> The human brain.<eos> Well, half of one.<eos> But it's useless dead, because when you remove brain tissue from a living body, you can keep it alive for a short time in a nutrient suspension.
Sure.<eos> Just sign at the bottom.<eos> That's freaky.<eos> How'd I...<eos> how'd I do that?<eos> That looks like a real signature.<eos> Well, it probably is.<eos> You've signed your name so many times...<eos> You've formed neural pathways, procedural memory.<eos> So he can't remember his name, but he can sign it?
Turn around.<eos> Elena: have you even talked to bonnie?<eos> No. I'm mad at her.<eos> She needs to make the first move.<eos> Be the bigger person.<eos> Impossible in her presence.<eos> Why are you so pissed at her, anyway?<eos> She's a thief.<eos> That's why.<eos> I gave her my necklace, and she refuses to give it back.
She was Katherine's handmaid and a witch.<eos> You know?<eos> About bonnie?<eos> The first night that you invited me over for dinner, I made the connection.<eos> And now Damon knows, and for some reason, he wants that necklace.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> It's, um, an antique iron setting with a-- with an amber crystal.<eos> I know it.<eos> It belonged to Katherine.<eos> Emily gave it to her, which means that... what?
You know that little bakery near you?<eos> I'd appreciate it if you could bring A dozen of their dinner rolls.<eos> Got a confirmation of death, Duck?<eos> Oh, gunshot wound To the head.<eos> Well, what I presume Is the kill shot entered his head here, Just behind his right ear, traveled in an upward direction.<eos> I was just about to find out what damage it caused.<eos> - Before he was posted?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Clearly, the killer's intention Was to leave some sort of macabre message.<eos> Yeah, and not too shy about indicating who was sending it.
Naturally, since they're oligarchs, they're gonna try to downgrade the standard of living of the vast majority of the population.<eos> They're gonna claim that the world is overpopulated, that industrialization, industrial pollution, and overpopulation are the main problems that face the world.<eos> And they're generally going to try to crush and mortify any kind of popular democracy or mass movements with any kind of progressive content.<eos> Nations rise and fall.<eos> They knew how debt could never be recuperated.<eos> They knew that disease or prolonged war could wipe out the population and the future populations that pay off debt.<eos> So these guys all work together.<eos> That's why it's no surprise that today you have Lord Rothschild coming out pushing the latest scam or religion that we must all believe in, which is global warming; which his personal bank, his family's bank in Switzerland, will be in charge of.<eos> They've run the system, the whole economic system of the world, for the last two-and-a-half hundred years, so why shouldn't they also run the economic system for the next few hundred years.<eos> The question of a ruling class, oligarchy as a ruling class, is posed by Plato in The Republic, where we find that oligarchy is a constitution full of many evils, where the rich dominate the government by buying it,
Once you've granted that power to a group<eos> -- the Federal Reserve system -- the economic crisis was inevitable.<eos> This has happened before.<eos> Every time in history when the government was given the power -- or a group of banks in conjunction with the government -- was given the power to expand the money supply at will, those economic systems always wound up in crisis and always collapsed.<eos> So there's no reason to believe that the United States was given some kind of a "get out of jail free" card, an exemption from the processes of history.<eos> So the economic crisis began at the very beginning and, as a matter of fact, when the founders of the Federal Reserve system met on Jekyll Island back in 1910, and were drafting the... the Federal Reserve Act,<eos> one of the things they discussed was how to pass on the inevitable losses to the taxpayers.<eos> They knew that inevitably something like this would happen and they knew that there had to be some way to... to get out of it without destroying the banks, of course, because they were the banks, and they said,<eos> "Aha, we'll go into partnership with the government.<eos> We'll take our cartel agreement and pass it into law
"Hey, the problems of the past?<eos> They're due to the old guy, and I'm cleaning house and I'm gonna bring in a new team, and don't blame us for the things we've inherited."<eos> Can't say, "You know, those policies of the past, that came before were insane," because you've got the guy that was one of the key architects of those policies.<eos> People need to stop having allegiance to their political party.<eos> They need to have allegiance to the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and what has made our Republic so special:<eos> the basic human rights and dignity that every citizen of this country inherently has.<eos> Not because it's some right given to us by government, but because our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, enshrines that these are inalienable rights given to us by God, that we inherently have as sentient, free, conscious beings.<eos> But instead the public cheers on the Republicans as they win or cheers on the Democrats as they defeat the Republicans.<eos> It's an endless, staged, gladiatorial event.<eos> Special interests own both parties and they project this false left-right paradigm up as like a movie screen and behind that, behind the throne the establishment is able to control our society and engineer it into this high-tech police state.
You can manipulate the inputs to make that happen.<eos> And that makes it a very easy tool to use to hoodwink other people.<eos> These manufactured, these engineered financial catastrophes are the result of a central banking system that has ability to add and subtract credit, add and... add and subtract dollars and money at will to create this roller coaster effect, because,<eos> unlike most people, the banks are able to make profits as easily on the way down as they can on the way up in any given situation.<eos> Volatility is great for banks and professionals.<eos> Volatility is not great for the... the... most... most average people.<eos> Their operatives in government and media then hold the economy hostage by issuing the ultimatum:<eos> give us unlimited bailout money or the economy dies.<eos> What's being used is what I call -- to try to get the money -- is what I call the suicide threat where, you know, if anybody has ever seen the movie Blazing Saddles, the sheriff is surrounded by hostile town folks,<eos> he takes out his gun, points it at his head and says, you know, "Don't move or I'll shoot."
And if we really believe in... in the environment, if we really believe in freedom, if we really believe in truth, we need to get some straight answers.<eos> Now the Kyoto agreement, of course, was reached in the city of Kyoto and what was interesting was:<eos> several things came out of that but, the first thing was that not... all countries had to participate in Kyoto, but not all had to take action.<eos> Only the developed nations were required to reduce their level of CO2.<eos> The developing nations were excluded.<eos> Now of course at that time China was -- and in some ways you can argue it still is -- a developing nation, so it wasn't required to meet any targets under Kyoto, nor was India.<eos> The US of course, held out.<eos> And what's interesting is that US Senate voted 95 to nothing against the Kyoto accord, even though Al Gore was the Vice-President at the time.<eos> And, lucky for him he didn't have to cast a... a divi... deciding vote.<eos> But, um, so it's 95 to nothing against it because the US Senate saw, no, this is... this is a socialist distribution of wealth, this is... this is gonna cost jobs in the economy, and so they scrapped it completely.
Over.<eos> Em!<eos> Dad?<eos> Did he just get...<eos> No, no, no, he didn't.<eos> Charlie one, move to alternate cave entrance. Complete.<eos> Charlie three, Charlie three, zero alpha, over!<eos> How'd the Taliban find us?<eos> They got his radio when he was hit.<eos> They used it for directions to find us here.
Or you just leave him there to rot?<eos> Or worse.<eos> We lost him.<eos> The battery in his tracking device died.<eos> - The battery?<eos> - It happens.<eos> Know how hard it is to find anyone out there?<eos> I've heard.<eos> We kept waiting for him to show up, and when he didn't, we assumed he was dead.<eos> So please, take your sanctimonious judgment and park it somewhere else.
It's not difficult.<eos> Seat massage system. Mercedes - front and rear seat massage.<eos> And the BMW, massage seat only in the front, so I win that pair.<eos> OK, that's not working, so let's go back to the traditional, philistine Top Gear method.<eos> A drag race. I went in the Mercedes with Stig at the wheel.<eos> I think I'll have "Firm massage" for this.<eos> The BMW quickly took the lead.<eos> And stayed there till the end.<eos> That made Stig so angry he went home.<eos> So, the S-class. When you drive it, you realise it's got much more of a split personality than the BMW.
Acidic acid neutralizes the poison.<eos> Will balsamic do it?<eos> Yeah. Pour it on.<eos> Yeah. That's better.<eos> I think somebody should look at that.<eos> Tell you what, okay? I'll go home, I'll change, I'll put a bandage on it, and you stop asking me about the women in my life.<eos> Cool?<eos> All right, tough guy.<eos> See what I mean? Something happened up here before Lofton went over, and this glass is pretty thick.<eos> Someone had a full head of steam to get through it.
You paid to be there.<eos> You're a donor.<eos> No wonder that tux looked so good on you.<eos> It wasn't rented.<eos> You owned it.<eos> It was for a good cause.<eos> $10,000 a plate on a cop's salary?<eos> I sure hope so.<eos> You know what, Wolfe?<eos> If you were this curious about the case, you'd have solved it by now.
I guess we'll have to invite them to our own party.<eos> All right, next.<eos> It's what we're looking for.<eos> Thank you. No. Thank you, though.<eos> Next.<eos> Pretty dress.<eos> Got a few black sequins missing there and there.<eos> Can we keep this for our investigation?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah. You'll get it back.
This guy just gave us half a dozen murders.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Here's the thing: if we don't have any hard evidence, it's going to be DeSalvo's word against his.<eos> - Well, then our CEO walks.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And we still have to figure out who killed Jeff Lofton.<eos> - Hey, did you get my message?<eos> - Patrol found our missing girl.<eos> They also picked up her dress.<eos> They found it at her apartment.
Six months probation.<eos> Ask her.<eos> Misdemeanor assault?<eos> Six months probation?<eos> Time served?<eos> You must be pretty pleased with yourself.<eos> You shouldn't be driving, Mr. Stern.<eos> And unless you disclose your condition, you shouldn't be practicing law, either.<eos> What are you... Th... the partners meeting isn't until 5:00.<eos> Call it off.
What's the matter, mother?<eos> Is the smoked salmon making you nauseous?<eos> No. No, i'm just a little jet-Lagged. That's all.<eos> Oh, charles, brut ros?<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> That's what blair said when she suggested i pick it up.<eos> Yes, mother, you simply must have some tonight.<eos> I'm not in the champagne mood.<eos> But you love champagne.<eos> I didn't say i didn't love it.
Yeah, come on, Kyle.<eos> I am not the only person here who's peed in the pool.<eos> Lots a people do.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Yeah, they do, Kyle.<eos> To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about 25 seconds ago.<eos> Dude!<eos> Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath!<eos> No!<eos> # What has happened to this place # # I don't recognize it anymore # # It used to be so fun and special #
Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging affects of the pee, they'll... they'll go in to look for survivors.<eos> I said keep the media out.<eos> If the public hears about this, we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands.<eos> - [phone hangs up] - Dammit!<eos> Where is that antidote?<eos> Here! Here!<eos> We think we have it, sir.<eos> It's the best we could come up with in such a short time.<eos> We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine.<eos> Alright, let's test it.
Well, thank you for that summary, but I asked for a point of view.<eos> Your own.<eos> It appears you don't have one.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hello.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> We are meeting to discuss your thesis proposal, yes?<eos> Yes, but I was hoping we could talk about what happened in class today?<eos> Erica, my time is valuable.<eos> If you wish to spend it rehashing this morning's events, well, that is your choice.
I know how mad you are that I chose to go with Tripp<eos> - Rather than following your advice.<eos> - Well, I never wanted to punish you, just protect you.<eos> You don't need to explain.<eos> Right now... I just need my mom.<eos> Okay?<eos> Of course, darling.<eos> Maureen has my letter from dad.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know how she got it, But she doesn't want to leave Tripp, And she's threatening to show it to Rufus.
Next, he sent 30,000 more Marines to Afghanistan, doubling the total number of forces in the crosshairs.<eos> Barack then announced that he was going to move missile systems into Eastern Europe to encircle Russia.<eos> But after all, what should we expect after he kept Bush's Secretary of Defense Robert Gates?<eos> The outcome of this policy is, if you're constantly meddling near the Russian borders with these fascist creeps, IMF-NATO agents like Yushchenko of Ukraine, or Sakashvilli of Georgia, or these Kachinsky twins in Poland, or various collections of people in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,<eos> you're tied to these gangsters and if they decide to start a war, that rapidly escalates into thermonuclear World War III.<eos> This is worse than the neocons.<eos> Bush and Cheney never got as far as Brzezinski, Soros and the other people running Obama.<eos> Barack Obama swore that he would vote to repeal the Patriot Act, but then he voted for it's reauthorization.<eos> Obama decried the Bush administration's illegal warrantless wiretapping of the American people.<eos> Then he voted to legalize it.
Only if you are a satellite.<eos> We humans will suffer no harm.<eos> We should sit back and enjoy the fireworks.<eos> Well, thank you, Professor.<eos> So tonight we'll be covering this phenomenon from round the globe. My bosses are even putting me on camera.<eos> You know, you people should come clean how dangerous these plants are.<eos> Tell me, why do triffids always go for the eyes?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, you should find out.<eos> Cos I'd say you have a 50-50 chance of losing your sight. Or of keeping it.
Dirty fuck!<eos> It's cold.<eos> Where's Soo -jung?<eos> She's completely passed out.<eos> Take care of her, will you?<eos> - Did you pick up the stuff?<eos> - I got it.<eos> Hey, that apple!<eos> It ain't from China right?<eos> Did you check it?
You ring the doorbell, the curtains open.<eos> It's kind of fun.<eos> Some guys can't find it.<eos> Others don't know when to stop ringing it.<eos> But you ring the doorbell, the curtains open, the penis goes inside.<eos> That's really... it gets everything ready to go.<eos> And the sperms fly out up into the human female.<eos> She carries the egg.<eos> Normally we gave it... we tried first giving the egg to the male.<eos> He kept losing it.
They have to have something that the cheetah would like.<eos> They're not gonna think that a little bit of rag, racing around an electric system...<eos> - Funny you should say that! - Yeah? Because, I did this documentary about a place in Namibia, and it's a big cat reservation, and they had a baby cheetah that had been found by the roadside and brought to them.<eos> So, within an effort to try and return it to the wild, they set up a motor with a long bit of cord and pulleys, zig-zagged around this field, and attached a rag to it, and then, this thing would fly around, and this... - This cheetah... - Well, that's brilliant!<eos> ...would chase it. And they would try and get it to... Keep it, or, you know, its hunting instinct.<eos> Well, maybe then, they would go round - And they eventually feed them horse meat, and they where driving in a pick-up, doing about 30 miles an hour, and they're just...<eos> - Jogging along, next to you at 30.<eos> - Extraordinary, isn't it?<eos> - Really amazing animals. - Beautiful. And they only eat fresh meat.<eos> Leopards will eat rotten meat, maggot strewn stuff, they'd take it up a tree and leave it for days...
And how clever was that?<eos> Nice one.<eos> Warning shot.<eos> Send Mr. Ramsay home or else.<eos> That's not what I was trying to do.<eos> I was trying to point out a pattern... That you might not be aware of.<eos> Look, here's the thing:<eos> I don't respond well to being threatened,<eos> Mrs. Florrick, so why don't you withdraw this motion... Before it becomes a part of the record?<eos> Withdraw it.
Are you out of your tiny, shiny fucking mind?<eos> Look, we can do this simply.<eos> Step one.<eos> Are you interested?<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Step two.<eos> Will you come back?<eos> Yes?<eos> Step three, and this is the important step, will you use your considerable influence to destroy the cabal?<eos> Can I drop it down?
Christ, is he dying or something?<eos> OLLY:<eos> I don't know.<eos> terri: (WHISPERING) Is he flirting?<eos> - You are a naughty bastard.<eos> - Julius.<eos> Best thing I've read all year.<eos> It's the only thing, mind you.<eos> You've done some pretty awful things to me in my time, but this takes the bloody biscuit.<eos> And you've pissed on that biscuit and I've got to eat it.
Okay.<eos> therewasseveraldifferent occupants inside the car, Two males, two females.<eos> An elderly lady was driving.<eos> And like I said, the subject that was in the backseat Is actually claiming ownership to this firearm.<eos> youshotit tonight?<eos> no,I didn'tshootit, sir .<eos> whatthecaliberonit?<eos> uh,that'sa.44 .<eos> hesayshe threwthe weapon in the back of the car When he saw the lights behind him.<eos> Luckily, he decided to throw it in the car and not engage the police.
Rounding up the team is a 66-year old construction worker from Spokane, Washington.<eos> Dawes Eddy.<eos> I am 5'6" and weigh when walking 130 pounds. Not a very big guy.<eos> If Dawes summits, he'll go into the records books as the oldest American ever to climb Everest.<eos> This guy's like Energizer Bunny. He just keeps ticking away.<eos> Guess, a kind of fulfilling a dream seeing how high I can climb.<eos> But the odds are against him.<eos> Statistically, climbers over 60 are 3 times more likely to die on Everest.<eos> Every climber has a weakness.<eos> And this mountain will expose it.
They actually used quite a lot of guitar, but it was so heavily processed, it didn't sound like rock 'n' roll guitar.<eos> It sounded more like a synthesiser.<eos> They also put synthesising-type effects on the voice, which is probably one of the most disturbing things they did.<eos> You have a guy singing, but it sounds more like a dalek than a human being.<eos> At night-time, you'd hear distant booming noises with which would probably be something like a drop forge or steam hammer or something.<eos> You certainly knew that you were on the edge of heavy industry.<eos> Everything in their music is alienated.<eos> The music that comes from people who are divorced from natural life, any natural rhythms.<eos> The music for a hostile environment.<eos> If I've ever been asked to explain that movement, I always call it the "alienated synthesists".
This must be the true god, and some people did convert, or if they didn't convert, they did submit to Arab-Muslim political control for that reason.<eos> By the early 8th century, Islamic caliphs ruled a vast territory.<eos> And like most successful emperors, from Caesar to Napoleon, they understood that political power and scientific know-how go hand in hand.<eos> There were many reasons for this.<eos> Some were practical.<eos> Medical knowledge could save lives.<eos> Military technology could win wars.<eos> Mathematics could help deal with the increasing complexities of the finances of state.<eos> Islam as a religion also played a pivotal role.<eos> The prophet himself had told believers to seek knowledge wherever they could find it, even if they had to go as far as China.
Democracy equals New World Order.<eos> I believe God put me on this Earth to be the best person I could be, and put everybody on this Earth to be the best they can be.<eos> You have to stand up for what's right in life.<eos> Unless you do that, you are nothing.<eos> Award-winning film-maker turned freedom fighter,<eos> Aaron Russo was an amazing individual.<eos> You know, he'd been battling cancer for more than 3 and a half years when he began making America: Freedom to Fascism that he shot, directed, edited pretty much on his own with just the help of a few people.<eos> An amazing individual!<eos> A long life of award-winning films, of hard work and of standing up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.<eos> You know, when we first went to shop this interview, I put it on the web for free.
I have no interest in such things.<eos> But you are aware of what they call me.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> What are you aware of?<eos> That they call you "The Jew Hunter. "<eos> Precisely.<eos> I understand your trepidation in repeating it.<eos> Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.<eos> Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.<eos> It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Hey what the fuck are we supposed to do?<eos> It looks like we're supposed to have a Nazi premiere.<eos> Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?<eos> Well, I need to talk with you about that.<eos> I'm confused, what are we talking about?<eos> Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it down to the ground.<eos> I'm not talking about that.<eos> You are talking about that.<eos> No, we're talking about that, right now.<eos> If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves we can burn it down by ourselves?
Oh, no!<eos> Oh!<eos> I have a boo-boo.<eos> Get him!<eos> Get him!<eos> Get him! Get him!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> - Stand back! - What are you...<eos> We've got a feather, and we're not afraid to use it.
- Hello, Dr. Elefun.<eos> - Hello, Toby.<eos> Toby?<eos> Nobody's called me that for a while.<eos> This isn't your fault, you know.<eos> You're fantastic. Absolutely first-class.<eos> Superb. Wonderful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I tried to find my place in the world.<eos> I thought I'd found it, but I guess fitting in can be a lot more complicated than it seems, huh?
The original concept may be important but it doesn't guarantee success.<eos> A good strategist is not one who knows that the secret of victory is surprise but the one who knows how to surprise.<eos> So, people, we are going to crown you now!<eos> You're not allowed to take these off though you couldn't anyway.<eos> But they are no less comfortable than a hat.<eos> Do you want to get inside our brains?<eos> It's not dangerous.<eos> Unless you are hiding something.<eos> Thanks to Mr Tamel, our little publication has found its way out onto the streets.<eos> Soon half the world will have read it.
Oh, yes.<eos> It has to be drunk.<eos> All of it has to be drunk.<eos> You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me?<eos> This potion might paralyze me.<eos> Might make me forget why I'm here.<eos> Might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief.<eos> You are not to indulge these requests.<eos> It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion.<eos> Even if you have to force it down my throat.

One more word and I'll turn you into a small side of bacon.<eos> Well, you are sizzling hot!<eos> Connor!<eos> Get this off of me!<eos> Don't need that, or that, or that!<eos> - Although, maybe this can stay.<eos> - Juarez, you are fine china!<eos> What exactly are we doing, anyway?<eos> Two days ago, my team embarked on a mission.<eos> Today, I'm gonna finish it.
-Grab it.<eos> -What?<eos> Grab it.<eos> Magic.<eos> -Got it?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Does this radio work?<eos> No.<eos> My dad tried to fix it, but he could never get it to work.
- A few more hours.<eos> - And he will respond to my commands? - Absolutely.<eos> Logan.<eos> Welcome back to the war.<eos> Before I gut you, I want to know why.<eos> I needed your powers for the Pool.<eos> - For the what?<eos> - The mutant killer.<eos> Deadpool.<eos> Years of searching and refining, finding the right powers that can coexist in one body without ripping it apart.
You hungry?<eos> Wow.<eos> Look at how old this shit is.<eos> It's like it was dragged here from another century.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Hey.<eos> It looks like you.<eos> - No, it doesn't.<eos> - Yeah, it does.<eos> It's cool, you should keep it.
Come inside.<eos> Yeah, I just had to sit down for a second.<eos> He's with your mama now. They're together.<eos> Drink.<eos> No.<eos> Hey girls, are you ready?<eos> In about just one minute.<eos> - Why did you take your dress off?<eos> - I hate it.<eos> You gotta put it on, okay. We have to go.
If he pisses on me, I'll flip out.<eos> Are you going to pull it out now?<eos> - With which hand, you jerk?<eos> Once it's out, someone has to thump on my belly.<eos> Reflex evacuation.<eos> Peter, will you come for the reflex evacuation and pull Kai's dick out?<eos> W... w... what?<eos> Ok, calling for volunteers.<eos> Man, guys!<eos> You've grabbed it!
He said they'd be killed publicly.<eos> Yes.<eos> Revenge for la purga.<eos> "La purga"?<eos> Oh, jeez, you guys don't even read your own history, do you?<eos> 1668, the Church kidnapped four Illuminati scientists and branded each one of them on the chest with the symbol of the cross to purge them of their sins, and they executed them.<eos> Threw their bodies into the street as a warning to others to stop questioning Church rulings on scientific matter.<eos> They radicalized them.<eos> The purga created a darker, more violent Illuminati one bent on retribution.<eos> Look how they intend to finally get it:
It's from Mr. Keats.<eos> He says, "It looks like a dream. "<eos> Start again.<eos> It's cold out.<eos> How are you all?<eos> We're all quite well enough, but how is Mr. Keats?<eos> Mrs. Brawne, it is as unbearable to me as I know it is to you.<eos> Mr. Keats has died.<eos> I received an account from Severn, and I've copied it for you, Miss Brawne.<eos> Shall I just read it?
-What?<eos> -Yes.<eos> I am Nicole.<eos> You, too, Inspector.<eos> Well, enough of this foreplay.<eos> Where are the other detectives?<eos> Yes, they're waiting inside.<eos> I hope no one has tampered with the crime scene.<eos> A crime scene is like a code.<eos> You decipher it, and it will lead inexorably to the criminal.
- And you must be Leigh Anne.<eos> - That would be me, Coach Saban.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - You too.<eos> Just call me Nick.<eos> This is an incredible home.<eos> The Windsor valances are a nice touch.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You obviously have excellent taste.<eos> Well, we appreciate quality and recognize it when we see it.
Please, where you going?<eos> Please, this is my career.<eos> I put all my money into this.<eos> I'm here with Congressman Ron Paul, who was the 2008 presidential candidate.<eos> So tell me, who are you wearing?<eos> Well, I don't even know because it's pretty conventional.<eos> And I'm pretty, in that sense, pretty ordinary.<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you want some champagne?<eos> I don't care for any. No. There's no ice bucket, but I know a good place to put it.
It's really pretty and I do love strapless.<eos> Me too, Em.<eos> I feel like I'm cheating on my mom's dress. I can't. I can't.<eos> I'm comfortable with my decision.<eos> I'm gonna put it back.<eos> -Put it back.<eos> -Okay.<eos> But, I mean, if you like it, you should try it on.<eos> -No.<eos> You saw it first. Please.
Poisoning the kid's mind with that foreign bullshit!<eos> What's the use of school?<eos> All he needs to know is to count pigs.<eos> He'll make a decent living from smuggling.<eos> - Profiteers!<eos> - Drop the politics, brothers!<eos> Look at him.<eos> What are you doing, Zoja?<eos> When will you get rid of that whorehouse monstrosity?<eos> Spasic's wife ordered it, but he won't have it in the house.

- That's always what I wanted to do, so...<eos> - That's good.<eos> That's really nice.<eos> I don't really want to read the whole thing, I kind of just wanna say what it's about.<eos> Okay, the counselors at Advanoement House, they were quizzing me about my mother and my father, right?<eos> But it's not really about them.<eos> They're trying to get me to do workfare.<eos> - They want me to be a home attendant.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Because I stole my file and I read it.
Hi. Um,I'm a friend of al's,and I was wondering if I could see him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Right this way.<eos> dear al, rest in peace oh,al.<eos> thanks again for your help.<eos> Well,we'd do anything for your aunt.<eos> I hope you know what an amazing woman she was.<eos> Hey,did you guys happen to find a pearl necklace?<eos> It's the only valuable thing aunt ida owned.<eos> Well,actually,I have it. Yeah,she promised it to me if she kicked the bucket first.
Great doctors have that extra instinct,george.<eos> They just know.<eos> Great doctors,they know when to stop.<eos> I have to have that instinct,george.<eos> 'Cause my instincts lately? Very bad.<eos> Really bad.<eos> They told me to go for cardio.<eos> They told me to have sex with a married man. - Oh?<eos> - They are not serving me well.<eos> I am in danger of going extinct here if this keeps up, and I am gonna win this contest if for no other reason than I have to win it
Time of death...1933.<eos> The parents were right.<eos> The baby... no further complications.<eos> Good,good,and mom's okay,too.<eos> You seem sad... miranda.<eos> we're not gonna do this.<eos> I can't share.<eos> I can't catch up with you.<eos> I can't talk.<eos> 'Cause if I did,if I told you tucker moved out, if I told you I haven't slept alone in 12 years, if I told you that my heart hurt so much sometimes, I want to rip it from my chest with my own little hands...
you feel crazy all the time.<eos> You haven't slept in years.<eos> you spend every day around people in massive crisis.<eos> You lose your ability to judge what's normal... move your crap off the floor before this thing eats it!
I had to insist to go along with him<eos> we can handle it<eos> Lardier will receive 20 years<eos> I don't care about Lardier In prison without help, he is a nobody he should have to pay.<eos> I do not know where he will meet you<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Julia, for once you need to select the side you're on<eos> Good evening, Lieutenant.<eos> what are you doing here - we have a search warrant.<eos> I put it on the table, and I went to make coffee we looked for you and you had gone we could not find you
Where did I get this nose?<eos> You could probably sue for the nose!<eos> It's just cruel to lumber a kid with that!<eos> You've got to call them.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Another lesson you learn in care - you can't make people accept you.<eos> What's for tea, Mum?<eos> Home-made stew.<eos> There's nowt here.<eos> That's because you haven't made it yet.
Look, I know I overreacted before... but the information was a little startling at first.<eos> Now the prospect of dating a clone deity seems kind of neat?<eos> If I could take it back I would.<eos> But the thing is, I wasn't lying in there.<eos> So if you feel anything... you know... remotely similar for me... then now would be a really good time to say so.<eos> Pathetic.<eos> What the f- What are you doing up?<eos> - You should be ashamed.<eos> - What are you talking about? Go back to bed, for God's sake.<eos> That woman just placed her heart in the palm of your hand... and you toss it aside like some old shoe... because you can't muster the guts to admit you feel the same way.
But I ask you not to underestimate the enemy the way he underestimated us.<eos> Please express my gratitude to all those who could not be here today.<eos> Your contribution to Norway is both decisive and historic.<eos> Just seeing you here today fills a King with enormous pride.<eos> God be with you all!<eos> I stood too far from him.<eos> Did I look stupid?<eos> Not at all.<eos> He knew my name.<eos> The Captain called it out!
Sue me.<eos> Oh, no, don't.<eos> I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me.<eos> She loves to sue.<eos> She loves lawsuits.<eos> You know, honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.<eos> You are so right.<eos> You are so right!<eos> Because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges.<eos> And I moved in and I cleaned it, so I guess that makes me the devil.
It's on the docket.<eos> Ok. There's one thing we have to remember, and that's that I decide what's best for the brain trust. I thought this was a democracy.<eos> Oh. Then it's just miscommunication.<eos> The brain trust is a dictatorship masquerading as a democracy.<eos> I know that you all remember when I seized power during the revolution of '02, when I overthrew kyle during the battle of the basement supply closet.<eos> Or have you forgotten your history?<eos> Well, maybe I'll just start my own brain trust.<eos> You can't. Brain trust is a registered trademark.<eos> I own that name. And chanel.<eos> Well, maybe i'll just call it the brain bunch.
Out with the old, in with the new and easily controlled.What's up?<eos> I need you to help me find someone -- a kryptonian scientist.<eos> Another kryptonian?<eos> Jeez, clark, I'm starting to think that earth was your home planet's top tourist destination.<eos> How'd you hear about this guy?<eos> Jor-el told me.<eos> Look, clark, usually, I'm right there to help, but right now, my hands are so full.<eos> And, uh, no offense, but kryptonians aren't exactly low maintenance.<eos> Chloe, the only way I'm gonna find this guy is to hunt down the tracking device.<eos> Now, there's a rumor that some people found it.
He's skimming from the register.<eos> Judge Meyers?<eos> At night,he puts on a furry bunny outfit.<eos> Over there -- that's Cal.<eos> He's gonna rob tony the mechanic on the way home.<eos> What's your point?<eos> My point is I've lived through every possible Tuesday.<eos> I've watched you die every possible way.<eos> I have ripped apart the mystery spot,<eos> Burnt it down,tried everything I know to save your life,
I am American citizen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Lick my balls anytime.<eos> What?<eos> Call us anytime, you know, if you hear something, anything.<eos> I think we're looking for a guy named Sam the Butcher.<eos> Who?<eos> Nah, he's kidding around.<eos> But seriously, Lieutenant, how far do you want us to go with this Rambo murder?<eos> I don't know, I was thinking maybe you could investigate it a bit more, figure out who did it, try to put him in jail.
Ring the bell.<eos> Hey, Stubby, why don't you go and escort our company up here?<eos> Go on, fat boy.<eos> Get it on.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> - Hey, Spider.<eos> - I'll be downstairs.<eos> - All right.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - All right, baby, just checking out this wizard shit before I let my kids watch it.
-Really?<eos> Do you think, uh-- Do you think that's a good idea?<eos> Not the first time in the mile-high club, if you know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, uh--<eos> Listen, skydiving is a little-- A little risky.<eos> -Don't you think?<eos> You could drop the ring.<eos> -Whoa, hot call, dude.<eos> Hate to lose my great-granny's ring.<eos> She gave it to me right before she passed.
Sarah, ring?<eos> Yeah, the ring you got Sarah.<eos> The one I kind of took out of your locker.<eos> You mean the ring that Awesome got for Ellie.<eos> Oh, thank God, man. Are you kidding?<eos> -I thought I lost you, pal.<eos> -Morgan where is the ring?<eos> It's kind of complicated, but--<eos> It's in the freezer at Wienerlicious.<eos> I put it in Big Mike's marlin.

Are you--?<eos> Are you sure that Lizzie didn't have the ring on her?<eos> When they took her away, all she had was the receiver.<eos> -Then it's gotta be here.<eos> -You know Chuck, if we can't find it, we can just replace it.<eos> Look, it was Awesome's great-granny's ring and it's gonna be my sister's.<eos> Even if it's covered in coffee grounds and miscellaneous DNA.<eos> I have a ring and I have the blessing of your brother.<eos> Would you do me the honor of becoming my wife, Eleanor Faye Bartowski?<eos> Ha-ha-ha! I found it!
"Your high forehead reftects intellect."<eos> "Your full lips are an artistic entity."<eos> "Looking forward to you reply..." He's nuts!<eos> You are not an artistic entity...<eos> Hot Lips!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> What?<eos> Hot Lips?<eos> My letter was in the basket.<eos> Have you seen it?
Would you?<eos> -Tomorrow?<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's a boy your age here.<eos> Have you met him?<eos> -Yes.<eos> His name is Ricky.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> His aunt wrote a love letter, but it landed in his basket - and he accidentally gave it to me.
Can't you count the legs?<eos> -No.<eos> -Six, seven, eight.<eos> Not six, eight.<eos> I'll kill you, you imbecile.<eos> My underbelly.<eos> My one weakness.<eos> (BOTH groaning)<eos> I got it.<eos> Now I can throw it in the hot thing over there and be the hero.
You are my homies.<eos> Monday<eos> Baby!<eos> The water is totally cool, probably 16 degrees.<eos> Wouldn't you like to swim for a while?<eos> That would be good for you.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> How is your shoulder?<eos> Is back in normal.<eos> You should not overload it?
I know, we'll just peek.<eos> I want to know if Alex and Niki are getting back together.<eos> Matteo, it's your sister's life.<eos> Please!<eos> Niki was very hurt.<eos> I don't want her to feel like that again. Let's do this.<eos> We'll put it here and I swear I won't touch it.<eos> We'll take some time to ponder.<eos> If anyone opens this letter, I'll raise hell.<eos> - You mustn't open it, clear?
The compound temporarily masked the characteristics of vampirism.<eos> It allowed those who took it to pass the test.<eos> TO IMMORTALITY<eos> And Lance is a member of this bloodline?<eos> He is.<eos> So that's how you got the cure?<eos> Where is it?<eos> I wanna see it.<eos> Here.<eos> I took it from Lance a year ago.

Do you want to tell me?<eos> - I was having an affair.<eos> - Good for you.<eos> I was in prison.<eos> I went to jail.<eos> That's nice, Jeffrey.<eos> I'm taking a nap.<eos> What are you staring at, man?<eos> I'm looking for my reflection.<eos> Yeah, you're not gonna find it in there.
I got a source in the D.A.'S office.<eos> How could you be so stupid?<eos> I've always liked to think that the "c" in counseling stands for communication.<eos> It sounds like what madeline needs is for you to share something from that part of your life that's been closed off.<eos> Nothing's coming to mind.<eos> You're missing the point.<eos> You're right, ma.<eos> I am.<eos> Let's try it this way.<eos> Madeline, um, you mentioned there were times when you wanted more communication but didn't get it.
Whew, he's a hard rock from the motherland.<eos> And what brings him to these fair shores?<eos> They got him linked up to what they think is a russian Syndicate active on the east coast, pretty much from here to new york.<eos> Now, The guy who handles the day-to-day Operations in miami -- guy named Takarov.<eos> But this guy, mike, I mean, He's seen the inside of every prison from moscow to minsk, So I think the best approach here is, we know everything, we're rolling up his whole gang, and he's just a little fish.<eos> Well, you're the expert, sam. what else?<eos> Oh! good news.<eos> I found the perfect place for our secret facility.<eos> It's an old concrete plant in the middle of nowhere.<eos> They condemned it after the last hurricane.
Uh, I've got to tell you, I was hoping for more than two names on it, Though, but...<eos> Oh, well, I'm sure they're the best, yeah.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Yeah, sure. I'll -<eos> - I'll see you then.<eos> Another meeting. he is working you.<eos> I've gotten nuclear secrets out of kgb agents for less time and money.<eos> Good thing my liver is flexible because a lesser man would be dead.<eos> Okay, where did we get a thermal camera?<eos> I borrowed it from my neighbor's boat.
Yes, Dad fell last year<eos> I heard.<eos> He got such a big bruise on his behind.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Because you left the soap on the floor<eos> I didn't leave the soap.<eos> Here we go again.<eos> He's always blaming someone else.<eos> Hey kids, if you hit it with those there'll be nothing left.<eos> You'll smash it.
It was long ago.<eos> Long, long ago.<eos> Is it this one?<eos> Oh, here it is<eos> I'll give you this, too.<eos> Oh, no, Mother. It's too expensive.<eos> Oh, no, it's not expensive.<eos> But it's a fine kimono.<eos> My, daughter wants everything but once she gets it, she ignores it<eos> I gave her a beautiful kimono but she's never worn it once
Mom wants to talk to you.<eos> What's up, baby?<eos> You want to talk to me?<eos> - Why you lying to me?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> "Dear Mr. Souléymane Diop... "your request for a flight attendant interview with Sun Airlines has been processed and approved for October 15, 2007."<eos> - Baby, is this letter you're upset about?<eos> - Solo, this is next week!<eos> Yeah, but this letter is three months old.<eos> I just didn't throw it away.
Seriously, I did not study.<eos> I gave it up.<eos> Who's going to help me take care of this baby when you're flying to Florida or New York for three or four days?<eos> - Baby, I'm here.<eos> - I need you here!<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I didn't study.<eos> And I'm sick of that taxi!<eos> I'm going to call my cousins to come here and fix it.
- Baby, I'm here.<eos> - I need you here!<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I didn't study.<eos> And I'm sick of that taxi!<eos> I'm going to call my cousins to come here and fix it.<eos> No, baby.<eos> You know I don't want your cousins in my business.<eos> - Well, fix it!
That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> I have my interview on Monday, and I'm going to ace it.<eos> I really don't give a shit.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> I don't want to know about Quiera or anything about your life.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> If you like this place, you can keep it when I leave next week.
I never want to make the same mistake again.<eos> I... Will you come along with me?<eos> In the same carriage.<eos> I'm not sure if you'll agree to remain always by my side from now on. Morning and evening. Otherwise I...<eos> I can't go on without you...<eos> My sweet dearest Anna Vasilievna!<eos> No room!<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Where is your ring, Anna Vasilievna?<eos> I haven't worn it for ages - and you didn't notice.
Yeah, great.<eos> Thanks, Shaz.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Course you can.<eos> Was it really that good?<eos> You know, what you were on about just now.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> How's the hangover?<eos> Yeah, it's coming along nicely.<eos> Well, at least I can feel it now.
There's nothing in it, guv.<eos> I've checked it.<eos> 9460549.<eos> Hello?<eos> Price house.<eos> Boo!<eos> Is this absolutely necessary?<eos> I just wanted to be sure we haven't missed anything.<eos> Where's the body?<eos> - Coroner just came and took it. - What?
Especially the younger men, they made comments about us.<eos> Things like that went on for quite some time.<eos> Later some guy, I never knew who, gave me the nickname "Standard Component".<eos> What did that mean?<eos> At first, I had no idea what it meant.<eos> Later I came to know it meant "flower of the factory".<eos> After that, people began calling me "Little Flower".<eos> There was a movie called "Little Flower", with Joan Chen, Tang Guoqiang and Liu Xiaoqing.<eos> Our factory showed that movie for a whole week.<eos> Many people saw it several times.
Chris, are you in position?<eos> Roger that, ma'am.<eos> You said you'd square this with the guv over brekkie?<eos> Chris, there's no time for that.<eos> I have to nail Layton now.<eos> Look, crime squad gave us the drop-off point for Markham's messages.<eos> - Are you at it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> OK. Message in place?<eos> Shaz has just set it up.
Why should you?<eos> Please be sensible.<eos> Let's have some tea, shall we?<eos> 'I wanted to tell her about that strange girl in the prison.<eos> But she wouldn't understand... or wouldn't want to hear.<eos> She's changed now.<eos> Changed, and... ordinary.<eos> Ah.<eos> Did you come for the demonstration?<eos> I'm afraid we've had to cancel it.
She's lucky I'm giving her anything.<eos> You know what?<eos> We've been miserable for years.<eos> I don't want to die with that woman.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> This is the life I was always meant to have.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Mona has the marriage license, and she was to hurt you.<eos> If you want to be with this 20-year-old girl, you're going to have to buy it from her.
What can I do for you?<eos> Actually, this might not be the best time to talk about this.<eos> Can't you tell I'd welcome a change in subject?<eos> Well, good, then.<eos> What the hell, right?<eos> Listen, we're coming up on two years together here.<eos> Did you get me something?<eos> I think we're at a point in time where I need to know what your plans are.<eos> A partnership.<eos> I think I've earned it.
I'm on call again on Wednesday.<eos> Why don't you wait in here while I get my things?<eos> Whose pants have a 38 inseam?<eos> Harold.<eos> I would like to meet him.<eos> I kicked him out.<eos> Even though old ladies shouldn't be picky.<eos> It's beautiful here.<eos> You like the porch?<eos> You paid for it.
bart,darling.<eos> what is the big mystery?<eos> what are we doing here?<eos> this is the first building i ever bought.<eos> well,it's quite impressive.<eos> you had a good eye even--even back then.<eos> sometimes i like to come here, just to... feel how it felt the first time i saw it.<eos> well,there is a comfort in revisiting the things that we loved... when we were young.<eos> but the truth is, i'm not that young man anymore.<eos> i think maybe i've outgrown this place, and holding on to it is keeping me from moving forward with what's most important to me now.
Never get them under his jacket.<eos> - Paul Daniels could.<eos> - Yeah, he'd like that.<eos> - Not a lot.<eos> - But he'd like it.<eos> For God's sake, keep that thing out of sight.<eos> Don't let him near you.<eos> He might be your boyfriend, but if he thinks you've betrayed him, he'll kill you.<eos> OK.<eos> Feed us the location as soon as you have it.
- Are you mad?<eos> - Do you really think, with what I've set up here, that I can have police crawling all over us just cos you can't resist one last taste of what it was like? !<eos> And you could kill yourself doing that!<eos> God!<eos> Adrenaline brings on the fits and the next one could...<eos> So tie her up and tie her tight.<eos> Why would anybody throw away this amount of meat?<eos> The sell by dates are recent.<eos> It's like it hasn't even been refrigerated.<eos> Like they were never gonna use it.
What's the matter?<eos> No contact with customers.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Hey, you said one beer.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> One beer.<eos> There you go.<eos> Hey, bro, this is supposed to say Randy.<eos> I guess they got it off your W-4 or something.
I want my brain in an android body.<eos> Eight feet tall and ribbed.<eos> I'm with you.<eos> I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish.<eos> I promised my mother.<eos> I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised.<eos> But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer.<eos> Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays.<eos> Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?<eos> Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but Occam's rasor would suggest that someone threw it out.
Lately, it's not easy moving under heavy inspection.<eos> I'll do my best to hurry.<eos> Please, I beg you.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Can I buy this medicine?<eos> Do you have the prescription with you?<eos> Prescription?<eos> The patient isn't here, so can't I just have it?
Fine. No makeup.<eos> But can you at least wear a dress so you look a little bit more feminine?<eos> I don't have any.<eos> I will get you one.<eos> Listen it can be totally hip.<eos> Totally you.<eos> I don't wear dresses.<eos> Please!<eos> I will get you something that you like and then you can keep it.<eos> How about you buy the dress and then after the interview... I return it and keep the money?

Say what?<eos> I love you.<eos> Je t'aime.<eos> J'taime.<eos> Forever? .<eos> Pour toujours.<eos> Je t'taime, Marcel.<eos> Pour toujours.<eos> I wrote him a love letter, like you told me, saying goodbye.<eos> And I didn't give it to him.
Je t'aime.<eos> J'taime.<eos> Forever? .<eos> Pour toujours.<eos> Je t'taime, Marcel.<eos> Pour toujours.<eos> I wrote him a love letter, like you told me, saying goodbye.<eos> And I didn't give it to him.<eos> I hid it in one of his books.<eos> Maybe one day he will find it, and realize how much he misses me.
He likes you.<eos> Fine.<eos> Pussies.<eos> Fucking hotel key.<eos> Shit. Fucker.<eos> Maybe they gave you the wrong key... for your room that you have with your husband, Dean Hodes, the lovable gimp.<eos> Yes.<eos> Look at this thing.<eos> Do you want to hold it?<eos> No, I don't want to hold it.
Yes.<eos> Are you dead?<eos> Can't you tell?<eos> But...<eos> Are you old?<eos> I'm twelve.<eos> But I've been twelve for a long time.<eos> Are you like, poor?<eos> See that egg over there?<eos> If you sold it, you could buy a whole nuclear power plant. For real.
I'm just trying to tell God how sorry I am for what I've done.<eos> Please.<eos> I need that boy to live.<eos> Tell that freak to stop staring at me.<eos> Not many people would jump in a frozen lake for a stranger.<eos> - He's not a stranger, he's a stalker.<eos> - V-tach, lost the pulse.<eos> Starting compressions.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> What's happening? His heart has stopped beating effectively. We can't shock it back until he's warmer.
- Maybe fucking Reeves.<eos> Your boss?<eos> - Is he attracted to you...<eos> Reeves?<eos> - Why wouldn't he be?<eos> - What do you think about me?<eos> - I think you're flirting with me.<eos> - Where's the stain?<eos> - What were you expecting to feel<eos> - when you saw it?
But you need to remember why Laura came to you in the first place.<eos> So you're telling me now what's, uh, what's wrong with my patient?<eos> Another dissertation on what a lousy therapist I am?<eos> I have never, ever said anything like that.<eos> Excuse me, you haven't?<eos> What about that famous letter you wrote?<eos> I carried that letter in my pocket for months.<eos> But I do have to say that everything I've accomplished as a therapist, I owe to that letter, so, thank you.<eos> You know, we're getting away from Laura, again.<eos> I can quote it:
The one cow gives milk and the other one doesn't?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Anyway... my dad died when I was 13.<eos> And my mother's rather like Cinderella's stepmother, and my sister's like the evil stepsister.<eos> Once, when I was 13, um... my parents came back from Milan with two identical dresses, very, very beautiful ones.<eos> A red one for Maria, my sister, and a blue one for me.<eos> Mine, of course, didn't fit me.<eos> So, my mother told her to switch with me because she was older and hers was slightly bigger.<eos> She, of course, didn't want to, so she started screaming and said, she wanted the red dress, it's not her fault that I'm so fat.<eos> And finally, she threw the dress at me and said, "Then take it, fatso."
So, come on then, Miss Foster, those pills, what are they?<eos> Well, you might as well have a scoop, since you'll never see it printed.<eos> This is the spark of life.<eos> And what's that supposed to mean?<eos> Officially, the capsule attracts all the fat cells and flushes them away.<eos> Well, it certainly attracts them, that part's true.<eos> But it binds the fat together and galvanises it to form a body.<eos> What do you mean, a body?<eos> I am surprised you never asked about my name.<eos> I chose it well.
What are we talking about?<eos> A drug?<eos> Right, I'm not familiar with Reset, so any idea of a chemical name?<eos> Where d'you get it from, Marie?<eos> I got it from the Pharm.<eos> The farm?<eos> What farm?<eos> No, P-H-A-R-M, the Pharm.<eos> It's a medical research place, all right?<eos> How did you get it from there?
This could have been me, or Martha.<eos> I've given her twice the critical dose.<eos> So, Mayfly larvae are incubating?<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Her immune system's clearly reacting.<eos> There's obviously quite a fight going on inside her.<eos> Keep your nerve.<eos> We're making history.<eos> Ianto, what have you done with Billy Davis' body?<eos> Um, I was just about to dispose of it.
Hello, jack.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> The woman you're traveling with-<eos> She's not who she says she is.<eos> Then who is she?<eos> She's a representative of some people Who have been trying to find this island, jack.<eos> If you phone her boat, Every single living person on this island Will be killed.<eos> Get that device-<eos> The phone she carries with her<eos> - And give it to me.
She'll have a Sunday off soon, now she's settled in.<eos> - How much, Jerry?<eos> - Penny each.<eos> You'll need to fix your prices closer to the size of a Lark Rise purse.<eos> I tell you what I'll do.<eos> I'll give you three whoppers for tuppence.<eos> Mrs Caroline Arless?<eos> I'm herself, and simply oozing' with goodness.<eos> I'm here on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen to serve you with a summons for the non-payment of debts.<eos> You took the beer, you drank it, and now you're going to pay for it.
I'm not sure I'd call all that warbling and those peculiar instruments entertainment.<eos> But they're doing it for us.<eos> We're expected to sit in a cold, damp school hall for them?<eos> It all seems rather unnecessary to me.<eos> That's the beauty of it, they do it for me and I do it for them.<eos> Adelaide, if I was to say I wanted you there beside me...<eos> I'm sure you'll enjoy it all so much more without me fidgeting by your side.<eos> When Sunday comes around, I'm going to have a dreadful chill, which will mean I must spend the day in bed.<eos> There.<eos> This pastry's so light, a little puff of wind could blow it away.
I-I understand,but suppose it's all been a trick, a ruse?<eos> If we don't open that envelope, dr. Swann's conclusions could be as mythical as the gods of mount olympus.<eos> Virgil's gonna be here any minute.<eos> I suggest you don't refer to his life's work as mythology.<eos> Veritas...<eos> Is the greatest secret the world will ever know.<eos> We forthis group to use our wealth and r to protect that secret, not expose it.<eos> Is that robert queen talking, or is that virgil swann?<eos> You're sounding more like him every day.<eos> Yes. Dr. Swann made the discovery alone, but that does not give him the right to keep it to p mself.
facedwith a two pronged attack from termites and rot, the beams that hold up the roof give way.<eos> and the boundary between inside and out, that had once been so important to the humans who called this building home, is forever erased.<eos> othersubstances like this mortar and rock are gonna last longer than several decades, but they'll still crumble after natural,chemical, and physical weathering processes, and eventually these walls will fall down as well, and there'll be no remnants.<eos> now,naturewillactquickly to swallow up these ruins.<eos> this crumbling house in baltimore's druid hill park was once home to the caretaker of the city zoo.<eos> itlookslikethisbuilding has been abandoned for more than a hundred years.<eos> but in reality, people have been living here up till 40 years ago.<eos> it's amazing how quickly the vegetation has reclaimed the area.<eos> the vines have started to climb up the walls.<eos> the trees are growing into the structure, and they're both physically pulling the structure apart, and chemically dissolving it.
But remember that every strip will be decorated by millions of silver sequins.<eos> - That one?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That's the beauty of it, all these sparkling sequins.<eos> But how will they do it?<eos> They'll put them one by one, all by hand.<eos> Superb--<eos> Look in the mirror!<eos> I think it's the most beautiful dress of the collection.<eos> This is the dress that I wake up early in the morning and I was pissed off because I didn't like the previous dress, and I changed it for this one, you see.
What did you do to it? A short-Wave sonic weapon.<eos> I haven't met a creature yet<eos> That likes getting hit with it-- Henry...<eos> When it works.<eos> Who are you two?<eos> Journalists?<eos> We're with channel 13. I'm...<eos> Amy saunders.<eos> "Weekend weather watch with the fabulous amy." I love your show.<eos> I mean, I watch it, when I can.
It's a giant poisonous bug!<eos> That's great, that's just great.<eos> He just... That thing could do that to all of us.<eos> Did you think this was some kind of game?<eos> That you could just come here And film some wild event, and then, what,<eos> Enjoy cocktails at some award ceremony?<eos> I've never seen anyone die before.<eos> Well, this is what you came for.<eos> Okay, forget about capturing it alive.<eos> How do we kill it?
- A folding man?<eos> - Urban legend.<eos> Crops up in city after city.<eos> Supposedly, a man who's capable of collapsing his skeleton to fit through narrow spaces.<eos> The legend falls short of a feat like this.<eos> But it is possible that we're looking at some sort of super-folder.<eos> Okay. Help me out here.<eos> You're familiar with a newborn's fontanelles?<eos> Yeah, the soft spot on the top of a baby's head, sure.<eos> Nature created it so the child could fit through the birth canal.
And what would you have us tell them?<eos> That their man's addicted to gold and that he slithers like a python?<eos> That's a good point.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're safe.<eos> Who says?<eos> I'm Dr. Zimmerman.<eos> Will.<eos> What is this place?<eos> We call it the Sanctuary.
Actually, no, I don't know anything about him.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's just, all the doctors said he was suffering from advanced dementia,<eos> and my parents, it's all my relatives think he was crazy.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> He just felt so strongly.<eos> I loved him very much.<eos> How did he come to this decision?<eos> Well, he always talked about a private research facility.<eos> He called it "the Sanctuary", a place where what he called...
I can quote you any manner of chapters and verses.<eos> And I won't deny that I love that book.<eos> But what if those fears... don't feel petty?<eos> Now, here, today, what then?<eos> What if a man's desire is to do his work and take his day of rest and use that day in whatever way he chooses?<eos> I choose THIS place.<eos> I know that I go about preaching devotion and sacrifice.<eos> Perhaps God... saw fit to put me to the test.<eos> My heart tells me that I have failed.<eos> My courage snapped in the night and I couldn't put it back together.
mom, can you do me a favour? Can you take a letter to Nishi San restaurant.<eos> Tell him it's extremely important.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sorry to trouble you.<eos> I'll try to reach him.<eos> If I can reach him, I'll call you.<eos> Hang on!<eos> Zin is trying to send this letter to her husband.<eos> What should we do this time?<eos> Just send it. We can then settle this once and for all.
Chuck, never do that again.<eos> It's Jill.<eos> I think....<eos> We know.<eos> - We know. Wait.<eos> This-This has got to be a mistake, okay?<eos> I've known Jill for eight years, since college, and we-we had this really amazing night.<eos> Look, she's not a spy, and she has no FULCRUM code name.<eos> The code name was...<eos> Wait, wait, wait. Don't say it.
Do it now.<eos> Too late.<eos> You're making a big mistake.<eos> Sorry, sorry, excuse me!<eos> Mr. Bartowski.<eos> You need to come with me.<eos> Um, you told Jill to shoot me.<eos> Why would I ever go anywhere with you?<eos> I'd rather not leave your body here on the ride.<eos> What if some kid saw it?
Kind of freaky deeky.<eos> Hey, you know what this reminds me of?<eos> Would that be a prison?<eos> No, but yeah. 'Cause of the cells and everything.<eos> But what it really reminds me of is a horror movie, you know?<eos> You know, like maybe that one with the haunted spaceship. Where that freakin' gooey head pops right out of her- bobby.<eos> - Yeah, charlie.<eos> - Murder weapon?<eos> - Haven't found it yet.<eos> I'm back looking for it.
But we got guys in the basement,<eos> All they do is pull stuff off computers.<eos> Pulled some pretty good stuff off of yours.<eos> You know, you'd probably like a job like that.<eos> Down there in the dark, just you and a computer.<eos> Wanna talk about bethany?<eos> - Please don't say her name.<eos> - Why not?<eos> It's a pretty name.<eos> It's not for you to speak it.

You're already dead.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you later then, crews.<eos> What are you sitting on?<eos> Earthquake kit.<eos> I can live out of this thing for five days.<eos> Water, radio, blankets, food.<eos> It's got a seat.<eos> So after you empty out the bucket, you can use it as a toilet.
We don't want to embarrass anyone.<eos> So if you know where they are, just point them out.<eos> We'll get this over nice and quietly--<eos> You guys investigating kendall's death?<eos> That's right?<eos> And you are?<eos> Alex lauer.<eos> Officer alex lauer.<eos> Your name isn't on that list, alex.<eos> So maybe you want to hand it on back.
There must be something you gotta do to get yourself ready, y'know, "[clears throat] okay, here we go"<eos> [exhales] "ahaha, you..<eos> I'm gonna suck ya"<eos> "muahaha oookay, HERE WE GO!"<eos> So, faggot, I don't know.<eos> A lot of words that are not bad words, but some people start using them a lot to hurt other people and then they become bad and become hard to use.<eos> There's words that I love that I can't use because other people use them wrong to hurt other people.<eos> Like the word cunt is a beautiful word, to me there's just beauty in that word, and I mean like asthetically it's chocolate-y and round on the ends.<eos> I just... cunt, I just like the way it sounds.<eos> I don't use it as an insult, I'll be alone in the laundry like "cunt, cunt" I just like saying it
I don't know if you wanted to pay your respects.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you a friend of Will's?<eos> Well, you don't look like a churchman, so I'm guessing you're police.<eos> Detective Sergeant Hathaway.<eos> I hate churches.<eos> Trust Will to finally get me back in one.<eos> I didn't catch your name.<eos> I didn't drop it.
Yes.<eos> Monday.<eos> I... ..left about 10 - had to be up for 5am the next morning.<eos> I'm impressed you found the time, sir.<eos> I mean, with all this on the way.<eos> I've read about this in the papers.<eos> Yes.<eos> A lifetime in the making.<eos> 10,000 acres of brownfield site.<eos> That filthy eyesore of a gas plant - we strip it down, transform it into the new Blenheim.
Don't touch me or I'll set you on fire!<eos> Well, I'm off to the store to check they're out of oil.<eos> If not, I'll make you drink some!<eos> Sure!<eos> You're going to the bar!<eos> Shut up, woman!<eos> No, I won't!<eos> Come to Daddy, my baby.<eos> I made you when I was drunk, but you're gonna get all my fortune.<eos> The communists will get it.
To town, to sell what's left of the quota.<eos> Is Mom home?<eos> She is, she's praying to the icons.<eos> But they don't listen.<eos> Come on, gee up!<eos> Hi Mom.<eos> Go to the store.<eos> I've just been there.<eos> We're out of lamp oil.<eos> Isn't Dad in town buying it?
Why, what's wrong?<eos> Are you upset?<eos> No, I'm happy.<eos> I'm celebrating the six month anniversary of having my land taken by the communists.<eos> I should have drunk it away when I could.<eos> Drinks all round on me.<eos> God bless you, Vrabie !<eos> And may we drink more when they've taken away what's left! At least, I had something to be taken away from me.<eos> Oh, I mustn't forget, have you got any lamp oil?<eos> You can't drink it!
"... and" I can't stop thinking about why we couldn't save her.<eos> I just...<eos> Anywhere I go, you go.<eos> A compass?<eos> I know it's corny, but it seems we always find each other.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm pregnant.<eos> I carry your heart.<eos> I carry it in my heart.
In the last two years, a group of British scientists and experts have been re-evaluating 20 of the country's most harmful drugs.<eos> If alcohol was invented today, it would be illegal.<eos> There's no question.<eos> The debate still goes on as to whether or not cannabis can cause schizophrenia.<eos> It can certainly cause an acute psychosis.<eos> If you look at ecstasy, it isn't a drug that causes significant problems.<eos> Yet, if you ask the public, they would probably rate ecstasy as something that was very dangerous.<eos> The group, led by Professor David Nutt, had a simple aim - to create the first scientifically valid list of drugs ranked in order of harm.<eos> They used three criteria.<eos> One is what the drug does to the person who takes it.
What's wrong with you?<eos> Lost a husband, but got a concubine.<eos> Good deal?<eos> Xiao-Chuan.<eos> Give her a hand.<eos> Take the wheel chair up.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Open it.
I don't know, M rs. Lane.<eos> But he had a ring with your name on it.<eos> R uairi?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> R uairi?<eos> R uairi O'Oonnell.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> Why should I care?<eos> If he meant so little to you, why the ring?<eos> I didn't know he still wore it.
I can read them like a book.<eos> You're lonely.<eos> Like I am.<eos> You're married. Is that the problem?<eos> She died.<eos> M r. Gently.<eos> What?<eos> How did R uairi die?<eos> He was shot.<eos> And then somebody poured petrol over his body and set light to it.
Know the sort I mean, don't you?<eos> And they were mates, were they?<eos> No. You're joking, aren't you?<eos> R uairi couldn't stand him.<eos> M r. Madsen, did R uairi have a gun?<eos> No.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Well, I never saw him with a gun.<eos> He never talked about having... why would he have a gun?<eos> This bottle of J40 Oil, what do you use it for?
R uairi couldn't stand him.<eos> M r. Madsen, did R uairi have a gun?<eos> No.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Well, I never saw him with a gun.<eos> He never talked about having... why would he have a gun?<eos> This bottle of J40 Oil, what do you use it for?<eos> I don't.<eos> It belonged to R uairi.<eos> Well, what did R uairi use it for?
So what is it you don't want your mum to know?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Come on, you're too smart for that.<eos> - Just leave me alone...<eos> Anyone playing it as cool as you are must be scared of something.<eos> Don't try to sweet-talk me.<eos> If you're gonna arrest me, do it.<eos> I done nothing wrong.<eos> - You had classified military hardware.<eos> - I found it on the street.
Our next spelling bee contestant is...<eos> Omar Mahar... jarif... a... something September 11th-y.<eos> All right, Omar, your word is "candy."<eos> Candy.<eos> C-A-N-D-Y.<eos> Candy.<eos> That's correct.<eos> Our next contestant is Peter Griffin.<eos> Peter, your word is "tree."<eos> Can you use it in a sentence, please?
Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> (laughing nervously): It's really stupid.<eos> Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks, Abby.<eos> And now we wait.<eos> And sure enough, by session seven, she saw me in a whole new light.<eos> Okay, I'm about to break my big rule here.<eos> Break it.
It's recharged!<eos> Use it!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Test completed.<eos> What was it?<eos> Doctor, what did it do?<eos> Doctor, what happened?<eos> Electrical energy, Miss Tyler.<eos> Every atom in existence is bound by an electrical field.<eos> The Reality Bomb cancels it out.
You have to step back now, okay?<eos> Get them the fuck out of here.<eos> Get them out of here.<eos> Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.<eos> Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.<eos> I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.<eos> And, boy, did I learn.<eos> "And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it."<eos> Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.<eos> I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
Great.<eos> - We can always use one of those.<eos> - Abby, you're with me.<eos> Admit Mr. Sucar to the burn unit.<eos> Keep an eye on his airway.<eos> I gotta say, I was shocked when Luka quit.<eos> - I always thought he'd be a lifer here.<eos> - Yeah. Well, change is probably a good thing, right?<eos> Is that why you cancelled your interview?<eos> I didn't cancel it.
No, sweetie, I can't.<eos> If I could, you wouldn't be here now.<eos> Daddy, get me out of here.<eos> The two of us can run away.<eos> And where do you want us to go?<eos> To Vienna.<eos> Vienna?<eos> Why?<eos> I'll need the dress.<eos> Go on, buy it for me. I can't go like this.
Let her talk.<eos> What do you know?<eos> Fat lot of good you've been.<eos> Just let her explain.<eos> Well, I think, I mean, from what I've seen, it repeats, then it synchronizes, then it goes on to the next stage and that's exactly what the Doctor said would happen.<eos> - What, and you're on his side?<eos> - No!<eos> The voice is the thing. DEE DEE:<eos> And she's the voice.<eos> She stole it!
It's gone!<eos> Stolen!<eos> Roger<eos> My son...<eos> My child!<eos> That poor footman!<eos> Roger is dead and he can't even mourn him.<eos> 1926, it's more like the Dark Ages.<eos> Did you inquire after the necklace?<eos> Lady Eddison brought it back from India.
This place hasn't changed a bit since i last saw it.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You were the last person to see lana while she was well.<eos> I figured you're the one to talk to if i have any chance of helping her.<eos> No one's asking for your help.<eos> I'm only trying to save her, Clark.<eos> I had the best medical minds in the world examine her.<eos> Is there anything thctors can do to help her?<eos> They tell me her condition is unlike any they've ever seen.<eos> Several specialists described it as almost alien.
- Your teacher's penis?<eos> - Yeah, that must be his.<eos> Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?<eos> Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat:<eos> getting material ahead of time.<eos> When Bill Belichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do?<eos> He videotaped the opposing team's defense.<eos> Think of the defense as your test.<eos> When taking a test you must also videotape the defense<eos> Learn what's on the test before they give it to you.
His mind, his blue eyes.<eos> But someone gets between them.<eos> So they decide to meet one night at an out-of-the-way little bar...<eos> Does that sound familiar?<eos> Do I feel familiar?<eos> What do you feel?<eos> Electricity.<eos> Electricity.<eos> I know I saw the symptom.<eos> I know the memory is locked in my brain, now I know how to get it.
I signed it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You did not tell her that was alright.<eos> The whole conversation was that she needs AP English class<eos> - She is taking some.<eos> - ... with Dr. Wells.<eos> Should I not have signed it for?<eos> She needed someone to sign the piece of paper 'cause she was going to school, she couldn't get in touch with you... she couldn't talk to you, so I signed it for her.<eos> Honey, we gonna change the schedule.<eos> We can't change it.
Here's my application for the University of Texas.<eos> I'd appreciate your thoughts.<eos> Also, I'm gonna be running for students council president.<eos> Here is my petition with all my signatures.<eos> One more thing.<eos> Don't tell me that I can't get to college ever again.<eos> If I don't get in, then you can call me an idiot.<eos> But I don't wanna hear that from you again.<eos> See, I don't accept that fate for myself.<eos> And I'm gonna do everything in my power to avoid it.
Lois.<eos> Lois, Lois I will decide what is best for my child, all right?<eos> Look, will you take it easy?<eos> And, and, I do not want to have this conversation in front of my son.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> That's it, Brian.<eos> Feed him whatever you want.<eos> Tell, tell you what.<eos> Go up to my jewelry box, take my gold jewelry.<eos> Melt it down.
So, he's in on the scheme, too<eos> I'll let you know when I have his flight info<eos> Hello?<eos> What? I'm going home<eos> I'll get killed<eos> Going home without getting a single shot?<eos> I got a picture<eos> Of me drunk?<eos> No, of a kid, yesterday, a beggar...<eos> You didn't get that shot You stole it
I didn't believe you, but it's real, isn't it?<eos> They'll run tests on him for the next 10 days<eos> After that, they'll bring the child the donor, here<eos> If our information is correct<eos> Drop me off and then go to the airport<eos> Maybe I don't have what it takes to be a cameraman<eos> But you need your camera, right?<eos> You are staying on the story?<eos> I have to witness, the face of the child being sacrificed, entering that hospital<eos> Because I couldn't save it I'll watch and I'll write what I see
- Charming as ever.<eos> - Oh, I knew you'd show up.<eos> Because I knew Sam wouldn't listen.<eos> But you're not gonna teach him anything.<eos> You understand me?<eos> Over my dead body.<eos> Oh, well, you're right about that.<eos> What you are gonna do is give me that knife.<eos> And then you'll go crawl back into whatever slop you came from and never bother me again, are we clear?<eos> Your brother is carrying a bomb inside of him and we'd be stupid not to use it.
I got four other deliveries to make.<eos> You want to just pay me the money so I can go?<eos> Of course.<eos> But I have a coupon.<eos> Dean, hey, listen, uh, Ed is not our guy.<eos> I'm guessing you're at home with Jamie, so just give me a call, okay?<eos> Lucy.<eos> You wake.<eos> The gown, it suits your beauty.<eos> Please, put it on.
It's an honor.<eos> Really.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.<eos> And I you.<eos> Sam Winchester, the boy with the demon blood.<eos> Glad to hear you've ceased your extracurricular activities.<eos> Let's keep it that way.<eos> Yeah, okay, Chuckles.<eos> Who's your friend?<eos> This raising of Samhain, have you stopped it?
I want Scylla out of Los Angeles by the end of the day tomorrow.<eos> Brad? Get out there!<eos> - Push it.<eos> - Don't do this.<eos> Brad!<eos> If anything should happen, call my mom in Chicago.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen.<eos> - Where's Brad's body now?<eos> - On its way to the morgue.<eos> It's at the cooler at Homeland Security where nobody can find it.
The wife says there was.<eos> There wasn't.<eos> How can you bear this smell?<eos> Report immediately to chief.<eos> I hired you knowing about your imprisonment.<eos> I trusted you, believed in you...<eos> Don't you appreciate it?<eos> That man lost his hand.<eos> Think what it means to him to lose his wedding ring too.<eos> So, will you... return it?
- Yuk!<eos> - Yeah, you know who she is?<eos> Once she is standing and smoking with boys. There comes a dog just poking its nose into her leg. And there she goes and kicks this dog, then dog comes off and wheezes.<eos> - No way!<eos> - Then she takes the dog and starts hitting the wall with it!<eos> - Poor doggy.<eos> - Yes, this Nastya can do whatever she wants... damn her.<eos> - I am lucky I have given the ring to her.<eos> - Yes...<eos> Now we are looking for it.
- are you kidding me?<eos> What?<eos> My mom just texted me.<eos> I have to write that paper for matthews by tomorrow.<eos> How much have you writte<eos> I haven't even started yet!<eos> Oh, my god, I-I... I can't do this right now.<eos> This is so not what I need I mean, I know if I just sat down and started writing it, that I could get it done, but thinking about staring at a blank piece of paper... what am I gonna do?<eos> Well, I can help.<eos> I told you, I got an "a" on that paper last year, so I can give it to you, and you can take some ideas from it.

Well, Chief Johnson, you might wanna tune in tonight, because, I assure you, every network is gonna run with this story.<eos> Well, Commander, don't let me stand between you and the cameras.<eos> Chief, I can do a thorough investigation right now.<eos> A murdering scumbag alcoholic passes out in an alley and gets run over by a car, leaving the world a much better place.<eos> I'll write it up, and we'll all be home by noon.<eos> Look, I'd love to be done with this by noon.<eos> You have no idea how much I'd like to be done with this by noon, but we have a dead body, a bunch of nosy reporters and somebody fled the scene, so nobody is gonna be done with anything by noon.<eos> Now, who has the number for the halfway house?<eos> The place is run by a private foundation.<eos> They call it a reentry center.
now... i have read your file, mr. murphy, and according to the fbi, you are a rising star in a very large drug-trafficking organization.<eos> they even have video of you with a major kingpin -- i believe y'all call him el jefe -- on his yacht, near catalina.<eos> i don't know what you're talking about.<eos> well, that's okay because we have some pretty important videotape of our own.<eos> it show you shooting ben masters at point-blank range.<eos> and since the murder was so up close and personal, i'm sure we'll find loads of physical evidence, as well.<eos> you recognize this ring, mr. murphy?<eos> you're wearing it right now.<eos> and you were wearing it on the day the videotape was taken.<eos> would you please remove that ring and set it on the table?
But no.<eos> Evidently the family has decided that I'm a gold digger and all overtures of friendship must be stamped on.<eos> Frankly, it's rather insulting.<eos> But I'm not having it.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Now we may rest.<eos> We are arrived.<eos> God is good.<eos> God is glorious.<eos> If you want my professional opinion... which you don't, but you should, so I'm gonna give it to you anyway...
Maybe there's another option.<eos> What option?<eos> We try to make contact with his contact ourselves.<eos> We do the deal for the heroin without him.<eos> His contact?<eos> Abdullah Akhmadev.<eos> Don't move.<eos> How do you know that name?<eos> I...<eos> I heard it.
okay, carter-- i really hope you're right.<eos> tell me a bout it.<eos> right-- so you're sure martha's gonna be able to hear us on this thing?<eos> yeah-yeah, but, whether she listens to us, is another matter.<eos> omega one, we're being targeted.<eos> if you have any words of wisdom, like don't start world war iii, now's the time.<eos> listen, martha, it's ethan.<eos> i know that you're upset, but, violence is not the answer.<eos> and there's going to be consequences for your actions, young lady.<eos> if you want respect, you're just gonna have to earn it.
Thorne wants to see me five minutes ago.<eos> Can you, um--<eos> Yeah. can you help?<eos> thank you.<eos> Used to be pretty good at this.<eos> The micro lock is damaged.<eos> You just need to-- yeah, it's like--<eos> Super-velcro. i-i know.<eos> So- - I should have believed you When you told me about the earthquake.<eos> No, you didn't feel it. I know it sounds crazy.
Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert<eos> And on the pedestal these words appear:<eos> "My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:<eos> "Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"<eos> Nothing beside remains<eos> Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<eos> The lone and level sands stretch far away<eos> "lf Liverpool did not exist, it would have to be invented." (Myrbach)<eos> We love the place we hate, then hate the place we love<eos> We leave the place we love, then spend a lifetime trying to regain it.
Without asking yourself questions?<eos> Without asking myself questions. And my pain gradually faded.<eos> By becoming a slave?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> By not thinking, my inner defenses fell. So without even wanting to,<eos> I could find previously hidden realities inside myself.<eos> In fact, my pain was linked to a profound refusal to accept myself.<eos> So the pain slowly diminished.<eos> I gradually felt almost totally free.<eos> I also began to really know my body, and to use it, including as an object of pleasure.
I mean,I've had three watches dropped in my body during surgery, and one of them's still in there.<eos> So I take it you're a movie buff?<eos> Hell,yeah!<eos> You spend 95% of your teen years in bed,you're going to watch somelicks.<eos> What's your favorite movie?<eos> Oh,without a doubt,2 The Max.<eos> It's all action with Max Patrick-- CIA agent,Navy SEAL,gigolo,and devoted family man.<eos> Watch as Max stops the terrorists from using a giant robot squid to kill the president!<eos> Me and Randy love squid movies.<eos> How'd we miss it?
But the good news is that all the other branches {\pos(190,230)}are doing just as bad as we are.<eos> {\pos(190,230)}So corporate upped the prize to 5 days.<eos> {\pos(190,230)}So if we stay fat long enough, {\pos(190,230)}we may actually get a whole month off.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.<eos> I swallowed a tapeworm last night.<eos> It's going to grow up to 3 feet inside of me, And then eats all my food so that I don't get fat.<eos> And then after 3 months, I take some medicine and then I pass it.<eos> Creed sold it to me.
I'm not a big fan of coincidence.<eos> Who was it made the offer on the house?<eos> Some realtor.<eos> Ah. I'd like to talk to them.<eos> All right.<eos> I ha...<eos> I've got his card upstairs.<eos> She thinks I've quit.<eos> Ah.<eos> If we don't demand equality, we won't get it.

I'll take a donut.<eos> You already got a ticket.<eos> You're bribing people to come to your keynote address?<eos> The whole donut thing works for you, doesn't it?<eos> The blind leading the blind.<eos> Donut and a ticket?<eos> Just fucking take one.<eos> Something up, Lew?<eos> You remember that statement you took from the Chicky Hines alibi?<eos> You want me to recite it by heart?
A set of german steel filet knives, a couple of straight razors, And like 12 pounds of human skin.<eos> Just be careful out there, will you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Deb's got her mission.<eos> I've got mine.<eos> Hey, I can get out and give you a great, Big hug so everyone can see what good friends we are...<eos> Or you can talk to me.<eos> You know, after 12 hours on surveillance detail,<eos> How 'bout you blow me instead?<eos> I've been given the directive to either Step up my investigation of quinn or close it.
Are you deaf?<eos> He said it's not for sale.<eos> Does it say who bought it?<eos> The pico property?<eos> M.s.stark?<eos> So he not only bought the land,but he designed it himself?<eos> The building.<eos> It's about the building.<eos> What is?<eos> Stark accidentally killed the man who was going to build it,

Help me find this machine, agent.<eos> You and I'll take it apart piece by piece.<eos> I'm not sure what we'll find, But I doubt we'll find evil.<eos> So much food.<eos> I know. we're totally puking later.<eos> But whatever.<eos> It's an occasion.<eos> I like your necklace.<eos> It's cool, huh?<eos> I got it from this awesome thrift store in echo park.
Just put it all in the bag.<eos> What are these?<eos> Whatever. just put 'em back.<eos> They're the same as the necklace you gave me.<eos> Because I stole it when I worked here.<eos> You said, "i got it at this awesome thrift store In echo park."<eos> Tell me about the necklace.<eos> Why are you making such a big deal outf thth?<eos> Tell me about the necklace.<eos> I didn't buy it or steal it, okay?
- Do you need them now?<eos> Charlie just cleared a guard tower.<eos> - What is it, walt?<eos> - Fucking shit!<eos> Mark-19's jammed.<eos> Hitman Two, this is Two One.<eos> Our mark-19 is down.<eos> I say again, our main gun is down.<eos> Shit!<eos> Either unfuck it now or get on your fucking saw.
It's better than nothing.<eos> What we did, running and gunning through those towns, the good stuff and the bad was all part of the plan.<eos> Of all the Marines in the 1st division, the General selected us to be the instrument of long range strategy.<eos> We led the feint to Al Kut.<eos> We tied down two Iraqi divisions, saved untold numbers of U.S. soldiers.<eos> You should be proud.<eos> Why didn't we go into Al Kut?<eos> Gabe, the General's plan wasn't about taking the city.<eos> It was about making the Iraqis think we were gonna take it.<eos> To be clear, the Commander's intent was never to take it.
Dude, your jacket is caught on the barbed wire.<eos> Bounce around a little bit, and you'll come loose.<eos> That worked great.<eos> So, what kind of car does he have?<eos> Old one.<eos> Toyota FJ-40.<eos> He loves that thing. More than me, that's for sure.<eos> Check it out!<eos> Can you imagine if I gave him that golden side mirror?<eos> I could glue it on his truck.
Do you want to explain this to me?<eos> Uh, recently Geoffrey's been talking about finding a way to make himself part of the art.<eos> Do you mean literally?<eos> The ultimate artistic act.<eos> Geoffrey was depressed, and he said he felt like he'd reached his limit as an artist.<eos> We'd like to show you a picture of the remains, only if you're up for it.<eos> I suggest you don't look at the person, but rather this distinct ring.<eos> That's Geoffrey.<eos> I know that ring.<eos> I designed it myself.
. -There's no ECMO unit in the hospital.<eos> -What?<eos> . That can't be.<eos> -County only has two machines.<eos> One's in use, the other's out for repairs.<eos> Systolic's down to 44.<eos> Valecia needs a machine that will warm her blood and do the work of her heart and lungs.<eos> We don't have that here, so we have to transfer her to another hospital.<eos> It's gonna take hours for a hospital to accept her, a transport team to pick up.<eos> Time is critical. So let's not waste it.
Look.<eos> I know<eos> That this sounds crazy.<eos> In fact, I think I am crazy.<eos> But I can be<eos> Anywhere, at home or at work,<eos> Just all of a sudden, I get this-<eos> I don't know how to describe it.<eos> This feeling.<eos> And the only way that I can get it out To get rid of it, Is to-
The precision with which this object was constructed is inspiring.<eos> Down to the molecular bonds.<eos> I hope that a gigantic metallic suppository is not the pinnacle of human achievement.<eos> What is it?<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> If I tried reverse psychology... If I said to you right now: "Walter, don't tell me what that is," would that work?<eos> Many years ago, I worked on Project Thor.<eos> Department of Defense wanted a subterranean torpedo a missile which could, in theory, be shot from anywhere in the world through the Earth's core and hit its target on the other side.<eos> I know for a fact that is ridiculous.<eos> Open your mind, son, or someone may open it for you.
Until Dashiell showed up after he was abducted and beat her to death.<eos> Did I hear mention of my old friend Dashiell?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'd recognize his handiwork anywhere.<eos> You mean he killed others?<eos> Well, he tried. A patient at the institution, Jasper.<eos> But actually, I was referring to the equation.<eos> Dashiell was obsessed with it.<eos> - Obsessed in what way?<eos> - He couldn't complete it.
You may go.<eos> There's another dolly in the truck, Mike.<eos> You can take more than that lamp.<eos> For the record, I wanted to go another direction, which was way better.<eos> Well, I'll be the judge of that.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Okay, I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class, left it in my smock.<eos> I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl.<eos> Look, I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger.<eos> You can hardly see it.
I am jetting off on an international business trip.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To Canada.<eos> Where is it? Canada.<eos> Okay.<eos> My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client, and I have always been intrigued by all things international, the women, the pancakes, the man of mystery.<eos> Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.<eos> Hello.<eos> I am ashamed at your naked face.<eos> I must cover it with my jacket.
Oh, okay, wild adventure.<eos> Oh, frenzy stance isn't working.<eos> Die, you undead mummy, die!<eos> Drink a healing potion.<eos> Thank you. you're welcome.<eos> Anyhow, on a scale of one to five,<eos> With one being always initiated by him And five being always initiated by you, How do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?<eos> That's on the registration?<eos> Oh, yes, it's quite extensive.<eos> But if we complete it, You get a free expansion pack.
How are they qualified?<eos> What makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that's been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under 30?<eos> Boy, I'll bet Ellen Page's friends aren't giving her this kind of crap.<eos> Are you proud of yourself?<eos> In general, yes.<eos> Subtitles: sub-way.fr<eos> There's my missing neutrino.<eos> You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren't you, you little sub-atomic dickens?<eos> Hey, look, I found my missing neutrino.<eos> Oh good, we can take it off the milk carton.
Cocoa break. Cocoa break.<eos> Okay, it's clobbering time.<eos> Ted, don't do this, you're a nice guy.<eos> - That's your best quality.<eos> - Is it? 'Cause I seem to rember this nice guy getting dumped by his fiancée for a Tae Kwon Do instructor.<eos> This may sound crazy, but I... I think I need to do this.<eos> I think this is an experience I need to have.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Me, too!<eos> Guys... take a good look at this face, because the next time you see it, it will be disfigured in the hottest possible way.
It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot.<eos> But the burger, Ted.<eos> The burger. Dude.<eos> I want one of those burgers right now!<eos> Do you think they're still open? I don't know.<eos> Does stuff in New York stay open past... 9:30?<eos> So we went out to get another burger.<eos> But after hours of searching... Damn it!<eos> Where is this place?<eos> You couldn't find it?
Look, I have slept with lots of women who afterwards told me off and stormed out.<eos> And sometimes they'd pick up the phone and they'd call me and then we'd hook up again.<eos> And when we were finished, I could see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they wish they'd never called.<eos> But if you could see that look...<eos> Actually, you can see that look, there's a video.<eos> No!<eos> Stop, okay?<eos> I won't call.<eos> Don't drink the beer!<eos> I just remembered when I bought it.
What do you get for the guy that has nothing and wants nothing?<eos> Some squeaky shoes.<eos> Hi,Gibbs!<eos> Bye,Gibbs.<eos> Something wrong,Jethro?<eos> Fingerprints found at a double homicide yesterday-- belong to a petty officer who's supposed to have been dead 17 years.<eos> His death certificate.<eos> Oh,dear.<eos> Someone's in trouble.<eos> I signed it?
No one leaves here till I get back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I'm officially curious.<eos> We found the murder weapon.<eos> - That's a good thing, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Owned by a Marine who's been dead nine years-<eos> - Otis Tripp, your father-in-law.<eos> Smith Wesson, 32 kit.<eos> Have you ever see it?
Now I'm officially curious.<eos> We found the murder weapon.<eos> - That's a good thing, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Owned by a Marine who's been dead nine years-<eos> - Otis Tripp, your father-in-law.<eos> Smith Wesson, 32 kit.<eos> Have you ever see it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Otis left it to me.
And you look exactly like my dad.<eos> Oh,God.<eos> You don't.<eos> My dad looks like Barney Frank.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> Stop worrying,Matthew.<eos> People always tell me I look like other people.<eos> Oh,I once got a free taco, because someone thought I was Julia Roberts.<eos> Which kind of made me mad, 'cause if anyone can afford a taco, it's Julia Roberts.<eos> But I took it, 'cause I'm on student loans.
Okay.<eos> My goodness.<eos> I see you're almost finished with the lawn.<eos> Yeah, all done.<eos> Okay, you know, i'll just pick up the little sticks that you missed.<eos> No, no, I'll get that.<eos> I didn't notice those, but.<eos> Mom, is that dress new?<eos> - It looks really pretty.<eos> - Yeah, I got it for the picture.
Champagne for everybody.<eos> It was so good.<eos> - You hated it, didn't you?<eos> - It's so stupid.<eos> First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?<eos> - Wookiee.<eos> They're all like, "That's a good point, Bear, - "let's try that."<eos> - He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear.<eos> That is Ted's favorite movie of all time.<eos> He watches it when he's home sick with the flu.
Can we get this thing to the surface?<eos> Ah. It took on too much water and the power's out.<eos> Our only hope is a free ascent.<eos> We're not gonna be able to open that hatch till the sub fills with water, the pressure equalizes.<eos> We got to flood it.<eos> Right before we open the hatch, you have to take in as much air into your lungs as you can and then scream all the way to the surface.<eos> Doesn't sound very manly.<eos> If you don't, the air will expand and your lungs will explode.<eos> Let's go, move.<eos> Yes, I understand the threat, Admiral, but I have two agents aboard that vessel and I'm just asking you to try to disable it as opposed to sinking it.
I must inform you that you've been robbed.<eos> - And that's not all.<eos> Those scumbags turned your bedroom upside down.<eos> - God!<eos> - Calm down honey. - Calm down madam.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - We found this weapon at your place.<eos> - Yes, this is my rifle.<eos> I hope you have a permit for it.<eos> Bring it to the police precinct as soon as possible.
We'll find 'em.<eos> You call Trammel?<eos> Trammel called us looking for Clay.<eos> All right, good.<eos> No way we're getting those guns to Laroy with the feds there.<eos> I see you haven't called your lawyer.<eos> My lawyer's $1,200 an hour.<eos> When I got a problem worth that pay scale, I'll give him a call.<eos> And you don't think that aiding and abetting a murder and a triple homicide is a problem?<eos> I don't know nothing about that crime or the guys that did it.
Women only have five seconds to be young d beautiful,<eos> And then it's gone.<eos> And then before you know it, we're old and fat and married And wondering where our beauty went.<eos> Gaby...<eos> No, Carlos. I mean... Sometimes I'm glad you can't see me.<eos> Five years and two kids And no Time for facials or the gym. It just...<eos> And when Edie same the other day, It was like she didn't even recognize me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Nobody knows your face better than I do.<eos> And I see it every Time I kiss you.
So I assume you want me to shut the hell up and go away, right?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I just want to hear what you think happed.<eos> That's all.<eos> Okay.<eos> You really wanna know?<eos> I think my sister was fed up with Patrick and his girlfriend.<eos> Oh, yeah, I know all about her or him.<eos> My guess is Ellen was gonna leave Patrick and take the kids, and then he killed or had her killed.<eos> Then he just dumped her body in that wedding cake castle of theirs and burned it down to cover it all up.
I was wondering how long it'd take for you to show up.<eos> How are you, chase?<eos> I stopped by darling avionics, and the plant manager told me you walked off the job yesterday.<eos> That's right.<eos> Do you mind if I ask you why?<eos> What do you care?<eos> Wife left me, took the kids.<eos> Hey, chase, just so you know, it was out of compassion not guilt that we were trying to help you.<eos> Help me?<eos> You offered to buy my self-respect, and I sold it.
Because the spirit clings there.<eos> So to have part of a dead body sewed into my chest is...<eos> My friends who follow the old ways, They begged me not to do it. I should've listened.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You think you're haunted by your transplanted heart,<eos> But you're here for a new transplant.<eos> No!<eos> That's what I'm trying to tell you<eos> I don't want it.
And you're gna tell me all about whatever trouble You and your little friends are into.<eos> Do you need a leash?<eos> Let's go.<eos> No.<eos> What do you mean, no?<eos> I mean... I k-kind of can't walk...<eos> Due to the catheter and the epidural?<eos> I can hear your heart beating...<eos> Which is odd,<eos> Because they took it out for the autopsy.
You should have died on that bus.<eos> The last time we met, things did get a little fiery.<eos> Lucky for me, i ducked.<eos> So, they're taking you to belle reve.<eos> I'm sure after a few years of good behavior, They'll let you see the sun again.<eos> Or you could come with me.<eos> I'd rather be a prisoner there Than your lab rat in montana.<eos> Go push your cheese somewhere else.<eos> I didn't build that place, bette.<eos> And after i heard about all the terrible things happening there, I closed it down.
No, no, but it's not just that though, Mac, it's not.<eos> I mean, a lot of presidents somehow end up looking like women.<eos> I mean, look at Ronald Reagan, right?<eos> Now, why would you hang a painting like this on your wall?<eos> Well, it's the Historical Society, bro.<eos> They have to hang it up.<eos> Oh, well, we got to suffer just because some old dude who looks like Meryl Streep chopped down a cherry tree, like, ten million years ago?<eos> It's just, he looks terrible!<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's take it down.
If the British come in here and find this body, we are screwed.<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> He's right.<eos> We've got to get rid of this body.<eos> How are we gonna to do that?<eos> - Maybe we could bury.<eos> - No, there's no time.<eos> We've got to burn that body.<eos> - It's gonna go to their intention.<eos> - Let's cut it of in pieces.
Don't reach for the notebook.<eos> I'll give you the notebook if you come out with me tonight.<eos> - Fine!<eos> See you tonight!<eos> You want me to do what?<eos> We want you to examine our poopie.<eos> We just want to know who it came from. That's it.<eos> I mean...<eos> Now, we don't presume to be scientists.<eos> That's why we brought it to you.
Or you be a man And you turn yourself in when they get here.<eos> - Well, that's not a choice.<eos> - It is a choice, Because I'm sick of living in the mess<eos> You've created for us, and I'm not gonna do it anymore. I hope you won't either.<eos> The annual van der woodsen diner thanksgiving dinner.<eos> Hmm. we should have a standing reservation.<eos> I think we do.<eos> What errand did serena have to run?<eos> I don't know, but she took her file with her.<eos> Maybe she went to burn it.
Wow, you look gorgeous thank you.<eos> I need tell you something, And while I do, I need for you not to say anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've, ...<eos> I've nev... I've never felt this way about anyone before.<eos> Never.<eos> And it made me do something that I can't believe I did.<eos> Jenny never got your letter.<eos> That's why youever heard from her again.<eos> I took it before she saw it.
Oh, she completely-- She what?<eos> She lied?<eos> She went behind your back?<eos> So what?<eos> For that she deserved to be publicly humiliated?<eos> She's your friend, jenny.<eos> You know, there's no reason for meo tell you this now, But I wrote you this letter after the fashion show, Telling u I had feelings for you.<eos> I never got that. No, I know.<eos> Vanessa stole it.<eos> But she felt so bad about it, she came and told me the truth.
He was on his way to see me.<eos> I was...<eos> I was gonna end our marriage.<eos> Hey...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You hear me?<eos> he left me a voice mail.<eos> - What'd it say?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I haven't listened to it.
I was gonna end our marriage.<eos> Hey...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You hear me?<eos> he left me a voice mail.<eos> - What'd it say?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I haven't listened to it.<eos> I've been too afraid, you know, to hear his voice.<eos> Well, do you want to listen to it right now?
That must have been so exciting.<eos> I felt like a fat cheerleader.<eos> As a designer, your worst fear is becoming irrelevant.<eos> Then I come back here And find out the teenage intern tells me that exact thing.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Maybe that is exactly what I needed to hear.<eos> You know, the first real dress I ever bought was one of yours.<eos> Just spare me the pity.<eos> It's true.<eos> I bought it from--well, from a consignment store...
I'm really sorry.<eos> Maybe that is exactly what I needed to hear.<eos> You know, the first real dress I ever bought was one of yours.<eos> Just spare me the pity.<eos> It's true.<eos> I bought it from--well, from a consignment store...<eos> Ah.<eos> 'cause that was the only way I could afford it.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I was 12, And I just wore it around the apartment for months.
Oh, no, no, no.<eos> The necklace is exquisite.<eos> It's... It's just--<eos> You didn't happen to buy a piece of art recently?<eos> Perhaps a mapplethorpe?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> You did.<eos> Oh!<eos> You did.<eos> You got it for me.
We hear there's nothing like yale in october-- The crisp air, the turning leaves, The invasion of prospective freshmen.<eos> Better hurry up, lonely boy.<eos> Your future's waiting.<eos> To summarize, i-i really feel that I have something to say.<eos> Well, by all means, say it.<eos> Via my writing.<eos> Uh, with--with its world-class english department,<eos> Yale would be the ideal place for me to grow As a--as a writer, to--to flourish And, uh, thrive.<eos> Kudos to you and your inner thesaurus, mr. Humphrey, But there's a problem with your application.<eos> A-a-a pr--no, there's um, I double--i triple-checked it.
He's controlling and a hypocrite.<eos> He acts like he's family friendly When he's dated half the models in manhattan.<eos> B., you look gorgeous.<eos> Where did you get that dress?<eos> Oh, this?<eos> Just...<eos> Chuck.<eos> When did chuck give you a dress?<eos> When we were going to europe.<eos> And you're wearing it tonight?
'cause we should get going.<eos> See you later, aaron. yeah, you, uh, you two have fun on your date.<eos> Oh, no, it's-- it's not a date. yeah, no, we're, uh, we're just fr--<eos> We--we used to date, but we're friends now.<eos> I should get back. dude, eleanor is a slave driver.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I'll get you home in time<eos> -I'll get u home To get all your work done. -ladies.<eos> By the way, I love your dress.<eos> I mean, I've been coveting it all day.

You don't know that that's true.<eos> You have to decide what's most important to you-- Keeping your pride and getting nothing or taking a risk<eos> And--and maybe, maybe, having everything.<eos> Well, I almost lost a finger in the process, I might be permanently cross-eyed, but I did it.<eos> Thank you. you look like hell.<eos> You should go home.<eos> Uh, the buyers are gonna be here any minute.<eos> Yeah, I know. that's why I'm gonna need every moment alone<eos> To figure out what the hell am I gonna do? this dress is a mess!<eos> It's not my finest work, but I wouldn't call it a mess.
Sorry, but, uh... looks like the little hacker bird missed the worm.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I thought you said that i was the only one capable of getting into it.<eos> You might be, but we won't know now, because i don't have it.<eos> It was stolen.<eos> Well, who else would want it?<eos> I intend to find out.<eos> Stay by your phone, chloe.<eos> Only a handful of people knew about that device,<eos> And when i find out who has it, i'm taking it back.
- You killed her.<eos> Oh, no, something much worse.<eos> We all have some part of us that we hold underneath the surface.<eos> Even I do.<eos> If this is because of brainiac, then we don't know what can happen!<eos> This is my life.<eos> I'm choosing to look at this as a gift.<eos> It was stolen.<eos> Only a handful of people knew about that device.<eos> When I find out who has it, I'm taking it back.
Means I have time to work on other things, and they all have more chances to step up, stand on their own.<eos> And if there is an emergency with Annie, should she wait until you finish grooming lab rats?<eos> If there's a problem with Sophia, or any other patient, you know I'll be there.<eos> Your patient is my priority.<eos> No.<eos> What? You want a reason?<eos> Clinical trials take time, your time is my time.<eos> I told you, I don't do drugs.<eos> Still a good idea to check your heart.<eos> Something else could've damaged it.
Are you lying to us? Because it's none of our business.<eos> If it's none of your business, I shouldn't have to answer questions.<eos> And I wouldn't have to, except House doesn't want to answer questions about Wilson.<eos> He's deflecting his own problems onto me.<eos> (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Are you deflecting now?<eos> Time for the B12 cocktail and my life lesson.<eos> No, Patty'll do the hearing, she just needs to be the lead-off witness so she...<eos> Okay. I'll lock it down today.<eos> Need you back in bed.<eos> My boss has a big Beijing trip, I've been planning it for months.
Good guy.<eos> Yes, but I told him we needed broad-cut pasta dough, but he bought something else.<eos> - Let's hope it's good anyway.<eos> - It looks wonderful.<eos> I can't eat it, but...<eos> Marina?<eos> Sure you won't eat?<eos> I'll bring you a tray.<eos> Would you like a drop of wine?<eos> I can't drink it, I'd better not.
Here are your camomile teas.<eos> How sweet of you.<eos> Your table...<eos> We're quite taken by this program.<eos> My dears, let's have some.<eos> Would you like some sugar?<eos> How many, two?<eos> How nice, no sugar for me.<eos> Would you like a nice cup of camomile?<eos> You had a pleasant childhood, in fact, you carry it with you.
OK.<eos> I'll see you in a week.<eos> Thank you.<eos> See you then.<eos> Look there is some soap left over there.<eos> I'm home.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Could you sell the milk?<eos> I did.<eos> - They want it every day.
To join you?<eos> Or I'll let him finish what he started.<eos> We know where suicides go.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> You will condemn him to hell instead of me.<eos> I will enter someone else.<eos> If you make me do that, I will kill hundreds. Everyone in your name.<eos> Stop!<eos> Agree to my condition.<eos> Name it.
Go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's the point of having people tasters for it if you're going to get yourself killed anyway?<eos> I won't fail.No matter what you think.<eos> Arthur,You are my only son and heir.<eos> I can't risk losing you for the sake of some serving boy.<eos> His life's worthless?<eos> No,because he's worth less than yours.<eos> I can save him.Let me take some men.<eos> We'll find the antidote and bring it back. No!
Yeah! So?<eos> Mum doesn't like anyone going in there.<eos> You always do as you're told?<eos> Clyde reckons you lot saved the world.<eos> Have you told him what we do?<eos> Mr Langer?<eos> Have you taken something?<eos> Hey, that's my dad you're talking to.<eos> He's nicked something alien. There was this pendant.<eos> Jacob West was using it.
Okay, a guy at work, Special Agent Graham Kelton died last week.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That's awful, Booth.<eos> Were you good friends?<eos> No, he was a creep.<eos> So, then your agitation comes from...?<eos> Kelton had the best desk chair in the office building, all right?<eos> Lumbar support, cushioned arms, Macintosh oak finish.<eos> - And?<eos> - And I want it.
Where will you get it?<eos> From across the border.<eos> What are you paying upfront?<eos> And what's my fee?<eos> This is a children's drug.<eos> It saves lives.<eos> I'll pay upfront, but a fee...<eos> No fee?<eos> Criminals stole this medicine.<eos> The hospital's having to buy it twice.
My last lovely penny.<eos> Here we go a-wassailing...<eos> That'll teach you to summon souls from beyond this world, Queenie?<eos> The wind do blow...<eos> 'Scuse me, my darlin'.<eos> You heard of a man name of Jeremiah Mears hereabouts?<eos> Can I ask why you're searching for him?<eos> He's my Pa.<eos> That name was told to me by my Ma, see.<eos> I whispered it and prayed it, and shouted it every day of my life.
I couldn't knock on that door.<eos> They wouldn't want me. But you could have asked.<eos> It would only have taken a little courage.<eos> You had found your family.<eos> Perhaps it was enough - finding him... seeing him.<eos> I had no part of the life in that cottage.<eos> All I ever known was the searching.<eos> If you'd told him who you were... what you wanted.<eos> What I saw through that window was happiness.<eos> I didn't want to be the one to spoil it.
I think it wise to report our position before we attack.<eos> Skywalkers' fleet is nearby, in the Bith system.<eos> Good.<eos> Perhaps he can reinforce us.<eos> From what I hear, Skywalker's always ready for a fight.<eos> So I've heard.<eos> Koh-to-ya, Master Plo.<eos> Koh-to-ya, little Soka.<eos> How's the hunt for the mystery weapon going?<eos> We've tracked it to the Abregado system.
I am quite mature enough, and know how to care for myself.<eos> Drink your milk.<eos> He came to ask about the field.<eos> And to buy the house.<eos> Well, he's not to come again.<eos> Pablo...<eos> You haven't used your dad's shotgun again, have you?<eos> No.<eos> Don't.<eos> You'll only ruin it.
I have come to deliver a message.<eos> And who is this message for?<eos> It is for you, Arthur Pendragon.<eos> Is it you who is responsible for killing our crops, turning our water into sand?<eos> You alone are responsible for the misfortune that has befallen Camelot.<eos> Me?<eos> ! You think I'd bring drought and famine upon my own people?<eos> When you killed the unicorn, you unleashed a curse.<eos> For this, Camelot will suffer greatly.<eos> If you have put a curse on Camelot, you will lift it, or you will pay with your life.
If he fails, there is no hope.<eos> The curse will destroy Camelot.<eos> Wait!<eos> What kind of test will he face?<eos> ANHORA: That is for Arthur alone to discover.<eos> Let me come with you.<eos> I might be able to help.<eos> You're not coming.<eos> I brought this curse upon Camelot.<eos> I'm gonna be the one to lift it, or die trying.
Trust me on this one, OK?<eos> That's two strikes against you.<eos> You're and you've been to therapy.<eos> You're a crazy Christian.<eos> You really want that getting out?<eos> I'm a crazy Christian!<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I'm a crazy Christian.<eos> And I see you're not wearing your promise ring anymore.<eos> No. You saw me take it off.

Hello?<eos> Old news.<eos> Adrian's father is up in Marc Moli and he's looking for her.<eos> So this proves it.<eos> They ran off together.<eos> That's who that is?<eos> Yeah. He's a DA.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> I took my file.<eos> I stole it right in front of him.
I just don't know if I'm good enough.<eos> I mean, I'm sure no one around here thinks I'm good enough.<eos> People are so cruel.<eos> I'm so sorry that you have to go through this, Ricky.<eos> Grace, when you said you wanted to kiss me, that wasn't because you felt sorry for me, was it?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I said it because I'm attracted to you.<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> Your promise ring?<eos> I decided not to wear it.
I wanted to know how you would feel if we did go out.<eos> If we go out.<eos> If my parents even let us go out.<eos> Oh.<eos> How would I feel?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Betrayed.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, by me or Ricky?<eos> Look, if you want my permission, you are not gonna get it, so live with it.
Oh, Oh, here they are.<eos> Help, he's hurting me.<eos> Well, maybe you shouldn't have let him on.<eos> Peter, what the hell is that?<eos> It's a space shulttle, Lois.<eos> I figured with unlimited free gas I can finally afford to go in to space.<eos> Why is it every time I open this door you seem to be in some ridiculous vehicle you inexplicibly acquired.<eos> I've got this at the NASA auction for next to nothing.<eos> They gonna scrap it 'cause some minor mechanical problems or something.<eos> Instead they sold it to me.

It's pretty much over once Baby comes out of the corner.<eos> - Were you even alive in the fall of 1987?<eos> - Of course I was alive.<eos> It was a good time.<eos> I was in the mail room at William Morris.<eos> Marce was still at N.Y.U.<eos> One day, somebody broke into her dorm room.<eos> Some homeless crack addict snuck in and stole all her jewellery, so I thought of a movie that'd cheer her up.<eos> It worked, didn't it?<eos> We had to go all the way up to 57th Street to see it, some crappy theatre that's not even there anymore.
Don't be distressed.<eos> - I know what those letters were.<eos> - They were nothing.<eos> How can you and I be friends when my family sponge upon you?<eos> Come, Maggy!<eos> I thought I might look in on Fanny later - get a pass for the show, see what's what.<eos> Might even take her out for supper if I get what I'm expecting. (KNOCK ON DOOR)<eos> - A letter for you, Mr Dorrit.<eos> - Oh, yes!<eos> Very good of you to bring it up, Chivery.
And now, of course, I'd like to think we've become good friends.<eos> I want to ask you if we could be more than friends.<eos> I want to ask you if... you could love me.<eos> If you would consent to be my wife.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> We haven't known each other long, and I don't press you for an answer,<eos> - only to consider it.<eos> - Mr Clennam...<eos> Arthur...<eos> I thank you for your proposal, but I can't consider it.
But how am I to know what is correct?<eos> That is what I have been endeavouring to instil in you!<eos> I am sorry, Mrs General.<eos> I will try to do better.<eos> Ah, now we have arrived at the eastern portals...<eos> All well with the works, Mr Doyce?<eos> Well as can be.<eos> I've made up my mind to mount another assault on the Circumlocution Office.<eos> Your invention should be put into production on a great scale.<eos> It needs to be patented and it needs to be publicised, and it can't be while the Barnacles of this world are burying it under their heaps of paper.
If you look, there is no way of telling, is there?<eos> I'd do that now, having just seen him do it.<eos> I'd still drive in.<eos> I'd park on this one - I bet it's the same thing.<eos> OK, listen.<eos> I was driving a Volvo XC60 this week, the new one.<eos> The front of it is all full of radars and sensors, cos the idea is you can't actually crash it.<eos> Don't ask me how.<eos> Anyhow, I was thinking, there must be a simpler solution to not crashing.<eos> And I think I have come up with it.
It started in 1983 and involved 6,500 people.<eos> It compared what they ate with the appearance of disease.<eos> Doctor T. Colin Campbell from Cornell University was one of the principal researchers who participated in this China study.<eos> Animal protein, either directly or indirectly, it contributes to increases in the risk for a wide variety of diseases.<eos> Most notably cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's, a number of auto-immune diseases and so forth.<eos> The basis for this lies in the chemistry of the effects which animal proteins and fats have on the individual cells as well as the whole body interactions.<eos> First and most importantly, cancer causing chemicals are produced whenever any animal, bird or fish tissues are cooked.<eos> One of the most worsen aspects of a meaty diet... and when I say that I mean not only beef and pork, but also chicken and fish, is that when you cook it, cancer causing chemicals form on the surface of that meat and they're called heterocyclic amins, or HCA.<eos> And they're not in the meat at the store.<eos> They form when you put it in your oven, in your fry pan, on your grill, and between the temperature and the amount of time that it takes to cook these carcinogens form.

(?<eos> ) Because you have salmonella and ? back there and the other infectious bacteria that the cooking is there and knock out.<eos> So, the meat is obviously not safe if you under cook it.

It comes with a little bag...<eos> I'm disturbed by what I'm seeing!<eos> ..and you fill it up.<eos> The only thing is, OK, the literature here, it says it can also be used on airplanes... on ski lifts and, look at this one, "while queuing".<eos> Queuing? What, in the post office?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do any girls want to see if they can have a wee in this bag without the person next to them noticing?<eos> What I like is, if you read through the marketing on the box, there's a lot of, "Yeah, go, girls!<eos> "Men have had this for ages," then it goes on about using this thing to wee in post office queues as if they imagine that those of us who've had one for years, a natural he wee that we're born with,<eos> I've had that for 38 years and I've never got it out in a post office queue to have a wee. Right, I'd like to demonstrate this.

And there are some universes where you and I don't exist at all.<eos> 'The highly-respected author and physicist, Paul Davies, has an even more bizarre idea.<eos> 'He suggests that the strangeness of the measurement problem explains how the universe came into being.'<eos> The experimenter today in the lab can make a measurement that affects the nature of reality as it was five billion years ago.<eos> There's a sort of feedback loop between the existence of living organisms and observers and the laws and conditions which have given rise to them.<eos> Otherwise it just seems a bit miraculous that the universe happens to have started out with the right laws and conditions that lead to observers like ourselves who can make measurements and make sense of it all.<eos> But quantum mechanics provides just such a feedback through time.<eos> It allows this backwards in time effect.<eos> Not causation.<eos> It's not that we here now can change the past to fix it so that we exist, but we have an influence on the past through quantum measurements we make.
Good job.<eos> Alucard...<eos> A meeting of the Round Table is being assembled by Her Majesty.<eos> Ho!<eos> The Queen herself!<eos> Return Post-haste, and have something formal to report.<eos> Don't make the Queen wait.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Integra...<eos> The joy of war... did you feel it?
But, unknown to Penzias and Wilson, a mere 30 miles away at Princeton University, another group was dreaming about just such radio sources from deep cosmic space.<eos> The group was led by the physicist Bob Dicke, who was renowned for devising novel experiments to probe the early universe.<eos> This was all motivated by an old interest I had connected with what were well established views of the universe at that time, that the universe was an expanding structure, galaxies flying away from each other, flying away from each other ever more rapidly the farther away they were.<eos> The implication, of course, of all this is if you simply send time backwards, everything is closer together in the past.<eos> So there's an idea of something blowing up or flying apart.<eos> Dicke saw that the early universe would at least do one thing.<eos> The fireball would be so hot that it would endow the universe with plenty of radiation to start with.<eos> That radiation would still be around today and Dicke said it should be searched for.<eos> He left Professor Jim Peebles to work out the details.<eos> If this radiation is present, will we be able to detect it and will we know we're detecting it and not radiation from something else in the universe?

He's fine.<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> I can't believe he did it.<eos> Who did what?<eos> Locke.<eos> He moved the island.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> 'Cause one minute it was there, the next it was gone, so, unless we, like, overlooked it, dude, that's exactly what he did.<eos> But, if you've got another explanation, man, I'd love to hear it.
The mass of this object bends space around it.<eos> If the ball here that is at the centre of this sheet is representing the sun, and this penny is representing a planet like the earth, then you can use the penny to demonstrate how the earth orbits the sun.<eos> Most of us think of gravity as an invisible force, which holds us on the earth and keeps the earth in orbit round the sun.<eos> So far, so good.<eos> But what physics says is really happening is that planets are trapped in areas of curved space.<eos> The earth is actually rolling round and down into an area of space warped by the sun.<eos> The penny rolls in quickly, but of course it'll take the earth billions of years to hit the sun.<eos> And it's the curvature of space caused by the earth itself which holds us in place on our planet.<eos> Hawking knew Einstein's work like the back of his hand, but what excited him was that Penrose had used the theory to discover something altogether bizarre.<eos> It was possible not just to bend space, but to twist it right back in on itself, to create a black hole.
- Who is this?<eos> - Lew Vogel.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Get up.<eos> Go on. Wake up.<eos> What you want, Lew?<eos> I'm afraid I've got some potentially bad news for you, Michael.<eos> Your safety deposit box at the Baker Street bank what's its number?<eos> - Why do you ask?<eos> Well, over the weekend some thieves broke into the bank vault and robbed it.
There must have been a time in the early universe when the particles became substantial and took on their mass.<eos> The best theory we have to explain how this happened was dreamt up one day by a British physicist Peter Higgs, whilst walking in the Scottish Highlands.<eos> He came up with a theoretical mechanism that could explain how some but not all particles attain mass.<eos> The Higgs mechanism works by filling the universe with a field, the Higgs field, and by the universe I don't just mean up there amongst the stars.<eos> I mean here in front of me, and inside of me, and particles acquire mass by interacting with the Higgs Field, by talking to it.<eos> The theory is that every particle in the universe is traversing this invisible Higgs Field and some particles like the quarks and electrons acquire mass as they pass through.<eos> Whereas mass-less particles, particles like photons, don't interact with the Higgs Field and they just pass through the universe at the speed of light.<eos> The Higgs brings simplicity and beauty to a nature which looks too complicated.<eos> It introduces a kind of symmetry and a kind of beauty to nature which gives us an understanding of one of the most puzzling features of this little model I told you about, the Standard Model.<eos> The Higgs Field may solve the problem of missing mass in the Standard Model but the only trouble is we haven't been able to detect it yet.

If you wanna say "Mistletoe" because it's too heavy for you, I get it.<eos> I get it. I totally get it. Don't feel weird about that.<eos> If you need to get out of here, you let me know where your comfort zone is.<eos> Beacause that was weird.<eos> I can not believe you didn't tell me your real name.<eos> - What are you talking about? - I just...<eos> It's just crazy to me. We've been together for 3 years now and I don't even know your real name.<eos> doesn't that strike you as a little bit odd?<eos> No, it's not a little bit odd.<eos> I hated my name, so I changed it.
She's in every brick, every stone, every slate.<eos> Sebastian was right.<eos> We should run away.<eos> - Why did you bring me here?<eos> - We can still leave.<eos> - Bridey...<eos> - Don't interfere, Charles.<eos> Now, try and remember your sins and tell God you're sorry.<eos> I'm going to give you absolution now.<eos> And while I'm giving it, I want you to tell God you're sorry you offended him, and then I want you to make a sign, if you can.
What do you want the statement to contain?<eos> An admission that you were wrong.<eos> I've admitted that.<eos> I'm guilty.<eos> There's a difference between pleading guilty... and admitting you were wrong.<eos> And that would satisfy you?<eos> An admission I was wrong?<eos> No.<eos> First, Professor Lurie must make his statement.<eos> Then we can decide if we can accept it.
I think this was why they worshipped him no matter what.<eos> For normality is no longer what people crave.<eos> It is simply too little, and today everyone wants much, much more.<eos> Normality is not a precondition for love and adoration, and when someone is reconciled to death and when he or she speaks from the heart as Diego does, the path to sainthood is nearby.<eos> The only problem was that it wasn't the time for sainthood, and that's why I think he became a drug addict.<eos> - Good, but no tango?<eos> - Do I look like tango?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I watched people congregating outside cafes at dawn in Buenos Aires, listening to the tango and crying together.<eos> The tango originated in 1883 in a bordello somewhere and Jorge Luis Borges calls it dance of grieving husbands.
My husband must sell Faraway Downs. But the offer from this cattle king, Mr. Carney, is only one-sixth of what it was once worth.<eos> We need the money, Ramsden!<eos> But Maitland is just about to muster the fats.<eos> -What? -Gather the big cows ready for market.<eos> Ramsden, you and I both know there is only one reason my husband has spent so much time down under. And it has absolutely nothing to do with cows.<eos> At least not of the animal variety.<eos> Lady Ashley, I do think that's a bit harsh.<eos> Oh, Ramsden, drink your tea.<eos> Lady Ashley! What do you intend to do?<eos> I intend to travel to this cattle station, sell it and bring Maitland home myself!
A Shrink, Ray?<eos> Oh, that's a genius' plan for stealing a monster.<eos> Hey!<eos> I don't come down to where you work and...<eos> Oh, that's right, you don't work!<eos> So shut your cake hole, darling!<eos> Now to shrink Igor and steal his monster.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Did I hit it?<eos> Did I hit it?
Oh, that's a genius' plan for stealing a monster.<eos> Hey!<eos> I don't come down to where you work and...<eos> Oh, that's right, you don't work!<eos> So shut your cake hole, darling!<eos> Now to shrink Igor and steal his monster.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Did I hit it?<eos> Did I hit it?<eos> I hope I didn't hit it!
Excuse me, Igor, I'm a little distracted.<eos> What?<eos> I think the makeup girl is out to get me.<eos> No, that's Brain.<eos> And he's not the makeup girl, he's the idiot.<eos> Now try to remember on the word "tomorrow,"<eos> you re supposed to crush the Evil Invention to your left!<eos> You mean "stage left. "<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> You're supposed to smash it to smithereens.
Oh, my God!<eos> - Jesus Christ!<eos> - Neil's dead!<eos> Neil's dead!<eos> - No!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Get the fuck out of here!<eos> Go! Go!<eos> It's the dawn of a new day.<eos> And Neil Patrick Harris isn't around to see it, man.
Yes, she has both the letter racks on her side.<eos> You don't think she's been killed?<eos> I can't see any other alternative.<eos> Whoever did this obviously intended to smother her with the cushion while she was sleeping.<eos> She wakes up, puts up a struggle, he presses down harder, using both hands perhaps, breaks her nose, hence the blood.<eos> Or it could have been a woman, using her knee to add extra pressure.<eos> When the killer removes the cushion, sees the blood, he drops it on the carpet and doesn't even bother to put anything back in its place. Scared, probably.<eos> In the book that I based my conference on, I unfortunately compare logical series with serial murders.<eos> And since its publication I've received dozens of totally absurd letters, which is why I attached little importance to this one.<eos> And you're sure you destroyed it?

Are you kidding?<eos> I think it would be so much fun<eos> I think we should go I'd love to go<eos> Can we discuss this some other time?<eos> When i saw you across the room at the art gallery i noticed you have beautiful lips Very full, very sensual<eos> Thank you<eos> Okay, okay, look I'm s-, you know, if you wanna go i can't guarantee the lovemaking- because i happen to be very moody<eos> Let's not negotiate like a contract<eos> I came over here with no subterfuge, and presented my best offer<eos> I hope you will discuss it and give me the pleasure to take you with me to oviedo
- He's a very arrogant guy.<eos> - Why?<eos> Did he ask for a lot?<eos> You should give him whatever amount he wants. It's worth your daughter's life.<eos> You're right.<eos> Either that he has a broad vision, or... He's very pretentious.<eos> He's one of both.<eos> You... better don't stray away with crazy thoughts.<eos> You have to treasure Mike's proposal.<eos> Just accept it.
Well, I hear you like it, sir.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - Mr. Ferris, please take a seat.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - Welcome to our promising country.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> As reliable as your Ed Hoffman would call a "towelhead monarchy" can be.<eos> Well, we'll leave that to Ed Hoffman, sir.<eos> What have you heard about this building?<eos> Well, to be quite honest, I hear they call it the fingernail factory.
Dear God, she talked all the time.<eos> That class of person always does.<eos> One doesn't exactly listen.<eos> Anyway, she didn't know she was gonna be murdered, did she?<eos> So what does it matter?<eos> Such a brutal crime.<eos> A meat chopper.<eos> Ugh! The police never found the murder weapon, madame.<eos> Oh, we all know it was a meat chopper.<eos> Bentley must have, I don't know, hidden it somewhere.
- Got a date for tomorrow night.<eos> - I'm very happy for you.<eos> - With a girl.<eos> - Can you turn the light off, please?<eos> Only been in Bruges one day, got a date with a girl in the film business, the Belgian film business.<eos> They're doing a film about a midget.<eos> Miss?<eos> Marie?<eos> Sorry about the message last night.<eos> The man who left it is a bit of a...
And you'd think with all this new technology, they would figure out a machine that would make the beds.<eos> And if they did, you'd be going along behind it, making them again.<eos> I know you, Mom.<eos> But I am good at modern...<eos> Tell them about the Internets.<eos> - He's gonna put me on the line. - SOPHIE:<eos> Online.<eos> SKY: I'm designing a website.<eos> I just think this place has so much potential, and no one knows we're here.<eos> So, if I market it really, really well, then, hopefully, people will come flooding in.
And we don't need permission to make movies on our own.<eos> This is for us to watch.<eos> –The whole town is participating. –It'll be ours.<eos> The movie could be called Fats Was Born in Passaic.<eos> –Yeah!<eos> –Everybody knows I was lying.<eos> –You gonna humiliate me again? –No.<eos> No, Mr Fletcher.<eos> No, he's trying to prove you were right.<eos> Our past belongs to us, we can change it if we want.
It's definitely not from me personally, so...<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> When were you planning on telling me this?<eos> - I just told you, then.<eos> - Yeah. No, I know.<eos> But telling me now... isn't really the same as telling me.<eos> Well, look, you know,<eos> I've not told you I've got genital herpes, because it's not inflamed at the moment.<eos> Do you guys want some champagne... with your cake, or do you want it without your cake?
You've seen what he becomes, right?<eos> I have.<eos> And it's beautiful.<eos> Godlike. I want that.<eos> Need that.<eos> I don't know what you've got inside you already.<eos> The mixture could be an abomination.<eos> I didn't say I was unwilling.<eos> I just need informed consent.<eos> And you've given it.
Yeah.<eos> I want a family.<eos> But I'd get it right, you know?<eos> There's this place in Vancouver on a lake... this cottage.<eos> It's got this long wooden dock that you can go out and sit on.<eos> Surrounded by the mountains, and it's quiet. No one else is around.<eos> Sounds nice.<eos> Is it a family place?<eos> Well, he actually sold it to pay for his trips to Reno.<eos> I'm gonna buy it back.
Who needs a scampish heir<eos> This group, the money, they are mine<eos> Not just yours<eos> In fact, all this started you<eos> Attempting to infiltrate the home The offender was arrested<eos> Do not have to take me with him that night<eos> Archive<eos> I searched your files for several hours<eos> He knew how important it is for you<eos> I have not found it
"We wish we had seen this first,"<eos> because their experience here was so meaningful.<eos> Do you think if...<eos> when you were a kid... they transposed the Bible stories with the fairy tales, you'd know the difference as an adult?<eos> - My name is Eve.<eos> - I'm Adam.<eos> This place is amazing.<eos> If they told you Jack and the Beanstalk was religion and that a man who lived in a whale was in a fairy-tale book... you think when you got to be an adult, you'd be defending the one instead of the other?<eos> So you're saying that the Bible's a fairy tale?<eos> God took my rib like this and began to whittle it like this and blow on it... and then...
"Dear Marley, I loved you all my life.<eos> "I hope you like heaven and that there's lots to chew on.<eos> Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan. "<eos> That was a good letter.<eos> Patrick, do you wanna say something?<eos> He knows.<eos> I'd like to give him something.<eos> This necklace.<eos> It's been on quite a journey.<eos> Your dad gave it to me... to celebrate the beginning of our family.
This so called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood, like some kind of a derelict mother who didn't even know her own son.<eos> And what was his findings?<eos> He found what he expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find.<eos> Mrs. Collins.<eos> - But that's not...<eos> That's nothing to be embarrassed about.<eos> That I was embarrassed is not the issue.<eos> The point is that you are wasting time when you should be looking for my son.<eos> But the report is final, Mrs. Collins.<eos> Well, then I want to receive the report, so I can refute it, before it goes to anyone else.
And what of you, my lady?<eos> Once I held the same prejudice, but no longer.<eos> We will be honored to travel with you and your friends.<eos> Tas, you got a map?<eos> I didn't steal anything!<eos> I mean, let me check.<eos> Hey!<eos> Laurana gave me that ring.<eos> This?<eos> You must've dropped it back at the inn.

Dude, are you really a homo?<eos> Aw, what's the matter?<eos> Did I hurt your feelings, huh? Here's an idea.<eos> Why don't you go tell your boyfriend? Maybe he can buy you some flowers.<eos> Make you feel better.<eos> I'd like your essays now, please.<eos> Well thank your for joking us, Mr. Melman.<eos> Please pass them forward. Yes?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> If you don't have your essay today, I don't want it.
So whatever problems you had with the schoolwork, they let it pass. That wasn't fair, was it?<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Did you do all of your own French homework, Robert?<eos> Carter, would you have a seat, please?<eos> I asked you to stay because I was grading your essay and I couldn't help but notice it's a marked improvement over anything you've submitted so far.<eos> Well, I've been studying with an English tutor. It's helped out a lot.<eos> In fact, it's such a significant improvement, I'm forced to question its authorship.<eos> What?<eos> I'm certain you didn't write it.<eos> Danny wrote it and signed your name to it, didn't he?
Now this one is a new building.<eos> It's got all the stuff you need.<eos> And this is all for you.<eos> Just enjoy it.<eos> And all the big guys are here.<eos> This is the promised...<eos> This is where you can operate from. You need to do a good business.<eos> I know this place is not so good.<eos> I know, I can see it.<eos> But you could tear it down and build something modern and beautiful.
Put the pope up.<eos> That's the wrong pope.<eos> He's deceased.<eos> I don't care what pope it is.<eos> Use the glass to see behind you.<eos> Children should think you have eyes in the back of your head.<eos> Wouldn't that be a little frightening?<eos> Only to the ones who are up to no good.<eos> Relax.<eos> Put it up there.
- Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> You'd teach me?<eos> I'm not a very good teacher.<eos> I tried with your dad, but, at 18, he still thought rosé was a blend of red and white.<eos> That's a mean thing to say.<eos> You never tried to teach me about wine.<eos> You never gave me a chance.<eos> When Mom died, you sold the estate without asking me to take over.<eos> I wasn't worth passing it on to.
Pubic hairs.<eos> By mail.<eos> I couldn't manage a love letter.<eos> So you sent pubes.<eos> Logical.<eos> I don't know why I did it.<eos> I think it turned me on to think she touched them... or that when she opened the envelope, a hair had fallen on her bed.<eos> But that's not all.<eos> Delphine was totally traumatized by the letter.<eos> She threw it away, disgusted, saying that if it happened again, she'd tell her father, who was a cop.
Where is that farewell letter?<eos> - I've got it.<eos> You startled me!<eos> Hi, Chris.<eos> Is meeting here a good idea?<eos> I think we've got a problem, Luc.<eos> I think we were too thorough in removing all traces.<eos> What d'you mean?<eos> - Where is Sarah's farewell letter?<eos> You put it in your pocket.

Don't lie!<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> - What about this ring?<eos> - He lent it to me.<eos> I'm ashamed for you!<eos> Calm down, for God's sake!<eos> Show me that ring.<eos> It's a diamond. It's worth about 20,000 francs. 20,000 francs?<eos> That's quite a lot of money!<eos> He'll give it to me if I go with him.
- To the city.<eos> I'll beat the bastard up!<eos> For how long?<eos> For a week.<eos> Suzanne.<eos> Come.<eos> Come, now.<eos> Suzanne!<eos> Come on, give it back to him.<eos> Why show her the ring if you want it back?
I'll beat the bastard up!<eos> For how long?<eos> For a week.<eos> Suzanne.<eos> Come.<eos> Come, now.<eos> Suzanne!<eos> Come on, give it back to him.<eos> Why show her the ring if you want it back?<eos> She'll return it to me when she likes.
For a week.<eos> Suzanne.<eos> Come.<eos> Come, now.<eos> Suzanne!<eos> Come on, give it back to him.<eos> Why show her the ring if you want it back?<eos> She'll return it to me when she likes.<eos> Diamonds are for life.<eos> Give it to him or I'll throw it away!
Don't bother to come back.<eos> You're merciless.<eos> You shouldn't have shown me the diamond ring.<eos> I'd never seen one before.<eos> - Suzanne, please.<eos> - You can't understand.<eos> Go away.<eos> Don't ever come back to see me.<eos> Suzanne, keep it.<eos> I'm giving it to you forever.
I won't have coffee because I'm tired and because I'm fed up with you both!<eos> What a nasty daughter she is!<eos> Jewels are useless, really.<eos> Those who wear them don't need them. 20,000 francs.<eos> Twice as much as the bungalow mortgage.<eos> It'd be shameful to give him back the ring.<eos> Considering the dirty things he's done.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> I haven't slept with him.<eos> He gave it to me for no reason.
If you ever lay hands on her again, I'll leave with her.<eos> So what if she slept with him?<eos> What's the fuss?<eos> You have a fever.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> She hasn't slept with him.<eos> I know...<eos> Don't worry about the ring.<eos> We'll sell it.
I know.<eos> I've gone hunting in that mountain region.<eos> How much for the ring?<eos> 20,000.<eos> Your diamond ring has impurities.<eos> Keep it.<eos> I know.<eos> It's a flaw.<eos> How about 15,000?<eos> Keep it.
But I remember the size .<eos> I think they were size 36 .<eos> Forgiveness.<eos> Forgiveness.<eos> Do not let anyone ...<eos> My birthday was great. The whole band helped and they gave me a helmet of knight.<eos> - Has a cross between the eyes.<eos> - Where did you?<eos> - It's in my room.<eos> - Can you find it?

All right.<eos> I'll pick you up after you're done with school, okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> As everyone knows by now, traces of the neurotoxin have been found in some plants and trees.<eos> Now, most environmentalists feel that this event is like the red tide in the ocean, but instead of algae killing fish, this happened on land.<eos> Now, plants and trees just can't pick up and move when they feel threatened, like other species.<eos> They have only one option, to rapidly evolve their chemistry.<eos> Well.<eos> Kay from Mississippi wants to know why it started so suddenly, on a Tuesday at 8:33 and then ended so suddenly at 9:27 the next morning.<eos> Well, Kay, to be perfectly honest, this was an act of nature, and we'll never fully understand it.
Skeeter.<eos> Are you all right, Skeeter?<eos> A bee bit my tongue.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> A bee... stung my tongue.<eos> "A bee stung my tongue."<eos> Oh, you understand him?<eos> How did a bee sting your tongue?<eos> Uh... I was eating ice cream, and suddenly a bee...<eos> Uh, it was on an ice cream, and he licked it. Hmm.
Lina.<eos> It's blue.<eos> Ember!<eos> You can see it!<eos> Hello!<eos> They won't hear you.<eos> It's way too far.<eos> Well-Well, we've gotta tell them somehow.<eos> We need to tell them what's up here.<eos> LinaandDoon tied their hope to a rock... and tossed it down toward the city.
Like one world on top of another. My watch is stopped.<eos> All the clocks have stopped.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - I don't know what it means. But time has stopped. Just not moving.<eos> Look.<eos> - How can time stop?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - She needs to take her medicine.<eos> Where do we get it?
- It's like he's been dead for a week.<eos> We have to go.<eos> We should be able to reach ground floor from here.<eos> Get the chair.<eos> No, not there.<eos> Do you know how to get out from here?<eos> Can you draw it for me?<eos> This way?<eos> I think we can find Sarah's medicine in here.<eos> - Did you find it? - No.
These have been a trying few days but the worst is surely over.<eos> My garden!<eos> Sidney!<eos> It happened last night but you weren't around.<eos> I bet it's the man who left me that malevolent message.<eos> I think he's trying to sabotage my life.<eos> I didn't get a good look him, though I did see what he did to your new tree.<eos> My little sycamore!<eos> What did he do?<eos> He raped it.
I'm the only one that really cares about you.<eos> Did you care about the people in the video?<eos> They were gonna tell.<eos> That girl and her cheerleading coach.<eos> They found my room. You can understand, right?<eos> I already started.<eos> I couldn't stop.<eos> Get your fucking hands off her.<eos> I went through a bunch of trouble to make this fucking show for you.<eos> You're gonna watch it with me.

This you must still show.<eos> - - Enter here.<eos> Very beautiful.<eos> Feel you your beautiful? - - Aanbiddelijk.<eos> Every bride loves Its accessories.<eos> Men wore dresses, Women wore suits.<eos> What was the theme there.<eos> Twenty-seven dresses, you take me In the leg.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> You do your thing, You have the dress, just throw it away.
Why did you bring all your work things?<eos> That job wasn't for me.<eos> First, the pay wasn't good.<eos> Second, I wasn't insured.<eos> Third, I can't work with those dumb ostriches.<eos> I have to find another job.<eos> Don't play with the egg, kids.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It'll break.<eos> Don't play with it, boy.

- Fine.<eos> And you?<eos> - Good, thank you.<eos> - Hello. - Hello.<eos> Do you have tea in the green box?<eos> No, I have the red box.<eos> Want one?<eos> Excuse me, where did you get that ostrich egg from? It's not for sale.<eos> It's decoration.<eos> Someone found it in the desert, and he exchanged it for a tin of oil.
So not only are you holding a transvestite prostitute... they confused "shim" with mrs. Jordan, yes, ma'am.<eos> And they think she looks better here than she did at the 2004 grammys.<eos> who's gonna do my banking?<eos> Who's gonna write my blogs?<eos> Who's gonna do the cooking on taco wednesdays?<eos> Okay, well, kenneth, you are now in charge of helping tracy with any of the nonsexual things that angle would do for him.<eos> So he's, like, my office wife?<eos> Sure.<eos> Let's go with that.<eos> Kenneth parcell, will you take this ring... and sell it in the jewish part of midtown, and use the money to get us a nintendo wil?
Weddings are so weird.<eos> This veil costs more than my couch.<eos> Is that comedy, or do you really have a $300 couch?<eos> Both.<eos> What, you never pretended to be a bride when you were a little girl?<eos> I did. I just never romanticized it.<eos> This is my husnd, saul rosenbear, and this is his son richard from a previous marriage.<eos> And then he cheated on me with a lamb.<eos> liz, this dress is amazing. But they don't have it in my size.<eos> Can you try it on for me so I can see how it hangs?
Newark's first offshore gentlemen's barge.<eos> I'm gonna get the kids, and we're coming straight here.<eos> Uh... okay.<eos> I'll set that up.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna do that?<eos> Liz Lemon know who keeps the lights on around here.<eos> But I couldn't do it without my background players.<eos> That's why I want you and Josh to be there for my award.<eos> Then afterwards, maybe I'll let you hold it.
I've invited him to assist on the surgery.<eos> - How do you do, Dr. Burke?<eos> - Oh, you're playing yourself?<eos> It distracts me from the fact that you're going to have your hands in my chest in a few hours. And this, Charles, is a former student of mine... A formidable chess player herself...<eos> Dr. Cristina Yang.<eos> Soon to be Dr. Cristina Burke.<eos> we're getting married next month.<eos> Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Perhaps you'd like to explain...<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Mr. Redford, instead of replacing your current heart, we're going to attach it to the new heart, essentially piggybacking it. The two hearts pump together, share the workload.
But when the sculpture's true function Was unveiled the next day, Whatever support they did have...<eos> Come on.<eos> It's 6:00 a.m. What is that?<eos> I don't know, but make it stop.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Wow!<eos> It's a fountain, too.<eos> We would have mentioned that yesterday, But your friends were a little uptight.<eos> Yeah, they can get like that.<eos> So do you think that you can just turn it off for a second?
No, on second thought, Do.<eos> Hello, Gabrielle.<eos> Milton... You scared me.<eos> I thought you were in washington with Victor.<eos> I was.<eos> I got to the messages first.<eos> Oh. You can't leave him, Gabrielle.<eos> Well, if he really wanted me to stay, He would've come here himself, instead of siccing daddy on me.<eos> Oh, Victor hasn't heard the message.<eos> I erased it.
Come here.<eos> I remember everything.<eos> What?<eos> I think i will rest now.<eos> I'm gonna need all my strength.<eos> The past is never truly behind us.<eos> Ghosts lurk in the shadows, eager to remind us of the choices we made.<eos> But if we look back, we might find an old friend with open arms... Or an old enemy with a hidden agenda.<eos> Or a grown-up son with a forgiving heart...<eos> Sadly, some of us refuse to look back, never understanding that by denying the past... We are condemned... To repeat it.
- Uh,stop that.<eos> All right,I'm in.<eos> she's warm.It doesn't make sense.<eos> I'm -'m sorry.<eos> She's breathing with the help of machines.<eos> Erin... the person that you knew... isn't there anymore.<eos> Uh... would you bring the paperwork?<eos> You can have her... have her...her organs.That's what she wanted.<eos> And her heart?<eos> Give it to someone else.
I'm sorry if things got.<eos> you deserve the job.<eos> Oh,does she ever.<eos> Come here,new chief resident.<eos> Huh?<eos> Someone deserves a big hug.<eos> oh,come on,sydney.<eos> Well,I admit,I'm a.<eos> I'm a wee bit jealous.<eos> But the chief has made his decision,and I will abide by it.
Hold off for a moment.His wife's arriving.<eos> Stan,sara's here.<eos> Stan,wake up,man.Sara's here.<eos> Wake up!<eos> That's good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Baby?<eos> Baby.<eos> Hey.<eos> your x-ray shows that the metal's embedded in your femur, so I'm gonna go in and remove it while Dr. Hahn and Dr. Sloan repair the damage caused by the infection.
Well,that would make me like him, and I'm not like him.<eos> Oh,sorry,Dr. Shepherd, I'm running behind today.<eos> I'll be out of your way in just a second.<eos> Well,actually,rose,I'm early,so technically,I'm in your way.<eos> Oh,well,in that case,don't let it happen again.<eos> You're staring at my chest.<eos> What?<eos> I think maybe you're intending to admire my ring, but it's coming off as you staring at my chest.<eos> Oh,sorry.It's just that,uh,you wear your engagement ring on your necklace.<eos> When I was engaged,I wore it on my finger.
yup... just like old times.<eos> you live for this and you know it.<eos> we could always get in the car and pass the time like we used to.<eos> [ laughing ] no.<eos> no.<eos> i'm not going down that road again.<eos> man: code 1, suspect's vehicle spotted -- one on board.<eos> headed your way.<eos> [ radio beeps ] i'll take lead.<eos> i got it.
If this kind of thing catches on, We're looking at an epidemic.<eos> Kind of like herpes.<eos> Fucking-A, masuka, i'm trying to listen.<eos> One in four, morgan - One in four.<eos> Vigilante justice is domestic terrorism.<eos> And terrorism prevention is the fbi's top priority.<eos> I have done my best to be diplomatic,<eos> But if we lose one life to a vigilante,<eos> I will pull this case from miami metro<eos> And hand it over in full to the bureau.
What's the story with the scruffy Kappa Tau who looks like Rob Thomas?<eos> He was talking to casey this morning.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Casey made the mistake of dating Cappie freshman year.<eos> $275?<eos> He said he was buying. You want me to bail you dorks out or not?<eos> Look around.<eos> Some day this could all be yours.<eos> How did you know about that video?<eos> - I sent it to you.
What happenedwasn't your fault.<eos> That's not exactlythe case.<eos> Is that coffee I smell? you only bolted becausevictor wants to be governor.<eos> He only wants to be governorbecause of me.<eos> You only suggested it.<eos> You can't make him go aftersomething he doesn't want.<eos> The hell I can'T.<eos> Ever since he was a kid,victor's been killing himself trying to live upto his big shot father.<eos> He's desperatefor my approval. Why?<eos> I supposebecause he's never gotten it.
Corey Smith and Herman Valdez, they have brothers, too.<eos> I've met them. Yeah, I know, I know.<eos> Is there any point to this?<eos> They have it already?<eos> Yeah, yeah, they have it.<eos> They have it.<eos> All right, tell me something that I've always wanted to know.<eos> Why isn't there 24-hour CIA surveillance of every employee of Al Jazeera?<eos> Somebody's getting these tapes handed to them.<eos> You, you can't make a home movie and then broadcast it on MBS without our knowing how it got there.
Stop it!<eos> That hurts, right?<eos> Which is odd, because I'm really enjoying this.<eos> You hold the pieces that way because you can't bend your thumb, because your bones have formed abnormally, thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.<eos> Actually, this stuff isn't important at all.<eos> Your doctors said he needs immunosuppressants.<eos> They're idiots. It's not amyloidosis.<eos> It's iron.<eos> He's got hemochromatosis.<eos> The body absorbs iron from food but can't process it, can't get rid of it.
- Dichmann...<eos> Dichmann!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Should we search everything to find a man in bandages?<eos> You fucked!<eos> It was later. And how do we know that Sebastian is dead?<eos> They found the body, brought it in and wrote a death certificate.<eos> - Where did you get it?
Because i, pappu master, saying... that you will become a hero.<eos> You have everything, style, hairstyle, race, face... and extreme talent.<eos> But there's just one thing coming between you and your stardom.<eos> What's that?<eos> Your name.<eos> My name?<eos> - Om prakash makhija your bill is due for two months.<eos> I will... in this lifetime or the next?<eos> Your cream roll also is not from this lifetime.<eos> You've been selling it since the times of alam ara.
So you believe in Buddha.<eos> That's buddhists.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> No.<eos> What are you?<eos> Well, if you're gonna reduce my identity to my religion, then I'm sikh.<eos> But I also like hip-hop and NPR.<eos> And I'm restoring a 1967 corvette in my spare time.<eos> So one sikh, and...<eos> As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery.
Yeah. They try to keep them alive.<eos> Because meat spoils slower in a fridge.<eos> So they keep it cold.<eos> That interview was terrible.<eos> It was terrible.<eos> We need a more exciting truth.<eos> We do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's set this place on fire.<eos> Let's burn it to the ground!
I don't want to talk about that.<eos> Did you become celebrities yet?<eos> We're not doing the celebrity thing anymore.<eos> We're done with that.<eos> No.<eos> We need you guys. 'Cause we got this great chopping mechanism.<eos> It's for the news show.<eos> There is no news show, Charlie!<eos> Yes, there is a news show, Dennis!<eos> We're gonna put it on public access!
It just stopped, engine's dead, they're all dead.<eos> So all this fighting aliens stuff, you've been doing it for years?<eos> Not now, Clyde.<eos> Did you go up to the career guy at school and say, "I wanna defend the planet from alien invaders?" Not exactly.<eos> So how did it start?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> WHOOSH! What's going on?<eos> It's transduction, like the candles.<eos> They've switched off the sun!<eos> They're draining it.
I don't think so.<eos> Earl, I'm serious.<eos> Tell me your real last name.<eos> I told you.<eos> It's Hickey.<eos> Joy, this is my brother Randy.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - You ain't staying here.<eos> And I'm not going to be called Mrs. Hickey.<eos> Took my 5th grade to lose that nickname, and I'm sure as hell I'm not going back to it now.
My parents are gone,<eos> The entire House of El.<eos> I'll never see any of my family ever again.<eos> You're with family now.<eos> Look, you can stay here with me on the farm as long as you want.<eos> You know, these humans are not as bad as you think.<eos> Thank you, Kal-El.<eos> I mean, Clark.<eos> I just wish I didn't feel like such a failure.<eos> I made my father a promise, and I couldn't keep it.
What a lucky guy.<eos> What the textbook left out is that Isis is also the goddess of the underworld.<eos> She's responsible for bringing the great god Ra to his knees.<eos> You believe that I would do that to Clark.<eos> Not intentionally.<eos> But I realize now that you're capable of it.<eos> You should just know that I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> There's no way to trace where the alloy disappeared to?<eos> Mr. Luthor, I don't need to remind you that the properties of that substance... weren't exactly conventional.<eos> We just barely started to study it.
Chuck, the registers are down.<eos> I can't get them back up.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Say more than one word, and I'll kill him right here.<eos> -Pineapple.<eos> -Let's go.<eos> Pineapple.<eos> Dude, don't say that word.<eos> It doesn't have meaning if you keep joking with it.<eos> No. I didn't say it.
A rogue spy.<eos> Did he try to contact you?<eos> He sent me an e-mail.<eos> Bryce sent me a database of government secrets that are now locked in my brain, keeping me in a constant state of fear danger and anxiety.<eos> Bryce Larkin pretended to be his buddy sexed up his girl, got him kicked out of Stanford.<eos> If Chuck is Solo, Larkin is his Fett.<eos> Stanford was five years ago.<eos> It's our subconscious that we're gonna be talking about today.<eos> How can we penetrate the human mind?<eos> How can we understand it?
-Someone set us up.<eos> -I think it was your sandwich maker.<eos> Are you kidding me? Lou?<eos> Please, come on.<eos> You guys don't want me to date for national security reasons, fine.<eos> But I think this is pathetic.<eos> And quite frankly, beneath you, Sarah.<eos> This was taken at the docks after your date.<eos> I'm sure she has a perfectly reasonable explanation for this. Good.<eos> Can't wait to hear it.
Am i gonna see him tonight?<eos> Well, he's in connecticut with his mum.<eos> He said he would try to catch a train<eos> And make it to the party tonight.<eos> Yeah, well, Another New York institution that i miss.<eos> You know, you don't have to miss any of it.<eos> I wish that i could be in two places at once, My dear, but impossible. Sorry.<eos> You know that chateau near lyon that i told you about?<eos> Mm-Hmm.<eos> Roman and i bought it.
Wow,these dolls are great.<eos> Oh, my god.You have a cabbage patch.<eos> My brother used to have oneof these.His name was cedric.<eos> Your brother's name is cedric? Uh, no that washis cabbage patch kid.<eos> My brother's name is dan.Actually, you might know him.<eos> He, um, he went outwith serena last night.<eos> That's your brother?<eos> so does that meanyou're friends with serena now?<eos> I mean, I don't havea problem with her, but if someone did havea problem with her, I wouldn't have a problemwith that either.<eos> You know... if you like that dress,you can have it.
I felt fine.<eos> naomi.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I see it.<eos> Th is not just sister helen and sister virginia.<eos> Sam.<eos> hey, no, no. Don't come in.<eos> Don't co in.<eos> This building is a hot zone.<eos> We have to lock it down.
Karen, you can't have it both ways.<eos> You can't tell me to fuck off and forget about you and then wander back into my life whenever you feel like it.<eos> Believe me, I will not make the same mistake again.<eos> - OK.<eos> - OK.<eos> Well, why did you come?<eos> Because you bought me a ring, you fucking asshole.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I mean, you went into a store, and you looked around, and then you... you picked out a ring, and then... and then you bought it for me.
Well, why did you come?<eos> Because you bought me a ring, you fucking asshole.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I mean, you went into a store, and you looked around, and then you... you picked out a ring, and then... and then you bought it for me.<eos> I did.<eos> But you never bought me a ring.<eos> Ever.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Why didn't you give it to me?
- I can't do that.<eos> Look, I never said that you had to choose between me and William the Conqueror.<eos> I just think you can't run off and marry a guy after making sweet love to yours truly.<eos> It just wouldn't be chaste, young lady.<eos> Says the guy who's, like, hosting orgies and standing in the middle of the street in a skirt.<eos> It was hardly an orgy.<eos> I wasn't even that into it.<eos> I just did it to get Charlie laid.<eos> I forgot... you're such a humanitarian, right?<eos> Look, I did buy you a ring, and I would show it to you, but I gave it to this homeless woman after you blew me off.

It was beautiful.<eos> It was elegant and understated, much like yourself.<eos> I would have liked nothing better than to get down on bended knee and slip it on your finger. - Stop it.<eos> - But buying it was a mistake.
Hank wrote something.<eos> Well, kudos to Hank.<eos> He's a writer.<eos> This is a big deal, sweetie.<eos> This is like the return of old Hank.<eos> Or I don't know. Maybe it's the new Hank.<eos> But the guy, he came into my office today with a giant engagement ring he bought for Karen,<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The only thing I could think when I saw it was hope.
A very clever woman looked at that thing with green snots... took a bite and said: ''this cheese is so freaking good!<eos> Lemme tell you how it all started.<eos> A cowboy was coming back home after spending the day... on the back of his horse, herding his cattle.<eos> Even on those days, women expected their man to do so.<eos> So off he goes ''clop, clop''... with a leather bag full of milk on his back.<eos> He gets home, jumps off his horse... drops his bag on the porch and takes the horse to the barn.<eos> At that point, he goes in, closes the door... and forgets the damn bag outside.<eos> Go figure, overnight the milk curds.<eos> On the next day, his wife sees the bag outside and gets mad.<eos> She thinks: ''that shit is staying there unless he takes it inside!
-I talked to him in the hangar.<eos> He's not so bright.<eos> -I could check him out.<eos> Maybe you should bug his car.<eos> Yeah, maybe I should.<eos> I'll do the recon. I'll see you guys around.<eos> When you want to turn someone into an asset get him to betray the people he loves, you have to get to know him.<eos> This wine is warm.<eos> This is very good wine.<eos> You're supposed to drink it a little warm.
Leland told me that you're becoming obsessed with me.<eos> To tell you the truth, I'm a little flattered.<eos> I know about your wife.<eos> About what happened.<eos> You miss her.<eos> You are obviously in a lot of pain.<eos> And pain like that can make it difficult to think... Well... to think clearly.<eos> I wish there was something I could do to help.<eos> The report.<eos> Oh, I can't find it.

Did you take the ring back to the jeweler's today?<eos> What, the ring?<eos> Yeah, the ring.<eos> Did you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You did?<eos> There was no problem or anything?<eos> No, he said it'll be ready next week.<eos> Is anything wrong?<eos> You didn't drop it or lose it?
Go back to sleep.<eos> Morning.<eos> Where is it now?<eos> Wintersgill must be on crack.<eos> As if anyone would bury a body in their own back garden.<eos> You can't just let him get away with it.<eos> You're innocent.<eos> It has to be Donnelly, who else could it be?<eos> Zoe didn't see his face, it could be anyone.<eos> - Where did you put it?
Just because you shaved doesn't mean you're clean and sober.<eos> You still have to get yourself into a program.<eos> Get your family back.<eos> Don't let your children hate you.<eos> Not if you can help it.<eos> You didn't kill Kaito Nakamura.<eos> I know that.<eos> I have done so many bad things in my life it really doesn't matter what crime I confess to.<eos> Let me help you, ma.<eos> No, what you want is redemption, and you're not gonna get it by helping me.
- Epigeneticist.<eos> The butyric acid cycle could be affected by any number of factors.<eos> Enzyme overgrowth,<eos> - radiation exposure, a virus.<eos> - Radiation can cause this?<eos> If it disrupts the TRNA synthetase.<eos> Okay, well, the chaotic thing<eos> - was pumping out a lot of radiation. - No. I don't think so.<eos> I've done studies with radiation on animals before, and that device would have to be tuned to a precise wavelength in order to cause this effect.<eos> What if somebody was tuning it on purpose?
Come on then.<eos> What's the name of this dish?<eos> 'Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate'.<eos> It's an auspicious name for the Chinese.<eos> You can see the fish is still alive.<eos> See?<eos> It's mouth is still moving.<eos> Is this a popular dish here?<eos> No, it's not really popular nowadays.<eos> Because it takes a lot of skills to make it.
Sure, we can meet.<eos> But I must inform my superior of the situation.<eos> A soldier commits suicide by taking poison.<eos> Be careful, it's hot.<eos> It's the base of an ostrich's neck.<eos> It's low in cholesterol and calories.<eos> It's good for the body.<eos> Try the egg!<eos> It's as big as 24 chicken eggs.<eos> It takes a long time to fry it.
Three fresh ones rollin' in!<eos> Christ, you're kidding.<eos> Automobile accident off of Highway 18.<eos> DOAs?<eos> Have Andy pick 'em up.<eos> He's already on 620 picking up another two.<eos> Fucking Wednesday nights.<eos> That's unsanitary, Doc.<eos> Not if I'm the only one using it. Helps me monitor my state of calmness.<eos> Yeah, don't get all worked up enough to crack it.
That's mine!<eos> Quiet!<eos> All this to clear the name of an innocent man.<eos> That's noble.<eos> You should be proud.<eos> You know who I did this for,fi.<eos> All right,I'm here.<eos> What couldn't you say over the phone?<eos> Bondsman won't have anything to do with me now that you've told him I was aiding and abetting.<eos> So I was thinking,when you collect your bounty, maybe we could split it.
Are you a fan of symmetry?<eos> Sure.<eos> Weird.<eos> 'Cause your eyes are lopsided, and by eyes I mean breasts.<eos> ARDS and crush syndrome, both reactions to severe trauma.<eos> Why can't she have both?<eos> Because... Because then, there's nothing we could do.<eos> Boy, you remind me of someone.<eos> Send me your résumé.<eos> I'll put it on top of the pile that I'm never gonna look at.
But it took some time to get over you, you know?<eos> I-I'm still getting over you.<eos> But you? You were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie.<eos> Over it?<eos> My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is... it was really lonely.<eos> And that's why Gael happened.<eos> You weren't trying to win the breakup?<eos> I was trying to survive it.
The yellow area show where we lose the most<eos> Luckily, we were born prepared<eos> We have a special layer of tissue that keeps us warm it s fat<eos> normaly found in hibernating animals<eos> Much more than just a insulating layer this fat is packed with special cells which actively generate heat<eos> eventually , most of this fat melts away as the hypothalamus matures and takes over the job of temperature control<eos> just days old, we know almost nothing about her world.<eos> Everything we do , we do by instinct even breast feeding<eos> our mother's milk gives us all the nutrients we need<eos> And we drink half of liter of it every day
Has Kurre called?<eos> What the hell?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - How are you?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Get your stuff in the garage.<eos> - I will when I have the time.<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Get your stuff, or I'll throw it out, understand?
What did you think this was?<eos> Well, I was going to eat you.<eos> I may have misheard you there.<eos> Did you just say that you were going to eat me?<eos> - Right, you did say that.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah, no, I'm here for the cookery.<eos> - No, this is the cookery.<eos> Look, I've got your advert here.<eos> I printed it out.
Bart, I'll need some clean urine.<eos> Stat.<eos> Now to make sure you're motivated to get this job, you have to quit your old one.<eos> I'll call your boss right now.<eos> I'll get it, sir.<eos> Just send it to voice mail.<eos> You here for the safety inspector job?<eos> Well, I can see the position of hand somest CEO is already taken.<eos> I like you already.<eos> If you can write your name so I can read it, you're in.
You are almost ready for the trials.<eos> How did you feel while you were building it?<eos> I was anxious to finish it and to see its blade. see its blade<eos> And how did you feel when you finished it?<eos> I was happy, Master.<eos> Happy and nothing more?<eos> We'll see:<eos> get up Hope!<eos> Close your eyes and concentrate.<eos> Now you must feel it
Family isn't just two people on their own.<eos> Well, I mean, that's just not my understanding of it.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> I said it's not my understanding of it.<eos> - THUNDER - Certainly a fine wine.<eos> Does the name Vino Nobile di Montepulciano mean anything to you?<eos> Vino certainly does.<eos> Two bottles of it, rather expensive bottles, disappeared, drunk by a person or persons.<eos> - By you, I should think.<eos> - No, I left it in the usual place in the kitchen, on the shelf where I always leave the good stuff, and they've gone.
My God.<eos> What did you eat?<eos> The entire kitchen cupboard today?<eos> What's wrong with my body?<eos> So many things.<eos> I mean, your breasts, they're tiny.<eos> Your gut is huge.<eos> I wear a "D" cup!<eos> Well, you're just lying about that.<eos> All right now, take this gut and suck it in.
Hmm...<eos> I'm not sure my wife will go for this naughty mud flaps.<eos> Not to worry.<eos> These... are the ones you show at home.<eos> That's still too sexy for my wife.<eos> No problem.<eos> Man, you work as a silhouette model for one day and it haunts you for the rest of your life.<eos> Now just rember two rules.<eos> One, stick to Springfield.<eos> If I catch you on my turf, I'll rip off your head, vomit down your neck, pull out your heart, show it to your head, then shove 'em both down your neck hole, to which I previously alluded.
The sands of time are running out from him.<eos> No, I just get along perfectly well without a clock.<eos> Aren't you late for work?<eos> No, the clock is inside.<eos> Everyone has a clock inside.<eos> They forgot to wind mine up.<eos> No, it's just that sometimes it runs fast and sometimes it runs slow.<eos> And sometimes it sticks in one place.<eos> Well, I want to live in harmony with time.<eos> But people these days, the people who populate the earth, they've all gone mad, they're all chasing time, they want to catch it up, they want to earn more...
Let's just go and sell this bar for everything we can get.<eos> Let's do it, boys.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Wait a second.<eos> What the hell am I supposed to do?<eos> Don't give a shit.<eos> Hi.<eos> I need to apply for a job.<eos> Right.<eos> Just fill out this application... and I'll put it in the stack with the others.
I love Starbucks.<eos> Oh.<eos> That's why I'm working here.<eos> Do you think you can get me a job?<eos> Here?<eos> I thought you weren't applying.<eos> No, that was a lie.<eos> Oh. Um... Here's my application.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, you didn't fill it out yet.
Okay, but tell him to call me as soon as possible.<eos> Fine.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Hi. Do you have a minute?<eos> Why?<eos> I've been interviewed.<eos> I have a few more questions.<eos> I see.<eos> I'd like to help but as this is Saturday and I'm only here to attend a meeting right now...<eos> Cancel it.
Leave him alone!<eos> Get off of him...<eos> You're killing him!<eos> "Get off of him, Get off of him. " I was screaming like crazy for someone to help us, but nobody did.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Blood was streaming down Will's face.<eos> I was watching him die.<eos> Brennan said Toole was shot.<eos> The gun was in the nightstand drawer.<eos> I remember Jimmie grabbing it, but Toole... threw him down, and the gun... slid across the floor.
Everything.<eos> Yes, but...<eos> Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.<eos> Why are you coming here twice in one week 15 years later?<eos> What do you mean "twice in one week"?<eos> A policeman called and asked the same questions you did.<eos> Who?<eos> He was difficult to understand.<eos> I wrote his name here.<eos> Oh, well. I left it in the lounge room.
- Can you prove it?<eos> We all regret what happened.<eos> But don't do this.<eos> Think of relationships after the election.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> What?<eos> If you'll re-think this I'll talk to Bremer.<eos> We'll put a lid on the defamation case.<eos> Nothing will get out.<eos> Let's solve it in an orderly manner.
I don't screw up.<eos> A nosebleed that major means he's actually sick.<eos> Means the cardiac arrest was a symptom.<eos> Stop gloating.<eos> I'm not gloating.<eos> Then what's that smirk?<eos> No smirk.<eos> This is how i look.<eos> What about the underwear challenge?<eos> I declare it officially on hold.
He was right about the botched transfusion.<eos> And he's your love nugget.<eos> You got no reason to pick him.<eos> But somebody else does.<eos> Kutner's a liability.<eos> He electrocuted himself, lit a patient on fire.<eos> It's only a matter of time Before he burns the hospital down.<eos> You made the deal with cuddy.<eos> That's how you got her underwear.<eos> She sold it to you For the right to put her choices on the block.
Maybe there was one.<eos> I don't remember his name.<eos> The others thought he was up himself but he was nice to me.<eos> - What did he look like?<eos> - Normal.<eos> He was in a photo with Dad.<eos> Mum tossed all the photos out.<eos> How did you feel about that?<eos> If it was me...<eos> I'd have hidden that photo somewhere where my mother wouldn't find it.
She's A Bitch.<eos> No, The One That's Making You An Idiot.<eos> The Story Of Life-- Boy Meets Girl.<eos> Boy Gets Stupid.<eos> Boy And Girl Live Stupidly Ever After.<eos> Pretty Girl Kill Again?<eos> Nope.<eos> Elephant Boy Just Vomiting Up Blood Again.<eos> No Tumors In The Patient's Stomach, So--<eos> But The Scope Caused Variceal Bleeding. Took 20 Minutes Of Banding To Stop It.
Three guys on motorcyclespulled me out of the car.<eos> They saidthey're coming after you.<eos> They're coming afterall of us.<eos> So, what do you wantfrom me?<eos> What kind of protection wouldI get for half of everything?<eos> Anyone fucks with you,they fuck with me.<eos> When they go down,they go down hard.<eos> Fine.<eos> The fire startedin their grow field.<eos> Someone torched it.
No, I am not. Oh.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> You're one of them, huh?<eos> A crooked cop. Yeah, I get it!<eos> Everybody's a crooked cop, huh?<eos> Am I the only cop left in Philadelphia who ain't crooked? Oh...<eos> Oh, I see what's happening.<eos> You wanna come at Serpico, huh?<eos> Who wants a place of Serpico?<eos> 'Cause I'll give It to you.
The patient is an addict.<eos> It's not his fault he's jonesing for whatever he can get his hands on.<eos> Not his fault he's jonesing?<eos> In what universe does that make any sense?<eos> Get him on a nicotine patch.<eos> That'll keep up with his joneses.<eos> Do your biopsy.<eos> How's the new us's final case going?<eos> It's a moving target.<eos> House keeps moving it, so I can't find it.
There may not be any technical liability here but...<eos> You're ripping it up because you think it would be wrong to take money from me?<eos> I think it would be wrong to take so little money from you.<eos> You're out $6,000...<eos> You ruined my life.<eos> I ruined three months.<eos> For the first time in my life, I was living in the present, 'cause that's all there was.<eos> You're suing me, not for the wrong diagnosis, but for the right one?<eos> Have you spoken to a lawyer?<eos> You gave me happiness, and then you took it away.
Good night.<eos> Danilo,<eos> I never want to go to the cemetery again.<eos> Could you make me some milk?<eos> - Sure, how do you like it?<eos> - With chocolate.<eos> It's cold.<eos> I'll heat it.<eos> Now it's too hot.<eos> For how many seconds should we heat it in the microwave?
This one's good.<eos> This one?<eos> Yup.<eos> It's pretty cute.<eos> Alright.<eos> Can I touch it?<eos> Sure.<eos> What are you going to name the baby?<eos> We still don't know if its a boy or girl.<eos> Since you got pregnant from the library, Why don't you name it 'book'.
We are supposed to stop the train... and to move the dead body.<eos> to move this horribly torn body onto the platform...<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey, snap out of it!<eos> Let me keep the witnesses' numbers, you keep driving!<eos> Then we write down telephone numbers of witnesses... and keep driving to the destination... as if nothing happened.<eos> Then at the destination, I change shifts,<eos> and come back to this station...<eos> And write down the statement<eos> And go to the police and write it down again.
We charged Kyle Betts, a local man, with kidnapping and false imprisonment.<eos> He was remanded in custody, and there he remains.<eos> There's no evidence to link him to the disappearance of the mother.<eos> You moved rather quickly to a murder inquiry on her.<eos> - Dragged there reluctantly. - No body, though?<eos> No forensic? - Correct.<eos> - So I'm still not clear on what evidence you changed your hypothesis from missing person to murder.<eos> Detective Superintendent Barclay, sir, this is your 28-day review.<eos> It's not optional. It's not voluntary.<eos> I've been assured by your A.C.C. that I will receive your full cooperation, and I intend to get it.
You see, I thought it would help.<eos> It does help.<eos> I thought it would help me.<eos> ( sobbing )<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Come on, let's go. Let's go.<eos> Let's just get to the airport, shall we?<eos> Do one thing at a time.<eos> - Can't help his background.<eos> - He can't escape it either.
Where did I put it?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Handbag.<eos> It's in the handbag.<eos> Did she mention ring?<eos> Yes, but why did that Ahjumma from the class reunion wants Mom to find it for her?<eos> Help me, it's not there either.<eos> Hey, you should search well for it!<eos> But how can it be under there?<eos> Did you really bring it home?

It's true. Sending you an invitation now is a little cruel to you.<eos> Wrinkles.<eos> Eye bags.<eos> Festivals.<eos> Family gatherings.<eos> Soft and subtle skin.<eos> Bouncy breasts.<eos> To me, all such things are extremely cruel.<eos> The world is going further and further away from me.<eos> So you received it too?
Yes.<eos> You seem thinner recently.<eos> Now that I've moved out, you're missing me?<eos> If you grow any thinner, you won't get married out.<eos> I'm totally overwhelmed.<eos> You should just eat more.<eos> Yun Hee, aren't you sensitive about the smell of food?<eos> Yes, not much morning sickness.<eos> I've ordered blankets.<eos> They should deliver it directly to your place, right?
Ha ha. I didn't hear you, man.<eos> Talk about the NBA again, I dare ya.<eos> I double-dare ya.<eos> Even your skinny women disgust me.<eos> - Halle Berry. - Wh...?<eos> Aw, hell no.<eos> Now you done gone too far.<eos> You want violence, smelly Frenchman? Huh?<eos> Do you want violence?<eos> Well, you got it!
Monsieur, I have the information.<eos> If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.<eos> But the rat!<eos> You must... lt stole my documents.<eos> It's past opening time.<eos> He should have finished an hour ago.<eos> Bonjour, ma chérie.<eos> Join us.<eos> We were just talking about my inspiration.<eos> Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.
So I wrote a check for the $ 12.000 he needed to keep his wife insured and in treatment. And sent it to him anonymously.<eos> His wife got better and his website is still going strong.<eos> It was hard for me to acknowledge that in the end. We truly are all in the same boat.<eos> No matter what our differences. We sink or swim together.<eos> That's how it seems to be everywhere else.<eos> They take care of each other.<eos> No matter what their disagreements.<eos> You know. When we see a good idea from another country. We grab it.<eos> If they build a better car. We drive it.<eos> If they make a better wine. We drink it.
And maybe you can pick up another shift at the store.<eos> Dead meat.<eos> You're really good at drawing.<eos> Like, better than any kid I've ever seen.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I wanna share this composition for two reasons.<eos> One, it uses adjectives well.<eos> And two, it's clear the author paid attention to what she saw and what she felt, which is important for any writing.<eos> Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus by Leslie Burke.<eos> Leslie, why don't you read it for us.
Last night, you didn't think I was too hairy down there, did you?<eos> I know a lot of women shave completely,but I don't like that.<eos> You know, it makes me feel like a little girl.<eos> But if you want, I could trim it.<eos> And that way you'd be able to see my kitty ring better.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I mean, I think...<eos> No, that's a good...<eos> I could see it.<eos> - Was good visibility on it.
Long's been sitting on it for ages...<eos> Got it. Pause.<eos> Come on, Evan, this is huge. You hitch your wagon to the right star, you could ride all the way down to Pennsylvania Avenue.<eos> This is day one. You got your name on a major piece of legislation!<eos> Oh, and another thing, he wants you to read it today.<eos> Well, I can't do it today.<eos> I promised my kids...<eos> Eugene.<eos> Well, sir, there's a time clock on the bill.<eos> If Congressman Long wants to pass it this quarter, he's going to have to introduce it to the committee immediately.
All right, J.J., I'm your man.<eos> I know more about a good picture than any photographer. See, photography, it's not just about, no offence, flagpoles or whatever. It's about lighting.<eos> I want a staffjob, sir.<eos> I have a girl that I intend to marry and I guess, I don't know, I have this stupid little dream of working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time.<eos> J. Jonah Jameson.<eos> Well, we do have an opening.<eos> Johnson quit, remember?<eos> -You fired him.<eos> -Whatever. I know what makes a good picture and I've been here a long time.<eos> If there's a staffjob, I think I deserve it.
- That ironical little authoress.<eos> I wished you to know her for yourself.<eos> I was certain her merit would speak for her.<eos> - Consider, sir, my happiness is in your hands.<eos> - Happiness?<eos> Damn it, nephew,<eos> I had rather you were a whore-mongering blackguard with a chance of reform than a love-sick whelp sunk in a bad marriage.<eos> My uncle has refused to give his consent.<eos> - The letter has done its work.<eos> - Who sent it?
Sergeant, this is beginning to get embarrassing.<eos> How could I possibly be in several places at once?<eos> I'm sure the store's security footage will absolve me.<eos> Do feel free to spool through.<eos> I can handle this, Danny.<eos> yöu might as well go back and just enjoy the rest of yöur birthday.<eos> - Did yöu really get me that plant?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> But it's been impounded as evidence.<eos> Well, I mean, maybe Dad will still let me water it, eh?
This is not battle, Wiglaf.<eos> This is slaughter.<eos> The Frisians want to make themselves heroes, my Lord. They want the bards to sing of their deeds.<eos> It's going to be a short song.<eos> Now, can you blame them?<eos> Your legend is known from the high seas and the snow barriers to the great island kingdom.<eos> You are the monster slayer.<eos> We men are the monsters now.<eos> The time of heroes is dead, Wiglaf.<eos> The Christ God has killed it, leaving humankind with nothing but weeping martyrs, fear and shame.
My Lord, this is the slave who found it.<eos> Please, please don't kill me!<eos> Where did you find this treasure?<eos> I'm sorry I ran away, Master. But please don't hurt me no more.<eos> - Answer your King!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Stop.<eos> Where?<eos> Up, up on the moors.<eos> But I was gonna bring it back, Master. I swear.
I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.<eos> But she was pretty.<eos> She had yellow hair like a...<eos> Oh, like something.<eos> Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, like that.<eos> Boy, you... You talk good.<eos> You can hide things in vocabulary.<eos> Maybe you and me could write her a note, send it by post?
- Fair enough. Fair enough.<eos> - Please take your seats at this time.<eos> Remember, smoking is in the last six aisles only.<eos> Enjoy your flight.<eos> Cheri Jo Bates attended Riverside Community College.<eos> She studies in the library the night of October 30th, 1966.<eos> She leaves with an unidentified male at closing, 9:00 p.m.<eos> Her body's found the next morning in a parking lot, stabbed to death.<eos> A typewritten confession was sent to the Riverside Press Enterprise on November 29th, a month after Bates's murder.<eos> They ran it.
- You don't think this is Zodiac?<eos> - We got a guy we like for it.<eos> We don't have enough to pin it on him yet, but we're pretty sure it's him.<eos> If you don't think this is Zodiac, then why give anything to Avery?<eos> I'm trying to cooperate.<eos> Oh, that's how you cooperate? By giving information to reporters?<eos> Look, I don't know about the handwriting, but Sherwood says it's a match, right?<eos> So, let's just say that your guy did Cheri Jo.<eos> He types the confession.<eos> Zodiac reads it in the paper, and he writes a letter taking credit for it.
- That's not true.<eos> - Kemp has thrown me out of the orphanage.<eos> - Y-you can stay here with us.<eos> - I can't do that! - Egremont could take you to America.<eos> - Draw my portrait!<eos> Paint my portrait and make me beautiful once again!<eos> Could you do that? - Rembrandt hasn't painted anything since Saskia died.<eos> - Then let me be the excuse to start again!<eos> The painting could stand in for my face. I still have a beautiful body, haven't I?<eos> You've seen it.
I have really very, very, bad dreams.<eos> I couldn't sleep last night thinking about Annie.<eos> I don't know how to comfort people.<eos> I hate when I say a stupid thing.<eos> Stupid things you say make me like you even more.<eos> Mom? Who built the snowman?<eos> I did. Do you like it?<eos> It's okay.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I got a letter from your father today, and I tore it up.
Of the good men!<eos> She wants you to grab it, Ana.<eos> You can do it, Ana!<eos> You know that I'm no mystic.<eos> Come on, Ana.<eos> We're with you.<eos> Don't be afraid, Ana.<eos> We're together now.<eos> Now I've given my name.<eos> Say it!
THE LAST LEGION<eos> The legend began beneath these dark hills and under this same sky.<eos> It tells of a sword of great power forged for the conqueror, Julius Caesar.<eos> This weapon was passed down until it reached the last of Caesars noble line, the Emperor Tiberius.<eos> On his death, it was hidden away to keep from the hands of evil men.<eos> For generations, it lay in a secret place marked by the sign of a pentangle and, as it was written, under the very gaze of Caesar.<eos> I, Ambrosinus, born in Britannia was one of many men who sought it.
- Such passion, commander.<eos> You must have broken many hearts.<eos> You're getting slow.<eos> Must be age!<eos> You know, your attacks are a little too predictable.<eos> So where am I open?<eos> There.<eos> Not bad.<eos> - Do you know this place?<eos> - Once, yes, I knew it well.
That's Cíbola.<eos> The City of Gold.<eos> The City of Gold.<eos> "In 1527, a Spanish ship wrecked on the Florida coast.<eos> There were only four survivors.<eos> One was a slave named Estebán who saved a local tribe's dying chief.<eos> As a reward, he was taken to their sacred city, a city built from solid gold.<eos> Later, when Estebán tried to find the city again, he never could.<eos> But the legend grew, and every explorer came to the New World in search of it.<eos> When General Custer's search for gold ended with his last stand at Little Bighorn, it became clear none would ever find it."
Now, let's go. Let's go.<eos> Husband-and-wife stuff.<eos> Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today...<eos> I object!<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake!<eos> - Norbit.<eos> - Norbit.<eos> Norbit.<eos> Norbit<eos> This wedding is a sham and I'm here to stop it.
Uh... 11 Washington Square.<eos> They don't know where I live.<eos> Don't - Don't let them track us.<eos> You gotta stay out till dawn.<eos> No!<eos> Donkey?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I would think of all people you would recognize a wall when you see one.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.
I don't wanna make you bad.<eos> You don't have that power.<eos> Go see my ex-boyfriend. He'll show you.<eos> "I should have gotten out of there Right at that moment, but then she said... "<eos> It's this number!<eos> This fucking number... 23.<eos> It rules my world.<eos> It's my father's fault.<eos> He said he'd found a way to beat the number,<eos> That he'd beat it, that I was safe.
666, the number of the devil.<eos> There are only 22 chapters in the book of revelations.<eos> We all know how that ends.<eos> So is 23 a blessing or a curse?<eos> What's true is that there's a select group of people That take delight in perpetuating the number's infamy.<eos> Lucky seven, unlucky 13,<eos> Ballplayers, lucky shoes.<eos> People only pray because they believe that god will help them if they do.<eos> This is magical thinking, non-scientific causal reasoning. Now you're...<eos> You're looking for 23 so you're finding it.
Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that."<eos> Tristan?<eos> Please protect our sister, Tristan.<eos> Yvaine is in grave danger.<eos> The unicorn came to help her.<eos> But now they're heading into a trap.<eos> No star is safe in Stormhold.<eos> The last to fall, 400 years ago, was captured by the same witches who seek Yvaine now.<eos> They tricked her, cared for her,<eos> and when her heart was once more aglow, they cut it from her chest
I used to watch...<eos> I used to watch people having adventures.<eos> I envied them.<eos> You ever heard the expression, "Be careful what you wish for"?<eos> What?<eos> So ending up with my heart cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?<eos> No. No, I didn't...<eos> I didn't mean it like that.<eos> Look, I admire you dreaming.<eos> Shop boy like me, I could never have imagined an adventure this big in order to have wished for it.
It turned. I'm green.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Sir?<eos> Listen.<eos> Officer, listen to me.<eos> I wasn't trying to go anywhere.<eos> I wasn't trying to leave.<eos> There's a bag of shit on my stairs.<eos> Two kids just...<eos> Honestly, they put a bag of shit on my stairs and they lit it on fire.
Yum, yum!<eos> - Don't make sudden moves.<eos> - I'm living wild.<eos> It feels good, baby!<eos> No, no, Dad.<eos> Your LDL.<eos> Butt out, LDLs!<eos> I miss butter.<eos> You know why I miss butter?<eos> The French think butter is like cheese, they eat it, they eat it just like this.
Are you all right?<eos> Can I ask you to do something for me this morning?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You got your cell phone on you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Could you sit outside the courtroom?<eos> Because I might call you.<eos> And if I do... just hang up.<eos> And come inside and whisper something in my ear about... finding the murder weapon.<eos> You found it.
No, you have a career, you have a car and you have a loft you pay way too much rent for.<eos> That's not a life.<eos> Milly, I'm your mother.<eos> I love you enough to tell you the truth.<eos> Your version of the truth, Mom.<eos> No. No. The truth is, happiness is a series of choices.<eos> It's not something that just sort of happens.<eos> One wrong decision can change your whole life.<eos> There's still time, Mom.<eos> Not if you waste another minute of it.
The circumstances surrounding the shooting... remain as yet unclear.<eos> Linked by their gruesome art... while presenting the awards...<eos> as a model officer, responsible for bringing one of the city's most disturbing case.<eos> - Wait, my hat.<eos> Hey, OK?<eos> Don't be seduced. Avoid psychological speculation related to the killer's intent<eos> We may never know why he did what he did.<eos> He may never know.<eos> Treat the boundaries of the crime scene like a frame, and limit your analysis to what is presented within it.<eos> Stick with it, don't rush things, and above all, in your initial encounter with the crime scene, trust your own eyes.
- This is the one you want? - Yes.<eos> What's wrong with the one you've got, Stan?<eos> Oh you know that I actually having company over the year?<eos> I just want another chair.<eos> What's wrong with having two matching chairs?<eos> Nothing wrong, Stan.<eos> I get you a Federal salty table or a Heppelwhite for the same price.<eos> - No, no, no, that's what I want.<eos> What?<eos> You just have to have it, don't you?
They do not like the alcohol.<eos> They do not like the alcohol, wanted.<eos> All drunks were when it fell.<eos> I had taken champagne in the night that the comet fell.<eos> They do not like the alcohol in the blood.<eos> I am going to take him from here.<eos> Take this.<eos> Antibiotics.<eos> A minute.<eos> We should have gone to a group of Chad, to secure it, to sow corn, trees of apple, what does he want that it has in the camionete.
- I'm joking with you.<eos> - Mind your own business, Wayne!<eos> - What are you getting so hostile for?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Me and you are on the same side.<eos> We're on the same side.<eos> - I'm just tired of the teasing a lot.<eos> - Kevin, we're on the same side.<eos> Let me get some...<eos> If I want some vagina, let me get it.
We're gonna stay right at 260, that's our number.<eos> We've got 20,000 pounds.<eos> We've got 20,000 pounds we need to get rid of.<eos> Maybe just do all that after lunch before we get back into everything else.<eos> Can we do the $500 reserves...<eos> What do you think about all this?<eos> I like all this.<eos> I don't think he can do it.<eos> Is there a library or bookstore around here where I can get books on hunting and preserving?<eos> Anything at all to do with hunting or preserving the meat, smoking it, whatever the hell it is, talk to Kevin over there.
- Why so critical, Günther?<eos> - I'm not critical, I'm decisive.<eos> Mr. Langhans, you turned the courtroom into a real circus.<eos> Why such contempt for German justice?<eos> No walls, no doors... I could never live here.<eos> You?<eos> I could. The German system of justice is the justice of the Third Reich, and this trial has revealed that in a big way.<eos> What's your stance on the use of napalm against the Viet Cong?<eos> - What's yours? - I have my opinion, and you?<eos> Then why don't you write it down and print it?
It's a place with an opening that can take him right away.<eos> What kind of place?<eos> A... A facility for older people.<eos> In this country, they call 'em nursing homes.<eos> I thought we were gonna try assisted living.<eos> They're not gonna take him at assisted living, Wendy.<eos> Let's just be real.<eos> - He's got dementia.<eos> - Well, don't lead with that.<eos> Look, if it's any consolation, uh, this place... they don't call it a... a nursing home.

I loved him.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> Hallo?<eos> - Abby.<eos> Carl, is that you?<eos> I missed you at the Hargrave today.<eos> It was like Christmas without a tree.<eos> There was something I had to do.<eos> Robbie's murder...<eos> I was just going over it in my head and I think I know what he was up to.
(tinkling) - Miss Angelica!<eos> Now remember, Miss Angelica, finish your studies.<eos> (knocking) Come in.<eos> Well, well, Miss Deverell returns.<eos> I hope this time you have a better excuse for your absence.<eos> - I've been sick, Miss Dawson.<eos> - And being sick has prevented you from writing your essay.<eos> - No. I've done it.<eos> - Then perhaps you'd care to share it with the class.
My wife would be delighted to meet you.<eos> Or perhaps another time, when you've spoken to your mother.<eos> - I don't need my mother's permission.<eos> I've never tasted wine before. - Hmm.<eos> Does it come up to your expectations?<eos> - I never really had any.<eos> - That's Theo's favourite claret.<eos> We have it shipped over specially from France.<eos> - My mother would be so shocked.<eos> She wears this funny little badge to show she'd never touch a drop of alcohol even if offered it by Christ in Heaven.
Can I see her?<eos> You'll see her, to identify her.<eos> All the indications point to a violent gang rape, with beating, mostly to the face.<eos> The fact that she didn't complain makes the investigation very hard, even if we reach the right people, it's doubtful we'll find someone to testify against them.<eos> Do you have any idea who could have raped her?<eos> Tell me, were you two possibly trying to get pregnant lately?<eos> Can you turn that trash down?<eos> Who changed the window?<eos> It was broken.<eos> Who broke it?
No papers, no work.<eos> - Don't waste my time.<eos> - I do anything.<eos> Don't waste my time.<eos> You heard me.<eos> - Can you get the internet on that?<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> - Can you get the internet on yours?<eos> - I just got an email from Michael.<eos> Oh, take it down.
I'm glad.<eos> And there's so much more I can do for you.<eos> And you for me.<eos> So she trusted you enough to turn you into a Prior?<eos> She had to.<eos> Why exactly?<eos> Because she knew I was her best chance of converting Earth.<eos> And me.<eos> Well that would explain why she wanted to believe you, not why she had to.<eos> She had Merlin's weapon, she just didn't know how to finish it.
He knew he was no match for her.<eos> He couldn't let Merlin's unfinished weapon fall into her hands, so he and Merlin came up with a plan to fool Adria into thinking that he had succumbed to her power.<eos> So he could continue to work on the weapon.<eos> Ostensibly, this time... for her to use against the Ancients.<eos> Merlin?<eos> He says he still has Merlin's consciousness in his mind.<eos> Merlin even seemed to be speaking on occasion.<eos> Daniel says that's what's protected him from Adria's influence and what's allowed him to convince her to make him a Prior.<eos> Why did he need her to make him a Prior?<eos> So he could steal the Ori ship with the weapon onboard and fly it through the Supergate.
I told you, I found out you guys were gonna be there, so I set myself up to be captured.<eos> You misunderstand me, Daniel Jackson.<eos> Why is Adria not suspicious of your actions?<eos> You attempt to reform a meaningless planet of people instead of completing the weapon.<eos> Actually, she was the one who stopped me before I completed the weapon.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> I know.<eos> You must stop for now.<eos> You're afraid the Ancients will take the device away from us before we can use it.
Knowledge he kept from when he was ascended.<eos> But if I don't finish it...<eos> For now, you must help bring the energy of more followers into the fold.<eos> The original plan was for the Ori to convert our whole galaxy, so that they could build up their power enough to attack the Ancients.<eos> But even then, a conflict on that level was gonna be costly.<eos> But now they have a weapon that could destroy all ascended beings within the scope of an entire galaxy in one fell swoop.<eos> They just need to distract the Ancients for long enough so that they can use it.<eos> Engage them in battle long enough to complete the weapon.<eos> Then back off to safety while Adria detonates it.<eos> If the Ancients perceive this weapon as a threat, why not intervene and simply take it now?
How's it going, Sir?<eos> Longing for the days when I actually carried a weapon.<eos> - What do you got?<eos> - A crazy idea.<eos> I'm down with crazy.<eos> I like crazy.<eos> Crazy and I are like that!<eos> Cam likes crazy, too.<eos> Listen, if what Jackson is saying is true, there is an Ori ship out there with a near complete weapon on it that could prove useful against the Ori.<eos> - I think we should go after it.
Trust me.<eos> Why don't you trust me?<eos> I can't wear green. - It's not really green.<eos> - It's completely green!<eos> That's what's beautiful.<eos> Take it as a challenge.<eos> Overcome it.<eos> It's my body which refuses, not my mind. - I want you to. - But my body doesn't.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> Maybe I could dye it.
Before long, they were running and jumping all over having a gay old time.<eos> So the shepherd took some of the branches to the local monastery where the abbots decided to roast them.<eos> When the berries burned the beans inside gave off such a pleasant aroma they brewed them into a stew.<eos> Stew, huh?<eos> And over the next few hundred years, it spread to Arabia, Europe even Sumatra, like that hooch you got over there.<eos> It's called Kopi Luwak.<eos> I know what it's called.<eos> You do?<eos> Never catch me drinking that shit.<eos> Have you ever tried it?
-No worries.<eos> I'll give you my new address.<eos> Thanks.<eos> "My dear inspector... This time, that's it.<eos> Here I am,<eos> VIP Section, individual cell...<eos> For all the sex offenders, the "nonces", as they call them here.<eos> I have time to think about everything."<eos> "Sir... I don't know if you'll read this letter.<eos> Perhaps you'll you destroy it, recognizing who it comes from?
Thinking about many things at once.<eos> TIME TO DIE<eos> What's the use crying now?<eos> You should have come to visit your mother once a year.<eos> Not like my son. He visits me.<eos> Twice a year.<eos> He won't cry.<eos> Ms Aniela!<eos> I won't be taking the piano.<eos> Maybe you want to buy it?
To explain that we will not sell the house.<eos> Because you are moving here.<eos> I don't want to live here!<eos> Mum was right, you are a witch!<eos> If I'm rich, I will have many admirers!<eos> I'm 8, and you're old.<eos> Old croak. You are absolutely right.<eos> An old witch, just like your mother says.<eos> But you would like the ring, wouldn't you?<eos> You'll let me have it?
An old witch, just like your mother says.<eos> But you would like the ring, wouldn't you?<eos> You'll let me have it?<eos> Really, Grams?<eos> Give it...<eos> It's "Grandma", not "Grams".<eos> Remember that.<eos> Will you remember that?<eos> I will, I will...<eos> So will you give it to me, Grams?
I don't know how to work.<eos> Transmitting the Voice of the Tarahumara Sierra, XETAR.<eos> With one thousand watts of power, at 870 AM.<eos> From Wachochi, Chihuahua, México.<eos> XETAR brings you the Sierra Messenger.<eos> It's eleven thirty four.<eos> And now, the Sierra Messenger for today Thursday.<eos> Let's start with a message for Cristóbal Nevarez at the Okochochi ranch, ejido San Ignacio de Arareko.<eos> We need medicine from town.<eos> Please bring it to the canyon.
Let's do Dean's first, shall we?<eos> OK.<eos> "To Dad, get well soon."<eos> That's all he's written.<eos> Never think he was hoping to go to university, would you?<eos> Monosyllabic 17-year-old what do you expect?<eos> Um, Joel's done his own card.<eos> Oh, he's done a picture of a heart.<eos> No, it's not a heart, yes, brain... it's brain.<eos> And he's coloured it in, look!
Unless, of course, I'm enjoying myself too much to remember.<eos> I thought it might look well with William's cross.<eos> This is beautiful.<eos> - How can I ever thank you?<eos> - Oh... by accepting it for what it is.<eos> A token of love from one of your oldest friends.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Miss Crawford has also sent me a necklace.<eos> Miss Crawford has given you a necklace?<eos> Then, my dear, Fanny, you must wear it.
For us it's very important to reduce the elements we use.<eos> When it comes to type, we will only use, if possible, one typeface, or two, and if possible we will use one size.<eos> We don't like humanistic typefaces for example, it must be more rational because otherwise it has too much expression.<eos> We think that Helvetica contains somehow a design program.<eos> It will lead you to a certain language also, and this is also one of the secrets of the success of Helvetica that in itself it is already it has a certain style, a certain aesthetic that you will just use it like that, because of the typeface, because the typeface wants it like that.<eos> You will do what the typeface wants you to do.<eos> If you are not a good designer, or if you are not a designer, just use Helvetica Bold in one size, like for a flyer... itlooksgood.<eos> So it may very well be that when it comes to trends, at least in graphic design, we've reached sort of the end of history.<eos> The pendulum that swings back and forth doesn't have any more directions it can swing in.<eos> The final trend may simply be the completely democratic distribution of the means of production to anyone who wants it or anyone who can afford it.
- I shouldn't have done it.<eos> - What's that?<eos> I cursed my own children, Pullo.<eos> It wasn't their fault.<eos> Don't worry, they'll be back.<eos> You can lift the curse then, no trouble.<eos> You didn't kill an animal on it, did you? - No.<eos> - There you go, then.<eos> The curse isn't sealed.<eos> And when they come back, you can lift it.
Now!<eos> Now!<eos> - What happens?<eos> - Continue to dance.<eos> - We'll take care.<eos> - To the other room.<eos> Bring some water.<eos> Where are you, Arkan?<eos> Arkan ...<eos> Look at that mirror ... .. you could assign it to us, for our room.
You become a slave to sin.<eos> You need strength and the Lord's help to return to the path.<eos> I have to go now.<eos> Finish your coffee.<eos> Finish your coffee. I told Mom I wouldn't be long.<eos> May I bring you a poem I wrote?<eos> You don't have to read it straight away.<eos> - OK.<eos> You're all wet, you little slut.<eos> I am. - Go ahead, take it!
You should ask for more work.<eos> Your elegance is equal to your charms.<eos> The river.<eos> The necklace, I don't have it anymore.<eos> It is not possible.<eos> We will find it!<eos> Are you sure you had it when you left the bal?<eos> If you hadn't fallen asleep on that bench, you'd have seen it.<eos> I will trace our steps back to the ministry.<eos> You must have lost it in the street.
For a firm order with a deposit...<eos> I will sell it to you for... 36 000.<eos> May I discuss this with my wife?<eos> Please, take your time.<eos> Let's see, we have the 16 000 from my father's heritage.<eos> We still have 20 000 more to find.<eos> We have friends, relations, they will help us. And then you work more.<eos> Sir, I think we'll do business.<eos> I told you earlier that this jewel was gone.<eos> If we find it again, may we return the one you are about to buy?
Hello Jeanne.<eos> I'm sorry Mme, but you must be mistaken.<eos> I am Mathilde Loisel.<eos> Mathilde!<eos> How changed you are!<eos> Mommy, can I have a boat?<eos> Go choose it, honey, I'm coming.<eos> I had many hard days and lots of misery. All because of your diamond necklace.<eos> What?<eos> You had lent it to me and I lost it.

So you have to conceal your true self, far enough so they can't see you, but not so far as you can't come back.<eos> Is that what happened to you?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> But it did contribute.<eos> I want you to close your eyes.<eos> Now, open again.<eos> Right now, you're an angel inside of a human form.<eos> What we're trying to do is hide that fact.<eos> So, to everyone out there, you're completely human.<eos> I want you to search inside, focus on your spiritual self, connect and feel it as a whole.
- I don't know, sir.<eos> Forget about it. It happens all the time.<eos> The other day, someone stole a radio...<eos> Are you guys insane?<eos> Stealing gets you court-martialled!<eos> - Yeah... right!<eos> - Are you listening to me? Jesus!<eos> If the cops had any brains, they'd never let someone like Neto be in charge of the auto shop.<eos> Neto was just like me.<eos> Once he got a mission, he wouldn't give up on it.
Goodbye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> In the name of the people I pronounce the following judgment the appeal against the ruling by the Administrative Court of April 18. 2007, is rejected.<eos> Court fees will not be charged.<eos> The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the proceedings.<eos> You may be seated.<eos> Ms. Ozturk your appeal was bound to fail.<eos> The Administrative Court rightly rejected your claim to be acknowledged as entitled to asylum.<eos> In line with the Constitution, The right of asylum shall be granted. to anyone who is persecuted on grounds of his or her religion, race, nationality adherence to a social group or political convictions and fears danger to body and soul or restrictions to his or her own freedom.<eos> Where have you hidden it?
Fine. Then show me.<eos> I've been in this damn hospital room for two weeks, waiting for something to happen.<eos> I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and watch my brother die.<eos> Take me to the artist.<eos> I want to see what's worth all this.<eos> I love you, man.<eos> There.<eos> Okay, your first mistake?<eos> Never put the peanut butter in the refrigerator.<eos> Mom always keeps it at room temperature.
Stop relying on his answers and find some on your own.<eos> It's a deep-vein thrombosis.<eos> The kid spent 16 hours in the back seat of an old pick-up.<eos> Causes a clot, makes its way to his lungs.<eos> We should do an arteriogram, find the clot, bust it with TPA.<eos> Or we can find the leak.<eos> There's no leak.<eos> Hey, you can't yell at a guy in a wheelchair.<eos> This is a slow leak.<eos> You've got to speed it up.
Well, I'm off to astronomy.<eos> - Did you see the Lampoon yet?<eos> - Unh-Unh.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Don't tell me they actually wrote something funny in there.<eos> Better, the Hearst Lampoon offices got egged the night after dean O'Dell reinstated the greeks.<eos> See, that's where the egg was launched at the Pi Sig Party by unknown persons, read "The Lilith House girls. "<eos> I can't believe how dumb these people are, you know?<eos> They're mad at the dean, so they egg his window,<eos> Like he's the one who has to clean it up.
Pullo, you've had no water in two days.<eos> You need to drink something.<eos> Mascius looked in.<eos> Cut up nasty.<eos> Drink.<eos> Gold got stolen, did it?<eos> All but Mascius and Zeno are dead.<eos> Don't you worry about it.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll get it back.
- And this?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Burn it.<eos> Wipe your arse with it. I really don't care.<eos> Well, well.<eos> Lucius Vorenus.<eos> You found my gold yet?<eos> - I know where it is.<eos> - And?<eos> Titus Pullo will retrieve it.
I was as a wife to him.<eos> - I amuse you.<eos> - Forgive me.<eos> It's an odd thought.<eos> A Roman consul with a 'Gyptian wife.<eos> - Wouldn't do, you know?<eos> - I fail to see why.<eos> I believe we may begin negotiations.<eos> Here is the text of our proposal.<eos> We would read it into the Senate record.
The hot dog water's going to push us into the fan!<eos> And I just sharpened those blades.<eos> Bart, I've got an idea.<eos> As you're dying, jam the blades with your spine.<eos> Keep pitching. I'll be back.<eos> Look!<eos> A window to a child's watery grave!<eos> Don't worry, I'll free the boy.<eos> Damn it! This glass is bulletproof.<eos> There's nothing that can shatter it.
Hey, hold on...<eos> What's this place?<eos> My place.<eos> The place I used to live.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> Wow!<eos> You can use it.<eos> Since you can't play at night - you can come here to practise at night.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm not giving it to you, just lending it to your till your audition.
I wanted you to meet your son, Blake.<eos> I was gonna name him Eli, after my father.<eos> They deserve to die... suffer... horribly... and then die.<eos> They should all die... just... that way.<eos> They did.<eos> They all did.<eos> If I'd known, I would have come back.<eos> You know that.<eos> What happened to your ring?<eos> I lost it.
Good, that's just What I needed.<eos> We can imagine.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You can't really imagine it.<eos> It's just a manner of speaking.<eos> You know, even if I wasn't there, I was devastated by What you went through.<eos> - You got my note?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Thank you. You're welcome.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd get it from Tangiers.
We've won.<eos> An AT-Field?<eos> It's pointless.<eos> Unless the AT Field is breached you can't do anything to an Angel.<eos> Left arm restored!<eos> Amazing!<eos> Unit 01 has also raised an AT-Field!<eos> Angel phase space is being neutralized.<eos> No.<eos> It's corroding it.
Why do you need makeup in the mountains ?<eos> Why are you growing your hair out ?<eos> Before, my hair was short, and the police knew that so<eos> I decided ti grow it in order to do underground activities.<eos> If that's the case, why not just use a wig ?<eos> I think there's another reason.<eos> What is it ?<eos> Toyama, why don't you take you your ring ?<eos> It's important.<eos> My mom gave it to me.
I love boyfriends.<eos> Let's find him.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What's this? Hmm?<eos> What do you got?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The price is in Euros.<eos> She brought it back with her.<eos> Uh, where's the wine?<eos> Probably drank it.
We'll tell him you're with me.<eos> And that you're just gonna watch.<eos> All right, when we get there, be careful.<eos> You can't get your fingerprints on anything.<eos> Yeah, that would be funny.<eos> 'Cause then you'd have to arrest me.<eos> See anything?<eos> Nothing much. Captain!<eos> Murder weapon.<eos> Boys found it under the stove.
Friends can be boys or girls.<eos> Why don't we ask Mr. Harris what he meant?<eos> Fine, we'll ask him first thing in the morning.<eos> In the morning?<eos> Good. I can wear my new shirt.<eos> Okay, you're embarrassing yourself.<eos> Hey, Mushroom.<eos> Not cool.<eos> I have made a decision.<eos> And I second it.
She was heldfor three months while she was questioned.<eos> Her arms bear the scars of those questions.<eos> So I assure you, najeev,I am not confus.<eos> My name is not najeev.<eos> I am sayid jarrah.<eos> I wasin the republican guard, and, yes, I was an interrogator,but I have never seen your wife.<eos> Maybe she saw meat the same facility, but I do not know her!<eos> I can remember every face of every personI've interrogated.<eos> She remembers your face.<eos> She remembers it so well that she recognized it from a mere glimpse when we walked by the restaurantwhere you worked!
We're gonna need another plan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stop dialing.<eos> It's not working.<eos> Sir.<eos> You two give us a minute.<eos> What can I do for you, John ?<eos> We need to head back to the Replicator planet. We do, do we ?<eos> If this satellite weapon is powered by its home world maybe we can neutralize it at the source.
Mom fell and she blacked out. I called 911...<eos> What happened to her?<eos> I came home and she didn't even know who I was.<eos> She didn't even remember Mr. Muggles.<eos> I'm coming home right away.<eos> Claude'll have to wait.<eos> - Matt, where are you?<eos> - Hey, what's up?<eos> The ring.<eos> I took it to get resized, and the jeweler told me it was worth $40,000.

Disgusting.<eos> You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?<eos> It was probably Carla's.<eos> Her face was a train wreck.<eos> I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.<eos> Thank you, Marshall.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Why is that still in your apartment?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just never threw it out.
Gloria, you are gonna love this one.<eos> I think we have finally found the perfect dress.<eos> It's nice, but I don't like the bow.<eos> Let's try more.<eos> We've tried on six dresses already.<eos> She's fine with this.<eos> Right, Lily?<eos> I don't care.<eos> See?<eos> She loves it.
Yes, the interview. Exactly.<eos> Follow me.<eos> He's been waiting for you.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> This is in case the interview doesn't go well.<eos> Just joking.<eos> I was doing a little hunting.<eos> All right, so you're here from the agency.<eos> - Where's your resume?<eos> - I lost it.
I can't believe you Just said it.<eos> Neither can I.<eos> - Oh, I love you too.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - Now we can go to Berkeley together.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I got into Berkeley.<eos> I applied and I got this letter and I put it on my desk, and...
- Nice to meet you, Mia.<eos> Likewise.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Sure.<eos> Did you... see that movie?<eos> And what did you think?<eos> - Honestly?<eos> - Yes, brutal truth.<eos> It really sucked.<eos> The director ruined it, he should be shot.
Mum can lend us two.<eos> I need some more Washer fluid.<eos> - With me, you say'?<eos> - The test...<eos> Okay. But I don't understand.<eos> - Could I send it to you'?<eos> - We'd like to take it now.<eos> - You did have the test here'?<eos> - Yes, I must have misplaced it.<eos> - Did you read it'?
- Do you get time for research? - I spend a lot of time on it.<eos> What's your subject?<eos> Developmental language.<eos> The dynamics are interesting.<eos> Words like ciabatta were unknown some years back.<eos> But French bread...<eos> Rather than talk about bread, look for that essay.<eos> Yes, it must be here somewhere.<eos> No...<eos> - Did you throw it out?
Sorry.<eos> Did I startle you?<eos> I thought you lived on the other side of town, sir.<eos> Needed some air.<eos> Clear the head.<eos> I don't take the accusation of corruption lightly.<eos> I value my reputation.<eos> I've worked a long time for it.<eos> I know that.<eos> But there's been an allegation and I have a duty to investigate it.
I've been honest but I had to hear this from others.<eos> Why did you tell your administration to withhold Kemal's file?<eos> We should have all the files.<eos> Why didn't we get his?<eos> This is the first I've heard of it.<eos> But how did it happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It doesn't look good.<eos> I don't know why neither of us got it.<eos> You'll get it now.
Did you hear him?<eos> Sim.<eos> I got another call from Tom's parents.<eos> When?<eos> I had my cell on vibrate at the desk.<eos> I just called them back.<eos> They got a call from the parents of another guy in the unit.<eos> They haven't gotten a check-in either.<eos> -I have the worst feeling about this.<eos> -Then keep it to yourself.
Want to go in?<eos> –What do you think?<eos> –That my butt is frozen.<eos> But it's worth it for this gyros.<eos> –Cheers.<eos> –Cheers.<eos> What?<eos> I want ice cream.<eos> You want ice cream.<eos> I didn't know we were going to steal it.
How did you know that?<eos> Guys, guys, guys, guys, we came here to play cards.<eos> - Why are we talking about jewelry?<eos> - Sorry, Tom. But I found out I bought a ring for Susan myself.<eos> It was in my pocket that night some son of a bitch ran me over.<eos> Tom's right.<eos> We should focus on the game.<eos> After our talk, I called the hospital.<eos> They said my ring got in with your wife's stuff.<eos> So you saw it before I did, the same day you proposed to Susan.
Deal.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Mr. Scavo? It's Lamar from the limo service.<eos> Um, I got a flat, so I might be late picking up you and your wife.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I canceled you.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> I left you a message.<eos> Oh, I must have missed it.
Hello.<eos> I love your dress.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - It's one of a kind, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Couture.<eos> Andare?<eos> Wow. Good eye.<eos> Well, I do have an unfair advantage.<eos> I bought it.
keep your mouth shut.<eos> where doou get electricity?<eos> we have two giant hamsters running on a massive wheel at our secre underground lair.<eos> yeah, that's funny. there's leftovers in the refrigerator. help yourself.<eos> i ate most of the dark meat. sorry.<eos> i never really appreciated chicken until right now.<eos> i know you think you need to do this, john, but if you blow up my submarine, i'll have a big problem with my people.<eos> is that supposed to be an incentive not to blow it up?<eos> i was born on this island. not many of my people can say that. most of them were recruited and brought here.<eos> and as much as they love this place, as much as they would do anything to defend it, they need to know they can leave if they want to.
I mean, for God's sake, if I've known back then that you were just gonna go ahead and give up, I would have saved myself a huge hassle, smothered you with a pillow and spent all my extra time catching up on Noobie's pathetic blog.<eos> Oh,myGod,hereferencedme in a tough love speech.<eos> Stop smiling!<eos> You don't owe anything to yourself, but... you damn sure owe to each one of us.<eos> All right, then.<eos> I'll call him.<eos> Brrrr! Ahhhh! Damn crap!<eos> You think that's funny?<eos> Making me kill that helpless little animal?<eos> If you didn't wanna hold it for me you could have put it on the counter.
Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I don't have my vows.<eos> I don't have mine either.<eos> You don't need your vows.<eos> Just say why you love each other.<eos> Okay, I'll go first.<eos> Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you.<eos> You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick.<eos> You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me.
Find!<eos> My God, they hid it under the stage? !<eos> No wait, look.<eos> How much money do we have to waste on needless spending when we should be focusing all our attention on... on the education of all--<eos> Whoa, there, girl.<eos> On the education of all children. Oh, I declare!<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...<eos> Mr. Thompson, that kid who called in the warning was right!<eos> We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... - Well, in her...
I'm going to find out where it is!<eos> All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find these terrorists.<eos> Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL.<eos> Ask Jeeves?<eos> Nobody uses Ask Jeeves!<eos> Just Google-search it!<eos> Are you telling me how to do my job?<eos> Yes.<eos> There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.<eos> Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!
- What about it?<eos> - Do you think they could really do it?<eos> Um...<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, I don't think they can really do it.<eos> You understand, these are mythic creatures.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I know. I know.<eos> But, uh, I mean, in the stories.<eos> You know, say you had a wish, uh, but you never even said it out loud.
-Sounds like a plan to me.<eos> -God, it's always that simple with you.<eos> Excuse me, Mrs Woman.<eos> Well, Sam's trying to work this thing out, and the rest of us... we charge in like a herd of elephants.<eos> Details are what count.<eos> And I'm wondering, or I'm starting to wonder, looking at Charley's files, whether we've really put down all the details.<eos> We had a child-killer to find.<eos> And we found him.<eos> Inside of 48 hours.<eos> Now, I made a pledge to her parents and I honoured it.
I think he's dying.<eos> Back away!<eos> No, papa!<eos> Papa, no!<eos> we got him.<eos> No bullets!<eos> It's inside him.<eos> We need the man alive.<eos> The entity can't survive out of the human body.<eos> I want you to check the eyes of every man, woman, and child until you find it.
Not a bad test run.<eos> Get some fresh guards.<eos> I want to see him do it again.<eos> Smallville Season 06 Episode 21<eos> We have about a dozen people that could do that for you.<eos> Next thing you know, they'll be brushing my teeth for me.<eos> There are some things I'd rather do on my own.<eos> Independent and not afraid to get her hands dirty -- two of the billion or so reasons I fell in love with you.<eos> The shoulder's just still a little bit sore.<eos> Maybe we should have the doctor look at it again.
We gotta test for Mycobacteria, leptospirosis.<eos> - When did you drink the water?<eos> - Last summer?<eos> You sure?<eos> You haven't even taken a sip to cool off?<eos> It was really gross.<eos> My shoulder's bugging me.<eos> Does that matter?<eos> It could.<eos> Did you do anything to hurt it?
Hey, I know!<eos> Let's all pee in her empty eye socket!<eos> Let's make her eat her own eyeball and then pee in her empty eye socket.<eos> How about we get someone with AIDS to pee in her eye socket so she dies all slowly? Yeah!<eos> Nobody hear has AIDS!<eos> But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eye socket!<eos> Now, don't be down, y'all. I bet we can find some AIDS down the forest.<eos> Run, run, run! Alright, men.<eos> We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird.<eos> If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control.
Herr Broloff, what do you know of this?<eos> It's true, I'm afraid.<eos> You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap.<eos> I took it back in 1960.<eos> It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken.<eos> Poppa, no!<eos> Say nothing more!<eos> Come to me, my darling precious child.<eos> After I had broken the record, I took the crap home.<eos> I was so proud of it that I decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child.
You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Okay, good, I'm wrong.<eos> Maybe if you did pick up something like that, Maybe it's because I warelieved... that it was him and not you.<eos> Well, don't feel bad about that.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> To be going down to the hospital again At 2:00 in the morning?<eos> And you know what?<eos> When you were shot, It was Christopher who held me.<eos> You know the baby's car seat?<eos> A giant tree branch came through the window And demolished it.
- About what?<eos> Don't tell me the fuckin' checks are late?<eos> There ain't any checks.<eos> - The fuck you talkin' about?<eos> - Silvio... Mr. Soprano's guy...<eos> Came by this morning, said to pull your jobs.<eos> - Whoa whoa whoa.<eos> - Fuck that.<eos> - Where's our money?<eos> - I don't got it, there's no jobs.
Surely Your Eminence is aware that His Majesty had carnal relations with Anne's older sister, Mary.<eos> Perhaps even with their mother.<eos> So it is rumoured. I give it no credence. With regard to the mother.<eos> And the second document.<eos> Have you read it?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Just as well. I wouldn't like to be the man that has to present this to the descendant of Saint Peter.<eos> It asks this: " If no way can be found to nullify the king's marriage then the Pope should allow him to take a second wife."<eos> Do you understand? He's asking the Pope to sanction bigamy.<eos> Since the king commands it, you must be on your way, Dr. Knight.
The man then kicked Mr. Satoyama in the abdomen... sending him hard to the ground.<eos> The back of Mr. Satoyama's head struck a concrete curb.<eos> The assailant fled the scene.<eos> A woman, Setsuko Kashiwagi, witnessed the incident.<eos> An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later.<eos> Mr. Satoyama's heart stopped once in the ambulance.<eos> He reached the hospital 22 minutes after the witness' call.<eos> Four doctors and 7 nurses worked to save him.<eos> But Mr. Satoyama's skull had been caved in... with massive cerebral hemorrhaging.<eos> Mr. Satoyama's heart stopped a second time but doctors revived it.
It was her father's and his father before that...<eos> And it's a family heirloom, and that's why we named the band after Dexter bloody Stratton. I know.<eos> But Charlie, let's be honest.<eos> We both know I'm a sodding mess.<eos> But you, you're different.<eos> You're gonna get married, have a family, a baby.<eos> - l'll be lucky if I hit 30.<eos> - Don't say that, Li.<eos> The ring has to stay in the family, Charlie.<eos> So please, take it.

Don't.<eos> You'll get dizzy.<eos> You're just like a child.<eos> Come here. The helicopters were deployed to neutralise the militants' strengths.<eos> Their casualties are unknown but in Noragukh one woman was killed and seven wounded.<eos> How did you know you were pregnant?<eos> Well, you see...<eos> Wave your hand.<eos> I liked milk.<eos> Then, you know... like... I couldn't drink it, this milk.
New things.<eos> New properties.<eos> Totally unpredictable.<eos> Take the watch.<eos> - Useless, right?<eos> - The watch?<eos> Wristwatch.<eos> Cooks eggs.<eos> Nothing else, just eggs.<eos> Put an egg in the middle, hard-boils it.
- We get a thousand channels!<eos> Can you take the remote before my dad does?<eos> Wow.<eos> A universal remote?<eos> This is nice, guys.<eos> Really nice.<eos> We now return to A Scoundrel Among Us.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> We let you into our family, and you've deceived us.<eos> I gave you my heart, and you ripped it into a million pieces.
My landlady's son<eos> But tell me...<eos> Remember the letter.<eos> I told you, it was gobbledygook. It went...<eos> I'm your neighbor, a liar, blah blah...<eos> s number? what did he mean?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Neighbor, you're swell, but your friend rings my bell.<eos> Why doesn't he know you know he's your neighbor?<eos> He doesn't know I read it.

Know why?<eos> - Why? Because you're virtually fired, my sleepy man.<eos> And mother or not mother to cover your ass.<eos> The office is boring!<eos> You can't leave me here.<eos> - The stupid bitch!<eos> - Not stupid bitch!<eos> Okay, you don't know what happens between us.<eos> Nobody has a clue what happens and everybody has an opinion.<eos> Fuck that. I wrote her a letter in my dream and I never gave it to her.

I wrote her a letter in my dream and I never gave it to her.<eos> And she read it.<eos> I don't know how, but she somehow read it.<eos> And she just recited it to me just now.
Storm.<eos> They're announcing it now.<eos> These so-called mutants are people just like us.<eos> Their affliction is nothing more than a disease, a corruption of healthy cellular activity.<eos> But I stand here today to tell you that there's hope.<eos> This site, once the world's most famous prison, will now be the source of freedom for all mutants who choose it.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... I proudly present the answer to mutation.<eos> Finally, we have a cure.<eos> Who would want this cure?<eos> I mean, what kind of coward would take it just to fit in?
The Lord God has forsaken us.<eos> Excellency...<eos> There's no other explanation.<eos> All is misfortune.<eos> Casale should have been taken, Turin saved, Arras relieved, and the Catalans and Portuguese should never have rebelled against their king.<eos> This is the most wretched year the monarchy has ever seen.<eos> Excellency, the letter I sent you... Yes.<eos> The letter.<eos> The letter.<eos> I've read it.
- I found one.<eos> - Ooh, ooh, ooh. - Whoa. Who is that?<eos> Down, girl. You're drooling on my doormat.<eos> Oh, it's my next-door neighbor.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Shh.<eos> Antonio.<eos> - Oh, hey, Ashley.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Your dry cleaning was delivered while you were out, so I took it.
I wanna be a professional poker player when I'm older.<eos> Or a comedian.<eos> Max-a-million, ask me what is the most important thing in comedy.<eos> What is the most important thing in com...<eos> Timing.<eos> Timing.<eos> Have you tasted Dad's wine?<eos> Oh, yes, indeed.<eos> Bloody awful, isn't it?<eos> But I recommend it for getting the paint out from underneath your fingernails.
They're irreplaceable!<eos> Did you know Dad mixed a martini for Winston Churchill?<eos> He also danced a waltz with Amelia Earhart in 1975.<eos> Well, considering Amelia Earhart died in the 1930s, that's a perfect example of the type of exaggerator Uncle Henry was.<eos> You wanna know the real Uncle Henry?<eos> Not the one your overactive imagination's manufacturing?<eos> The real Henry Skinner was so afraid of committing to the real world, he retreated from life to drink and shag his way to a lonely, loveless end.<eos> Everything I need to know about my dad is right here.<eos> It's right in front of me.<eos> You know, and if this place meant as much to him as I believe it did, you're worse than I thought for even thinking about selling it.
Why didn't you tell me this before?<eos> Why didn't you trust me?<eos> Max, would you trust you?<eos> These vines, they are illegal.<eos> Your uncle always intended to leave the estate to you, but he worried about what you had become.<eos> "My nephew is selfish," he used to say.<eos> "How can I give this place to a man "who can't even appreciate the simple pleasures of life?"<eos> So it was never written.<eos> Alas, fate took him before he could decide what to do.<eos> I've already sold it.
You know what's weird?<eos> I've never even seen this McGorvey guy.<eos> - We did.<eos> - No, we didn't.<eos> Not you.<eos> Me and Brad.<eos> That day at the pool, remember?<eos> Yeah, I-I totally forgot.<eos> - Well, what happened?<eos> - Sexual tension is an elusive thing, but Kathy had pretty good radar for it.
- We did.<eos> - No, we didn't.<eos> Not you.<eos> Me and Brad.<eos> That day at the pool, remember?<eos> Yeah, I-I totally forgot.<eos> - Well, what happened?<eos> - Sexual tension is an elusive thing, but Kathy had pretty good radar for it.<eos> It was like someone had turned a knob a hair to the right, and the radio station clicked in so loud and clear it almost knocked her over.<eos> Once she became aware of the connection between them, it seemed impossible that she'd missed it before.
You really look beautiful.<eos> -Yes, you do. -Thank you.<eos> -You really do. -Thank you.<eos> Pull up a chair, Matthew.<eos> Glad you decided to join us, Matthew.<eos> Could you maybe just...<eos> Thank you so much, Chef Didier.<eos> No, you are my preferred guest and I have prepared a special menu just for you tonight. But I will make no substitutions.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We will have your special menu exactly the way you make it.
-Tommy?<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -May I have a word with you?<eos> -One second.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> -It's my ring.<eos> I put it there. -It's gotta be here.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> We'll find it.
In her last days, she became whole.<eos> She saw her...<eos> Tommy?<eos> -Tommy.<eos> -Just stop it!<eos> Death is a disease.<eos> It's like any other.<eos> And there's a cure.<eos> A cure.<eos> And I will find it.
- Get back to your room.<eos> - It's all right, Mother.<eos> This is for you.<eos> My composition.<eos> - What have you done to it? - Made some notes.<eos> Look, I've even marked the good passages.<eos> - It's a mess.<eos> - But it has promise.<eos> I told you, it has promise.<eos> Let me develop it with you.
Frits is at the top of his class.<eos> Should he go to special class, then?<eos> This is a disciplinary matter. Not an academic one.<eos> What disciplinary problems?<eos> Several teachers report that Frits causes trouble in their classes.<eos> Who?<eos> Perhaps Mr Johansen should consider moving his son to another school.<eos> Here's what I have considered.<eos> The school laws state that parents be consulted regarding special class.<eos> You don't have our consent and you'll never get it!
Never mind him.<eos> Stop!<eos> You bastard!<eos> What did that idiot follow me for?<eos> He doesn't suit you at all.<eos> I'm your enemy!<eos> Don't shoot her!<eos> Know how long I've waited to give her this necklace?<eos> Damn, where's the necklace?<eos> I lost it again, damn it!
You know where to find me.<eos> You know, I've had a bit of a shady past.<eos> Oh, really? -I was married for 1 5 years.<eos> -Arrest this woman now.<eos> He was a very nice man.<eos> But I had affairs.<eos> I like the candies and the flowers, the teabags bit.<eos> I'm just not good at the day-to-day stuff, you know.<eos> I'm a selfish woman and I broke his heart.<eos> Made a real mess of it, actually.
When words spread of a new dragonrider... we were expecting someone who was more.... well...<eos> - More than me...<eos> I've heard it before.<eos> Your armor is ready for you.<eos> We must prepare for battle.<eos> It's not as easy... as it looks. Is it?<eos> You look... fit for battle!<eos> Be strong, Eragon.<eos> The search for a rider has been long and dangerous.<eos> Some of us... have carried the egg for as long as we can remember hoping it would hatch. And fate... finally carried it to you.
Let me out!<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> Time to return the favour!<eos> Come!<eos> Taste the blood of your dragon!<eos> Let's finish this!<eos> What is that thing?<eos> - Dark magic.<eos> Closer, so we can reach his heart.<eos> - This time, rip it out of his chest.
Yeah.<eos> That's what you look like when you smile, huh?<eos> You was probably drinking then too.<eos> There's the lady.<eos> Redhead. She cute. That ain't bad.<eos> Hey, man. Come on, don't be stopping to get high or nothing like that.<eos> Man, we gotta go.<eos> Make sure you lift the seat up before you go.<eos> It's up already.<eos> Maybe you left it like that, huh?
I can't explain it, but... It was amazing.<eos> Because it was like I was finally seeing the person. I'd been waiting for my entire life.<eos> Oh my God! That's so romantic!<eos> So when do I get to meet him?<eos> Right after I do?<eos> - What? - Well...<eos> We didn't actually meet. Per se. As it were...<eos> But you know his name.<eos> Yes, it was on the Sotheby's catalogue.<eos> He dropped it and I picked it up.
Oh, the letter was just fine.<eos> Listen to this...<eos> "A Coconut Cove police cruiser... "was vandalized early Monday morning while parked at a construction site... "when an unknown prankster spray-painted the car's windows black...<eos> "There have been three incidents within in a week at this location... "the future home of Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House."<eos> Oh, we're getting a Mother Paula's here.<eos> That'll be nice.<eos> Hey, Dad, can I see the newspaper for a second? Mm-hmm.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You'll notice that your name wasn't mentioned.<eos> That's because we refused to release it to the media.
- Sorry.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Mr Hammond?<eos> Good morning, Detectives.<eos> Just like he planned.<eos> I got a court order here to open a safe deposit box.<eos> Number 392.<eos> STEVE-O: Oh, thank God.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I left it in there.
You sure about this?<eos> Fuck...<eos> Come on.<eos> Talk.<eos> I don't know why I didn't see the signs.<eos> I should've been there, done something.<eos> Sometimes, there aren't any signs.<eos> This was an intensely lonely young man. More than you can ever know.<eos> He was very skilled at hiding his loneliness.<eos> And when he couldn't hide it anymore, he hid himself.
Sean John and some Baby Phat.<eos> You going to like something, girl.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna let you all be.<eos> Where's your bathroom?<eos> I gotta shit.<eos> Girl, he's impossible sometimes.<eos> You know I don't play all that niggas all up in my house, taking shits...<eos> Hey, you know that I know.<eos> It's just he's got some moneys and he wants to spend it on me.
It's your birthday. Hmm?<eos> Oh, I wish I could celebrate with you tonight.<eos> I just have to go out of town for a few days.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes, I just have some business to take care of.<eos> But we'll celebrate when I get back, all right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you so much for the present.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I'll think about you whenever I wear it. (CHUCKLES)
That's the problem.<eos> Anyone else, I'd have gone to the police.<eos> An anarchist with a gun is a criminal.<eos> But a man can steal billions behind his desk!<eos> Your methods bother me, Constance.<eos> You're sinking to their level.<eos> You're lecturing me?<eos> Go to Russia, Mr Jaures. Go to see those tortured for talking too much.<eos> Tell them violence isn't the answer.<eos> That they must endure it but never use it themselves.
Much older looking since I last saw him...<eos> Don't lose heart, Soza<eos> Finding a man in Edo's sprawl is like winning the lottery<eos> It could take 10 years, no, 20...<eos> Hey, sis, another sake<eos> Patience...<eos> But he's the right height, right?<eos> I'll go over it once more so listen well<eos> Our shit fertilizes the rice paddies and fields<eos> That's why the farmer pays money to buy it from the rich landlord, who owns this tenement
Good point.<eos> You keep saying, "good point".<eos> Not good point, sir. True!<eos> To you, th-the Holocaust is just another topic on which we may or may not get a question.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> But this is history.<eos> Distance yourselves.<eos> Our perspective on the past alters.<eos> And looking back, immediately in front of us is dead ground - we don't see it.

So we're on for Lucifer's tonight?<eos> RENATO: Tonight's my volunteer night at the dog pound.<eos> - I'll see you later. BUDD Y:<eos> All right.<eos> [SINGING] [BELL RINGS]<eos> Buon giorno, Shannon.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> You've gotta help me, Renato.<eos> Angelo wants me to make some aglio olio.<eos> If you're gonna make it, you're gonna have to learn how to pronounce it first.
Obviously, I could use this tool of mine.<eos> It's called... a revolver.<eos> It's unsealed lots of lips. Of both men and women.<eos> You load it and unload it, like this.<eos> Load, unload.<eos> Load, unload.<eos> It's trustworthy.<eos> Hard. It can penetrate up to...<eos> I don't know what's in the envelope.<eos> A stranger asked me to give it to my uncle, King Farouk.
- No... yes.<eos> - Yes, he's a spy.<eos> He's working for Lemon. The reporter who forced me to bury you.<eos> You said I was cremated.<eos> That too.<eos> I hope you were well paid, because you've just said goodbye to a fortune.<eos> He's still one of your own kind.<eos> He could still break the curse...<eos> Max. I know... this face repulses you... and I wouldn't...<eos> I wouldn't dream of asking you to accept it.
You betrayed us the way you betrayed them.<eos> You fucking asshole!<eos> Okay, if you like, I'll take your verbal resignation right here, right now.<eos> Do you want your career to end here, now, like this?<eos> Your call.<eos> Now, I'm prepared to dismiss your behavior.<eos> And in light of what's happened,<eos> I understand it. I really do, and I'm truly sorry.<eos> But a decision has been made.<eos> And we're required to abide by it, regardless of our personal feelings. Feelings that might run contrary to the collective good.
Got any more crap comments, you two?<eos> Go ahead, just try me and see.<eos> Yes, sarge.<eos> Be careful! Patrick! Let's cut the crap for tonight.<eos> Settle down here.<eos> We'll wait for daylight to move on.<eos> You're lucky to live in Paris.<eos> To feel less isolated in this petty bourgeois town, I buy the Communist daily paper.<eos> I don't really understand it all yet.<eos> I think politics should reduce inequality rather than increase it.
We'll kill whoever wants to escape.<eos> Start thinking about your last request.<eos> Let's see.<eos> How about you, Gallego?<eos> What's your last request?<eos> I want...<eos> I'd like to call home.<eos> And you, Guillermo?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Will you grant it?
Fuck!<eos> See you later, sunshine.<eos> Yo, it's Verona.<eos> You won't believe this call I just got.<eos> It's gonna be all right, baby.<eos> But you said...<eos> - No, no.<eos> Things have changed.<eos> There's an antidote.<eos> I can make a deal for it, but I got to go alone.
A pleasure.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> All right, mate.<eos> Gentlemen, there is a forgotten word.<eos> No.<eos> An almost forbidden word.<eos> A word that means more to me than any other.<eos> That word is 'England'.<eos> Yes!<eos> Once, we flaunted it in the face of the world, like a banner.
Shall we walk or take the car?<eos> Let's walk!<eos> At least the video was cheap.<eos> Do you have to take it back today?
- What'd you get me?<eos> - Graduation gift.<eos> Is it a briefcase?<eos> Did I just ruin it?<eos> I ask because it's a typical gift.<eos> I don't mean boring, I mean basic.<eos> When I say basic, I don't mean boring, either.<eos> Open the box.<eos> - You bought me a pen.<eos> - It's a good one.
So who lives there now?<eos> A woman and her son.<eos> The kid is cute.<eos> No address in the Philippines...<eos> Just his son's phone number.<eos> - I can't accept this!<eos> - Please, you must.<eos> Thank you, then.<eos> That era has passed.<eos> Nothing that belonged to it exists any more.
I know one thing for sure. You gonna look pretty foolish... with two different shoes on your feet.<eos> Ah, Jesus.<eos> You got an answer for everything, don't you, Bagger ?<eos> There's no difference between winning and losing... and anything in between.<eos> What's lost is lost.<eos> A man lives. A man dies.<eos> And in the end it all turns out the same. You're alone.<eos> And that's all you're ever gonna be.<eos> Is that a fact ?<eos> Alone. So, a soul is born with everything that the Lord can give it, and things don't go its way, so it just gives up, and the good Lord takes everything back ?
That's what we're here for.<eos> A man should live out his life fully.<eos> Give form to every feeling and reality to every dream.<eos> Sitting there among her things, I was reminded I didn 't really know Emily at all.<eos> Though we'd lived together as man and wife, it was when I left the house when I was with Sara that I felt like I was home.<eos> WOMAN: University.<eos> - Chancellor, please.<eos> There's only one way to get rid of a temptation:<eos> Yield to it.<eos> Resist it and the soul longs for what it's forbidden to itself.
-Me neither. 'Cause we're too good together to let that come between us.<eos> -It was a mistake.<eos> -You think so?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -I think you're right.<eos> I think that we just got carried away in the moment and you know.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Last night was really special to me, because you're really special to me.<eos> But that's all it was. It was an incredibly special night.<eos> I got worried that maybe we'd give it more importance than we should.
We lose children, people, postmen and now even hoes.<eos> And nobody cares!<eos> Are you listening? Don't even touch that cabbage, understand?<eos> You know I won't let you go hungry.<eos> I always found you food, and I'll keep finding it.<eos> Cabbage will give you gas.<eos> No cabbage. It's not healthy.<eos> It'll give you a tummy ache.<eos> What's the matter with that girl?<eos> I'm cooking for a whole regiment and it's still not enough.
I was in my cell...<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> When I went back to the cell, I saw a ray of sunlight coming in the window.<eos> It was moving. It seemed to be looking for something.<eos> I said my prayers. And I was going to the chapter room when I realised my gold and diamond ring was missing.<eos> It was my mother who gave it to me on the day I became a nun.<eos> I looked for it everywhere, with no luck.<eos> Then I remembered an old tradition.<eos> It said that to find something that's missing, we have to undress, Iie on a bed and call the missing object like you call a lover.
Next time Dad gets a transfer, he'll have to go alone.<eos> No garbage today.<eos> Bring it tomorrow.<eos> No use building your body.<eos> Why?<eos> Godzilla will disappear in the black hole we make.<eos> Keep this.<eos> The signal bomb has a micro transmitter?<eos> I made it for you.<eos> When in danger, shoot it.
It's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.<eos> - Perhaps.<eos> - Two questions.<eos> Who the hell was Seti the First, and was he rich?<eos> He was the second pharaoh of the 19th dynasty, said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all.<eos> Good.<eos> I Iike this fellow.<eos> - I like him very much.<eos> - I've already dated the map.<eos> It's almost 3,000 years old.
I wonder if I might photograph you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Here by the piano?<eos> Goodbye, Mr. Wieck, a safe journey home.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Which way are you headed?<eos> To the Hotel Duna.<eos> Then we'll keep you company a bit.<eos> Mr. Aradi, your piece is wonderful.<eos> Do you have a title for it?
Yes, thank you.<eos> Was everything satisfactory, Mr. Mendel?<eos> I must tell you how happy I am that my sister insisted we come here.<eos> Your braised pike was sheer poetry.<eos> Maybe even better than Gundel's.<eos> Don't be angry, Mr. Szabo, but the best thing this evening was "Gloomy Sunday".<eos> It has the perfect balance of bitter and sweet.<eos> Does the song have lyrics?<eos> Not yet.<eos> It doesn't need words, it already speaks to me.
Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> It's breakfast.<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you no animals at all?<eos> Yes, we've got hens.<eos> And we have a cat.<eos> But it isn't called anything.<eos> It must be called something.<eos> You could think of a name for it.
- Four thousand.<eos> - What?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Next, Ed, this business of a $ 15 royalty for BASIC sold in every 4K Altair, it's just not acceptable.<eos> Let me tell you something, boy.<eos> This ain't the way I do business.<eos> And I especially don't like being dictated to by some little...<eos> Ed, Ed, this is not about dictating.<eos> You see, this is about reality.<eos> The reality is that your machine is brilliant, but it needs our language.
"lt looks like your mother..."<eos> When they crack your bones it goes, "Urgh!" and then, "Arrhhh."<eos> but not sort of, "Ahhh..." but sort of, "Arrrgh!"<eos> All the way up your spine.<eos> "Crack your bones."<eos> They arrange you into a nice, comfortable... Rrrah-CHAH!<eos> Rrra-poom! Sometimes it doesn't crack, it just goes...<eos> Then they pull a mallet from their belt and try to make the noise.<eos> "Make the noise, I live for the noise."<eos> They do your head as well, get it into a nice position.
- Later on, big remorse.<eos> - Now, I've found a spell that should reverse the soul transfer procedure immediately.<eos> Willow and I will perform it.<eos> Leaving Xander and me to help Buffy in the flesh.<eos> "Hear me, elders ofthe upper reaches." "Elders ofthe lower reaches.<eos> Elders ofthe dry land. Elders ofthe river flats."<eos> Do you mind?<eos> People are trying to study.<eos> "Ancients, I beseech you.<eos> The soul, abstracted, let it revert to its true seat."
- You're paying for the babysitter.<eos> - All right, done.<eos> - What am I, the dishwasher?<eos> - No, Dad.<eos> You were invited because, well, it just wouldn't be a party without you.<eos> Although there may be a few women here that are unattached, who might just take a shine to an old debonair dog like yourself.<eos> I'm just a piece of meat to you guys, aren't I?<eos> There goes that damn loose earring again.<eos> Thank goodness it didn't fall into the punch bowl.<eos> Don't want someone choking on it, do we?
Let's do this:<eos> Look down at the big seal in the middle of my carpet.<eos> Now, everybody look back up at me.<eos> Zoey's down from Hanover, and I'm making chili.<eos> - That's great!<eos> - Terrific!<eos> See how benevolent I can be when everybody does what I say?<eos> Now, sit down.<eos> I want this meeting to last three minutes.<eos> I will allow it to last no more than five.
I'm always honest with you, aren't I?<eos> And ifl seesomething that you desperately need help with, like... cooking... cleaning... the children... your hair, I care so much that I have to say something 'cause I want to help.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> You don't have to be worried, dear.<eos> I forgive you for today.<eos> And I'm always here to help.<eos> Voila.<eos> Ladies, whatever you went through today was worth it.<eos> An excellentmeal.<eos> I give it two buttons and a zip.

Who the hell's that?<eos> All right, Willie?<eos> Does it look like I'm all right?<eos> Take this.<eos> I'm in danger of breaking sweat at any second.<eos> Charles, why have we got that cage?<eos> Security?<eos> That's right.<eos> That's right, security.<eos> So what's the point in having it if we're not gonna fucking use it?

Just a detail.<eos> I've never seen a detail from a Bosch picture so large.<eos> It's huge.<eos> Perhaps, but it's my job.<eos> I've worked on that picture's detail for ten years.<eos> Ten years?<eos> Then you must know all about the picture.<eos> Absolutely all.<eos> For example, did you know it had healing powers?<eos> Sick people came to prostrate before it in the hope of a miraculous healing.
There are other bottoms than La Va_BAR_adon's!<eos> - Ain't that so, girls?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Was Suzanne there or not?<eos> It was a girl who looked like her.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Put down your brushes.<eos> I want you, little runt.<eos> Valadon, our love life is quite disappointing.<eos> It is time to end it.
We've got a lot to get through.<eos> I've gone for a word.<eos> Please God it's in there.<eos> Open up the Bard.<eos> Start fanning pages and stop anywhere.<eos> - Stab the pen down...<eos> - Twirl it, Adam.<eos> - Or we can't mix to the pre-record.<eos> - Right.<eos> Hold the pen up, spin it round and around...
They palm some animal tissue and a blood capsule and the rest of it's in the performance.<eos> I assume a small fee was involved?<eos> Well...<eos> A donation to their hospital, obviously.<eos> But you can't write off the rest of it.<eos> What kind of man leaves no footprints in the snow?<eos> So before your cousin came, your mother was fine?<eos> Which does make her death look a bit dodgy.<eos> Well, except... You've got the suicide note.<eos> Presuming that's what it is.
- They do?<eos> Don't do anything against her consent but you must be aggressive. - That disconcerts me.<eos> Grab her hand.<eos> Squeeze her neck.<eos> Half massage, half "you belong to me."<eos> Sometimes hold them by the shoulders.<eos> They need to feel dominated.<eos> The body talks. You're mine.<eos> You feel my dominion.<eos> You want to surrender to it.
Very Juice Newton.<eos> - You fancy it?<eos> - Yeah, but the store's closed.<eos> Ripper, that was so brave.<eos> Hold it!<eos> This is great.<eos> Let's do doughnuts in the football field, huh?<eos> Oh, my God, look out!<eos> Copper's got a gun.<eos> - You'll never use it, though, mate.
A pain.<eos> - A free spirit.<eos> - A handful.<eos> A Warren.<eos> It's a family trait.<eos> So are the short tempers, the great cheekbones, the strong wills and, of course, the powers.<eos> All blessings.<eos> All signs of where you came from.<eos> This book is your connection.<eos> And it began with me.

How old is he?<eos> Too old to be having a birthday party for his dog.<eos> Can I interest you in a drink?<eos> I've just opened a bottle of Côte de Brouilly.<eos> You've been saving it.<eos> Bourgogne hasn't made a decent Beaujolais in years.<eos> Do you hear that, Niles?<eos> Our Caitlin is a fellow oenophile.<eos> When I was little, my father owned a vineyard.<eos> I would open a can of Hawaiian Punch and let it breathe.
I mean, if you want to get married, it's to have kids, right?<eos> Not with someone older than 35, 'cause you have to have kids right away... and that's about it.<eos> I think these women should just forget about marriage... and have a good time.<eos> I have a friend who'd always gone out with extremely sexy guys... and just had a good time. One day she woke up, and she was 41.<eos> She couldn't get any more dates. She had a complete physical breakdown... couldn't hold her job and moved back to Wisconsin to live with her mother.<eos> Trust me-- this is not a story that makes men feel bad.<eos> Most men are threatened by successful women.<eos> If you want to get these guys, you have to keep your mouth shut... and play by the rules.<eos> I totally believe that love conquers all.<eos> Sometimes you just have to give it a little space... and that's exactly what's missing in Manhattan-- the space for romance.
Prophet, hear me.<eos> I am the Kai of Bajor.<eos> I offer myself to you as your humble servant.<eos> I await their vessel.<eos> Speak to me.<eos> Tell me what I should do.<eos> - We're evacuating.<eos> - You can't be serious.<eos> This battle could destroy the station.<eos> - Don't let it be fought here.

What's up, fellas?<eos> Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your own fuckin' house.<eos> That's fuckin' filthy.<eos> I don't have a V.C.R. in my house.<eos> Come on. Not in my glove.<eos> I didn't use the glove.<eos> That's my Little League glove.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I mean, what's wrong with you? You'll hump a baseball glove?<eos> L-I just used it for cleanup.
Look at you!<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Look at you.<eos> Mommy and Daddy are home.<eos> Sorry. You're just fun to mess with.<eos> They rented your place furnished.<eos> jackie brought your personal things.<eos> They were gonna set you up in here.<eos> It's an extra room.<eos> I never use it.
The Scarsdale Yeomanry.<eos> Raised by Willoughby Parfitt.<eos> Parfitt?<eos> ! The barrow boy? !<eos> He has his own yeomanry?<eos> Isn't that the height of pretension?<eos> He proposed to me once, you know?<eos> Regretfully, I could not accept.<eos> Just think...<eos> If I had, I could have raised my own yeomanry and got you to command it!
I'm living near here, in an inn, with Mirza.<eos> I've begun procedures to adopt him legally.<eos> If anything happens to me, he's got Clementina, Valerio and Colo.<eos> Colo told me the house is mine until I go to join you.<eos> The man is deafer and crazier than ever, but the truth is I need him.<eos> And he needs me.<eos> Bartolomé, the other boy, is expecting his parents any minute.<eos> He too wants to live in the house, which he calls "his home",. but there's very little I can do about that.<eos> The weather is still the same as ever and life, as you used to say, is a great complication which each person resolves in his own way.<eos> Mine is to let it go by, hoping it behaves well, and doesn't sweep away too quickly the little strength I have left.
The Secret Service will confirm that.<eos> It's not the illegal immigrant nanny thing?<eos> The girl's alleging...<eos> Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.<eos> Maybe we could say it was a drug reaction to the flu.<eos> Who's got the story?<eos> Don't you want to know if it's true?<eos> What's the difference?<eos> It's a story.<eos> They'll run with it.
Because at first he refused.<eos> We leave in two hours. Semyonov, you just get my boat back!<eos> We must get back by tomorrow morning.<eos> We need to get some scuba drivers. You must call your Finn in Finland, and tell him to open the shed.<eos> God, three days...<eos> Vodka is the unique invention of our people.<eos> It's not just a strong drink like any other.<eos> It's a nationality, a national character.<eos> It is what protects all of us from total disintegration, bearing in mind we are reasonable enough when consuming it.<eos> Our vodka uses natural, soft water, which, alongside with cereals, gives it a special taste.
But when I'm writing something, and I write perfectly straight, perfectly sober, and I write a whole lot of stuff, six, seven, eight, nine pages, and I'm really poured out...<eos> The next day...<eos> One hit!<eos> It's all I need now!<eos> One hit and it's punch-up time!<eos> Time to get this thing done!<eos> And you do find, with that sort of judicious use, I find there's some value in it!<eos> But most of the things we use, don't... let... You leave them alone!<eos> They don't!<eos> Pot does, thank it is for that!
Walk with me.<eos> Master may I ask a question?<eos> Will you make contact?<eos> No.<eos> The Council will be more determined now.<eos> I could override their decision but nothing would be served.<eos> Authority should never be used as a club, Delenn.<eos> - Then why?<eos> - When others do a foolish thing you should tell them it is a foolish thing.<eos> They can still continue to do it, but at least the truth is where it needs to be.
Flood it?<eos> -No.<eos> Look, you got to treat it right.<eos> You have to fiddle with it.<eos> Like the heater, you got to slide the thing all the way to cool first... and then really jam it back to heat.<eos> Trust me, I'm very good with machines.<eos> Still punching the dough, loser?<eos> Guess who I'm thinking about?<eos> You know, Frank, it's not just the heater.<eos> The mechanic seems to think it's going to need some major repairs.

She'll do this.<eos> I just hope you have better luck with women than I do.<eos> Come on, pick it up.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> I'm watching you on video.<eos> Behind you above the bulkhead.<eos> There you go.<eos> We met in the elevator.<eos> American soldiers are onboard ready to take over the plane.<eos> But there's a bomb, and a passenger is in control of it.
- Pee-wee franks.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> But out on the ocean, you can't order a pizza.<eos> You ever been fishing?<eos> What d'ya catch? - A whale.<eos> But I threw it back.<eos> Most people think fishing's a bamboo pole and a 6-pack of suds. But it's tougher than that.<eos> - Oh really.<eos> What about seasickness?<eos> Look, I can handle it.
And cute little puppy dogs<eos> These are the things that I've seen with my heart<eos> Life is a happy game if you don't forget to smile<eos> But every now and then your face<eos> Fuck!<eos> He's on the drug.<eos> It harbors a frown<eos> You suck!<eos> Sadness is a barnacle clinging to your bright boat<eos> You won't let it sink your spirits if you'll only learn to float
I thought there was a meeting.<eos> There is, but It doesn't start for another half an hour.<eos> I wanted a chance to talk to you alone.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Like I said the other day... we've been getting reports that Earthforce may have been infiltrated... by traitors right up to the command level.<eos> Any unusual behavior is to be reported and investigated.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> So the captain was gone for four days.<eos> Our records don't show any absence, but I checked the access panel in his quarters.<eos> It hasn't been used since Monday.
What goes up must come down.<eos> Seen one Sheridan, seen them all.<eos> Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.<eos> Shouldn't you be someplace where they can take care of you?<eos> Your injuries?<eos> Flesh is transitory.<eos> Flesh is a prison.<eos> Flesh is an instrument.<eos> Flesh can be replaced.<eos> And flesh does as it's told.
Perhaps it's that fella from England.<eos> He touched it and he grew a beard.<eos> Weird.<eos> That'd be enough to upgrade it to a Class I.<eos> Oh, Class I would be very rare.<eos> That'd be bringing people back to life... time travel, cloning dinosaurs...<eos> Very rare.<eos> There's millions of relics.<eos> How do they know which ones to do?<eos> Well, they have to think about the history of the relic, how many miracles can be attributed to it.
- I know.<eos> It's a museum!<eos> You' re the only who can make a joke?<eos> At least mine was funny.<eos> Waiter.<eos> We will have two lobsters and a menu.<eos> So, Dr. Greene, how's the old boat?<eos> They found rust.<eos> Do you know what rust does to a boat?<eos> Gives it a nice antique-y look?
I turned over control of the turbolift without verifying his code.<eos> They say to err is human.<eos> But you're not human, Odo.<eos> You're not even humanoid.<eos> And this is not the sort of mistake that I'd expect from you.<eos> I... was distracted.<eos> Distracted?<eos> A personal matter, sir.<eos> I'd prefer not to discuss it.<eos> Constable... whatever this personal matter is don't let it interfere with your job again.
I know exactly how you feel, but it's the truth.<eos> I find that difficult to believe.<eos> Admiral Leyton may be somewhat grating and inflexible at times but for a man of his accomplishments a man of his distinguished record to commit treason?<eos> I'm sure the Admiral doesn't see it as treason.<eos> He would probably defend it as a desperate act of patriotism.<eos> He and his supporters think that their actions are both necessary and justified.<eos> Not to mention effective.<eos> Think about it.<eos> The power grid fails and the next thing you know, Starfleet security officers are on the streets of every city, armed with phaser rifles blood testing citizens at random.<eos> Your story has a certain logic to it, gentlemen but what it lacks is proof.

It gives me an extraordinary pleasure, almost sensual.<eos> Because... just because.<eos> Filmmaking is a pleasure for me, but I don't take it very seriously.<eos> It's a playground for me, as when I was a child.<eos> I don't know and I don't want to know.<eos> Maybe it's just for the pleasure I get from it.<eos> It nearly reaches exultation when I am with the audience watching my films.<eos> I think it's some sort of obsession, obsession is when you've lost all rationality, when you can't express it so you go on filming to try and know why.<eos> So, I can't give any coherent answer.<eos> Never ask a centipede why it walks
Poor Weinrib!<eos> Turn back.<eos> Don't meddle any further.<eos> Accept the truth.<eos> I see disaster.<eos> I see catastrophe.<eos> Worse, I see lawyers.<eos> But wait, a messenger.<eos> I come from the midtown area where Lenny Weinrib, tortured by passions too overwhelming to regulate, did indeed call this little hustler on the phone... in earnest attempt to see her again.<eos> At first he wrestled with his drives, trying to master a curiosity... not slaked by this initial meeting, but only whetted by it.
Now, be a good chap and bugger off.<eos> C'est fini.<eos> Daccorod<eos> C'est bien.<eos> Oh... pardon.<eos> Très bien.<eos> Good sword, that.<eos> I'll have it when you're dead.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What were you going to do with it?
Donne-moi ça.<eos> Donne-moi ça, espèce d'abruti!<eos> Je le fais moi-même.<eos> Hey, my favorite English spy.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> What the devil are you doing here?<eos> I was looking for a book, Sir Henry.<eos> A book?<eos> What does a common soldier want with a book?<eos> Why, my lord, I was going to wipe my bum with it.

Where is he, Sergeant?<eos> Well, he's at Santa Maria too, sir.<eos> In charge of Sharpe.<eos> - He'll kill him, Sergeant.<eos> - I'm going to get him out, sir.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> - Why not? With respect, sir.<eos> - The British army needs every man it has.<eos> - The British army needs a lot of things, sir.<eos> But what it does need is Major Sharpe.
They're a prideful people, and the "Black Star" was their flagship.<eos> That's why it made a good target.<eos> How did you take her out?<eos> I've heard it was a new maneuver, but I've never heard the specifics.<eos> There wasn't much style or finesse involved.<eos> She was huge, monstrous.<eos> We tried everything, but none of our weapons would lock on to their ships.<eos> Some kind of stealth technology.<eos> So I hit on the idea of mining the asteroid field between Jupiter and Mars.<eos> A fusion bomb doesn't have to lock on to anything if it's close enough.
- Where am I?<eos> - lt's all right.<eos> You're safe.<eos> What have you done to me?<eos> We've brought you back home...to Cardassia.<eos> Please, we're here to help you.<eos> I don't know who you are or what you're trying to do, but it won't work.<eos> Whatever you think this is going to get you, you can forget it.<eos> We don't think it will get us anything.<eos> If all we wanted was information, we'd have it already.
He was trying to destroy me.<eos> I had to defend myself.<eos> Oh, my love.<eos> I would never harm you.<eos> I am here to protect you.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> There's no such thing as a ghost.<eos> You are some sort of anaphasic life-form.<eos> Anaphasic energy is extremely unstable.<eos> It needs an organic host in order to maintain molecular cohesion or else you'll die, isn't that right?

Major Lennox must answer.<eos> Major Lennox answered with his life, as you should have done, if you had any sense of honour!<eos> You lost the Colours of the King of England<eos> You disgraced us sir You shamed us sir<eos> You will answer<eos> The South Essex is stood down in name.<eos> If I wipe the name, I may wipe the shame.<eos> I am making you a battalion of detachments.<eos> You will fetch and carry<eos> The Light company put up a fight so I will let it stand under the command of a new captain.
In the refugee camps, we did whatever needed to be done.<eos> Didn't matter who you were.<eos> I was just talking with our good neighbour, Quark.<eos> He's laying odds that the government's going to fall.<eos> Quark knows a good bet when he hears one.<eos> This government will be gone in a week and so will you.<eos> What happens to Bajor then?<eos> Civil war.<eos> You think it's inevitable?<eos> The only one who can prevent it is Opaka.
So you don't speak any English at all?<eos> - English?<eos> No.<eos> - No.<eos> Hey, what are those bums doing back there?<eos> You said they could come and take the records.<eos> It's like watching a couple of hyenas going through the garbage.<eos> - You don't speak any English?<eos> - No English.<eos> I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body.
- Oh, cows?<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> - Yeah, that was when fascinating. ... I began my affair with Mohandas.<eos> - What?<eos> - Mohandas.<eos> Gandhi?<eos> The passion.<eos> The forbidden pleasure.<eos> You had an affair with Gandhi?<eos> He used to dip his bald head in oil and he'd rub it all over my body.
Oh, God! Get his gun!<eos> "Hundreds would die, but not the thing they died for.<eos> A man can stand up." Wow!<eos> Mm-hmm. If you'd like to learn more about colonial times... we could take a field trip to Olde Springfield Towne.<eos> D'oh!<eos> Dad! Everyone likes Whacking Day, but I hate it.<eos> - Is there something wrong with me?<eos> - Yes, honey.<eos> - Then what should I do?<eos> -Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball... and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle.

It's my support.<eos> I can't do anything today.<eos> You know, usually when I put on my blouse, it's like wearing a uniform, a shield between me and the world.<eos> It helps me focus, but today something's wrong.<eos> It's awful.<eos> Then I get the feeling I'II never make it.<eos> You didn't frame the painting.<eos> It's not finished.<eos> It's still a part of its surroundings.<eos> Framing it wouId rein it in, prevent it from finding its true form.
Excuse me.<eos> I'd like to order a drink, too.<eos> Whiskey, double.<eos> So, what are you doing now, Mabel?<eos> I sell bait.<eos> You have the most beautiful hair I've ever seen.<eos> Should I get it bobbed?<eos> No, not in a million years.<eos> 'The candle burns at both ends.<eos> It will not last the night.

No, I'm really into photography, not movies.<eos> But movies are photography, 24 times a second.<eos> Did I invite you over here to talk to me?<eos> When young, we mourn for one woman.<eos> As we grow old, for women in general.<eos> The tragedy of life... is that man is never free... yet strives for what can never be.<eos> The thing most feared in secret... always happens.<eos> My life, my loves, what are they now?<eos> But the more the pain grows... the more this instinct for life somehow asserts itself.<eos> The necessary beauty in life is in giving yourself to it completely.
Excuse me.<eos> Well, shit twice and fall back in it.<eos> God.<eos> Where'd you get the $6,600 in cash?<eos> A friend.<eos> We spoke with a gentleman today who says he delivered very close to that same amount to a Ms. Louise Sawyer.<eos> Do you know her, too?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, I believe she's the woman driving the car.<eos> He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.
Well, it's still standing.<eos> Almost by force of habit.<eos> Well, habit can provide a strong foundation.<eos> Dead Dog Farm, huh?<eos> That's an old legend.<eos> Of all the people in the world, the best and the worst are drawn to Dead Dog, and most turn away.<eos> Only those with the purest of heart can feel its pain.<eos> And somewhere in between, the rest of us struggle.<eos> Irene, have you shown this property to anyone else recently?<eos> I don't think anyone's asked to see it this last year.

Well, it's still standing.<eos> Almost by force of habit.<eos> Well, habit can provide a strong foundation.<eos> Dead Dog Farm, huh?<eos> That's an old legend.<eos> Of all the people in the world, the best and the worst are drawn to Dead Dog, and most turn away.<eos> Only those with the purest of heart can feel its pain.<eos> And somewhere in between, the rest of us struggle.<eos> Irene, have you shown this property to anyone else recently?<eos> I don't think anyone's asked to see it this last year.
This spoon was born when you were seven years old.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Just sits in a draw.<eos> Out of the draw, into the peas, stir the custard, into the wash, out of the wash, on the hooks with all the other spoons.<eos> And all the time, just waiting for the fatal day when it can drastically alter the course of a man's life.<eos> Don't look dangerous, does it?<eos> No, you take my word for it, that is an evil spoon.<eos> Here you are, look, put it in a place of honour.<eos> Keep an eye on it.<eos> Yeah, I don't trust it.
So I called Cynthia's, and her mother answered.<eos> Apparently, she was sleeping late also.<eos> But she said that Cynthia was visiting Audrey.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> - Well, Cynthia borrowed her mother's car.<eos> And the last anyone has seen of either of them... was about 4:00 yesterday afternoon.<eos> So they might have gotten to Von Sloneker's already last night.<eos> You were right.<eos> But I am authorized to use my mother's card.<eos> I use it all the time.
Even us Mudwarts who are made of earth, can't get there.<eos> "Take courage, friends<eos> "The Earthling has come to help us We must talk to the Empress"<eos> Childlike Empress.<eos> Bastian, you are the only Earthling moved by our plight.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> The same force that makes the books in your world become empty makes me a prisoner in my castle.<eos> What is this force?<eos> Only you can name it, Bastian.

Understand?<eos> I'm taking care of you from now on.<eos> I'm gonna deal with Leo.<eos> I'm gonna deal with James.<eos> Bobby's gonna deal with everything.<eos> Birdseed?<eos> No, this bird eats fruit.<eos> The sheriff says it's a witness.<eos> No, not just because it saw something, because it talks.<eos> It needs to eat...
It was late.<eos> We'd made popcorn.<eos> And they made this very serious promise to each other, to be best friends forever.<eos> I think it was a kind of bond against...<eos> I need to remember all this.<eos> Besides, she's cursed.<eos> Boys, take it easy.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna stick his head in the gutter where it belongs.

Why, Deets...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm a-comin', Deets.<eos> Wait for me, Deets. Just...<eos> I'm a-comin'. Deets...<eos> Deets...<eos> You intend to stab me with that knife?<eos> About to have a go at that rotten leg before you woke up.<eos> It's ruined.
The females were about the same size as African lions, but the males were 25% bigger.<eos> And there was an even more impressive cat, the sabre-tooth.<eos> At one time it was thought that these extraordinary teeth were daggers for stabbing, but now it's believed that they were used to slit open the belly of the prey.<eos> You might wonder how the animal managed even to close its jaws, and I asked a scientist at the museum, George Jefferson, to explain.<eos> I think we can illustrate that best with the specimen here that was preserved closed.<eos> That will give us an idea what that mouth looked like.<eos> As you can see, the incisors actually interlaced, allowing the jaw to fully close.<eos> I'm surprised how much space there is between those huge sabre teeth and the lower jaw.<eos> That gap is the same gap as between the meat-slicing teeth on the side of the face.<eos> What that meant is, the animal would disengage the incisors, drop the jaw down, move it slightly sideways, and guide the slicing blades here by running the inside of this flange against the canine tooth.
Father!<eos> The horse is mine!<eos> I got it from my father.<eos> The claimant says the horse belongs to the farm.<eos> He says your father has mortgaged everything, and that there's not enough to cover the debt.<eos> And that you have no right to claim anything.<eos> Just one moment.<eos> I was present during the foaling.<eos> It took place in fact during a game of poker.<eos> I can bear witness that Martin got the horse there and then, and that he has owned it and taken care of it since.
You know, I don't even know where she's staying.<eos> She's not gonna call me.<eos> -This is unbelievable.<eos> -l know, I know. lt's tough.<eos> Listen, your stuff has to be done by now.<eos> Why don't you just see if it's dry.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Don't interrupt the cycle.<eos> The machine is working. lt knows what it's doing.<eos> Just let it finish.

Why do I need freedom? I am married.<eos> Boy, come here.<eos> - Boy, do you need to be free?<eos> - I don't know, maybe I do.<eos> You're talking nonsense.<eos> Do not dare beat a child!<eos> Quiet, quiet here, give them freedom, and they will strangle and bite each other,<eos> - They are not guilty.<eos> How can they know what freedom is?<eos> After all they've never known how to enjoy it.

What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Feri doesn't go out in the storm. He's inside.<eos> He's in the flat.<eos> Hello, my Giza.<eos> Franciska speaking.<eos> I'll put it differently.<eos> There's a big epidemic here.<eos> A big one.<eos> No, children don't catch it.
Our dog!<eos> That's our dog!<eos> He killed our dog!<eos> You're in luck, it missed the bone.<eos> Where's the captain?<eos> - Don't move!<eos> - I want to see him now!<eos> You stole our dog!<eos> It wandered over.<eos> I just gave it sugar.
She is my butterfly<eos> Ar Mo<eos> This is the detention centre... of the Fushun Bureau of Public Security... and I am the Governer<eos> During the war... this was a Japanese prison<eos> Many of you may remember it... because you worked with the Japanese<eos> You were responsible for building it... and you filled it with innocent people<eos> How could this happen? Why did you betray your country?<eos> What turned you into war criminals?<eos> We believe... that men are born good<eos> We believe... that the only way to change... is to discover the truth and look at it in the face
- What was what?<eos> - I thought I heard something.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - How do you like that baby?<eos> - It's a beauty.<eos> Come on, let's get in.<eos> Can I drive on the way back?<eos> Fat chance.<eos> Nobody drives this baby, but me.<eos> We have to let it warm up a little.

Come, Daniel-san, talk to drum later.<eos> - That guy's uncle own everything?<eos> - Almost.<eos> Hey!<eos> There's Miyagi the coward.<eos> And his baby!<eos> - Doesn't that bother you?<eos> - Why should it?<eos> All the people might believe it's true or something.<eos> Daniel-san, lie become truth only if person want to believe it.
That's sensible.<eos> Take care of the animal needs first.<eos> Come along, we've got it all worked out.<eos> Go to your assigned row according to the colors that you were told about earlier.<eos> These are pumpkin seeds.<eos> About this deep, this far apart.<eos> Jerry, corn for you.<eos> - How are you doing, Charlie?<eos> - All right, Dad.<eos> Right now, someone in America is pushing an electric squeezer down a garbage disposal and saying it's busted.
- He did a little too much LDS.<eos> - LDS?<eos> I'll give you a lift.<eos> I have a notorious weakness for hard-luck cases.<eos> - We don't want to be any trouble.<eos> - You've already been that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Don't try anything.<eos> I've got a tire iron right where I can get at it.

Don't be afraid, Christ isn't dead.<eos> He rose from the dead and flew to the sky, like a bird.<eos> He's in the sky.<eos> There're only kind people there. Evil people cannot get there.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - The evil ones are heavy.<eos> - Why are they heavy?<eos> - You don't know?<eos> Because of sins.<eos> And a kind person's soul is pure and light as a bird, it can easily fly.

Vedic chants of the ascetics<eos> Why do you always laugh at me ?<eos> I will leave you now.<eos> I have work to do<eos> The Sun in the sky, and Shankara in my heart... both are memorable<eos> This is Sringeri and the Thunga river<eos> Buddhists tried their best to ban animal sacrifices<eos> Now animal forms made out of dough are sacrificed<eos> The very practise is tragic.<eos> How does one put an end to it?
Really, you can hit me as much as you like.<eos> Go on, but just let us keep the fish when you're done.<eos> That's right!<eos> You can hit me as much as you want, too.<eos> But give us the fish. Go on. I'm ready.<eos> Will you tell me why you boys want that blasted carp?<eos> It's for our mother, sir.<eos> She's going to have a baby, and she's not very well.<eos> And Mr. Pak said carp blood's the only thing that'll help her.<eos> Without it, my mother will get worse or even...
What's that?<eos> Don't worry, dear. I'll get it.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Hello.<eos> Can we have your liver?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your liver.<eos> It's a large glandular organ in your abdomen.<eos> You know, it's reddish-brown, sort of...<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know what it is, but I'm using it.
(Avigdor) So, er...what was it Like?<eos> - Oh, the usual.<eos> Music, dancing...<eos> - I was there.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hadass and I talked, laughed a little...<eos> Laughed a Lot.<eos> And then she went to sleep.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> People who want the truth never believe it.

All I said was he doesn't sound like he knows what he's talking about.<eos> Who'd make the mistake of thinking Ankara's in Bulgaria?<eos> Well, Francis wouldn't.<eos> If you're a spy, why have you got your back to the door?<eos> Because I can see the door reflected in your beautiful eyes.<eos> That old line.<eos> Your eyes remind me of an etching I bought in Norway for 200 guilders.<eos> - Norway's currency is the Krone.<eos> - Diane.<eos> If you have a licence to kill, can I use it a second?

Hooper<eos> is there any chance I can safely leave you in charge of the working party for half an hour?<eos> I was just wondering if we could scrounge some tea.<eos> For Christ's sake, you've only just started.<eos> They're awfully browned off.<eos> Keep them at it. Righty oh.<eos> Why, isn't it Mr. Ryder? It is.<eos> I was wondering when I'd meet somebody I knew.<eos> Mrs. Hawkins is still in her old room. I was just going to take her some tea.<eos> I'll take it for you.
-Melkur?<eos> Of course!<eos> The evil originates from him.<eos> Don't you realise?<eos> The evil is here before you.<eos> Before your eyes!<eos> My wife is not well.<eos> -Did she say Melkur?<eos> -She has an obsession with the statue.<eos> -Devoted to it.
Yes.<eos> Yes? The diaphragm.<eos> Yes, that's correct.<eos> Here we have the heart and the lungs, and down here, we have the intestines.<eos> The intestines and other parts.<eos> Yes, the intestines are... peeled out.<eos> Does one of you know what...<eos> is located here? Here! Mr. Særlang.<eos> The liver.<eos> Mr. Særlang, how old is it?

Use brute force in an attempt to counter a force we do not understand?<eos> Then what do you propose?<eos> - Doing nothing.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I may not be the bravest man in the galaxy.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> But I'd rather fight than do nothing.<eos> We will not counter the force acting upon the Liberator.<eos> We plot the Liberator's course... on the main battle computer flight predictor... to see exactly how she is behaving.<eos> Once we understand how the force is operating... we may be some way toward defeating it.
This is a world marked by searing heat crushing pressures, sulfurous gases and a desolate, reddish landscape.<eos> Far from the balmy paradise imagined by some early scientists Venus is the one place in the solar system most like hell.<eos> But today, as in ancient tradition there are travelers who will dare a visit to the underworld.<eos> Venera 9 was the first spacecraft in human history to return a photograph from the surface of Venus.<eos> It found the rocks curiously eroded perhaps by the corrosive gases perhaps because the temperature is so high that the rocks are partly molten and sluggishly flow.<eos> The Soviet Venera spacecraft, their electronics long ago fried are slowly corroding on the surface of Venus.<eos> They are the first spaceships from Earth ever to land on another planet.<eos> The reason Venus is like hell seems to be what's called the greenhouse effect.<eos> Ordinary visible sunlight penetrates the clouds and heats the surface.<eos> But the dense atmosphere blankets the surface and prevents it from cooling off to space.

Do we have to go over this all the time?<eos> - Rita who?<eos> - Rita Hayworth.<eos> Are you joking with me?<eos> Course I'm joking!<eos> You think I'm unaware of any event pre-Paul McCartney.<eos> - I find these photographs interesting.<eos> - Yes, so do I.<eos> - Do you ever use the camera I got you?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.
There's another alarm been immobilised.<eos> You've got a pretty cynical attitude to life, haven't you, Duggan?<eos> Well, when you've been around as long as I have.<eos> -How old are you, anyway?<eos> -1 25.<eos> What?<eos> It's gone!<eos> The system around it should be absolutely impregnable.<eos> It can't be turned off.<eos> Someone seems to have managed it somehow.
Fettle?<eos> Define fettle.<eos> Well, you know, form, condition, tone.<eos> It is stimulating to communicate for once with something other than a limited and unpredictable organic intelligence.<eos> What did you say?<eos> With something other?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> I have been communicating with my own kind.<eos> The day of retribution is at hand.<eos> I shall myself lead the final assault upon the very citadel of Zeon might and deliver to it such a crushing blow that the dread spectre of Zeon aggression will never rise again!
-Yes?<eos> -That hole in the wall...<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -Might it lead to a way out?<eos> -No. Not yet, anyway.<eos> I don't know, I've got tunnels all over the place,<eos> -but I can't seem to find it.<eos> -Find what?<eos> The transmat shaft.<eos> They all use it.
I'll put my trust in this solid metal.<eos> There's another six inches to add to your collection, old man.<eos> Tempered steel!<eos> Is that really tempered steel?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Kill me and you condemn yourselves to poverty.<eos> Without that piece of shell, all this metal is just worthless scrap.<eos> I have that piece of shell hidden.<eos> I think that gives us an interesting basis for conversation, doesn't it?<eos> If it's hidden, what's to stop us killing you and letting it stay hidden?
And to perform these manoeuvres, it beats its wings at an astonishing speed of 175 beats a second.<eos> A normal slow-motion camera still shows the wings as a blur.<eos> They control their flight with a device which can be seen clearly in another fly, the crane-fly, or daddy-long-legs.<eos> Those two objects like drumsticks swinging up and down are their back pair of wings after millions of years of evolution.<eos> They're jointed to the body, like the rear wings are, and act like gyroscopes.<eos> By beating very fast, and here they're slowed down 120 times, they give the fly stability in the air.<eos> Like gyroscopes in the automatic controls of an aeroplane, they enable the fly to be aware of the attitude of its body in the air and to detect when there's been a change in the flight path.<eos> Houseflies also have these "drumsticks", though they're much smaller.<eos> It's these that enable flies to perform such extraordinary and tantalising aerobatics.<eos> And the same organs perform similar functions for the hoverfly, giving it that superb flight control.

And to perform these manoeuvres, it beats its wings at an astonishing speed of 175 beats a second.<eos> A normal slow-motion camera still shows the wings as a blur.<eos> They control their flight with a device which can be seen clearly in another fly, the crane-fly, or daddy-long-legs.<eos> Those two objects like drumsticks swinging up and down are their back pair of wings after millions of years of evolution.<eos> They're jointed to the body, like the rear wings are, and act like gyroscopes.<eos> By beating very fast, and here they're slowed down 120 times, they give the fly stability in the air.<eos> Like gyroscopes in the automatic controls of an aeroplane, they enable the fly to be aware of the attitude of its body in the air and to detect when there's been a change in the flight path.<eos> Houseflies also have these "drumsticks", though they're much smaller.<eos> It's these that enable flies to perform such extraordinary and tantalising aerobatics.<eos> And the same organs perform similar functions for the hoverfly, giving it that superb flight control.
Some of the folk think he was an escaped convict.<eos> Heard anything about it?<eos> - Not you, too.<eos> Mr Farnon, I really must protest.<eos> Ah, Miss Harbottle, I was just on my way to see you.<eos> I have asked you repeatedly...<eos> - Yes.<eos> Just one or two little points I wanted to discuss.<eos> First of all, your petty cash box.<eos> It's a very nice little box as boxes go but the function of a cash box is to have cash in it, agreed?

- Dad!<eos> - Bill!<eos> Pipes ain't growing alone. I make sure they don't.<eos> Look at my knees.<eos> - Look at my knees!<eos> - Bill!<eos> - Are you hungry?<eos> - Bill!<eos> The girls had heard this before... but 14 years ago, I had an operation on my arm here.<eos> Doctors said I won't be able to use it. But what the hell do they know, I said.
- Mine.<eos> It was yours, actually.<eos> But I approved it immediately.<eos> You think I talked you into something.<eos> No.<eos> We live together, we sleep together, we eat together.<eos> Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do you?<eos> - How is it any different?<eos> - Because you keep your own apartment.<eos> We don't have to go to it, deal with it... but it's like a free-floating life raft that we know that we're not married.
So I taught him how to scream.<eos> First of all, I oiled him up.<eos> His body, with really heavy oil and everything.<eos> We're standing there in the shower room. And I taught him how to do it.<eos> The higher your arms go up, the higher you make a screaming noise.<eos> And the lower your arms come down, the lower the noise.<eos> This kind of a thing.<eos> I practiced with him for around two hours.<eos> Spent a lot of time on developing his new posing routine.<eos> And he mastered it very well.
It will become a part of you, as you will become a part of it.<eos> Yes, that's what I thought.<eos> VARDAN 1: Prepare.<eos> But you know this already.<eos> Once before, you have entered into the amplified Pantropic computer.<eos> Yes, I didn't much care for it either.<eos> The APC net is only a small part of the Matrix.<eos> And when I've been introduced to the Matrix, will I have complete power?<eos> More power than anyone in the known universe, yes.<eos> I'll put it to good use.

- Did you send the telegrams?<eos> - Yes, this morning, I prepared everything<eos> - Dr. Robertson<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Dr. Messier is here to see you<eos> - Good, have him come in<eos> Brendan, how are you?<eos> I'm doing great.<eos> What are you doing, checking my work?<eos> No, only admiring it.
Okay, line up.<eos> Move it!<eos> On your feet, right now.<eos> Two lines.<eos> Alice and Mary, eyes front.<eos> Katie.<eos> You too, Chris.<eos> And spit out that gum.<eos> - Where'll I put it, Miss Collins?<eos> - You can choke on it for all I care.

Hey Buzz, why do not you show your Brother something about cars.<eos> I know enough, I have My teachings.<eos> You do not have a car to do it.<eos> Look, learn from someone who knows.<eos> You can not do it without a car.<eos> True.<eos> Hey, you gotta see this car!<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can you fill it?
Thanks, but want fresh coffee.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He's already getting sloppy. Typical southerner!<eos> - Listen, boss- - What?<eos> - That lady... the blonde lady- - Who?<eos> The blonde who rented the boat. - Mrs. Panzetti.<eos> - Lanzetti.<eos> She called me a sloppy southerner.<eos> - Look, boss...<eos> She can call her husband that but from me she'll get a slap! Can't you grin and bear it for a month?

ILLUMINATION<eos> What is the "illumination"?<eos> "Illumination" is a term and outlook of Saint Augustine's.<eos> Both the term and the outlook survived for a long time, the whole of medieval philosophy.<eos> According to it, we gain knowledge through enlightenment of the mind.
Would you like tea?<eos> Or some coffee?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Your port wine tastes excellent.<eos> I may add that nowadays, it's surprising to be offered port wine by your host.<eos> It was explicitly mentioned in the dossier about you.<eos> But back to my assignment:<eos> To a citizen of Dream City, the only thing of importance is his dream.<eos> We nourish and grow it.<eos> To disturb it would be unthinkable high treason.
Come on, Professor, come and tell me all you know about the layout here.<eos> Truly, Madam President, I...<eos> I sympathise with your position.<eos> But my government has sought these criminals throughout the galaxy.<eos> They are now prisoners of the government of Earth.<eos> That's good enough.<eos> With the greatest respect, General Williams, I must disagree.<eos> They are citizens of Sirius 4.<eos> Part of Earth's empire.<eos> Yes, but it has been granted dominion status.

Corleone is Johnny's godfather.<eos> To the Italian people that's a very sacred, close relationship.<eos> I respect it.<eos> Tell him to ask me anything else.<eos> This favor I can't give him.<eos> He never asks a second favor when he's been refused the first.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.<eos> That part is perfect for him.<eos> It'll make him a big star.
Hari, what can I do?<eos> I won't return to earth.<eos> We'll live here, on the station.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> The ocean's activity is increasing.<eos> Your encephalogram may be the cause.<eos> Whenever we show pity we empty our souls.<eos> Suffering makes life seem gray and suspicious.<eos> No, I don't believe that...<eos> What is not indispensable to life is in some way harmful to it?

It's up to you to call a meeting of the village and start behaving like the Squire.<eos> You may be the vicar, but I'll thank you not to take that tone with me!<eos> Ah, a man of spirit are you?<eos> That's exactly what's wanted at a time like this.<eos> I still don't understand what you're talking about.<eos> Decadence - that's what I'm talking about.<eos> It's what I see on every side.<eos> All this talk of democracy... fffreedom... lllliberty...<eos> What this country needs is strength, power and decision!<eos> And those are what you can give to it.
Right, I'm coming.<eos> I thought you'd make for here.<eos> Hold it Mailer.<eos> Let me have that gun.<eos> I think you'd better show our patient into the chair, Mailer, and handcuff him into it.<eos> May I ask the purpose of this charade?<eos> Certainly.<eos> You'd better wait outside, Mailer.<eos> As you see I have affected the necessary repairs.<eos> But, before I let you control this machine for me, which I fully intend that you shall, it'll be very interesting to see exactly how long you can hold out against it.

Very well.<eos> The information I need is in my car, I will go and fetch it.<eos> You will wait for me here?<eos> Yes, all right.<eos> I think I've got it now<eos> Send "stand up"<eos> Forward.<eos> Send "stop".<eos> There can be no problems with that thing?<eos> It's simple enough... even you might be able to manage it.

- Flesh of my leg!<eos> - What 's up?<eos> Flesh of my leg!<eos> My God!<eos> The ogre!<eos> But I f ooled him.<eos> - What happened, boy?<eos> - The ogre tried to eat me.<eos> It 's my mother 's fault:<eos> I f ound some f ood. She wanted to share it with my brothers.

A very simple problem, easy to correct.<eos> Then come.<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't be afraid.<eos> I do not fear the punishment of disobedience.<eos> - Well, then come, we must hurry to join...<eos> - No, I cannot go with you.<eos> It is not fear.<eos> I understand the great purpose of the creators.<eos> I shall honour it.
Which just goes to prove that there's no such thing as a perfect solution.<eos> So it would seem.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - Yes, Spock. Do you still feel anger toward Parmen?<eos> Great anger.<eos> - And you, Dr. McCoy?<eos> - Yes, Spock, and hatred. Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine.<eos> I might have seriously injured you, captain, even killed you.<eos> They have evoked such great hatred in me,<eos> I cannot allow it to go further.

The one you suggested.<eos> I asked him to wait.<eos> Powered from this, I suppose.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Better than the public supply, just in case.<eos> In case it blows up?<eos> That's why he won't let anyone down there, sir.<eos> Oh, very considerate of him.<eos> Oh, I reckon this little beauty would cut through anything.<eos> I did steel armour plate with it. Six inches thick. Just like that.
I don´t think so.<eos> Come on.<eos> That guy´s got some nerve!<eos> Say, that´s in G minor!<eos> I´m in love, I am.<eos> Lucky youl I do what I can.<eos> I come to Rochefort to see a friend, Simon Dame, he lives out this end.<eos> But I meet a girl and I go crazy.<eos> The girl´s gone but love´s fazed me.<eos> It took a trip across two continents, lt took this one amazing chance To change my life, to give it sense, lt took my coming back to France.
Well, I hate to use the word, but, logically, with those kind of odds, you might as well stay.<eos> But please stay out of trouble, Mr. Spock.<eos> That is always my intention, captain.<eos> - Kirk here.<eos> - Scotty here, captain.<eos> My brilliant improvisation just gave up the ghost.<eos> It couldn't stand the strain.<eos> - Can you fix it again?<eos> - Negative, captain.<eos> It's gone for good.

It's late and we have work to do.<eos> So the show's over?<eos> Yes, it's over.<eos> Before it has the opposite effect.<eos> People of the Casbah, the rebellion is dying out.<eos> Ali Mohammed, head of FLN Section 2, was killed this morning.<eos> People of Algiers, turn in the agitators.<eos> Disassociate yourselves from the rebel organization.<eos> The army is protecting you.<eos> Trust in it.
Leave!<eos> Don't worry, I won't do anything to your lady.<eos> I only want to ask her forgiveness.<eos> I hate you.<eos> So much that I could kill you.<eos> Ah, finally the truth!<eos> Why do you try to control that which you cannot hide?<eos> Because I'm a gentleman.<eos> Your goodness makes me sick.<eos> And I don't trust it at all.
I knew he would.<eos> If anyone's interested, 30 seconds.<eos> Request permission to return to post, sir.<eos> Permission granted.<eos> Eleven.<eos> Ten seconds.<eos> Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.<eos> A very interesting game, this poker.<eos> It does have advantages over chess.<eos> Love to teach it to you.

Sometimes, reality is too complex for oral communication.<eos> But legend embodies it in a form which enables it to spread all over the world.
On his way to execution, he took a pistol from one of the guards and blew his own brains out.<eos> Don't tell Lara this.<eos> I think I know Lara at least as well as you. But don't you see her position?<eos> She's served her purpose.<eos> These men that came with me today as an escort will come for her and the child tomorrow, as a firing squad.<eos> Now, I know exactly what you think of me.<eos> And why. But if you're not coming with me, she's not coming with me.<eos> So, are you coming with me?<eos> Do you accept the protection of this ignoble Caliban on any terms that Caliban cares to make?<eos> Or, is your delicacy so exorbitant that you would sacrifice a woman and a child to it?

"That is why I'm not ashamed."<eos> You're stupid, conceited.<eos> You talk, talk...<eos> You think you know everything, but you don't know anything or anybody.<eos> Shut up, you can't talk.<eos> No more river!<eos> Enough of the river!<eos> One must forget it.<eos> They tell us to bid it farewell.<eos> They order us to say goodbye to it.

I'll leave.<eos> What about our game?<eos> We can play tomorrow.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> Life is good.<eos> Good for what, Doctor?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Life... flows too slowly in me.<eos> So I speed it up.<eos> I set it right.

If you don't mind, Dad...<eos> I hate to say this...<eos> It is your house...<eos> We don't believe in saying "no" to the children.<eos> According to all modern psychologists, saying "no" leads to neuroses.<eos> It can also lead to bankruptcy, too, if he breaks enough stuff.<eos> What we do is put all the ashtrays and other breakables out of their reach... like on the mantelpiece.<eos> If I want to smoke in this house, I have to stand beside the mantelpiece?<eos> Well, maybe Susan does carry it a bit too far at times...<eos> Susan carries it no further than Susan has been advised to carry it.

Let's just hope that this will be more effective then the drug we've prepared for his horse. The horse acted exactly as we've predicted, sir.<eos> And this poison will have the expected effect too.<eos> You can trust him, my friend.<eos> Lorenzo is the best alchemist I've known.<eos> And the most devoted one.<eos> You're quite famous.<eos> I've learned you count your victims by the hundreds.<eos> They were only bad people, sir, the enemies of my friends.<eos> What's the secret of your genius, you diabolical magician?<eos> The nature has played me a prank and I'm not finished paying it back.

- Well, perhaps if we reason with her.<eos> - Reason?<eos> - With Maleficent?<eos> - Well, she can't be all bad.<eos> Oh, yes, she can!<eos> Ooh, I'd like to turn her into a fat, old hoptoad.<eos> Now, dear, that isn't a very nice thing to say.<eos> Besides, we can't.<eos> You know our magic doesn't work that way.<eos> It can only do good, dear, to bring joy and happiness.

The Pentagon has given the green light.<eos> Preparations are already underway.<eos> You haven't seen that monster, Dr. eliot!<eos> Are you suggesting that anything in this universe can withstand a multiple thermonuclear attack?<eos> You yourself have generated the heat of a dozen suns in the nuclear furnace on the other side of that wall.<eos> I tell you that Kronos has plates more impervious still.<eos> Not only can he withstand any force we're able to throw against him, but he will actually absorb that energy.<eos> - Become more powerful from it.<eos> - Have you any proof of this, Gaskell?<eos> No positive proof, but I'm convinced that the giant sucks up energy like a sponge, feeds on it, is a walking storehouse of energy!

Yes, it's all right.<eos> Go on, Jimmy.<eos> I don't want to now.<eos> You shouldn't have...<eos> - done that to him, Noah.<eos> - Somebody's got to do it.<eos> - I think you liked doing it.<eos> - No, I didn't!<eos> For Pete's sake, somebody take this family off my hands.<eos> I don't want to run it.
Now, that's not it.<eos> I'm trying to locate a lost article.<eos> The only difficulty is, I can't remember what I lost.<eos> No, this isn't it.<eos> I don't know why I keep it.<eos> I don't think it's any good anymore, it's been used.

Which door?<eos> This one.<eos> - Good afternoon, Mr. Sherman.<eos> - Dr. Brubaker.<eos> I see you've been working on my book.<eos> It's a wonderful book.<eos> Very important.<eos> - It has something for everyone.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You'll be happy to know that we're giving it a big promotion.
Why have I never been a young lover?<eos> Can you tell me that?<eos> My dear little girl... console yourself.<eos> There are only a few young lovers in the world.<eos> You could almost count them.<eos> Love has befallen them as a gift and a punishment.<eos> - And the rest of us?<eos> - The rest of us...!<eos> What becomes of us?<eos> We invoke love, call it beg for it, cry for it, try to mimic it... We think that we own it, we lie about it...
What were you doing here then?<eos> Helping Rutherford.<eos> I was the assistant here.<eos> You can't remember anything about a party of deer hunters... that checked in here around October 13 or 14?<eos> Don't know.<eos> What do you mean, you don't know?<eos> Long time ago.<eos> We get a passel of hunters through here in season.<eos> My memory's not as good as it used to be.<eos> It might need a little help.

- Why, is something big going on?<eos> It's going on right here.<eos> It's a big night.<eos> It's just an old run-of-the-mill Wednesday.<eos> The calendar's full of them. It's opening night of the last depressing week of L B Jefferies in a cast.<eos> Well, I haven't noticed a big demand for tickets.<eos> That's because I bought out the house.<eos> You know, this cigarette box has seen better days.<eos> I picked that up in Shanghai, which has also seen better days.<eos> It's cracked and you never use it.

Miss Mei.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here are a few for you.<eos> Do not eat spicy food, or your hand will not heal.<eos> A Cheng.<eos> Come out and help with the baskets.<eos> Forman (manager), my hand.<eos> What's wrong with her?<eos> It still hurts.<eos> Give it a rest for a couple days.
You mustn't stay outdoors.<eos> There they are, the swine!<eos> I've been expecting them.<eos> The letter, Heurtebise.<eos> The anonymous letter.<eos> I'll talk to them.<eos> What does marble think when it's being sculpted?<eos> It thinks, "I am struck, insulted, ruined, lost."<eos> Life is sculpting me.<eos> Let it fiinish its work.

I've just been working on a problem.<eos> What kind of a problem?<eos> You might call it a project.<eos> A project?<eos> I'm planning on how to irrigate this desert.<eos> What, all of it? Why not?<eos> Turn it into a blooming garden.<eos> Ain't a bad idea.<eos> There's plenty of water, only it's not in the right places.<eos> It just stands about, waiting for people to drown in it.

- And Mammy.<eos> It's good to see home folks.<eos> - I didn't know you were here.<eos> - I didn't know you were.<eos> Didn't Suellen tell you about my store?<eos> Did she? I don't remember.<eos> Have you a store?<eos> - This?<eos> - Won't you come in, look around a bit?<eos> I don't suppose it looks like much to a lady... but I can't help being proud of it.

Don't offer them any more money.<eos> Don't encourage them to... . To admire you.<eos> All right. I'll do that.<eos> Sure, you will.<eos> Father Connelly, I'd like to help you. I really would. But we can't get away with it.<eos> The organization is too powerful to fight.<eos> You know what you're asking of me? Yes, Mr. White.<eos> The other papers have gone to great lengths to explain the risks to me.<eos> You'll go into the fight personally?<eos> Devote your full time to it?

And now we must try to help him in the same way.<eos> So, what kind of terror are we talking about here, Delenn?<eos> The kind that cripples.<eos> The kind that destroys.<eos> Not from without, but from within.<eos> As soon as he can stand, whether he is fully healed or not Tannier will prepare to face his terror.<eos> Those who harm him now have power over him.<eos> He must take back that power or he will never be whole again.<eos> We will go with him and bring him to the point of his terror.<eos> And then he will face it.
Even the priest died!<eos> - What's the deal?<eos> - OK.<eos> See here, the balcony?<eos> That's where the original teacher died back in 1955, and that teacher last night.<eos> That's the hot spot where all the bad mojo is coming from.<eos> - We need to create a Mangus tripod. - A what?<eos> One person chants here on the hot spot.<eos> And the other three chant in other places around the school, forming a triangle.<eos> It's supposed to bind the bad spirit and keep it from doing any more harm.
Dimitri, pick up your order. Don't make me hurt you again.<eos> Aunt Zora, I realise I'm not the most welcome person here but...<eos> It is not fair to take my mistake out on your husband or my father.<eos> - They didn't do anything.<eos> - More pepper.<eos> You have a wedding. You should be joyous.<eos> Sponge off this countertop.<eos> Nikos says his fiancée's a lovely woman and you like her very much.<eos> You should be full of motherly emotions.<eos> When I find out who bent this skewer, I'm ramming it right in his eye.
A hypnotist?<eos> What about a psychic?<eos> Or a fortune teller?<eos> Why don't we turn this case into a circus?<eos> Fifteen years ago, I worked a case, serial rapist murderer.<eos> We had a surviving victim, couldn't remember a thing about the attack.<eos> The woman's family brought in a hypnotist.<eos> Under hypnosis, she could remember enough details about the killer that we were able to catch the man.<eos> Hypnosis can be a powerful tool.<eos> They say kids are especially open to it.
Didn't you have to talk them into it?<eos> Didn't they say they would exact a penance for helping you?<eos> Yes, but they listened, and they saved Bajor and the rest of the Alpha Quadrant.<eos> Now they're asking for something in return.<eos> I don't know what it is, and I won't return the tablet until I do.<eos> It's the key. I can feel it.<eos> - l hope you're wrong about that.<eos> - What have you got?<eos> The computer translated part of the inscription.<eos> It probably lacks the eloquence of the original, but you'll get the gist of it.
- Where's the Captain's desk?<eos> You don't know?<eos> This is your authorisation code, isn't it?<eos> - Nog.<eos> - What about him?<eos> He must have traded the Captain's desk for the graviton stabiliser.<eos> I will get the desk back.<eos> You're damn right.<eos> The Captain returns in two days.<eos> When he does, I want his desk sitting right here where it belongs.
I didn't start working on this until after the computers went down.<eos> What might they be trying to communicate?<eos> They could be saying, "Take me to your leader", for all I know.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> The point is that they're trying.<eos> We haven't considered that we may be up against an alien intelligence.<eos> We've treated it like a disease, a plague.<eos> Not once have we stopped to listen.<eos> How do we do that?<eos> - We let it grow.
I would like to get a little even, though.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Oh, just go back a little in time.<eos> "The Penguin"?<eos> - Will you do the honors?<eos> - We're adults.<eos> We're lawyers. We don't do that anymore.<eos> We haven't retired the Penguin, and this guy...<eos> He's the perfect finale.<eos> - You do it! - No.

And we just weren't meant to be together.<eos> There was nothing we coulïve done other than what we did.<eos> But I was wrong to have forgotten your birthday.<eos> Mendel, you know I, I can't accept...<eos> Please, if not for yourself, then for me.<eos> Yom Kippur is coming up and I would like to face God... knowing I tried to do right by you.<eos> A ruby.<eos> Is your birthstone.<eos> I looked it up.<eos> I bought it loose. I figured finding the right setting for it is your specialty, so why interfere.
How do I look?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Where is the crew?<eos> All over the place.<eos> Check the cargo hold!<eos> There may be crew down there. Everybody off the boat!<eos> No, no!<eos> Get away from that!<eos> Now you're John Hammond.<eos> Why the hell wasn't it tranquilized?
It's got enough fuel to carry it beyond our coastline.<eos> If we were handling this, fewer lives would be in jeopardy.<eos> - Meaning what?<eos> - Just what I said.<eos> Here's who you're dealing with: male Caucasian, 35, well-educated.<eos> Raised by his aunt who mysteriously disappeared when he was 16.<eos> Has raped and strangled five women... escaped while being transferred to San Quentin two years ago... finally recaptured and was being transported by four of your marshals...<eos> We already have a comprehensive profile...<eos> Let's focus on the problem with the plane.<eos> We can't just let it crash into Downtown Los Angeles.
Now will you tell me what's wrong?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I have to talk to the lawyer.<eos> To Valerio?<eos> Why?<eos> He has to try to buy Lola's house.<eos> -What are you saying?<eos> -I know very well what I'm saying.<eos> Mateo, the kid, has got the house.<eos> He doesn't want it.
Stay with it, Boone!<eos> Stay with it!<eos> He's alive.<eos> His pulse rate is heightened but within anticipated parameters.<eos> I'll start preconsciousness calibrations immediately.<eos> Welcome to a new world, Boone.<eos> Everything is so much clear now...<eos> The CVI is everything you said it would be.<eos> You must master the talents of your implant.<eos> Let it guide you to a more profound phase of awareness.
And I took this.<eos> You stole some money?<eos> -I did an act of courage.<eos> -and if he had seen you?<eos> I walked like an Indian and then I made off really fast.<eos> So, can I return?<eos> We need to vote.<eos> Who is for Thomas becoming a Chiricahua again?<eos> If I betray my brother, I will lose his trust forever.<eos> Only the largest of tests can erase the stain, And only my blood brother can impose it on me.
Kill it.<eos> Fair lady, would you care to hear a sonnet?<eos> Pass<eos> What happened here?<eos> An assassination attempt<eos> Some rebel clerics found a way to make my pillar descend.<eos> Good for them, I say - not at the time, of course, but -<eos> Squish!<eos> Bad lizard<eos> You should have let it kill me.

Hey, no problem.<eos> We just, uh...<eos> Oh, jeez...<eos> Any sign of Deakins?<eos> Maybe the son of a bitch is dead.<eos> What a terrible thing to say!<eos> Get 'em.<eos> You assured me everything would go smoothly!<eos> Everything is going smoothly, I assure you.<eos> Our merchandise is not where it's supposed to be!
(in English) OK.<eos> Bring black.<eos> They'll put us into "Catastrophes in Israel".<eos> This is the westernmost tree in the forest.<eos> It carries virus zero.<eos> From it will start the plague that will turn this whole forest into desert.<eos> Virus zero is not just a lethal virus.<eos> It eludes us.<eos> It eats the trunk from within, leaving the outside whole, without any traces.<eos> But suddenly, you trust it.
- Excellent.<eos> - Dad!<eos> What?<eos> You guys are being...<eos> Oh, man.<eos> - You're so stupid.<eos> - Am not.<eos> Are so.<eos> You ruined my dad's marble.<eos> He's not gonna want it with your snot all over it.
I didn't think it had anything to do with this.<eos> - You don't.<eos> - I've spent a lot of money here.<eos> - They spent more.<eos> - I built a clinic here.<eos> These people depend on me.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> Send them cheques from California.<eos> Chucho, hazme el favor, scame el CD.<eos> I respect your advice, Marty, but I can't take it.
Do you understand what is going on now?<eos> You don't talk to him.<eos> - Don't talk to my brother, all right?<eos> - He is not your pet.<eos> - This is real. - You don't gotta talk to my brother, all right? You got nothing to say to him.<eos> Who do you think you are? What do you... - You think you're running shit here?<eos> - No, I'm not running shit.<eos> - My man is running shit. - Oh.<eos> Your man. Right.<eos> But if I have a problem, I'm going to address it.
Captain, playing cat and mouse is... not very smart.<eos> Not for the mouse.<eos> Do you know you're violating international law... - by boarding my ship?<eos> - But, you invited us.<eos> That's bullshit, man.<eos> Your cannons made a compelling argument.<eos> - I've got a passport. I swear to God.<eos> - A stowaway?<eos> He left his passport in Grenada.<eos> It's being mailed to him in Panama.
- With room to spare.<eos> God, it's almost enough to make you start believing in miracles, isn't it?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Almost.<eos> Why?<eos> What happened?<eos> You'd think I'd learn one of these days... that I can't fix everything, but it never happens.<eos> And now...<eos> I gave him back the sword.<eos> I figured maybe it'd help, but it didn't.
Sometimes I think maybe Londo could use a visit there.<eos> I think it would do him good.<eos> A darkness in the heart cannot be cured by moving the body from one place to another.<eos> I don't think there is anything that can be done for him now.<eos> That's because you don't know him.<eos> Someday he'll surprise you.<eos> The problem we're facing involves not just the Psi Corps... but planetary security.<eos> For a year, we've been after the biggest manufacturers of Dust in Earth territory.<eos> Dust is a major problem for telepaths... because it allows the user to commit a kind of telepathic rape.<eos> The drug enhances the latent telepathic gene in most humans... and gives it a destructive power for several hours.
Hold his head... while I try and get this poppy juice down his throat.<eos> It has calmed him before.<eos> Has he had another vision, Brother Cadfael?<eos> His soul is most wondrously open.<eos> Or his head is weak through loss of blood.<eos> Do you deny the benefits of blood-letting, Brother Cadfael?<eos> That it calms the body, and therefore the soul.<eos> I think even in the House of God there is danger in excess.<eos> I'll leave the poppy juice there.<eos> Though I doubt he'll need any more of it.
You're both right.<eos> I'm a talentless hack who got lucky once.<eos> - We didn't say that!<eos> - You're not listening to them?<eos> - Look at this trash!<eos> It won't burn!<eos> - It's a fireplace, you see.<eos> - It's not well ventilated.<eos> - This doesn't belong in a fireplace.<eos> It belongs in the gutter, with the rest of society's garbage!
Goodbye.<eos> - Why the voice?<eos> - Hard to say.<eos> - Your cappuccino, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - This is better than the coffeehouse.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> How come it's not mixing with the water?<eos> The package says to keep it moving.<eos> Stir and drink, never let it settle.
That ingrate can't stop hounding me for five minutes.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We've seen the stain.<eos> You know, Debra, for something like a spill, I find it best to wipe it the day it happens.<eos> - Marie, where's my sandwich?<eos> - Where?<eos> Exactly where you threw it.<eos> In the garbage.<eos> Where it belonged.

If we can't get them out, we'll breed them out.<eos> That should fetch just the kind of lords we want to Scotland.<eos> Taxes or no taxes.<eos> A most excellent idea, sire.<eos> Is it?<eos> Now, in Edinburgh were gathered the council of Scottish nobles.<eos> Among these was Robert, the 17th Earl of Bruce, a leading contender for the crown of Scotland.<eos> I hear that Longshanks has granted primae noctis.<eos> Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.<eos> My father believes we must lull Longshanks into our confidence by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it.
It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that.<eos> Go on.<eos> I just don't think I can continue... to live in a place that embraces... and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue.<eos> You're no different. You're no better.<eos> I didn't say I was different or better.<eos> Hell, I sympathize. I sympathize completely.<eos> Apathy is a solution.<eos> It's easier to lose yourself in drugs... than it is to cope with life.<eos> It's easier to steal what you want than it is to earn it.<eos> It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it.
Now get going.<eos> And leave the clothes... here.<eos> Brother?<eos> All right, tell me what's wrong with it.<eos> Nothing.<eos> The ship is perfect!<eos> Gaila must have paid a fortune for it.<eos> You mean it'll actually fly?<eos> This ship could outrun a Romulan interceptor.<eos> We could take it halfway across the galaxy before it would even need a maintenance check.

You're no better.<eos> I didn't say I was different or better.<eos> Hell, I sympathize. I sympathize completely.<eos> Apathy is a solution.<eos> It's easier to lose yourself in drugs... than it is to cope with life.<eos> It's easier to steal what you want than it is to earn it.<eos> It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it.
Now get going.<eos> And leave the clothes... here.<eos> Brother?<eos> All right, tell me what's wrong with it.<eos> Nothing.<eos> The ship is perfect!<eos> Gaila must have paid a fortune for it.<eos> You mean it'll actually fly?<eos> This ship could outrun a Romulan interceptor.<eos> We could take it halfway across the galaxy before it would even need a maintenance check.
- Miles...<eos> - l can do it so it won't hurt at all.<eos> I owe you one, my friend.<eos> You finally got one of us out of our uniform.<eos> Move it.<eos> Where's Alixus?<eos> Get her out here.<eos> Get him some water.<eos> Do you know why this phaser is working now?<eos> I shut down the duonetic field that was stopping it working.
But your friend seems to appreciate that kind of thing.<eos> Different tastes for different people.<eos> Nothing wrong with that.<eos> You'd be surprised how detrimental a poor choice of fashion can be.<eos> Take this dress. It may be all the rage now, but in a very short time it can become an affront to the eyes.<eos> Certain people might even think it's objectionable.<eos> And then... nothing but rags.<eos> I see.<eos> Mr Quark, might I offer you some free advice?<eos> - lf l'm not obliged to follow it.
You know Stan Taylor?<eos> Know me?<eos> Ned Flanders saved me.<eos> I used to party all night and sleep with lingerie models... until Ned and his Bible group showed me that I could have more.<eos> Professional athletes-- always wantin' more.<eos> Ned, they gave me the game ball.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> - [ Gasps ] - Stan, tell you what.<eos> Homer Simpson here is just about the biggest Atom fan... that's ever graced God's green earth.<eos> I bet he'd enjoy it even more than me.

Shake hands on it.<eos> Word of honour.<eos> Little blond hero.<eos> Does he feel this?<eos> Your son's asleep.<eos> If we stop the artificial processes, he'll sleep deeper and deeper.<eos> He doesn't feel anything.<eos> Can't you give him an anaesthetic anyway?<eos> If you want.<eos> Yes, better do it.
The owner of that lot.<eos> He came the other day to ask me if I'd buy that lot.<eos> I don't have so much money.<eos> I have to refuse, but... he was very courteous.<eos> Approaching me so politely, I find it hard to tell him.<eos> Seems he found a buyer.<eos> Yes, I'm glad.<eos> Are you keeping that cat?<eos> I call it Nora, because it's a nora neko (alley cat).<eos> My wife gave it dried fish, and it's lived here.
I sold that to Sir Watkyn Bassett for £1 ,000.<eos> And he has the cool cheek to try and sell it to me for £5.<eos> He's stolen it, of course.<eos> (Tuts) Did he indeed, sir?<eos> I shall impound the object.<eos> We'll need that as evidence.<eos> Come along, Joe, the game is up.<eos> Thank you for your help, Major Plank.<eos> Alpine Joe, we call him, sir, on account of his peculiar headgear.<eos> - He's got it on now.
You know, "primavera" is Italian for "spring."<eos> - No?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Really, I'm terribly sorry.<eos> It's just all of a sudden, it just hit me.<eos> So you were saying, about the script.<eos> Right.<eos> The script.<eos> Your script needs...<eos> It needs...

In this case, Monsieur Maillot talked about an experiment with blowflies in a matchbox.<eos> This is not...<eos> Watching the flies one can understand human behavior.<eos> But not historical events like the Napoleonic Wars.<eos> I don't understand what the flies should help there.<eos> Take another letter.<eos> "Mr. Director, I'm concerned over the fact... that our children are taught not to trust their parents..." - It's not true!<eos> - But parents often spoil their children.<eos> - But...<eos> - The child itself knows... what it will benefit from.
Don't you see they are only lambs?<eos> For Dulcinea! For Dulcinea!<eos> Come back, sir Don Quixote.<eos> - What is that guy doing? - Go away, you bastard!<eos> Go back.<eos> Go away, son of a bitch.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Lauracalco has betrayed me.<eos> Didn't you realise they were sheep?<eos> I remember having read that a knight called Diego Pérez Vargas, having lost his sword in a battle, pulled a oak up and crushed so much Moors with it, that was called 'the crusher'.
I really belong to the spring.<eos> Every spring, the season smiles just at me.<eos> You're December's child.<eos> You like the cold and ice.<eos> You exaggerate.<eos> Look at the hyacinths prettier than the ones in the garden.<eos> It's a shame it's windy today.<eos> But we need wind, especially now.<eos> It helps some kind of flowers reproduce.
It's obvious he's barking at me.<eos> Every nerve ending is screaming:<eos> "Take off!<eos> Just bail!<eos> Get the fuck outta here!"<eos> Panic hits me like a bucket of water. It hits me right in the face.<eos> I'm standing there, panic-stricken, and the sheriffs look at me, and they can smell it on me.<eos> Sure as that fucking dog can.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Hey, anyway I got my gun drawn, and pointed it at this guy and say:

To see D'homme à hommes.<eos> You'll like it.<eos> What's it about?<eos> The chap who founded the Red Cross and Christian-Jaque will be there.<eos> - We've seen several of his.<eos> - He's made 40! All right.<eos> Let's go. I'm going on my bike.<eos> At the intermission,<eos> Christian-Jaque was kind enough to look at my film.<eos> He saw it and thought it wasn't bad.
Then another week went by, and part of a third.<eos> After three entire weeks the child was still alive.<eos> But the doctor was still very negative.<eos> That started to make me angry.<eos> I sat up all night in the kitchen while my poor wife lay awake in the bedroom.<eos> And I sat there, just as the dawn was about to break.<eos> The light outside was just like it is right now.<eos> Then Eija came to me and said I'd made a mistake.<eos> I realized she was right.<eos> If that baby was going to make it, it needed all my love.
You know?<eos> Next week after test going to come a few to see you.<eos> If you want.<eos> - Here?<eos> - If you prefer stayed in the bar downstairs.<eos> Silly.<eos> Look what I painted.<eos> Do not worry; if we are going to come also in disguise, to see costumes.<eos> The prince is the most cool,<eos> - It is my aunt.

It's me.<eos> How are you?<eos> My legs hurt.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> Here I am again.<eos> Just like your father.<eos> Wait till I'm gone.<eos> What would I do without you?<eos> Where's the cat?<eos> Give it some water.
This madhouse needs one more good going over.<eos> Good idea.<eos> But try and be back by six.<eos> - Professor, look.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Around here, the forces of darkness don't wait until midnight.<eos> - Professor, I thought the lift was broken.<eos> - I mended it.<eos> Very clever, climbing up the lift shaft, but I had hoped Control might bring something with it, and for that it will need the lift.
It'll pass by quickly.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Oh, goody, it's back on.<eos> Look!<eos> Look at that!<eos> It's completely upside-down!<eos> The Freedom Adventurer has been shaken by great winds...<eos> It's like a balloon in that position.<eos> It has broken loose from its mooring and drifted into an upside-down position.<eos> A desperate, last-ditch effort is being made to tie the dirigible down... and keep it from drifting away.

Get in there and spend some money.<eos> Keep me in the manner that I'm accustomed to.<eos> Very good. How are you? Get in there and spend some money, you two.<eos> What do you think of my rowing boat?<eos> - Jesus Christ!<eos> - Come aboard, ye land lubber.<eos> Baccarat crystal.<eos> Louis Treize, voila.<eos> Should we let it breathe?<eos> It hasn't breathed in 50 years. It's dead. Let's just drink it.

When the child was a child, it walked with its arms swinging.<eos> It wanted the stream to be a river, the river a torrent... and this puddle to be the sea.
I'm reading an article about shark fishing in Florida.<eos> So?<eos> They found an old treasure chest full of gold coins.<eos> Yeh, in Florida.<eos> Here in Iceland they've been looking for one treasure ship for twenty years, and they haven't so much as found a single bloody deck nail.<eos> Christ it'd be fun going to Florida.<eos> We might find some treasure like those shark fishermen.<eos> Well, it'd be fun for the sharks at least getting a nice Christmas roast like you to keep them happy in the water.<eos> I thought we decided you'd throw that suit away after you didn't make out in it last time.<eos> Give it one more try this weekend.

- You ever catch one?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> What was that you were doing on those stumps over there?<eos> - Called Crane Technique.<eos> - Does it work?<eos> - lf do right, no can defense.<eos> - Could you teach me?<eos> First learn stand, then learn fly.<eos> Nature rule, Daniel-san. Not mine.<eos> - Where'd you learn it from?

Those chaps carry British passports.<eos> If any of them have to die, it'll be by a British bullet.<eos> Please give me a little room?<eos> Go ahead. Do your best.<eos> Delgado!<eos> Delgado, your mother and I are both here.<eos> Oh, no! I can't handle this.<eos> On television, too!<eos> It's emotional blackmail, Delgado.<eos> Don't go for it.
There's a stain of yellow custard used in making tarts on your lapel, and your shape convinced me you've eaten many before.<eos> - There's no need to be rude.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Hang on, where are we going?<eos> - Do you want to miss Chemistry class?<eos> - By the way, what's your name?<eos> - Holmes.<eos> Sherlock Holmes.<eos> The deductive mind never rests, Watson.<eos> It's like a finely-tuned instrument. It demands practice.

Easy as cake, huh?<eos> Pie. Easy as pie.<eos> I have no indication here.<eos> No magnetic field.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm having difficulty gauging distance.<eos> Radar signals are not bouncing back.<eos> That pod looks awful small.<eos> Good.<eos> That means there's nothing threatening about it.

Shoot!<eos> Shoot!<eos> Here!<eos> Keep him!<eos> Another point!<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> Pass!<eos> Too bad!<eos> Give me the ball, I'm going mad!<eos> Why are your kicking it at his eyes?
Can I go fishing too?<eos> How come the gun, Mike?<eos> Just because I'm giving away gas, I'm no fool.<eos> You too.<eos> Ones that never been here, ones that never had time for us, for Hiroshi.<eos> Hiroshi.<eos> Well, I'll accept the gas, Mike, but only if you and Hiroshi come over for a meal.<eos> I wanna repay you somehow.<eos> The gas has been paid for, missus, many times.<eos> I just hope you get to have a use for it.

Tell her before it's too late.<eos> Run to the light, baby!<eos> - Mommy's in the light!<eos> - Tell her you're waiting for her.<eos> Mommy is waiting for you in the light!<eos> I hate you for this.<eos> Now clear your minds.<eos> It knows what scares you.<eos> It has from the very beginning.<eos> Don't give it any help.
- Great.<eos> Who's got access to it ?<eos> I guess I'm the only one.<eos> And I got the only key.<eos> Would that test have worked, Doc ?<eos> - Oh, I think so, yes.<eos> - Somebody else sure as hell thought so.<eos> Well, who else could have used that key ?<eos> Nobody !<eos> I just give it to Copper whenever he needs it !

eaten moderately what was in season drunk fine claret<eos> slept in my own sheets<eos> I shall live long.<eos> When I was fifty they dismounted us and sent us up the line.<eos> 'Old men stay at the base', the orders said.<eos> Old venerables. My commanding.... my nearest neighbors, he said.<eos> 'You are as fit as the youngest'....<eos> So I was. So I am now if only I could breathe.<eos> When summer comes I shall leave my bed and sit in the open air and breathe more freely.<eos> When the wind comes down the valley and a man can turn to meet it
But can you do it?<eos> No.<eos> But I'll tell you who can.<eos> Tell us!<eos> I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me.<eos> A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate!<eos> Yet I will design it for you!<eos> A computer which can calculate the Answer to the Ultimate Question, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix.<eos> You yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its 10-million-year program!<eos> Yes, I shall design this computer for you and I shall name it also unto you and it shall be called the Earth!
The total effect is a system which responds in what I can only describe as an eccentric manner.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> A computer must, by definition, be logical.<eos> But it can also mirror the logic of its creator.<eos> - You mean it's an extension of his mind. - No, that is not what I mean.<eos> - His personality, then.<eos> - A better definition, but still not quite accurate.<eos> Would it know how the booby traps on the Orbiter are programmed?<eos> As yet, I don't have enough data to answer that question.<eos> If it knew, could you extract the information from it?
I do not understand.<eos> Understanding is not necessary to your task, Consul.<eos> Now listen carefully and obey without question.<eos> Well, I had no idea your science was this highly advanced.<eos> It has to be.<eos> To protect and expand a great power which our Keeper exercises on our behalf.<eos> Oh, yes, I've read about your Keeper.<eos> The chosen Keeper dedicates himself to the bioelectronic system.<eos> The Source, yes.<eos> From it he organises the whole Traken Union.
She loves to read.<eos> I can't find enough books to lend her.<eos> Don't you have some to lend her?<eos> Sure. I brought some. I'll gladly be of service to your cousin.<eos> I hope they'll appeal to her.<eos> As long as it's print!<eos> She even reads military handbooks.<eos> Colonel, I'll get them before she comes down.<eos> Fosca's in bed today. Give them to me later.<eos> The trick is to soften the breadstick, stirring. But without letting it crumble.

The Lord Thaarn wishes to see you.<eos> (TARRANT) She stays with us.<eos> Take her.<eos> She will come to no harm, provided that you cooperate, of course.<eos> Groff is especially anxious that you should cooperate.<eos> He is Krandor's senior technician... and has many, many targets that must be met.<eos> There is a member of your crew we cannot find. Orac.<eos> Where is he?<eos> The neuronic whip is on an automatic setting.<eos> It has only to sense one lie and it will boil your brains in your skull.
I don't know if there'll be one labeled "Mars."<eos> But if there is I bet it will be full of organic molecules.<eos> There's another way to search for life on Mars to seek out the discoveries and delights which that heterogeneous environment promises us.<eos> One of the things that a grasshopper can do but Viking can't is move.<eos> We landed in the dull places on Mars.<eos> For all the solid, scientific findings and hints which Viking provided we know that there are many places on the planet far more interesting.<eos> What we need is a roving vehicle with advanced experiments in biology and organic chemistry able to land in the safe but dull places and wander to the interesting places.<eos> This roving vehicle was developed by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.<eos> It has a long list of dumb things it knows not to do.<eos> A Mars rover hasn't got time to ask if it should attempt a steep slope.
And so on.<eos> There are many hypotheses in science which are wrong.<eos> That's all right.<eos> It's the aperture to finding out what's right.<eos> Science is a self-correcting process.<eos> To be accepted, new ideas must survive the most rigorous standards of evidence and scrutiny.<eos> The worst aspect of the Velikovsky affair is not that many of his ideas were wrong or silly or in gross contradiction to the facts.<eos> Rather, the worst aspect is that some scientists attempted to suppress Velikovsky's ideas.<eos> The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion or in politics, but it is not the path to knowledge.<eos> And there's no place for it in the endeavor of science.
I will drive them all from our domain.<eos> Only one castle has fallen.<eos> You need not go yourself.<eos> He must study Ieyasu's moves to understand his purposes.<eos> The Tokugawa army has burned Okabe Castle.<eos> Now they are surrounding Futamata Castle.<eos> We must counterattack now to save Futamata.<eos> The castle is protected by Anayama.<eos> It is impregnable.<eos> If it is in danger, he will ask the lord for help.

And so on.<eos> There are many hypotheses in science which are wrong.<eos> That's all right.<eos> It's the aperture to finding out what's right.<eos> Science is a self-correcting process.<eos> To be accepted, new ideas must survive the most rigorous standards of evidence and scrutiny.<eos> The worst aspect of the Velikovsky affair is not that many of his ideas were wrong or silly or in gross contradiction to the facts.<eos> Rather, the worst aspect is that some scientists attempted to suppress Velikovsky's ideas.<eos> The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion or in politics, but it is not the path to knowledge.<eos> And there's no place for it in the endeavor of science.
I will drive them all from our domain.<eos> Only one castle has fallen.<eos> You need not go yourself.<eos> He must study Ieyasu's moves to understand his purposes.<eos> The Tokugawa army has burned Okabe Castle.<eos> Now they are surrounding Futamata Castle.<eos> We must counterattack now to save Futamata.<eos> The castle is protected by Anayama.<eos> It is impregnable.<eos> If it is in danger, he will ask the lord for help.
Obviously, if he doesn't eat, nor fuck, doesn't sleep or anything--<eos> I told you he "barely" ate, or drank, or fucked...<eos> So, as it is, how old is he?<eos> - Well... it depends.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> He's a guy that has lived for 27 years... but is... 12.<eos> - I know several.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> Hey, there he is, stop, stop.<eos> Blow the horn, blow it, where is it?
-Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.<eos> Five hundred meters.<eos> Viewer ahead, sir.<eos> Hold relative position here.<eos> Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!<eos> Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!<eos> Mr Spock, can that be one of their crew?<eos> A probe from their vessel, Captain.<eos> Plasma, energy combination.<eos> Don't interfere with it!
As much as you wanted the Enterprise, I want this.<eos> Captain.<eos> Spock, did we just see the beginning of a new life form?<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> We witnessed a birth.<eos> -Possibly, a next step in our evolution.<eos> -I wonder.<eos> Well, it's been a long time since I delivered a baby, and I hope we got this one off to a good start.<eos> I hope so, too.<eos> I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose out of our own human weaknesses and the drive that compels us to overcome.

Torvin.<eos> Are you...<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I feel...<eos> The material is too strong.<eos> I am in danger of depleting my power packs.<eos> It's all right, K9.<eos> Why has the animal stopped?<eos> Because if you want to kill the Creature, K9 must have some power left.<eos> But so far, it's had no effect on the shell whatsoever.

Without fear of God!<eos> I'll tell your husband!<eos> This is a bit younger, still dances...<eos> Thank you, thank you, gentlemen, thank you, thank you, kind gentlemen, thank you, kindest ladies,<eos> a coin of happiness removes the sadness.<eos> Thanks Grandpa, thank you, good luck, good luck to all and good night, thank you and good night.<eos> The social order, unfortunately, is always lagging behind the new demands of life.<eos> Only when become of common possession the achievements of knowledge and of progress, then we can finally talk about new achievements of civilization.<eos> When a better justice and respect for every right of the citizen become daily norm, institution, rule of life accepted and practiced by all, when no one will be able to enjoy privileges that are denied to others, then only we can say that we have built a democratic society.<eos> Unfortunately, social progress walks slowly, hampered by those who fear it, but also, above all, not supported with sufficient courage and sacrifice by those who call on it instead as a human right!

He just went into the woods and never came back<eos> I yelled for him, but he didn't answer<eos> Are you a criminal?<eos> - Why? Are you scared?<eos> I was just thinking, when you came out of the woods - that you could be an escaped convict<eos> Hey, you have a rabbit!<eos> That's not a rabbit.<eos> It's a hare. I found it<eos> Poor little thing.<eos> I'll fetch some carrots for it
And regrown grain<eos> The nature reserve law states it's forbidden to have wild animals as pets<eos> This hare has to be officially declared<eos> I'll write you a permission<eos> Certification<eos> I hereby certify, that the one in possession of the certificate, Vatanen, - has the right to keep and feed a wild field hare, - because it has an injured back leg - and might have died<eos> Mikkeli, today<eos> U. Kärkkäinen<eos> The wilderness care district in Southern Savonia<eos> And it likes meadow vetchling and all sorts of vetch

It seems you two are doing well.<eos> Almost too well.<eos> We'll have to expand and get bogged down in bureaucracy.<eos> You have a minute?<eos> - Sure, but I'm already late.<eos> I should have been at work half an hour ago.<eos> I have no schedule. I work when others eat, and vice versa. No one bothers me.<eos> I can breathe.<eos> - You're not the only one.<eos> I have a schedule, but I'm not obliged to follow it.

I'm accused of preaching violence, but capitalism has made violence a daily thing.<eos> For capitalism means exploitation, humiliation, and repression of a vast majority.<eos> Am I in charge of the National Guard?<eos> Do I use the third degree?<eos> No!<eos> Nor is it I who invented guerrilla actions; I didn't invent rebellion or mass uprising.<eos> The people did that, when they ransacked the Bank of America,<eos> cut down the apples trees of rich landowners or stormed the metro without paying.<eos> You speak of democracy!<eos> The ruling class always has the system it needs, and the system makes a farce of democracy.
. Reb Nachum, the beggar. And, most important of all, our beloved rabbi.<eos> Rabbi, may I ask you a question?<eos> Certainly, Leibesh. Is there a proper blessing... for the Tzar?<eos> A blessing for the Tzar?<eos> Of course. May God bless and keep the Tzar far away from us!<eos> Then there are the others in our village.<eos> They make a much bigger circle.<eos> We don't bother them and so far, they don't bother us.<eos> And among ourselves, we always get along perfectly well.<eos> Of course, there was the time when he sold him a horse. He told him it was only six years old when it was really 12.

Who's this?<eos> He's a little mate from school, aren't you, dear?<eos> Are you coming in then, love? Come on, up to the table.<eos> Nice bit of ham, Flo. Not bad, is it?<eos> You in the, uh, in the Boy Scouts, Donald? Daniel?<eos> No, the BB.<eos> I was in the Boy Scouts.<eos> Ha ha, dear me! Marvelous, it was.<eos> All those steaming hot cups of cocoa, suet pudding; sing songs around the camp fire: "Oh, we're riding along on the Christopher White!<eos> You know, when the new boy arrived, we used to mix some boot black and tooth paste, and spread it all over— Reg, do you mind?

I know, the voters should be completely informed.<eos> But that's just not possible. They don't really know what's good for them.<eos> This evening, you were good for us.<eos> I really don't know how to thank you.<eos> I have no idea how I'd have gotten along without you.<eos> My wife will be very grateful to you.<eos> My activities have prevented me from going to PTA meetings, but I am acquainted with your Principal.<eos> He'll never set the world on fire, but he's a good man.<eos> Could you find out if he's decorated? I could see about getting a plaque for him.<eos> It might please him, and it would help the boy.
You're jealous. You may kill him.<eos> I'm merely curious to know where people can make a living.<eos> He is now working on the construction of the Turkestan Railroad.<eos> Upon my word, you are too curious. You mustn't be like Othello! You make me laugh, Zosya!<eos> Do I look like that silly old Moor?<eos> I simply want to know on which part of the Turkestan Railroad one can find a job.<eos> He has a job as a switchman in the Little Northern City.<eos> That is its only name.<eos> As a matter of fact, it is just a train.<eos> This train lays down the rails and moves on along them. And another such little city moves to meet it from the south. Then there will be an official union.
They didn't harm me.<eos> Listen to him.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop, please!<eos> - With your death, we win.<eos> - Nobody wins.<eos> Have any more of your men died?<eos> We can't be killed.<eos> There's an alien aboard.<eos> It wants us alive.
Please, Spock, do me a favour, and don't say it's fascinating.<eos> No, but it is interesting.<eos> - Aye, that's got it, Mr. Spock.<eos> - Good. Have you found a solution, a way to shut that thing off?<eos> You don't shut a child off when it makes a mistake.<eos> M-5 is growing, learning.<eos> - Learning to kill.<eos> - To defend itself.<eos> It's quite a different thing.<eos> When a child is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point, if its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was taught, thinks independently.
-Now, wait a minute, this is hardly a job for you.<eos> -Why ever not?<eos> Well, you're a young woman.<eos> This is a job for my men.<eos> Well, of all the bigoted, anti-feminist, cretinous remarks...<eos> This is no job for a girl like you.<eos> Now, that's final.<eos> Oh, you...<eos> You man!<eos> I'll get in touch with my photographic unit and get them onto it.

I thought that she loved me.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Oh, that's what it is...<eos> Hurtig, you need to think up something.<eos> - I guess we are the only passengers on the deck.<eos> All the others are already asleep.<eos> I cannot hear anyone in the whole universe.<eos> Is there a fan in your cabin?<eos> Yes, but it doesn't work.
It's this blasted heat.<eos> Sorry again, Jeff.<eos> No harm done.<eos> But take it easy.<eos> Buying up the whole place?<eos> We've got to keep cool.<eos> The Met Station's like an oven.<eos> They envy us on the mainland. My publisher's threatening to pay me a visit.<eos> Tell him to bring some snow.<eos> We could use it.
Barcuna?<eos> The Marakeets cannot fight his curse.<eos> Already half of my people are dead.<eos> It's not Barcuna, Manlo.<eos> It's a sickness.<eos> And the doctor can help.<eos> It is the curse of Barcuna!<eos> By morning my people will be destroyed.<eos> Is this how a great chief leads his people?<eos> Will you allow your village to die without even trying to save it?
Oh, it's adorable.<eos> What is it?<eos> What is it?<eos> Why, lovely lady, it's a tribble.<eos> A tribble?<eos> Only the sweetest creature known to man.<eos> Excepting, of course, your lovely self.<eos> Oh, it's purring.<eos> Listen, it's purring.<eos> It's only saying that it likes you.

But now in Italy is quite easy.<eos> Could you give me...<eos> A cigarette?<eos> Yes....<eos> Thank you<eos> In his writings he asks me to take care of the family crypt.<eos> Do you live at the comandment?<eos> At the castle.<eos> My husband is the nephew of the castle.<eos> It his 300 years old.
Now, Australia.<eos> This place I was at last year, there's this bint.<eos> Farida or something.<eos> She did a sort of a dance.<eos> You should have seen it.<eos> I've woken up a few nights in a cold sweat thinking about it, I can tell you.<eos> Probably some poxed-up old bag from Manchester.<eos> What's the point of that?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I just thought I'd give it a name.

She's always reading magazines and things.<eos> Anything in Bengali.<eos> The trouble is, I can't spare any time to guide her.<eos> But, I think she has talent.<eos> She writes well.<eos> When I was in Monghyr, she wrote me letters.<eos> She has a beautiful style.<eos> The thing is, whatever talent she has you can help bring it out.<eos> Give her some of your time. Guide her. Make her write.<eos> If she really has some talent, it should not be wasted.
Seven, fi...?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Operator?<eos> Operator?<eos> I can't dial.<eos> Operator, a number out at the lake.<eos> I've forgotten it.<eos> It's a Lakeville number.<eos> Malcolm C. Hilyard.<eos> Please dial it for me.
Thus, in accordance with our sacred and ancient laws<eos> I, Prince Zereteli, Regentof Sura, ask forfull powers.<eos> Hooray!<eos> Where are we?<eos> We're near the grottos of the Falcon.<eos> - Do you know them well?<eos> - I've been there once.<eos> Whatare you doing here?<eos> We've been out hunting for the monster all night.<eos> It managed to get into the camp.
Do you understand?<eos> What a wonderful opportunity it gives us to catch him red-handed and to release Chesterton.<eos> (DOCTOR CHUCKLING)<eos> (CLOCK BEEPING)<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> You!<eos> TARRON: Call the prison.<eos> (GASPING) The key!<eos> IAN: How did you know it was there, Doctor?<eos> Well, it had to be.
SUSAN: Sabetha!<eos> IAN: Altos!<eos> (ALL EXCLAIMING)<eos> You heard about Arbitan?<eos> Yes, we met the man who's usurped his place.<eos> (STUTTERING) Give me the key. We must have it destroyed.<eos> SUSAN: Well, Ian gave it to him.<eos> -What?<eos> -What?<eos> You gave it away?

Do we hurt anybody?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> But our marriage doesn´t exist in the Lord´s eyes.<eos> Since when do you know it?<eos> Since the Archbishop explained it to me.<eos> - Did you talk to him about this?<eos> - Yes, seven days ago.<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you tell your father?<eos> It was Francesca.

The one in charge of the transport.<eos> He's a beast. I snuck on the train, too.<eos> If they catch me, they'll make me get off. I'll have to wait for a passenger train, or even fly.<eos> I'm scared of bigger things than you.<eos> I thought you were the lieutenant.<eos> I had a terrible fright and got slapped in the face, and it's all my fault.<eos> I had everything in my bag: my things, some bread, a skirt. Everything.<eos> It's nothing. When you go back, you can find your bag.<eos> - You think so? - Of course.<eos> Where could it go?

You can cure it in adolescence.<eos> I'll cure him all right, but not with your depth psychology and your disastrous understanding for...<eos> - For what?<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Christa.<eos> I've locked him in.<eos> - You've locked him in?<eos> I've locked him in his room because he said that he had to go to see his friend Manfred this evening.<eos> By doing that you'll achieve the opposite.<eos> The boy's too sensitive.<eos> Oh, give it a rest!

I could lead to a new type of television program for adults.<eos> It sounds fascinating.<eos> Did you say that to the Parent's group?<eos> So you do remember what were talking about.<eos> Did you make a full report, Wally?<eos> I'm sure you did.<eos> Well.<eos> This will be a wrench for both of us.<eos> But I couldn't possibly continue to live here.<eos> This new project I couldn't do it justice in an atmosphere of petty domesticity.
Raise new sail! We're running on!<eos> Jump, my hearties!<eos> Jump now!<eos> Where are the crew of the Pequod?<eos> There is not one face I know among 30.<eos> He has snatched their souls.<eos> Look at them.<eos> They are gloves.<eos> Ahab fills them. Ahab moves them.<eos> You must admit, Mr. Starbuck, he called that typhoon's bluff. Stood toe-to-toe with the bully, traded blows with it till it hollered, "Help!"

He was pretty good about it.<eos> I think he got a bit of a shock.<eos> I hope we're not disturbing you.<eos> Not at all.<eos> My father will be sorry he missed your visit.<eos> The twins are great guides.<eos> They were perfect....<eos> very interesting.<eos> The second portrait of the captain of the guard.<eos> It was presented to him by Richelieu, for having killed 14 musketeers.
We can defeat it.<eos> It's dead.<eos> It's taking off!<eos> The controls must have been set.<eos> Go on, get out!<eos> Sandy, you all right?<eos> Larry?<eos> Allan, I thought the brain had no physical being.<eos> What about that monster?<eos> I guess it had to travel here in some form, something to handle the ship.

Lily.<eos> It was an impulse.<eos> I couldn't help it.<eos> Are you trying to tell me after all these years, you were suddenly seized with an irresistible impulse?<eos> Don't you think I wanted to see the children before?<eos> - You never tried!<eos> - Nobody asked me!<eos> - Would it have mattered if we had?<eos> - Naomi, your supper's ready.<eos> Don't let it get cold.
And how.<eos> In England, they settle things and set caution(bail).<eos> What?<eos> - Caution on "Caution"!<eos> - In France it's more difficult.<eos> - In France, it's more crummy. - Yes.<eos> Should we get a lawyer?<eos> A proper one.<eos> Because once he's out...<eos> He knows what my satchel is worth and will make the most of it.

"And up from the bed of the river God scooped the clay,<eos> "And by the bank of the river He kneeled Him down<eos> "And there the great God Almighty<eos> Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky<eos> "Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night<eos> "Who rounded the earth In the middle of His hand<eos> "This Great God<eos> "Like a mother bending over her baby kneeled down in the dust<eos> "Tolling over a lump of clay<eos> Till He had shaped it In His own image
We shall be together always.<eos> Not in my time, Peter, or in yours... but in God's time.<eos> My father brought this to me from Egypt.<eos> It's a crux ansata.<eos> The symbol of life... and eternity.<eos> I've always loved it.<eos> In some strange way I knew my life and this cross were bound together.<eos> I'll leave it here for you.<eos> Perhaps no one will find it until you come.<eos> Maybe it will bridge the time between us.

That's a long story, my friend.<eos> I never did like sitting on newspapers.<eos> I did it once, and the headlines came off on my white pants.<eos> It actually happened.<eos> Nobody bought a paper that day.<eos> They just followed me around town and read the news off the seat of my pants.<eos> Oh, fresh guy, huh?<eos> What you need's a good sock on the nose.<eos> Listen, partner... you may not like my nose, but I do.<eos> I always wear it out in the open... where if anybody wants to sock it, they can.

– Derek's trapped in this village, you know.<eos> – I'm trapped!<eos> He's brilliant at his job and he has to work with the woman he loved, or loves, who ran off with a cynic.<eos> Actually, maybe under those circumstances, you might find it hard to make an effort.<eos> I mean, what would you do?<eos> I'd scuttle back to the pawnbroker's, pick up my spine and piss off!<eos> Piss off, Derek.<eos> How am I supposed to see you, appearing out of nowhere like that?<eos> Useless V people!<eos> So, the heart, that big muscle, pumps the blood round the body, giving it the energy it needs.
We don't know how much staff energy will go through into the colonel.<eos> Your objection is noted.<eos> Do it!<eos> Again!<eos> - No change.<eos> - Sir, it just absorbed the energy.<eos> This weapon is ineffective. I shall try another.<eos> No!<eos> Sir, that staff energy's gone somewhere.<eos> We could be feeding it what it wants.
Right at the end, you didn't stick your fingers out straight, did you?<eos> What! ? Are you saying my pose wasn't right?<eos> Eh? After making me go through that embarrassing pose over and over again, you would say that! ?<eos> Well now, you can't combine, can you?<eos> This is a delight!<eos> H- how come Grandpa and Vegeta can't do Fusion?<eos> I don't understand it either.<eos> It could be that Goku-san's Super Saiyan 4 power is low...<eos> Going through Fusion consumes a great deal of Ki as it is.<eos> And after they've taken that many of Yi Xing Long's attacks head-on not even Super Saiyan 4 Goku-san could withstand it.
At morning, the flowers which line the meadows are more beautiful.<eos> "But for whom are these flowers?"<eos> you ask! Do you?<eos> For whom?<eos> Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!<eos> Don't say anything to my husband, to my husband, but they are for the handsome shepherd who lives just here, who lives just here, who lives just here,<eos> don't say anything to my husband, don't say anything to my husband.<eos> Every day like this I bring the lovely shepherd beautiful cornflowers, which I tremblingly hang on his door,<eos> and my poor heart throbs and races.<eos> So for whom does it beat so fast? Do you ask? Do you?
This is what I was afraid would happen, but it's been coming for a long time.<eos> Ever since Sheridan got back.<eos> Before he went to Z'Ha'Dum he never would've gone up against his own, our own government, like this.<eos> I don't know, maybe he thinks he's Alexander the Great and maybe he thinks he's John the Baptist and maybe he wants to take over the whole operation for himself.<eos> That's the part that worries me.<eos> That's the part that made me come back here.<eos> Mars.<eos> I can't believe I'm back on Mars.<eos> Three times before, this place almost killed me.<eos> I swore I'd never give it another chance to finish the job.
Come on.<eos> Richard.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Take the body, Brother Fuliginous.<eos> But.<eos> But father...<eos> What is it?<eos> He's not dead.<eos> One of those, eh?<eos> Ah well, we will look after the poor creature until it passes on to its ultimate reward.
Oh, my God, yes!<eos> I would love that!<eos> That's so sweet, Joey.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> And now, for the great news.<eos> That wasn't the great news?<eos> Only if you think it's better than this.<eos> Snow-in-a-Can!<eos> You want me to decorate the window?<eos> Give it kind of a Christmas looky?
No point resisting. You're outnumbered and trapped.<eos> Where are the rest of you?<eos> Where's Wallace?<eos> - Father.<eos> - Ah, come in. Come in.<eos> A rebellion has begun.<eos> - Under whom?<eos> - A commoner... named William Wallace.<eos> You will embrace this rebellion.<eos> Support it from our lands in the North.
I liked the other face better.<eos> Do you know who I got it from?<eos> Marshall Richard Cooper.<eos> Name ring a bell?<eos> Do you know how we got it off him?<eos> Just like your buddy Chuck, we ripped it off.<eos> He was screaming something about God and Jesus.<eos> You"re in the wrong place.<eos> I took his face.<eos> He didn"t have much use for it.
It's too risky!<eos> But if I make it, everyone will be saved.<eos> The hatch can be opened as soon as our signal is cut off.<eos> You'll be able to enter through the back pack.<eos> "Hope".<eos> That's the password to delete the programming.<eos> Thank you.<eos> JA is the target.<eos> There's a danger of meltdown in five minutes.<eos> Therefore, we cannot allow it to get any closer to a populated area. Hyuga?
Do not attempt to come here again.<eos> Any approach will be met with resistance.<eos> Any ship attempting to land will be destroyed.<eos> When the time is right, we will be here, waiting for you.<eos> But not until then.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Better get Pierce.<eos> The enemy ship is headed for the planet.<eos> - Did they get the message?<eos> - They didn't believe it.
You endangered a quarter million humans and aliens to raise your profit margin!<eos> I thought I'd control it.<eos> I didn't expect anyone to be hurt.<eos> - And the murdered customs guard?<eos> - We had to get them past customs.<eos> Nelson said he'd do it.<eos> I didn't ask how.<eos> There was too much at stake.<eos> That's why the weapon bonded to him, not us.<eos> - It needed someone willing to kill.
I know Phil.<eos> He's a good friend.<eos> We play softball together.<eos> - How could this be?<eos> - Oh, it be.<eos> Have you got any other friends you wanna set me up with?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, how was your date with Phil Tatola?<eos> He took it out.<eos> Well, maybe it needed some air.
Based on your knowledge of its behaviour, can we set up a forcefield to hold him?<eos> We could reverse polarity on the energy fields.<eos> - lt's only a guess.<eos> - Set it up on the Promenade.<eos> I want a lot of room.<eos> Major, station security teams along the perimeter.<eos> How will we get him out of the conduits?<eos> We could use some R-F energy bursts to attract him.<eos> There's only one way that you'll attract that creature into your trap.<eos> It's me it's after.
- I want to know what happened.<eos> - I'll be right there.<eos> Shit.<eos> I can't blow this.<eos> I didn't touch him, the car skidded.<eos> - Went off the cliff. - You imbecile!<eos> Uncle...<eos> What about his heart?<eos> What about it?<eos> Did you hurt it in any way?
Both sides ready to explode.<eos> I heard us scream and then suddenly we were drowning.<eos> I heard bubbles like in a milkshake, and then just as I was drowning and exploding, I saw we'd never leave this place again.<eos> The knife gone and I screamed.<eos> He was coming and his blood splattered the walls, the fridge, the stove, the tables and I kissed him all over, kissed the wound on his throat and tasted his blood. It was all over me!<eos> He was shuddering, arching and trembling just like me.<eos> I looked at him.<eos> He was beautiful.<eos> He wasn't holding his throat.<eos> I was worried it had hurt, but I'm sure it didn't.
- I don't know.<eos> - This morning or last night.<eos> - You've been here all night?<eos> Becky thinks I've already got this promotion.<eos> - You told her that?<eos> - Gwen did.<eos> What do you think? Can you show this to Moseby?<eos> - You better do it.<eos> He likes you.<eos> Davis, if I take that in there and Moseby starts carrying on... about how brilliant it is, I'm going to take the credit.
One was not with Lee-Wortley...<eos> I lament to have deceived it, Monsieur Welwyn.<eos> This morning I asked the Mademoiselle Sarah who was going to warn His Highness.<eos> Quite great.<eos> Et voilá. The ruby.<eos> Unfortunately, Mademoiselle Sarah, for me it was more obvious what what the plays of seduction between you and Monsieur Desmond Lee-Wortley they had been carefully planned.<eos> - A disguise, it means.<eos> - I lament.<eos> He was needing an alibi.<eos> It was not necessary in London, while the had woman since his sister was stealing the jewel.
But when our attention turned from outer space to the wooded areas surrounding Twin Peaks, he became destructively obsessive.<eos> Earle acted in an overzealous and secretive manner.<eos> Possessive of his assignments, finally violent.<eos> He was removed from the project.<eos> I found this in the project archives.<eos> These- - These evil sorcerers, dugpas, they're called, they cultivate evil for the sake of evil, nothing else.<eos> They express themselves in darkness for darkness without leavening motive.<eos> Now, this- - This ardent purity allows them to access a secret place where the cultivation of evil proceeds in exponential fashion, and with it, the furtherance of evil's resulting power.<eos> This place of power is tangible and as such, it can be found, entered and perhaps utilized in some fashion.<eos> The dugpas have many names for it, but chief among them is the-- Is the Black Lodge.
- You do this with your spare time?<eos> - It's an incredible breakthrough.<eos> A psycho-reactive substance.<eos> It responds to emotional states.<eos> Mood slime?<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> This stuff actually feeds on bad vibes?<eos> - We're testing positive reactions.<eos> - What kind of test?<eos> We sing to it and talk to it and say supportive things to it.
No, Mr. Bagley, it does not.<eos> We'll speak about that in a moment... when we've had a look at this boil.<eos> What you mean is you want me to have a look at it.<eos> What would you say if I said you don't want to look at it... because you're frightened of what you might see?<eos> I'd say you'd be absolutely right.<eos> Isn't that trying to pretend it doesn't exist?<eos> Isn't that exactly what you're accusing everyone else of doing?<eos> Now, we must reduce this guilt in two ways.<eos> First. It must be physically reduced with surgery.<eos> And secondly we must reduce your punishing conscience... by refusing to allow it to hide.
For the third year running, Algiers is seeing a number of campers from France and elsewhere flying in to enjoy a holiday.<eos> Thanks to Air France, what was once the preserve of millionaires is now a popular weekend break.<eos> "A camel to suit any budget" would be... a good slogan for Camp Matifou.<eos> I had the urge to go and join her, to see what she was plotting.<eos> But she might have misinterpreted my move.<eos> And I was afraid a colleague from Cahiers might see me with her.<eos> Fowl plague is an infectious disease which afflicts all farmyard birds but, under natural conditions, the most significant losses occur among chickens.<eos> Scientists have been aware of this disease since the late 19th century.<eos> It seems to have been identified for the first time in Italy by Perroncito in 1878.<eos> But it was in 1901 that Centanni classified the disease gave it the name by which we now know it and demonstrated that its causative agent was a filterable virus.
Get dressed.<eos> And so gradually I got preoccupied with the thoughts about the state, and, with sadness and amazement, I came to understand that we all were living each to his own liking, and hardly anyone cared for the state's interests.<eos> And even if anybody shouts at every street corner about its interests, he's just pretending, his self comes first, he just wants to look vanguard, and thus steal more.<eos> Take sedatives.<eos> I saw how our state was being squandered.<eos> Each does his best at his place.<eos> And still our state is alive.<eos> What is it alive by?<eos> And I came to a conclusion - by its structure.<eos> The structure of the state is such that even with the minimum that we're giving it, it is still capable of strengthening itself by some way.
Is there money in it?<eos> Yes.<eos> How much?<eos> - How should I know?<eos> I can't get it open.<eos> Wait, don't do a thing.<eos> All you ever gave me Was sorrow and pain<eos> But that's alright, I can hide my ache.<eos> I won't let people know For if you leave me now<eos> My heart will cry But it mustn't show.
Still at it.<eos> You mean Natsuo Yamagata? Landscapes?<eos> I've seen some of them.<eos> At least you don't attempt to paint human bodies.<eos> Forgive his bluntness.<eos> Takei and I were just talking about art.<eos> And what did you decide?<eos> I got interested because of the way Michelangelo and Rodin treated the human body.<eos> The human body is the work of art.<eos> It doesn't need artists.
I checked the sensors.<eos> This creature is formed from antimatter.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Then it's worse than I feared.<eos> But the creature failed.<eos> It's not in our dimension now.<eos> Oh, it is somewhere and halfway to achieving its purpose.<eos> It won't have given up that easily.<eos> To remain in this universe, the creature would have to reverse its polarity.<eos> -If it failed...
Which means that we'd better be ready for them.<eos> It's not the thing they sent before.<eos> Stand by, Dayna.<eos> Something nasty this way comes.<eos> Tarrant, all the energy's draining from the banks.<eos> The blasters are useless.<eos> It would seem that this crude device is intended to frighten primitive people...<eos> - from underdeveloped worlds.<eos> - It's doing a pretty good job on me.<eos> Let's see if it thinks our neutron blaster primitive.
You saved me.<eos> You redeemed me from the pit.<eos> I was in it, Emily.<eos> I was in that ultimate moment of terror that is the beginning of life.<eos> It is nothing.<eos> Simple, hideous nothing.<eos> The final truth of all things is that there is no final Truth.<eos> Truth is what's transitory.<eos> It's human life that is real.<eos> I don't want to frighten you but what I'm trying to tell you is that moment of terror is a real and living horror, living and growing within me now and the only thing that keeps it from devouring me is you.
Misses his mother.<eos> It's all right, little fella.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Easy, easy.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> Fell down a slope chasing after his mum.<eos> Is anything broken?<eos> A clean fracture of the metacarpus.<eos> He should do well with a plaster on it.
The fur coat, the meat, and the wood?<eos> It was you?<eos> I thought I'd help your children.<eos> But as they say, thieves never prosper.<eos> When you build happiness on a lie,<eos> The sand won't hold the water.<eos> You have to pay the price.<eos> And your dreams die.<eos> When you see a young tree die,<eos> You can't but help it.
Do you mean to say you teach the children this stuff?<eos> Yes.<eos> I told you, it is what we believe.<eos> They never learn anything of christianity?<eos> Only as a comparative religion.<eos> The children find it far easier to picture... reincarnation than resurrection.<eos> Those rotting bodies are a great stumbling block for the childish imagination.<eos> Why, of course.<eos> And may I ask, where is the rotting body of Rowan Morrison?<eos> Right where you'd expect it to be- in the earth.
I can't. - Jo, stop it.<eos> - Be quiet. Stop it.<eos> - What's that screaming?<eos> The whole thing's electro-convulsing.<eos> The power's creating an electrical storm in its brain.<eos> We're going right through the centre of the trauma. Come on.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Jo, try and stop it.<eos> Try and stop it.<eos> Don't let it get a grip on your brain.

- How's that strike you?<eos> - Where?<eos> Right here!<eos> Here! Right now!<eos> Why not?<eos> I've prayed in the streets, the saloons, and the toilets.<eos> It don't matter where if He gets that prayer!<eos> - Shit!<eos> - That's the ticket!<eos> Open your heart and let it flow!
Mr. Pecuchet, if you write that, you know very well, we'd be ruined.<eos> My job is to inform, Madame.<eos> That's all.<eos> Yes or no?<eos> Are Gigi and Charly going to get married?<eos> - They're not in love.<eos> - They're not right for each other.<eos> It's just a question of what? A hundred times a hundred per head each night?<eos> Have I guess right?<eos> We've invested too much time in this affair to allow it to fall apart.
Biles, why are you a freak?<eos> Shag off, you creeps!<eos> Now listen.<eos> You've got to know all the seniors' names.<eos> Ask me who someone is.<eos> Brunning, damn you!<eos> Stop talking!<eos> This term I've just one thing to say to you.<eos> One rule.<eos> Follow it, and you won't go wrong.
As I suspected, it is not a malfunction.<eos> M-5 was merely shutting down power to areas of the ship that do not require it.<eos> Decks 4 and 6 are living quarters, are they not?<eos> - Yes, that's correct.<eos> - And currently unoccupied.<eos> I am not familiar with these instruments, doctor.<eos> You are using an entirely new type of control mechanism.<eos> However, it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before.<eos> Quite right.<eos> As the unit is called upon to do more work, it pulls more power to enable it to do what is required of it, just as the human body draws more energy to run than to stand still.
You want to hear a story, about this boy, he owned a dairy farm...<eos> And his old ma, she was kind of sick, you know.<eos> And the doctor, he called him over and said...<eos> "... Listen, your ma, just lying there, she's just so sick and she's weakly...<eos> "... I want you to try to persuade her to take a little brandy."<eos> "Just to pick her spirits up."<eos> "Ma's a teetotaler," he says, "she wouldn't touch a drop."<eos> "Well, I'll tell you what you do." That's the doc. "Now, I tell you what you do..."<eos> "...you bring in a fresh quart of milk every day..."<eos> "...and you put some brandy in it, see. And you try that."
I simply did not understand.<eos> What is there to understand, Mr. Spock?<eos> I am a Vulcan, doctor.<eos> Pain is a thing of the mind.<eos> The mind can be controlled.<eos> You're only half Vulcan.<eos> What about the human half of you?<eos> It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable.<eos> The creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now, is pressuring me.<eos> It wants this ship.
- Mr. Ambassador, my wife.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - She drinks, too.<eos> That's a fine tan you have there, Colonel.<eos> Might I inquire where you got it?<eos> - Traveling, Ambassador.<eos> - Indeed? - Any place I'd be interested in?<eos> - You'd be interested in every place.<eos> "The sun never sets on the British Empire."<eos> - Not if we can help it, it doesn't.
I demanded, I even begged that you get off my planet.<eos> Can you recognise this thing when you see it?<eos> Professor I'll forego charges up to this point, but this creature is aboard my ship, and I'll have it, or I'll have your skin or both.<eos> I loved Nancy very much.<eos> Few women like my Nancy.<eos> She lives in my dreams.<eos> She walks and sings in my dreams.<eos> And it becomes Nancy for you.<eos> Not because of tricks. It doesn't trick me.<eos> It needs love as much as it needs salt.
Only soldiers.<eos> What other weapons do your soldiers carry?<eos> I refuse to answer that sort of question.<eos> You must answer.<eos> You can do what you like.<eos> I will not tell you anything.<eos> I will not tell you anything!<eos> The creature is becoming aggressive again.<eos> I will force it to answer.<eos> I do not wish it to be damaged.
O, my fair warrior.<eos> O, my dear othello.<eos> It gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me.<eos> O, my soul's joy.<eos> If after every tempest come such calms may the winds blow till their wakened death and let the laboring bark climb hills of seas olympus-high and duck again as low as hell's from heaven.<eos> If it were now to die 'twere now to be most happy for I fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate.<eos> The heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow.<eos> Amen to that, sweet powers.<eos> [LAUGHS] I cannot speak enough of this content. It stops me here.<eos> It is too much of joy.
What reputations do these here need?<eos> They work as hard as Robinson.<eos> He was the first to figure out that you have to work before you can eat.<eos> What a far out concept!<eos> Robinson at Melenany, many Robinsons!<eos> Well, jackass, are you threatening a city person?<eos> The elevator doesn't have to go rusty.<eos> Nobody wants to work by the exhaust, everybody runs away from it.<eos> I've never harmed the cooperative!<eos> You've never helped it either.
I must lead the attack tomorrow.<eos> If the arrow is not withdrawn... it is certain you will die.<eos> Not before tomorrow.<eos> - That's all I need.<eos> - But it's not all I need.<eos> What will there be for you if this battle is lost?<eos> Someone else will lead them.<eos> They have made me their heart.<eos> But their heart is wounded.<eos> It needs to rest.
Boy, oh boy, I'm telling ya. This guy here is really somethin'.<eos> The kid had a lawyer, didn't he?<eos> He presented his case, not you.<eos> - How come you say so much?<eos> - Lawyers aren't infallible.<eos> - Baltimore, please.<eos> - He was court-appointed.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - A lot. He didn't want the case or he resented being appointed.<eos> It's the kind of case that brings no money, no glory, not much chance of winning.
Probably best to relax and regroup.<eos> That is so good!<eos> I will see you tomorrow, then.<eos> She is the strangest girl.<eos> You have done well.<eos> Everything is in place.<eos> When this night's work is done, I will have a mighty ally.<eos> I'll be one step closer to freeing myself from this mystical prison.<eos> I've been trapped here so long, I've nearly forgotten what it's like on the surface.<eos> Well, there'll be time enough to remember when I rule it.
Ah... East on Slowman.<eos> Thanks, Reggie.<eos> Julie is gone to see Murrey.<eos> He'll take her to Da'an the first chance he gets.<eos> Murrey will turn her over to us, we do represent the Companions.<eos> No, he won't let anyone get near her, especially me.<eos> The Calvert coverage was terrific!<eos> Even without Julie showing up.<eos> I wanna 30 minute video assemble from her appearance on our website last night.<eos> We've been given a unique opportunity to spread our message. Let's not waste it.
My God!<eos> I didn't know you were so...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't talk.<eos> I'm gonna go write in my journal.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> If you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But I wanna remove it, not make it savory.
The casualty list is as long as my arm and now they're serving under a man who seems to have left more behind than just an eye in that prison camp.<eos> Do not speak of the Captain in that manner.<eos> Not while I am First Officer.<eos> Look, I like Martok but this crew needs a leader someone who'll remind them of their duty as soldiers of the Empire and they need that leader right now or I promise you, they will explode.<eos> It will not come to that!<eos> I know Martok.<eos> He is a great man.<eos> He will not fail us, but we must give him time.<eos> Time may be the one thing we don't have, Worf.<eos> What happened in that mess hall could happen all over this ship and if you think the blood looks bad on my uniform wait until the decks are dripping with it.
The case is closed.<eos> Do you think that this is easy for me?<eos> I don't want to harm B'Elanna, but I don't have a choice.<eos> That thought has to be contained.<eos> Otherwise, we risk further violence, maybe even a citywide panic.<eos> You told me your people spent centuries learning how to control their violent impulses.<eos> I know we haven't achieved your level of discipline, but we're trying.<eos> I thought you'd understand.<eos> I am not judging your culture.<eos> ln fact, I admire it.
But it isn't.<eos> The next meeting it will be.<eos> These chairs will be filled with your fellow partners people whose eyes you look into for respect acceptance.<eos> They know the situation.<eos> But an excellent idea.<eos> They may know the facts, but they've only heard you tell them.<eos> My presentation may be less exonerating.<eos> My presentation may have the added impact of, well, presentation.<eos> One, if made in front of a jury, would incur embarrassment to your firm.<eos> A firm that, correct me if I'm wrong, cherishes reputation flaunts it for recruitment purposes.
Probably best to relax and regroup.<eos> That is so good!<eos> I will see you tomorrow, then.<eos> She is the strangest girl.<eos> You have done well.<eos> Everything is in place.<eos> When this night's work is done, I will have a mighty ally.<eos> I'll be one step closer to freeing myself from this mystical prison.<eos> I've been trapped here so long, I've nearly forgotten what it's like on the surface.<eos> Well, there'll be time enough to remember when I rule it.
Ah... East on Slowman.<eos> Thanks, Reggie.<eos> Julie is gone to see Murrey.<eos> He'll take her to Da'an the first chance he gets.<eos> Murrey will turn her over to us, we do represent the Companions.<eos> No, he won't let anyone get near her, especially me.<eos> The Calvert coverage was terrific!<eos> Even without Julie showing up.<eos> I wanna 30 minute video assemble from her appearance on our website last night.<eos> We've been given a unique opportunity to spread our message. Let's not waste it.
My God!<eos> I didn't know you were so...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't talk.<eos> I'm gonna go write in my journal.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> If you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But I wanna remove it, not make it savory.

- How did you know?<eos> - Don't hate yourself over the photos.<eos> We should hope that's as dirty as our hands get on this job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Billy.<eos> You know what I said before about drawing lines?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about...<eos> We say we're friends like it's a consolation prize...<eos> The truth um for me... Our friendship is the greatest thing I have.<eos> I cherish it.
He spoke of you often, you know.<eos> Always with great reverence.<eos> Did he say anything before he left?<eos> He gave me his thanks.<eos> It was all he had to give.<eos> Delenn?<eos> I finished going over his room and I found only this.<eos> He had very few possessions.<eos> To be with him was to have the strangest feeling.<eos> As though he were only visiting this life and did not want to be overly burdened by it.
- None that I've heard about.<eos> Where's Marcus?<eos> I thought for sure he'd be here.<eos> Something must've come up.<eos> One day, the universe will truly understand itself.<eos> And at that moment, it will transcend itself.<eos> It will become something else, something even greater, another big bang!<eos> Only this time, consciously directed because this time the universe will know exactly what it's doing.<eos> Right now it kills everything it makes.<eos> Everything it designs, dies.
We have been bombarding a local subspace instability with verteron particles.<eos> If all goes according to plan, the Barzan wormhole should reopen at our present location in a matter of hours.<eos> And if all doesn't go according to plan?<eos> One way or another, you're coming with us.<eos> We've been kidnapped... snatched... from the embrace of bliss.<eos> It's all over.<eos> No more limitless profits... no more unquestioning adulation of the masses... no more quadruple lobe rubs.<eos> If I'm not mistaken, Captain, the Federation has rules, and those rules forbid you to interfere with indigenous cultures.<eos> What about your interference?<eos> You've taken these people's religion and manipulated it for your own selfish purposes, pretended to be their Sages.

Nice dress.<eos> You fool.<eos> What's that noise?<eos> The source of all Shang Tsung's power. The souls of 1[dead warriors.<eos> Face your enemy.<eos> Is that all you've got, sorcerer?<eos> Liu Kang! I can see into your soul.<eos> You will die.<eos> Face yourself.<eos> You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Whatever we find in here, you haven't had time to process everything.<eos> - I'm OK.<eos> - You couldn't go to your father's funeral,.__ _.and if something in here was to cast doubt on the kind of man he was...<eos> I just know how it would affect me.<eos> You called me.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> About?<eos> I may have located the digital tape you're looking for.<eos> You may have located it?<eos> Yes, although it may fall into the hands of people... _.who might use it for purposes not your own.

Oh, I've got it!<eos> It's "Next Stop, Pottersville."<eos> Goody!<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> "Next Stop, Pottersville." You are a genius.<eos> You'll love this car, even if you don't like Jon Voight.<eos> I like Jon Voight.<eos> Just seems like a strange reason to buy a car because he might have driven it.<eos> What do you mean, "might"?<eos> - You don't think he really owned it?

What, we'll have, uh, a coupon day or something.<eos> Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, um... staggers me.<eos> Well, thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I think things are a little bit different... than you and I feared.<eos> Yeah. They're a lot worse.<eos> Now wait a second. We haven't even seen the park yet, and you<eos> - No, Donald, Donald.<eos> Donald, let him talk.<eos> I want to hear every viewpoint. I really do. Yeah.<eos> Don't you see the danger, uh,John, inherent in what you're doing here?<eos> Genetic power's the most awesome force the planet's ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that's found his dad's gun.
Would you take this, too?<eos> Ma'am, if you need anything, please tell us.<eos> Thank you very much, everyone.<eos> We trouble you all the time.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> I want an umbrella.<eos> Take this one, sir.<eos> Our bathroom is... that new building over there.<eos> It doesn't have a roof.<eos> Therefore, on rainy days such as today... we can't use it.
Hmm. That doesn't sound like they like you at all.<eos> You're right.<eos> First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head.<eos> Batten down those cowlicks. Straighten that part.<eos> Uncross those eyes, mister.<eos> - But I can't!<eos> - Oh, sorry, Quigley.<eos> Come on, honey. Smile!<eos> I bet you've got a beautiful smile.<eos> Why don't you share it with the world?

I can't believe this.<eos> Do you have any idea what kind of an inspiration your work is to people?<eos> No, I, uh... I mean, I know people-- friends of mine who want to be<eos> Holli Would when they grow up.<eos> -Really?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Sparks, the goons, all of them.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Your stuff, it's like crucial spiritual nourishment for people.<eos> They live on it.

But I haven't any money.<eos> Have you nothing to swap? Books or games?<eos> Why are you rushing about?<eos> - He's got ants in his pants!<eos> - He'll get over it.<eos> All right, Mr Dubuisson?<eos> We fill the tank. We have a chat.<eos> I was looking for you...<eos> I didn't want you to go knowing you were angry...<eos> So I got the camera, but I had no idea how to use it.
We made love that night.<eos> Violently, silently.<eos> As if we didn't know one another.<eos> Like two strangers, who had meet for the first time in the darkness of a moviehouse.<eos> When I woke up in the morning, he was gone.<eos> He never came back again.<eos> I was in such a pain when I lived with him.<eos> I couldn't breathe... I was lost.<eos> He had a secret wound.<eos> The fact that he didn't share it with me was unbearable.
I was quite content with the notion of returning with these trinkets.<eos> I'd "invent" about one a year.<eos> But now, look what fortune has graced me with.<eos> You will take a little longer to figure out than a tricorder but it should be well worth the effort.<eos> If the auto-timer is programmed the way I think it is in... about two minutes, we should be on our way back to a place called New Jersey.<eos> I'm afraid you won't be awake for the ride.<eos> I assume your handprint will open this door whether you are conscious or not.<eos> That weapon was working yesterday.<eos> You were right to suspect him, sir but he is not from the future. He is from the past.<eos> Trying to make my history unfold in a way other than it already has, eh, Professor?

Blow them out.<eos> They've given us two weeks.<eos> I can't do any more after that.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> Are you looking at my hands?<eos> They were beautiful once. Now, they give me away.<eos> Did you go through this?<eos> Let your pleasure be your guide. Your pleasure as a woman.<eos> And don't forget, there are two things that have no limit:<eos> femininity and the means of taking advantage of it.

Do you believe her?<eos> I have no doubts regarding Number 25's abilities. We have all sorts of data that substantiate her abilities.<eos> What about you, Colonel?<eos> My job isn't to believe or disbelieve.<eos> It's to act or not to act.<eos> Cold gear, Colonel.<eos> Please put it on.<eos> You, too, Doctor.<eos> The other day, a young researcher asked me something.<eos> He wondered if their power was the form the next stage of human evolution was taking, and perhaps that we'll all be able to control it someday.
You look terrific.<eos> You're a great liar, Dad.<eos> That's why I love you.<eos> You think it's too dark? - No.<eos> - Neither do I.<eos> - Am I interrupting something?<eos> - No. How are you?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - How's the penthouse?<eos> - Are you enjoying it?
Something terrible's happened.<eos> Or maybe not, I don't know.<eos> But I...<eos> I have to talk to you. It's urgent! Call me at any hour.<eos> My number is 674-95-65...674...<eos> Damn!<eos> - Well?<eos> - Well, what?<eos> Did you get the bonus?<eos> I'm drying my head with it.

- What about him?<eos> He's a little leaky.<eos> Doesn't know whether he's a hare or a hound.<eos> - I don't want him to know a damn thing.<eos> - So I assumed.<eos> Sorry you've become an instrument in the imperial hypocrisy, but there's a lot of it about.<eos> - How's Ann?<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> Karla still got that cigarette lighter she gave you?<eos> Still using it, is he?

Would you mind awfully not doing that?<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't much enjoy it.<eos> Who cares about divorces these days, anyway?<eos> A few old maids?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Charles!<eos> You were pretty nippy getting up here. That exhibition of yours this morning was divine.<eos> You enjoyed it?<eos> I adored it.
Believe me, it's true!<eos> Slap me.<eos> Go!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Fight me!<eos> You're going to hurt me... because I'm your little girl... and no one has ever made love to me.<eos> I have backache.<eos> If I'd found some bleach, I'd have used it to wash myself.
Where's the Doctor?<eos> He's in there.<eos> But it's going to blow any minute.<eos> Well, Doctor.<eos> Of course, the Master.<eos> Welcome to my new ship.<eos> I used to know an ancient remedy for mad dogs.<eos> I must look it up some time.<eos> Good library here, have you?<eos> Unfortunately for you, you will not be using it.

But the Martians of Percival Lowell were, he believed very real.<eos> It was here that the most elaborate claims in support of life on Mars were developed.<eos> Lowell dabbled in astronomy as a young man.<eos> He went off to Harvard.<eos> He had a semiofficial diplomatic appointment to Korea and otherwise engaged in the usual pursuits of the wealthy for his time.<eos> But his lifelong love was the planet Mars.<eos> Lowell was electrified by the announcement in 1877 by an Italian astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli of canali on Mars.<eos> Schiaparelli had reported during a close approach of Mars to the Earth an intricate network of single and double straight lines crisscrossing the bright areas of Mars.<eos> Now, canali in Italian means "channels" or "grooves" but it was promptly translated into English as canals a word which understandably has a certain implication of intelligent design.<eos> A Mars-mania swept through Europe and America and Percival Lowell found himself caught up in it.
Wake me in the year 2000.<eos> The power and the glory.<eos> Amen.<eos> I shall be powerful.<eos> Give others the creeps.<eos> They will all do as I say.<eos> - Hell... -<eos> Come and help me, I say.<eos> Help me with my leg.<eos> I can't move it.

Just try and break me!<eos> I ain't talking for no statement!<eos> Have some respect for a man's life!<eos> This doesn't have to be so hard.<eos> Just tell us about how you killed Shibata.<eos> Where'd you get the stiletto?<eos> Listen here.<eos> Be sure you get this down right.<eos> Chiyoko Hata gave me the stiletto.<eos> She told me I should stab him with it.

Your time is up, conductor give it up!<eos> Your time is up, conductor give it up!<eos> Long live the metronome!<eos> Metronome!<eos> Metronome!<eos> Metronome!<eos> Your time is up, conductor give it up!<eos> Down with the metronome! Music has its rhythm, its cadence! We want to set them!<eos> It is time to stop playing music that works against us<eos> Since we play it, we also want to create it! Conducting is forbidden!

Since it all started.<eos> Or ended.<eos> But you must have the most incredible amount of information.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Might make a Canterbury Tales one day.<eos> Oh, I mean, we had records, but what you've got must be a record of half a nation.<eos> Mmm, certainly a lot of people moving north and south from the Midlands.<eos> Well, look, look, what I want to do is,<eos> I want to get people to join up, to federate, to use whatever technology we've got.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, of course, any information about movement is vital and you've got it!
-Yes, let's fight the Company.<eos> -Fight, yes!<eos> -What is this Company? Can anyone tell me that?<eos> Well, it's just the Company.<eos> -It gave us the suns.<eos> -Of course.<eos> That's what we've been told.<eos> -Shh.<eos> -It's always been the same.<eos> I mean, who runs it?

Yes...<eos> and now all the dead are resuscitated.<eos> I'm sure she's cooking up something.<eos> In any case the bitch knows more than she's telling us.<eos> You're a misogynist, old man!<eos> I don't know, but women like her frighten the pants off me.<eos> She wouldn't need to frighten my pants off.<eos> Do you think she's seen her husband?<eos> I'm sure of it!<eos> It's funny, but when I propose a theory you jump on it with both feet.

She had the power and lost it.<eos> Became useless to me.<eos> You will not make the same mistake,<eos> Solitaire.<eos> Where is Bond now?<eos> I cannot see when you are this way with me.<eos> Things become unclear.<eos> Let us hope these momentary lapses do not become a habit.<eos> Your power exists to serve me.<eos> And it is mine to control.

Wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Would it surprise you to know that one of your hearts stopped completely?<eos> You were within an inch of dying.<eos> You wanted... you wanted to know... how long I could hold out against that machine.<eos> Well, the answer is I can't.<eos> - Nobody can.<eos> - Of course you can.<eos> If I can control it from that console then so can you, and you... must while I'm not here.
Yes, well, the trouble with this game is that it's too simple.<eos> In any case, I'm more used to playing three dimensional chess.<eos> All right, I've allowed you your little gesture.<eos> Now perhaps we can talk seriously?<eos> I suppose you're going to ask me to control that machine of yours again?<eos> - I am.<eos> - Yes, well, I can't.<eos> I've told you before, nobody can.<eos> You underestimate yourself, Doctor.<eos> You are perfectly capable of controlling it, for a time, at least.

Strongly indicated.<eos> Jealousy.<eos> Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to want us together.<eos> The billiard game.<eos> He suggested we dance.<eos> It does appear to defy the male logic, as I understand it.<eos> Kirk to Enterprise.<eos> Mr Scott.<eos> Report on the Rigelian fever.<eos> Nearly everybody has got it.

But, doctor, that...<eos> - Don't argue, nurse, just get it.<eos> This may be the turning point.<eos> Prepare another shot.<eos> - But, doc...<eos> - Please, just follow orders, will you?<eos> There, that should do it.<eos> Just let him rest now.<eos> You see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba fever.<eos> He suffered from it about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then.
But, captain, since you assume responsibility for your people, you will take the punishment.<eos> It is less painful than the collar.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Captain, you will be practise target.<eos> It is a shame to lose you, captain, but it is worth it as an example to the others.<eos> Captain's log, supplemental.<eos> Stardate unknown. Our strange captivity continues.<eos> This planet is called Triskelion.<eos> We do not know its location.<eos> We do not know who controls it.

Next bend up ahead.<eos> - Last night you saw tracks for 10.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Any cover? - Both sides.<eos> Cut out your two horses and the dynamite mule.<eos> - Maybe they're just passing.<eos> - If so, they'll ride in single file.<eos> The leader in front, and they'll palaver.<eos> If it's trouble, they'll come as a group.<eos> If the leader takes his hat off and passes it across to cover his gun let go, fast.

- Hello.<eos> I wanted to tell you how sorry I am and see if there's anything I can do.<eos> It's in the afternoon papers.<eos> - I'm very sorry.<eos> - Thank you. Uh<eos> - Uh, I pressed the bell, but it isn't ringing, I guess. I know.<eos> There's no electricity.<eos> Well, where did everything go?<eos> Charles sold it all at auction. This is all I have left.<eos> I love this room, but Charles never really saw it - only the things in it. I think I prefer it this way.
- Romeo?<eos> From Union Square. First it's that Hungarian French poodle.<eos> - That's over with long ago.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - If I could only get back the ring.<eos> - And now look what happened.<eos> You ask a friend to introduce you to some girl.<eos> - He asked me just to cheer me up.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Anyway, it turned out to be Sam.

San Francisco was now respectable. So sophisticated, in fact, it even had mansions up for auction.<eos> $2,000.<eos> $2,000.<eos> Is that your last bid?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, this trophy is solid gold and fully inscribed.<eos> "Mr. Cleve van Valen, President of the San Francisco... Kansas City Railroad. "<eos> It's a treasure he held dear to his heart.<eos> Do I hear $3,000 for this priceless possession?<eos> Priceless, my foot.<eos> We used it for a doorstop.

I know that now.<eos> It's only because he means so much to me.<eos> To both of us.<eos> Now we must forget, and others must be made to forget what he did.<eos> We all make mistakes.<eos> What a lavish feast, Bernardone.<eos> - Well, I spared no expense.<eos> - I'm glad to see you do know how to spend money.<eos> - I'm afraid I don't understand.<eos> - Small price to pay if it brings your son back into favor.

- about that small door. - Small door?<eos> Yes, the one at No. 22, that leads to the cul-de-sac, next to the trash... you know, the little door!<eos> Don't tell me you don't know it either.<eos> You must know it.<eos> You were born in that building.<eos> You'd pass through it to go play in the courtyards. Like all the other kids.<eos> Above all, your mom didn't like that. So, you'd go through there.<eos> Sight unseen. We've all done it.<eos> There's no harm. Yes...<eos> - I must have known about it.
The doctor told my father he was afraid it could be polio.<eos> He found symptoms...<eos> - I heard everything...<eos> - You were fine and you just simulate !<eos> Yes !<eos> - How could you !<eos> ? - It asked me courage.<eos> A lot of courage !<eos> But if you could know how well I feel on that wheelchair !<eos> Of course... Life doesn't come to me, but I can control it !

Don't you have any sympathy?<eos> My sympathy is with the duke.<eos> And the horses and the hounds.<eos> How about the case of the Benedictine monk who quit his order for the love of a young widow?<eos> She only married him because she wanted the secret formula for the liqueur.<eos> - Papa, you're a cynic.<eos> - I guess I am.<eos> - You enjoy your work.<eos> - I guess I do.<eos> - You'd enjoy it even if you weren't paid.

Why have I never been a young lover?<eos> Can you tell me that?<eos> My dear little girl... console yourself.<eos> There are only a few young lovers in the world.<eos> You could almost count them.<eos> Love has befallen them as a gift and a punishment.<eos> - And the rest of us?<eos> - The rest of us...!<eos> What becomes of us?<eos> We invoke love, call it beg for it, cry for it, try to mimic it... We think that we own it, we lie about it...

We all are, I no less than you.<eos> We were not made good people or bad people.<eos> We were made people.<eos> A great man once said of a poor creature going to execution,<eos> "There but for the grace of God go I."<eos> That grace is infinite.<eos> It is there for the forgetful child.<eos> It is there for the wealthy, who surround themselves with luxury but cut themselves off from human contacts.<eos> It is there for all of us, for God abandons no-one.<eos> But though his mercy is there for us to accept, we must not presume on it.

Well, I don't blame you whatever it was.<eos> You had plenty of reason.<eos> Oh! I read your letter, Norah.<eos> I know I shouldn't of, but I did.<eos> - Ah, it's all right, Sally.<eos> Don't take it so hard.<eos> No man's worth it.<eos> Not 6000 miles away, that is!<eos> They were probably struggling when she backed into the fireplace and grabbed the poker.<eos> She must've raised it over her head like this, smashed the mirror and let him have it.

Stop it!<eos> Get a hold of him!<eos> Get him out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> When I had the charges dismissed, you promised.<eos> I don't want to regret it.<eos> - I know.<eos> I've told you, violence is no good.<eos> Then why does he use it?

Ah, Brooklyn in the wintertime.<eos> What time of year do you like best, Jamie?<eos> Oh, springtime I think.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Isn't that funny because I do too.<eos> Really?<eos> What an amazing coincidence.<eos> Spring?<eos> I got nothing against spring.<eos> I enjoy it.

It was on this road.<eos> She was on this road.<eos> Send the boys up and down the way, see if anybody saw her.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You expect me to believe that you hid my Grace in a library?<eos> Nobody goes to libraries anymore.<eos> It's the safest place in the world.<eos> I can feel my Grace.<eos> It's here, but you've hidden it somehow.<eos> Where is it?

Where is it?
I can't lose you.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> You change your mind on that, 'cause that's not what you said last time.<eos> Oh, come on, man.<eos> You know I didn't mean that.<eos> This is my cross to bear, Sam.<eos> Mine.<eos> And that book is not the answer.<eos> Now, we got to destroy it before it falls into the wrong hands, and that includes me.
Y'all hid the book, didn't you?<eos> Lead-lined little number, I'm betting.<eos> I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> You don't?<eos> See that?<eos> That man back there, well, he said the same thing as all the others at truck stops and gas stations up and down the way.<eos> Nobody had seen that redheaded girl.<eos> And then a man bearing that Mark comes in here, to me.<eos> Well, there's coincidence, and then there's just Providence.<eos> See, "The Book of the Damned," it wants to be found. It wants to come home.
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> What does the book do?<eos> It triggers the memory centers of the brain.
So, I'll find you at the bell.<eos> They only come out after dark though, right?<eos> You don't have to check on me every period.<eos> I want to.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> You can't tell anyone.<eos> It's almost like this thing doesn't want to be found.<eos> Maybe it knows we're late for class.
We'd do worse than we did today to protect it.<eos> And hey.<eos> Now I have something to hold over your head.<eos> Just kidding, buddy.<eos> You have a good night.<eos> The paperwork is complete.<eos> The account has been established for Mr. Ames' daughter.<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> Yes.<eos> And the scholarship, it's... anonymous, correct?
It... it moves around.<eos> Listen, I went to China last month.<eos> Is this the bird flu?<eos> Or the... the... what...<eos> what is it, the SARS?<eos> It's one of those.<eos> I have a headache all the time.<eos> - I get these nosebleeds.<eos> - Nosebleeds?<eos> Yeah, the blood starts to come out, and then I got at it with a tissue, and it just goes back up.
If her aneurysm had ruptured outside of the hospital, she wouldn't have made it.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thanks. - Mm.<eos> Uh... Tell your mom I said goodbye.<eos> I ordered this book that she's been searching for forever.<eos> It was out of print.<eos> I found it.<eos> I had it shipped.<eos> Uh, it arrived yesterday.
Hi.<eos> You're here now?<eos> Yes. You may have missed something.<eos> In the mouths of the victims.<eos> - Henrik Sabroe, Copenhagen Police.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I'm working on the last victim.<eos> - Latest.<eos> The latest victim.<eos> We don't know if it's the last.
The wash basin... another brand.<eos> They're similar, but not identical.<eos> But the painting there is exactly the same.<eos> The car that Rasmus saw was reported stolen yesterday morning in Lomma.<eos> - There's no trace?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - A painting.<eos> - Yes, I see that.<eos> - It's from the foster home where Emil lived.
Oh gosh<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was really hard to drive that car after that.<eos> I'll... bet.<eos> But, you know, it was a Ferrari, so I muscled through.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What's that?<eos> Ugh, rat trap.<eos> Damn it.<eos> It's still alive.
He is like the beasts that perish."<eos> Over here!<eos> Those are Hartley's clothes.<eos> So where is Evan Lee?<eos> Okay, well, aside from a destroyed hotel room, we did good work here.<eos> Little early for champagne, don't you think?<eos> We don't know anything about that bacteria.<eos> Well, we've been here for two days, and already, we've discovered unusual bacteria inside a wolf that's behaving abnormally.<eos> That's an accomplishment.<eos> But just because it's inside the wolf doesn't mean that it's inside the lions or the cats or the bats.
Make them take on things that they can't handle.<eos> Hillary Clinton.<eos> Oh, hey, Ken.<eos> You can just put the beer behind the bar.<eos> Oh, actually I was coming over here to talk to the pretty ladies.<eos> Nice hair.<eos> Hey, Jess.<eos> Hey, Cece.<eos> Bear Claw, hello.<eos> I'd offer you my hand, but it's quite wet.
Try and grab it with forceps.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Okay. Hurry up.<eos> He's not breathing.<eos> - It keeps moving further in. - All right.<eos> If you can't get it out, you're gonna need to grab an ET tube and push it in all the way.<eos> - All the way?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It'll go into the right or left bronchi, but at least he'll be able to breathe with one lung, until we transfer him for surgery.
- Wow.<eos> - I know.<eos> So how much do you think we can get for it?<eos> Or...<eos> Or what if we take a crack at opening it?<eos> You're serious?<eos> Mom lost the Cortland Street Grill, and now we're being handed a second chance.<eos> It's fate, Peter.<eos> I have my fate.<eos> It's here.

Have you found out where it's from?<eos> ~ Name?<eos> ~ Well, you know my name.<eos> Name, I said.<eos> George.<eos> ~ Yes, go on.<eos> ~ Ernest.<eos> ~ Yes, go on.<eos> You know my surname.<eos> It's the same as my father's and my mother's.
You go to Putin with the head of command, you'd be a national hero.<eos> And in return, I let my agent retire?<eos> No more missions, including the current one.<eos> Kill command, set her free.<eos> Your chest hurt?<eos> It should.<eos> I put 100 stitches in you.<eos> Fentanyl drip for pain.<eos> Now, you want to take tube out, don't.<eos> It helps you until you're strong enough to breathe on your own, so leave alone.
You know you're a fan of her work.<eos> This is amazing, Cyrus.<eos> "Vote for me because I have my husband, the president, wrapped around my finger."<eos> The spin to end all spin.<eos> It is, and it'll probably work.<eos> Mellie will probably get elected, and then...<eos> Every minute of time either one of us has worked for this man and his legacy goes right down the drain because all he'll be remembered for is his wife telling the world he's whipped.<eos> It's all any of us will be remembered for, so...<eos> Enjoy this job while it lasts, Red.<eos> It might be the last one you ever have.
If he had done the right thing, he would've saved my father.<eos> He chose not to, so...<eos> Down he goes.<eos> You scare me.<eos> Good.<eos> You never forget your first.<eos> Kingsly's when we became a team.<eos> Remember?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Look, if he's putting together a coalition, we have to stop him before it reaches critical mass.
Did you see a doctor?<eos> Yes. They want to keep you a couple of days.<eos> I'm sure it's nothing.<eos> I'm tired is all.<eos> The baby is fine.<eos> Sweetheart, I...<eos> I'm sorry, I was so stupid.<eos> Do you forgive me?<eos> At the conference, a woman talked about the ABA method.<eos> I'm sure it can work for Tom.
This is Tandy Land, and he knows it.<eos> He smells the spray, he's trying to tip-toe through it.<eos> But it's all over his feet and legs.<eos> Poor guy.<eos> Mmm, Phil.<eos> Oh, there you go, you big camper.<eos> Oh, now put the food in the bear box.<eos> The food's in the box, baby.<eos> Put it high up in the tree so the bears can't get to it.<eos> It's in the tree, it's high up there.
Point it at my chains and think the word "open".<eos> Say it with your mind.<eos> Clara!<eos> Clara!<eos> Welcome to Valhalla, my ladies.<eos> No, wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> There's nothing to fear, strange maiden.<eos> We are Odin's chosen.<eos> The wall, it moves!
Used her up like a battery.<eos> I'm so sick of losing.<eos> You didn't lose.<eos> You saved the town.<eos> I don't mean the war.<eos> I'll lose any war you like.<eos> I'm sick of losing people.<eos> Look at you, with your eyes, and your never-giving-up, and your anger, and your... .. kindness.<eos> One day... the memory of that will hurt so much that I won't be able to breathe, and I'll do what I always do.<eos> I'll get in my box and I'll run and I'll run, in case all the pain ever catches up -- and every place I go, it will be there.
To hold me to the mark.<eos> I'm the Doctor, and I save people.<eos> And if anyone happens to be listening, and you've got any kind of a problem with that, to hell with you!<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Saving her... I think.<eos> It's from the Mire helmet.<eos> Battlefield medical kit.<eos> I've reprogrammed it for human beings.<eos> It's gone.<eos> It's inside her.
It's not important right now.<eos> Yeah, so it's the boy genius you took under your wing.<eos> Alex O'Connor.<eos> Very nice, Faber. Very nice.<eos> Objectively speaking, I'm pretty good at my job.<eos> I got a weird feeling about this, Jason.<eos> Feelings aren't facts, Sam.<eos> You start pointing fingers.<eos> You get it wrong.<eos> You might burn down a promising career before it gets off the ground.
Jesus, I'm sorry.<eos> I should be the one comforting...<eos> What can I do?<eos> Hey, Henry, you're already doing it, okay?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Oh. Donna must be a mess with all this going on.<eos> Actually, uh, she doesn't know.<eos> - Gordon...<eos> - Look, you have no idea what the last year has been like.<eos> I mean, you know, her work's taking off, you know, and it's driving her, you know, like... well, like mine used to, you know?
You're needed in the Situation Room.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> What's up?<eos> Blake couldn't give me any details.<eos> That's because it's need to know.<eos> Okay, what do I need to know?<eos> Russian war games have gotten heated.<eos> One of their subs split from the fleet and has crossed into US coastal waters.<eos> That's aggressive, but not unprecedented.<eos> Sure, Russians like to test our defenses, just like we test theirs, but we were tracking the sub, and it vanished.
Yes.<eos> You'll find out in a month.<eos> So till then, keep it under your hat.<eos> Or helmet, I believe they're called.<eos> Carry on.<eos> 4-3-6-2.<eos> X marks the spot.<eos> A plan of the base!<eos> My cousin in the Taliban has this map.<eos> Don't worry, it's probably not for work.
Not even for you.<eos> It seems the mood has soured.<eos> Hmm. We got a problem.<eos> What?<eos> Every time I move a piece of arktech from Nolan's brain, the arktech in Irisa's brain grows larger to compensate.<eos> I need to figure out a way of removing the arktech from both of their brains at the exact same time.<eos> Okay. Well, we have two doctors, so we could do two surgeries at the same time. What do you say, slick?<eos> Any experience doing cranial nano-surgery?<eos> I once removed a tumor from a cat's brain.<eos> And it lived.
We've robbed that man of dignity in his final moments and for that, I will never forgive myself.<eos> You're not going to say anything, are you?<eos> No. But after the wedding, I want you to find out who that man was, where his family live and we're going to go to their funeral.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> Right.<eos> Who's paying for that?<eos> Right, well - we're off.<eos> Enjoy the wedding.<eos> Oh, thanks love.<eos> Hey, it's at the Pavillion Hotel in Vallandry, if you wanted to pop in for a drink?
Come forward, Thomas and Goodwife Nutter.<eos> Warren, Clarke, you may proceed.<eos> So tell us now of all ye spied, Thomas Nutter, and Mr Clarke will take heed of it and writ as evidence your cursed testimony.<eos> That we may better remember the facts of this matter.<eos> My name is Thomas Nutter, and this here be my wife, Sarah Nutter.<eos> We did, yesternight and for many nights afore, spy Elizabeth Gadge, mother of my wife, creep abroad and meet with a fiend... CROWD WHISPERS .. covered, as we saw, in brown fur, and suck upon a black teat until sunrise.<eos> !<eos> Swear you to these sights, Goody Nutter?<eos> I have followed her myself whilst Thomas has been sleeping or at shit and I sometimes seen a white dog appear and dance a jig.<eos> Yes, it lives next door.
Elizabeth Gadge.<eos> What manner of fiend is it that you creep to nightly and suckle on?<eos> I know not of what you speak.<eos> I'm but a frail old woman who is in bed by evensong.<eos> My tormentors know this to be true.<eos> So you deny any knowledge of a brown thing of fur?<eos> A brown thing of fur?<eos> Think carefully before you answer, Old Mistress Gadge.<eos> I... have a brown hat of such a description.<eos> It is for winter and the cold.
Think I might try the program this time, out of boredom.<eos> Just for something different.<eos> How did you end up here?<eos> My story is the same as most bitches in here:<eos> relationships with blokes just bad enough to keep you coming back, too many brushes with the police while doing anything to keep the buzz going, and so on.<eos> I'm tired of hearing it, and really tired of telling it.<eos> Oh, well, you don't... You don't have to.<eos> No, hey, it's for a princess this time.<eos> How often can you say that?<eos> It's just they have you tell the same bloody story every day, thinking it'll jar something loose that'll suddenly make you stop craving what you crave.
I'm a troll.<eos> All my orgasms are gonna be self-made, handcrafted ones.<eos> I'm all I got.<eos> Dr. Webber, did you always know you were gonna do general surgery?<eos> Uh, I knew pretty early on, yeah.<eos> Okay, but how did you know it was the right place for you?<eos> Did you ever consider anything else?<eos> How did you choose it?<eos> Well, I guess I didn't, really.<eos> It chose me.
I assumed you'd be pissed.<eos> I was, but not at you.<eos> Louise is a lunatic, but she was a sideshow.<eos> The main event was you, a man trying to do something good, not...<eos> And despite her worst intentions, you succeeded.<eos> Wow.<eos> Not at all how I imagined this conversation was gonna go.<eos> Usually, my friends start uncapping the red sharpie right about now.<eos> Maybe it's time you started looking at life from a different perspective.<eos> Because from this view, it looks pretty great.
- 27.<eos> 27.<eos> What the hell you doing here, Joe Blake?<eos> I want my country back, sir.<eos> You want it back?<eos> You never had it.<eos> Sir?<eos> You were still sucking your thumb when they dropped the bomb.<eos> This shit hole's the only country you've ever known.<eos> Well, my father told me what it was like, before the war.
Remember, I'm on injured reserve, so you'll have to fill me in.<eos> Deputy Taylor finally stopped calling me cupcake.<eos> I guess that's progress.<eos> Maybe that's because Deputy Taylor's on medical leave for a week after you kicked his ass in front of the trainees.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, you know what? He had it coming.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Are you that incapable of not raging out?<eos> This program was a chance for you to do something with your life.<eos> No. That's what it is for you
Where are we?<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> Hey, slow down!<eos> Wait...<eos> Get the hell away from me!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Get away!<eos> No!<eos> - Please tell me you have the camera. - What's wrong?<eos> Is it missing?
I'm Christine Price, and this is my friend Eva.<eos> Excuse me, I need some air.<eos> And you all know each other?<eos> We all have something to contribute.<eos> And I'll set up an office here in this building.<eos> If anybody needs support, come find me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You were snooping.<eos> - Please tell me you have the camera.<eos> - What's wrong, is it missing?
I love you.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just said that you love me.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I knocked out a column.<eos> I didn't know it was load-bearing.
I'm guessing you're not a very good shot.<eos> But either way, you lose.<eos> Oh, yeah, how's that?<eos> You're too late.<eos> Dale and I are bonded now.<eos> If you kill me, the man you love will never forgive you.<eos> What do you know about love?<eos> Are you even capable of feeling it?<eos> Love is a human construct.<eos> It has no value for the kinship.
The Resistance still out there?<eos> Unfortunately, but we have who we need... Joe.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Our survival depends on a device that can bring down the dome, and Christine needs Joe to build it, but he refuses to help.<eos> Well, where is he?<eos> No, I've already tried.<eos> Take me to Joe.<eos> Hey, careful.<eos> That thing might be loaded.<eos> It is, but...
You've seen a lot of other stuff, too.<eos> Yeah, that file you sent me was everything Aktaion had on the dome from day one.<eos> Why'd you dump it?<eos> I thought maybe one day we'd need it.<eos> And the folder with the M.I.T. time-lock-level encryption?<eos> Who's gonna need that?<eos> What?<eos> An unnamed folder is buried in those files.<eos> Someone worked very hard to hide it.<eos> I didn't know it was there.
That's impossible.<eos> And you are?<eos> Hektor Martin.<eos> Hektor founded Aktaion.<eos> He's come bearing gifts.<eos> A cure for said infection.<eos> Well, whatever you brought, we don't need it.<eos> Dale Barbara isn't better.<eos> He's in a dormant phase.<eos> Once an infection's in a person, it's there forever.
Hmm? Uh... uh... behind?<eos> Yeah, well, a little back, a little beyond.<eos> I mean, o-of course, we're moving in opposite directions.<eos> Wow. And then I'm racing to the E.R.<eos> To prep it for the first casualties and just thanking god I'm alive.<eos> I mean, I knew that they were stranded out there, but what they went through?<eos> They gave Dr. Sloan a pericardiocentesis with, like, a drinking straw.<eos> They all almost died.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> It's real, and they had it.
Beat it, boo boo kitty.<eos> I'm working with Veronica now.<eos> I don't even know why you here.<eos> Okay, let's hear it from the top.<eos> You know, this place remind me of the free clinic back in Philly.<eos> We all right over there?<eos> Uh... no, actually.<eos> I don't have your authorization form.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It was in your file when you got your meds, a few days ago.
My ex-wife, my ex-CFO, my ex-son who wants to be a rap star, working with my ex-wannabe-girl and with some of my ex-artists?<eos> Ain't nobody scared of you though.<eos> We working on a new project, right?<eos> What, that little girl group y'all cooking up? Yep.<eos> You gonna bet the whole farm on that?<eos> Tell that to Berry Gordy and the Supremes.<eos> They wish they were me.<eos> I'm giving y'all one last chance, because y'all are my family.<eos> I know y'all can't eat without me, 'cause all y'all got is pride.<eos> And it's chewy and it's hard to swallow.
I'm just here to see Mom.<eos> How's it going?<eos> We're on Sway in two days. You sure you want to risk that?<eos> With Dad coming for you the way that he is?<eos> Bring it. COOKIE:<eos> Well, you can always come back here with us, Dre.<eos> Empire's where I belong, Mom.<eos> That company's part of me.<eos> But more importantly, I have a vision for Empire.<eos> Now, I want it to be something that I would be proud... to leave my own... child.
No.<eos> You know we gonna run on these fools, Fre!<eos> Baby, don't do something that you can't come back from.<eos> Come on, Fre.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Come on, Fre. (sirens wailing in distance)<eos> We out!<eos> I have to get you out of here.<eos> Come on. JAMAL:<eos> I'mtellingyou, it's this war between my mom and dad. It's killing everything, especially the music.
I got Cookie and Laura helping me.<eos> Look, I'm sorry about everything, Anika.<eos> Don't be.<eos> Hey, what's up, Mal?<eos> I've been thinking about this song, and, uh... not really sure which way I want to go with it.<eos> What you talking about? You don't like my song?<eos> No, I love your song.<eos> But I got this other song stuck in my head, and...<eos> I don't know, maybe there's a way we could, you know, combine the two.<eos> Well, let me hear it. I mean, if it's good, we'll use that one.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I can do that.<eos> So, uh, me and... me and my wife Tabitha, we were getting ready for bed and she says...<eos> I think I heard something, downstairs.<eos> Again? Maybe outside.<eos> It's--it's a dog or a cat or squirrel or something.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Go.<eos> So I did.<eos> I checked the front door and it was fine.
Why--why us?<eos> Why me?<eos> Well, that's why you're here instead of a holding cell in Topeka, so my team can answer that question.<eos> Agent Hotchner.<eos> I'm not a murderer.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> And I'm going to find out who turned you into one.<eos> ♪ Criminal Minds 10x21 ♪ Mr. Scratch Original Air Date on April 22, 2015<eos> "Your memory is a monster.<eos> "It summons with will of its own.

Get out.<eos> I was out, remember?<eos> You're the one who brought me back in.<eos> Get out.<eos> Perhaps I haven't made myself clear.<eos> I came home, and Tom was here.<eos> - He's back in your life.<eos> - He is not in my life.<eos> I understand what it's like to be drawn to something that is unhealthy, to a part of yourself that you are afraid of.<eos> But I want you to remember what your life really was with him, and imagine all that it could be without him.

Wow.<eos> You know, that's actually not the craziest place that pair has landed.<eos> I'd like to hear more about that.<eos> I'm Tyler.<eos> - I'm Gabi.<eos> - I'm Sofia.<eos> She has a boyfriend. I do not.<eos> Neither do I... have a boyfriend.<eos> You have to say that in San Francisco. Especially with this hair.<eos> It's really pretty.

I am.<eos> And it's not a secret.<eos> I'm just gonna run down a lead or two.<eos> It shouldn't take too much time.<eos> It took time this morning.<eos> So is this everything from the church?<eos> It is a testament to the insidiousness of cult thinking:<eos> A charismatic loon like Finn warps impressionable minds and then sends them to stalk and harass.<eos> And here I thought they just sold flowers at the airport.<eos> I find the practice repulsive, but in this case, it may have played in our favor.
Cinco De Mayo.<eos> Good for morale.<eos> I told them to get a margarita, but stay on call.<eos> Because an attack can happen at any time.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> She just gave me our final destination.<eos> She's in Brooklyn.<eos> We're running out of time, Harry.<eos> We can only go just so fast, Ms. Groves.<eos> This thing has eight cylinders. But I sincerely doubt it can fly.
Pat's got enough on his plate without you turning into Justin Bieber!<eos> Who?<eos> You know, the little man with the beard, plays tricks on people.<eos> Jeremy Beadle?<eos> Well, whoever it was...<eos> Pat's got the "Carol situation" to think about.<eos> What's happening with that now?<eos> Is it still bad?<eos> It's worse.<eos> According to Pat, it's white wine in a coffee mug at 9.30 in the morning, apparently.
Courtesy of Mr H Allmark!<eos> Did you hear it, Angela?<eos> Yes, Mother, it's... very funny.<eos> Well, shall we move this cake and make some room, Pat?<eos> Could you?<eos> Wait a minute, I want to take a picture of the spread.<eos> I told your cousin Ann I'd show it to her.<eos> Now, where's me camera?<eos> Pat, have you seen my camera?<eos> It's in the car, Maggie, I'll be back in two shakes.
I cannot imagine not seeing Michael Vincent every day.<eos> Booth is doing okay.<eos> He knows he's got a gambling problem.<eos> He's handling it.<eos> He's worked through this once before.<eos> He can do it again.<eos> These bones are also heavily fractured.<eos> And based on the lack of discoloration on the fracture margins, the injuries are postmortem.<eos> Well, once again, you can thank the red slurry for that.<eos> The weight of the water and the force in which it hit the remains would have been enormous.
- OK, well, if we use this muffin as the comet.<eos> - Right.<eos> - And this banana as the craft.<eos> - Gotcha.<eos> Now, once our craft is in the comet's orbit the craft... will split in two.<eos> And this bit, the leader, slams into the comet in order to make a crater.<eos> And the follower, which has the nukes in it, hits the crater a few seconds later and then...<eos> - It's kind of like a boxing combo, sir.<eos> - One, two punch, right?<eos> We only need to knock the comet off its current course by a couple of degrees for it to miss Earth.
The refrigerators are down.<eos> The chefs are freaking out.<eos> Hey, are you guys okay?<eos> She's dying.<eos> You mean she's melting.<eos> I mean dying.<eos> It's a disaster!<eos> Tonight will go down as the greatest night in the history of the Carlyle Hotel.<eos> Your beautiful food will not die.<eos> It will live forever.
That way, she could feed me for under a buck.<eos> She was laid off two weeks ago.<eos> But we already had lunch planned and she insisted on wearing her uniform and I begged her not to.<eos> But she didn't want you to think...<eos> I don't want you to think that this is about money.<eos> 'Cause it's not.<eos> 'Cause my mom will get by.<eos> We always have.<eos> This job means a lot to me.<eos> And I hope it goes on for a long, long time.
No, no, no, no.<eos> Baby, don't worry.<eos> I'll still love you.<eos> - Wait... what?<eos> - Hmm? Why is that even on the table?<eos> I-it's not!<eos> No! We can't have a new baby!<eos> We're the babies.<eos> Mom says my butt is as soft as a baby's bottom.<eos> But compared to a real baby, it'll seem like turtle skin.
Of course things are gonna change.<eos> I wish someone had told us that when we got married.<eos> We could have used that advice way more than those towels.<eos> Babe, we made a contract with each other.<eos> And the only constant in that contract is us.<eos> The kids aren't a part of that constant?<eos> - Oh, hell no. - Oh.<eos> You say the word, I'll get my sonicare and my speedos, and we'll be halfway to méjico.<eos> Turns out life isn't routine.<eos> If you're doing it right, it always surprises you.
When I first started at Brooks, I heard him refer to me on multiple occasions as "the exotic one."<eos> Oh, fuck him.<eos> God, these Silicon Valley guys, they like to pretend they're so fucking progressive.<eos> I thought Brooks would at least try to fake it.<eos> It really bothers you, doesn't it, being defined by Pernell?<eos> I love my husband, but...<eos> I did not get my ass into Stanford and build my business from scratch so I could be called "the judge's wife."<eos> So is that why you've been making deals behind his back?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> We've been looking into all the companies who snapped up land around the Brooks Innovation site while it was still cheap.
If we disagree, who has final say?<eos> Yeah, no, if you want to be a dick about it, which you clearly do, then you have the final say.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Forget it, okay?<eos> We'll... we'll do this later.<eos> Shit.<eos> That's gotta be it.<eos> That's gotta be the fucking book.<eos> Where is that book?<eos> It's right there.
I can't wait for him.<eos> Well, maybe I'll go check up on him later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So what are your thoughts?<eos> I go back and forth.<eos> You?<eos> I can't think of anything else.<eos> Me either.<eos> I was thinking about the marina, how we used to park there and talk about our dreams.<eos> We'd build this church, and when it was strong and thriving, we'd announce our love to the world.
He might be around for a while.<eos> Or not.<eos> Who can say?<eos> You're still not going to take me with you, are you?<eos> People like us, we go on too long.<eos> We forget what matters.<eos> The last thing we need is each other.<eos> We need the mayflies.<eos> See, the mayflies, they know more than we do.<eos> They know how beautiful and precious life is because it's fleeting.
Caltech Geological Survey. This is... Chet, it's Molly Dunn.<eos> Oh, hey, Molly.<eos> You okay?<eos> I heard that last quake hit a little close to you.<eos> Cell towers are going down,<eos> And I don't know the next time I'll be able to get to a landline or how long they'll last, So you have to listen to me.<eos> We have got to enact a level-four evac.<eos> This is going to be big, Upwards of a M10, Chet!<eos> Molly, Molly, please.<eos> My system works, Chet.

- Okay,<eos> - I think I'm gonna see if Cameron is free...<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> - I can do it.<eos> - You sure?<eos> I have a close working relationship with our quantum computer.<eos> What I don't have, though, is a cassette player.<eos> Now you do.<eos> Before we get started I want to say something.<eos> In this lab we deal with death all the time, but when it hits this close to home, death can leave us with a lot of questions.
She lived here all her life.<eos> She used to tell us kids this place is chosen.<eos> The Good Lord pointed His finger down on the final day of creation<eos> And said: "You.<eos> The Jarden of Eden."<eos> We didn't believe her, but she said there was a way to prove it, a way to make your wishes come true.<eos> You take a bird, you put it in a box and you bury it.<eos> Anywhere in the woods is fine.<eos> And you wait.<eos> You wait three days, you come back, dig it up, and if it's alive, right then is when you make your wish.
Why do you keep following me?<eos> If you want me to do something, just fucking say it.<eos> I'm glad you finally asked, Kevin.<eos> There is something you need to do.<eos> In Cairo, Egypt, there is an ancient artifact.<eos> It's in a museum now.<eos> They found it in the tomb of Amenhotep.<eos> Scholars call it the Wishing Cup.<eos> You need to acquire this cup.<eos> It's more of a chalice, actually.
Come on!<eos> We're not doing the audio tour.<eos> Oh, hell, yes, we are.<eos> It's pretty common for folks to get confused about where you've come to visit today, so let's clear it up.<eos> The moment you cross the bridge, you enter the town of Jarden.<eos> Miracle is the national park that surrounds and protects that town from those who would corrupt its exceptional properties.<eos> Historic site number seven.<eos> Some say the earthquakes that occur in Jarden are a result of man-made fracking and wastewater disposal in nearby towns.<eos> But this crack in the street wasn't caused by a quake.<eos> It was the result of a gas explosion in the sewage system on October the 14 that sent manhole covers flying a few blocks over.
How can one person's confession matter so much?<eos> We didn't survive all these years by compromising our beliefs, Michael.<eos> You may be struggling with your faith, but we're not with ours.<eos> You were right.<eos> I ruined a relationship with someone who was like a son to me.<eos> I needed him to want what I did, and it brought the worst out in me.<eos> I should have let him find his own path, his own truth.<eos> I'm sure Harper will do the same.<eos> Laurel, your faith is something I admire.<eos> It's what compels me to stay and search for my own.
Alex, you son of a bitch.<eos> I never thought you were coming out of there.<eos> Thanks, Noma.<eos> Uh, who's this guy?<eos> Riesen?<eos> General.<eos> Lady Riesen.<eos> Don't tell me you're praying.<eos> No, I used to, but I don't find comfort in it anymore.<eos> Faith helps little children sleep at night, but it won't help me protect my city.
_<eos> _<eos> That's hardcore.<eos> You've been reeducated.<eos> Show me what you've learned.<eos> The bonds.<eos> You had the Gecko brothers steal them for you.<eos> There's a message hidden inside them, a prophecy about a source of blood that will feed us all.<eos> "And a storm of blood shall come unlike anything the world has seen.<eos> It will quench our thirst."
But... it's a mix.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> I get what these mean.<eos> And I get what that means.<eos> And I get this one.<eos> One of these kids is doing his own thing.<eos> And it's sticking out, you know, kinda like a turtle head.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Well if I had a gun to my head, I'd say it's a map.<eos> We know that, but where does it lead?
- Yeah.<eos> Nice place.<eos> Ahh, I'm so glad you like it.<eos> We hope you enjoy living here for a long, long time.<eos> Wait...<eos> this is mine?<eos> Yes, I specified in my emails that we would provide housing.<eos> One of the perks of the job.<eos> So tell me more about this job.<eos> Oh, I imagine it's pretty much like your last one.
She says they fight all the time now.<eos> Oh, that sucks.<eos> Well, I am one who believes that in times of crisis it's God's word that pulls us through.<eos> - And I was hoping that you could help by giving them some scripture.<eos> Some what?<eos> Scripture.<eos> Oh, scripture.<eos> Sure.<eos> I love that stuff.<eos> It's awesome.
(zoe, over loudspeaker) these walls aren't a sanctuary.<eos> They're a tomb.<eos> Help me.<eos> Help me make it right.<eos> I gotta admit, she's persuasive.<eos> She's persuading people to overthrow my government, And it's playing on loop.<eos> Shut it down.<eos> (gates) i can't, not from here.<eos> Okay, they're broadcasting it from a relay station On their side of the city, ten blocks behind the trench.<eos> (arika) but this propaganda is being heard on both sides, And the longer it plays, the weaker your authority looks.
We need proof.<eos> Bones is looking at the remains again.<eos> She's gonna come up with something.<eos> Hope she can do it in less than an hour, Cher.<eos> Start at the distal ends of the tibias and proceed upwards.<eos> Tell me everything you find, no matter how small or insignificant.<eos> This mark...<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, you found a curved striation on Father Nabors' left clavicle yesterday.<eos> Yes, it seemed to have been caused when his hand slipped as he was cutting into the victim.

We'll take care of each other.<eos> Trust me, Maddy.<eos> We'll leave in the morning.<eos> If we're staying here, you have to take care of Peter.<eos> You can get gas from the truck.<eos> - For what?<eos> - To burn him.<eos> No.<eos> If you burn him, the sickness will not spread.<eos> We don't know how it spreads.
Trade Minister.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I have caused you embarrassment.<eos> I should have told you that the Kempeitai had questioned me, and I will resign.<eos> Or you will dismiss me.<eos> No.<eos> In life there are too many questions with a lack of time to answer them.<eos> You may not understand this.<eos> I live by a 5,000-year-old book.<eos> I ask it questions as if it were alive.

- Look, Zed.<eos> I know I was a little rough on you in there.<eos> Oh, Dr. Tyler. It's not necessary for you to apologize to me.<eos> Oh, I'm not.<eos> When you're in my O.R., you need to get it right the first time, no questions asked.<eos> And if you can't do that, you need to get the hell off my surgical rotation.<eos> Try psychiatry.<eos> They love questions there.<eos> And for God's sakes, don't eat this crap.<eos> It will kill you.
Sanchez: Sykes, we found his car on the fourth floor.<eos> See?<eos> Drove up. Dropped down.<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> He's missing a contact.<eos> Oh. Damn it!<eos> [Stammers] Don't move.<eos> Sykes, inform the troops, please.<eos> Hey, guys, you need to look for a contact lens up there.<eos> I have it.

Mr. Evans, that would be amazing.<eos> You deserve the shot. You've worked hard for it.<eos> Auditions start in one short week.<eos> Don't let me down, honey.<eos> That sounds like a big opportunity.<eos> It's huge.<eos> Ballantine...<eos> His company, I mean...<eos> If I even got in...<eos> But it is in New York.
That's what you said to me before you told me mom and dad were splitting up.<eos> I've had some... Bad luck, I'm afraid.<eos> A, um, a tumor has taken up residence inside my brain.<eos> It's caused a lot of problems.<eos> That's why I collapsed.<eos> They are going to remove it this afternoon.<eos> It's a relatively routine procedure...<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> But this, uh, procedure will take care of it?<eos> It will take care of the tumor.
Ivan, your toes... Move them, please?<eos> He's unresponsive.<eos> His O2 sats are dropping.<eos> Brain tissue is swelling.<eos> I think he's seizing.<eos> We need to induce coma.<eos> Give him propofol, midazolam, and secure his airway stat.<eos> Right away, Doctor.<eos> Damn it!<eos> We successfully resected the tumor, and it doesn't appear to have spread.
Just thinking about vacation.<eos> What about you, Pulaski?<eos> Any plans?<eos> Well, I'm thinking about going on this single's adventure to Costa Rica.<eos> Kind of like The Bachelor, but with zip-lines and monkeys.<eos> Oh, I never took you for the deep jungle type.<eos> I still need to come up with 500 bucks, so...<eos> I'm thinking of selling this sucker online.<eos> Doesn't really go with my apartment.<eos> It doesn't really go with anywhere.
I want it back!<eos> Pop, pop, little bubble!<eos> Let that sizzle speak.<eos> It's time to flip.<eos> Care to do the honors?<eos> Ah, sure, man.<eos> That'd be cool.<eos> Rude.<eos> Winston, you're not gonna trick me into taking the stupid pan.<eos> It stays behind... that's the system!

You've been at this for a couple of months.<eos> I ran an underground for 20 years.<eos> I know enough to know that trying to kill Claire Riesen wasn't just a mistake.<eos> It destroyed any chance we have for peace.<eos> Peace is not the answer.<eos> The V-6s are too entrenched and too powerful, and they will use that power to stop you by any means necessary.<eos> The only chance for revolution is to burn them down.<eos> Now why don't we set our differences aside till the war is won?<eos> For now, Whele.<eos> But when it's over, one of us is going to die.
True, but today, it's 'cause of them.<eos> I think they sound good!<eos> It's better than this stupid hold music.<eos> Oh, hi, Dr. Rinaldi!<eos> No, no, I love your hold music.<eos> Listen, Doc, the rash is still there.<eos> I did everything you said...<eos> no shaving, no deodorant.<eos> Oh. Yeah.<eos> But now it's in both armpits.

That's amazing, 'cause I was just calling you.<eos> Uh, Bishop and I are going back to the alley where - Emma Vickers' body was found.<eos> - Yeah, thought we might find something in daylight that we missed last night.<eos> Possible witness, video.<eos> Boss, Abby talk to you yet?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> She find something?<eos> No.<eos> The car was a bust.<eos> It's old.
I couldn't wait.<eos> I wanted to see the expression on your face.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, I love it when-when a plan comes together.<eos> You found a place?<eos> Great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where is it?<eos> You won't believe our luck.<eos> It's in your building.
There's marks here and here.<eos> It's consistent with being bound, and there's evidence of rough sex.<eos> She may have been raped.<eos> Lab's running samples and the tox screen now.<eos> Cause of death?<eos> Mechanical asphyxia.<eos> The killer strangled her with some sort of rope, and he pulled it so hard it left these indentations here.<eos> What about the cut?<eos> It's from the necklace.<eos> The rope pushed against the charm, causing it to slice into her skin.
I'm afraid Mama seems to see this argument as the last battle, the last big fight of her life.<eos> If she loses, there'll be hell to pay.<eos> Then there'll be hell to pay.<eos> Added to which, I'm feeling pretty rough.<eos> I'm sure it's only indigestion, but whether it is or not, I'll be glad of a chance to put my feet up.<eos> It's too late to cancel, but I'd be happy to manage the evening without you, if you're really ill.<eos> Mama would only say I'd ratted on her.<eos> As you say, I'll get through it and then take things quietly for a few days.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> I threw a book and it caught it.
What is it?<eos> Is it working?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Fiddleford?<eos> When Gravity Falls and Earth becomes sky, fear the beast with just one eye.<eos> Fiddleford, get a hold of yourself.<eos> You're not making any sense.<eos> This machine is dangerous.<eos> You'll bring about the end of the world with this.<eos> Destroy it before it destroys us all!
He's a dealer.<eos> Germaine cleans his cash.<eos> I can make an introduction for you.<eos> Ari Adamian... he's a lieutenant in the Sarkissian family.<eos> The previous UC spent, Colby Moore, spent the last week establishing you with Ari, building an ID.<eos> Somebody has to be held accountable for Ari's crimes.<eos> I'll be their sin-eater.<eos> Sammy O'Malley is dead!<eos> This operation is over.<eos> It is not over until it is over!
Who hired you?<eos> Someone on the prom committee saw my pictures at the contest.<eos> Look, I I didn't wanna rub it in your face when I found out you were off the guest list.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My friends saw you, Clark.<eos> At that old doll factory.<eos> What were you doing there?<eos> Who were you meeting?<eos> I don't think you wanna be photographing her.<eos> Get one of the ice sculpture before it melts.
I'll do what I can.<eos> In the meantime, no matter what happens to you all, Kirsten needs to survive.<eos> So I want you to put her in isolation.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Well, considering the only thing this lab is able to do about a biohazard is ring alarm bells, not great.<eos> We're just not equipped for this kind of emergency.<eos> We can work the problem if we knew Barmal's formula to her serum.<eos> Yeah, but her formula tanked. So what good would it do?
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Camille, what is it?<eos> There's a rat in here.<eos> Oh, okay, that's all?<eos> There are two things in the world that terrify me.<eos> Rats and hairy backs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, it's touching me.<eos> It's disgusting and it's touching me with its rat teeth and its rat fur covered in rat diseases.
Oh, my God.<eos> - It's all in here.<eos> - I'll start with the injections.<eos> Okay, treat the sickest first.<eos> Good to see you, Fisher.<eos> Well, I heard there was cake.<eos> Soon, Fisher, soon.<eos> - Lockdown complete.<eos> - Okay, so it looks good.<eos> We've scanned the lab twice and it's clean.
Mr. Houston?<eos> The man with the truck, he's back.<eos> Reddington has a location for Karakurt-- 63rd and Franklin.<eos> Coordinate with HRT. Roll out now.<eos> We have a lead.<eos> We need to talk in your office.<eos> Tom.<eos> You will ignore Reddington's lead.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm sure it's solid.
That means "Spider," right?<eos> Kara-what?<eos> Huh? Look, I don't know what that is.<eos> My name is Jonas Flemming.<eos> I'm a reporter for the European Wire.<eos> I live in Rotterdam.<eos> We're gonna try this again.<eos> We know who you are.<eos> That's you outside the Orea.<eos> You exited a rental truck less than a minute before it exploded and destroyed the building.
Still doesn't feel right.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He rigged his car to explode.<eos> What do you think he'll do to his house?<eos> If I die because of Arkady's paranoia, I deserve it.<eos> We got to get in there.<eos> Could be bleeding out on the kitchen floor.<eos> You don't want me to check it?<eos> Where's your sense of adventure?<eos> It's in here.
Never mind.<eos> So what was that all about?<eos> Heather thinks I stole her stereo, suspicious-ass bitch.<eos> - Oh, my God, that's crazy.<eos> - I know.<eos> I just borrowed it.<eos> I was totally gonna get it back from the pawnshop and then she got all aggro, and I was like, screw that.<eos> That no-trusting-ass bitch.<eos> It was just on principle.<eos> Plus, I had this dog and it bit this kid in the face and that was a whole thing, so it's not like I wasn't gonna get high.
And Jaclyn and I recently decided to become exclusive, so I don't think she would appreciate me sucking your dick!<eos> Just knock some shit over.<eos> - Rap beef! Rap beef!<eos> - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.<eos> We out of here... we out of here, 'Stain.<eos> _<eos> Oh, my God, I was so scared.<eos> _<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Gazing into the darkness, seeing if it gazes back.
I stole some checkers from the rec room.<eos> Just making a little chaos.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> - That wasn't your mum, was it?<eos> - No, no.<eos> She's, uh... she's back in Boca.<eos> How long were you talking to that old lady, you weirdo?<eos> I'm going home.<eos> I read your book.<eos> It's amazing.
Right, then.<eos> Hakuna matata.<eos> Did you just quote The Lion King to me?<eos> The lion what?<eos> No, it's a...<eos> it's a Swahili phrase.<eos> No, I know th...<eos> Are you sure you're not quoting something?<eos> Just Khalid, the kabob shop owner in my old neighborhood.<eos> I mean, the phrase doesn't translate easily to English, but it means... that there is not currently a problem.
Sam's so gonna fire me.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Jobs are dumb.<eos> Hakuna matata!<eos> So, what do you think of Dorothy?<eos> Pretty great, huh?<eos> She a'ight.<eos> Where's the mouse?<eos> !<eos> It ran in here!
But making a grammatical nightmare of a song with Gretchen's psychopath client, that's a really big deal, you know, for you.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Tomorrow I'm eating runny cheese and going on an inverted roller coaster.<eos> - Want to come? - Okay.<eos> Oh, sorry, I forgot.<eos> You can't ever do anything fun because you're ruining your body with some ginger-headed parasite. - Ha!<eos> - Whatever.<eos> In five months, I will be on a Disney cruise with my family, while you're at divorce court, looking back on the time someone took pity on you and let you sing on their stupid song.<eos> "New Phone Who 'Dis" is not a stupid song.<eos> It's about texting!
- Nor should she.<eos> - She must eventually.<eos> Let her make that decision for herself.<eos> Now, you need some sleep before your hideous day tomorrow.<eos> Andrew?<eos> What were you doing in Mr Barrow's room?<eos> We were...<eos> I was borrowing a book.<eos> What book?<eos> Where is it?
What that woman said is totally untrue.<eos> - I have never blown...<eos> - Sit.<eos> You know, I have a joke.<eos> Who's the funniest man in the Old Testament?<eos> Samson.<eos> Because he brought the house down.<eos> Thou shalt not kill, but you killed on that one.<eos> That's the Fifth Commandment, by the way.<eos> I told that joke because it's from the Bible.
What?<eos> You're going to filibuster?<eos> You're going to stall for time?<eos> I thought if I stopped the clock, I Could... I could talk you down.<eos> Oh, and then you could rewire the detonators?<eos> God, after everything, you are just like the rest of them.<eos> You want the Army to drop it.<eos> Trust me, Jim, the Army doesn't give a shit what I want.<eos> They're going to drop this thing either way.<eos> Not if it doesn't work, they won't.
No, wait, we look like cops.<eos> We're never gonna blend in dressed like this.<eos> Okay, there, how's that?<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> All I see is clothes hanging off of a genderless blob.<eos> You look fine.<eos> Here, wear this.<eos> Jake, you need a jacket or something.<eos> Well, Scully left his sports coat back there.<eos> Oh, but it will never fit Jake's athletic body.
And over here will be the sort of hangout area.<eos> Does that sound good?<eos> Perfect.<eos> Great work.<eos> And day one of summer school?<eos> Off without a hitch, as far as I can tell.<eos> It's great that we were able to hire those extra teachers.<eos> Thank you, Kilfer grant.<eos> Speaking of the Kilfer grant, one of the benefits that comes with it is a trip for two to D.C. for their national conference.<eos> And it's coming up, like, early July, I think.
That's good.<eos> Maybe we could sell it at Molly's.<eos> Yeah, now you're talking.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm telling you, you got something here, kid.<eos> Ms. Dawson, hey, it's Billy Carson.<eos> I just want you to know everything's fine.<eos> It doesn't matter what anybody says about me.<eos> I know the truth, even if it doesn't come out.
Even after he left that first time, when I should have realized that what I felt for him, he didn't feel for me.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I loved him, too.<eos> Because he was your brother.<eos> I'm sorry he let you down.<eos> I'm sorry he let us down.<eos> But I'm glad this is behind us.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> That shit stinks.<eos> And it's not good for the baby.
The Spoils Before Dying was to be my greatest achievement.<eos> However it was banned in this country, and I was summarily exiled from the country of my birth.<eos> Even now, I am a man without a country, and an apartment.<eos> I have only my wine and a humble cot in the guest house of an old lover.<eos> My death is imminent.<eos> Anyway, you're about to see Part IV of Spoils Before Dying.<eos> It's pretty good.<eos> I think you'll enjoy it.<eos> Oh, hi, Doris.<eos> Your porcelain skin, it's intoxicating.
All right, guys.<eos> Let me get this.<eos> Welcome, make yourselves at home.<eos> I can't believe we won 500 bucks and you wouldn't let me stop at that pawn shop on the way back!<eos> What would you even get at a pawn shop?<eos> I swear to god I saw a crown in that window.<eos> - Like for teeth? - No.<eos> Like for your head.<eos> Like it belonged to some king.<eos> It could have been mine.
There was a bump on his head.<eos> I thought they were signs of a struggle.<eos> But the paramedics told me that sometimes this happens.<eos> Someone will have a heart attack, fall down, knock things over.<eos> So where was he lying when you found him?<eos> Right here, with his, um, head towards the living room.<eos> All right.<eos> Here?<eos> Was this door open?<eos> No, it was closed.
I know how this works.<eos> Right now, some other cop is arresting him, saying I gave him up.<eos> You want us to turn against each other, but we won't.<eos> We didn't do anything.<eos> But you did, as a matter of fact.<eos> You both got master's degrees.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, you both have your degrees in agriculture.<eos> But this scarlet academic hood that you're wearing denotes a degree in theology.<eos> It belongs to your lover, Everett Keck.
No.<eos> He's the criminal, not me.<eos> You want to ask me any more questions, you get my attorney down here.<eos> Maybe he can talk me out of suing your asses.<eos> So, after all that, looks like the only thing Neil Kopecky may be guilty of is being an ass.<eos> I take it that was the captain who rang?<eos> Kopecky's lawyer finally got him to give straight answers.<eos> Turns out, after he got fired, he had to move back in with his parents.<eos> They have a security system there.<eos> It showed he got home at 6:00 last night and didn't leave until we called him this morning.
When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.<eos> I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To mt people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> I've seen this picture.<eos> It won the Pulitzer.
I never would've seen it if Nathan hadn't kept pushing me.<eos> Yeah, he can be stubborn.<eos> I just wanted you to know that it's not impossible.<eos> Hi, everybody.<eos> I've been troubled since I was a kid.<eos> My dad, Garland Wuornos... Most of you knew him...<eos> He was troubled too. Helping troubled people has been the family business for a long time.<eos> Let me tell you, I wouldn't wish a trouble on my worst enemy.<eos> Maybe that's what your trouble's about. You refuse to look at the dark, emotional truth.<eos> You're scared that it might kill you.
But don't tell anybody.<eos> Don't tell anybody.<eos> He wants it to be a surprise.<eos> Well, of course not.<eos> I'm not gonna ruin Victoria's biggest night.<eos> Ooh! I can help her plan the wedding.<eos> I can fix all the mistakes we made with ours.<eos> What... Wh-What mistakes?<eos> Our wedding was beautiful.<eos> It was good.
What's the problem?<eos> Who knows what you'd do to me with that stuff?<eos> Fine.<eos> Answer me this...<eos> How far are you willing to go for Audrey?<eos> 'Cause I would do anything for Mara.<eos> And... and she would do anything for me.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Mara wanted to get you back, but only so she could find your stash of Aether.<eos> You knew where it was.
But who knows what Croatoan did to him?<eos> The Duke we knew...<eos> I'm afraid we lost him forever.<eos> Let's find out.<eos> You should eat this.<eos> You love it.<eos> I am not your daughter.<eos> I will never be your daughter.<eos> Family's not a choice.<eos> How can you talk about family like it means anything to you?
I will never abandon you.<eos> You don't have to be so morose.<eos> Attitude is the paintbrush that colors our world.<eos> What we're about to do will be wonderful.<eos> What is that?<eos> Mm, the question is, what is behind that?<eos> I'm using an abrasion trouble to create an opening to the Void.<eos> Why is it...<eos> Turning black?<eos> It's filling with Aether.
Who am I?<eos> Why am I here?<eos> What the hell did I do last night?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Shishkaboobs...<eos> North Judson's finest Lebanese-owned gentlemen's club.<eos> Buddy?<eos> - A box came for you.<eos> Can we open it? - Sure.<eos> Who's it from?
Thanks for the backup, by the way.<eos> In order to back you up, I'd have to have supported your point of view.<eos> We were looking at the same monitor.<eos> You really feel confident that those clips are gonna hold?<eos> I believe Clara Levine was performing splenectomies before we were born.<eos> Not laparoscopically, she wasn't.<eos> Not to mention, you get on her bad side, you might as well toss your career in the bin.<eos> Now let's be extra careful with these port sites.<eos> Patient's not herniating on my watch.<eos> Since when did it become your watch?
Well, I need to go see my patient, so...<eos> See you in the morgue.<eos> Scissors.<eos> Your technique is exquisite.<eos> Did Dr. Bell tell you that I'm on the jury for the fellowship award?<eos> She may have mentioned it.<eos> You don't have to suck up to me, Dr. Curtis.<eos> Your record speaks for itself.<eos> Hmm. The superior cerebellar artery seems to be the one causing all the fuss.<eos> It's adhering to the trigeminal nerve.
Pupil response is normal.<eos> Do you have any vision problems, Ava?<eos> Dizziness?<eos> Any changes to your coordination?<eos> Um... Memory loss?<eos> Fatigue?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> Why?<eos> The trigeminal neuralgia...<eos> I think it was masking an underlying condition, and now other symptoms are surfacing.
- Who?<eos> The Warrior King leader, Clinton Wallace.<eos> He has 'em all brainwashed.<eos> The ones that don't believe he's God are convinced he's the devil.<eos> Either case, we can't break 'em.<eos> You can't break the ice?<eos> Ha, ha, ha. No, we can't.<eos> Chief Kent couldn't either, try as he might.<eos> Everyone and everything has a breaking point.<eos> If you know where it is, and nobody does with these guys.

We don't need to come in.<eos> Good.<eos> Uh... See?<eos> She's still alive.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Did you hear that music playing in there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So? She hates music.<eos> Unless it's coming out of a pipe organ, she calls it "ear rape."
Who knew a sloppy drunken one-night stand would turn into forever?<eos> Not me, that's for sure.<eos> I woke up next to this one and thought, "What have I done""<eos> "And who still has a water bed""<eos> Say what you want, but that bed did half the work.<eos> Point is, love is tricky.<eos> You can't go looking for it.<eos> Then how am I gonna find it?<eos> You don't.<eos> It finds you.
I have important business to attend to.<eos> You must stay here with your grandparents.<eos> What business?<eos> It concerns my book.<eos> And the gentleman who came to call.<eos> You must leave.<eos> Now!<eos> Is your book more important than me?<eos> Nothing is more important than you.<eos> But it has caused great misery in this world.
No, I got one about this, too.<eos> I have, like, six ideas.<eos> The third one's about this.<eos> Dubbing it ourselves?<eos> Great idea.<eos> Thanks, Gene. Guys.<eos> All right, I typed up all the subtitles from Hawk Chick versus Seaweed Monster.<eos> Did you guys know about spell check?<eos> It's amazing.<eos> It tells you if you misspell something.
(as Kevin): Ah, you got me away!<eos> Watch out for the... Ugh! Ow!<eos> Okay, privacy's over.<eos> You had some you time.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, we'll come and get you when it's about to start!<eos> Wait.<eos> Why can't I go in now?<eos> Yeah, just relax and enjoy the green room.<eos> Sorry it's not actually green, or a room.
"bad outcomes do not equal negligence."<eos> And I bet they told you that the best thing for you to do was to accept things and move on. But how?<eos> How do you move on when the doctor is still out there and the person that you loved... is dead?<eos> That sounds like the voice of experience.<eos> And it looks like it's having an effect. Maybe you could start by telling us what happened to your daughter.<eos> What did Dr. Henson do to her?<eos> Tuesdays, 4:00 to 7:00, Stephanie had a study group, a very unofficial thing with her friends, and so we... we let them u-use the pool house.<eos> My wife got home that night after I did.<eos> We cooked dinner, watched some television, then I got a headache around 8:00.<eos> I went to the medicine cabinet, and it was empty...
Just listen.<eos> I've been tracking an exchange on DarkMarquet.<eos> It's an undisclosed parcel pickup here in Los Angeles between two parties, VinXXX and Huma9.<eos> VinXXX:<eos> V is the shape the clock hands make at 10:10.<eos> X...<eos> Roman numeral for ten.<eos> Right, but Huma9 is the real prize.<eos> The Huma's a mythological creature.<eos> It's the Persian equivalent of the Phoenix, and when this bird rises from its ashes, I'll give you one guess what color it is.
Kirsten, did I notice anything?<eos> I'm gonna do what you asked me to do, tonight, and nothing's gonna happen to the girl.<eos> I didn't save her at the Santa Monica pier to kill her now.<eos> The carousel.<eos> - What?<eos> - The carousel.<eos> Jewels, now!<eos> The carousel at Santa Monica pier.<eos> - What?<eos> - We thought it went off by itself.
Is there a procedure for waking him up?<eos> - What are the risks?<eos> Tell me what the target is.<eos> Tell me where the attack<eos> - is going to happen. - Keep him awake, Colonel.<eos> - Stand back, please.<eos> - Sir, please.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.<eos> And you will see to it that it does.
Yes, I'm safe.<eos> We're safe.<eos> You want to tell me what happened today?<eos> It's all over the-the Internet.<eos> A mysterious blonde woman in the Hauptbahnhof tunnels with a gun.<eos> You?<eos> Me.<eos> Nice shirt.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's yours.
But I wasn't allowed a real life or real love.<eos> That was for normal people.<eos> With you, I thought,<eos> "Ah, maybe, just maybe..."<eos> But I know now that was a false glimmer.<eos> I'm used to those-- they happen all the time in the desert-- but this one got to me.<eos> And here's the thing, this death, this end of me is exactly what should have happened.<eos> I wanted the darkness.<eos> I fucking asked for it.<eos> It has me now.
You think I don't know which way you'll drive?<eos> Is this how they teach you how to stage a suicide in medical school?<eos> This one's a challenge.<eos> The stable's a unique venue.<eos> Forty percent check out in their own house.<eos> I prefer bathrooms.<eos> It's a good place to open a wrist.<eos> Or drown.<eos> In the end, it's not the scene that matters, it's the story.<eos> It's gotta be credible.
No.<eos> You're acting like you're drinking more coffee than you should.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Crisis over.<eos> - Good.<eos> I Googled rashes.<eos> And as you can see, skin irritations can look very different, but none of them anything like what I've got.<eos> I only gave you the cream yesterday.<eos> - It doesn't work.

- What?<eos> - Could you give this to Anna. Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just thought you'd be here.<eos> Have you got the keys to your car?<eos> I'm missing an earring.<eos> - What? Why do you need...<eos> - I've searched everywhere else.<eos> You look fine.<eos> I know it's in there.
A gold headband?<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's what it was.<eos> And, uh, how about his clothes?<eos> Do you remember anything distinctive about them?<eos> No.<eos> But... he wore a ring.<eos> A red and silver signet ring on his right hand.<eos> I remember that.<eos> Evelyn, back to the mask... did it look anything like this?
I've been tracking the escape car.<eos> Picked it up on I-87 going north.<eos> I got it going through 3 toll booths, two bridges, at mile marker 244, and then at marker 245, it's not there.<eos> Obviously, he stopped somewhere, but where?<eos> I've got street view, traffic cams, eye in the sky.<eos> I can't find it.<eos> Highway.<eos> The highway cam?<eos> I'll take another look.<eos> Here it is at 244 and nothing at mile marker 245.
No, no, no...<eos> to this other candidate, because I am going to wipe the floor with her... or him.<eos> It's gonna hurt.<eos> Getting trounced hurts, and it'll be embarrassing, publicly and professionally, losing by that wide a margin, because I am primed for this job, sir.<eos> I deserve this job.<eos> There isn't a single person in this room<eos> - who would d-d...<eos> - Disagree.<eos> Disagree that I am not so ready for this job.<eos> It's already mine.
You ran out.<eos> No, I didn't run out.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> Okay, well, it doesn't matter, because I'm a psychiatrist, not a pharmacy, and if you want my help, you do it my way.<eos> You make regular appointments, and you commit to doing the work.<eos> And you show up at my house unannounced again, I'm calling the police.<eos> Do you have any time available ten minutes from now?<eos> I want to give you time to finish your dinner.<eos> Is the car ready?<eos> It's downstairs warming up, like you.
Two fatalities.<eos> One female.<eos> One looks like a male.<eos> How's that?<eos> We're still putting him back together.<eos> (Antonio) Any idea what caused this?<eos> IED of some sort.<eos> We found screws in buildings all the way down the street.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So where were you standing when it went off?
You asked me to help you kill Malvado.<eos> We still can.<eos> I have a plan to give you everything.<eos> The problem with your plans, Carlos... is that you come with them.<eos> Oh, so you choose a... a myopic boy with his mother's milk on his chin.<eos> It's about Richard, isn't it?<eos> It's about you, and the prison of vengeance that you have built for yourself.<eos> Let me tell you something about prison, Carlitos.<eos> It's hard. And unjust.<eos> But after a while, it becomes your home.
jianjun.<eos> Nobody ever called me that here.<eos> I'm the reason everyone called you Scott.<eos> I was a stupid little kid.<eos> And I just... hated you.<eos> And it was a sin for me to feel that.<eos> But God forgives me.<eos> I know that God forgives me because He is love.<eos> That love can change anyone.<eos> It can change you, Scott.
That is the spirit.<eos> Open it.<eos> I know you can.<eos> But it's locked.<eos> I've tried it.<eos> Mother and Tituba...<eos> Couldn't keep me out.<eos> They cannot keep you in.<eos> That door belongs to you.<eos> It is yours.
You're not superior to people who were cruel to you.<eos> You're just a whole bunch of new cruel people.<eos> A whole bunch of new cruel people being cruel to some other people who'll end up being cruel to you.<eos> The only way anyone can live in peace is if they're prepared to forgive.<eos> Why don't you break the cycle?<eos> Why should we?<eos> What is it that you actually want?<eos> War.<eos> Ah, ah, right.<eos> And when this war is over, when you have a homeland free from humans, what do you think it's gonna be like?
Who's gonna be quickest? Who's gonna be luckiest?<eos> This is not a game!<eos> No, it's not a game, sweetheart. And I mean that most sincerely.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Yes, I'd quite like to know that too.<eos> You set this up, why?<eos> Because it's not a game, Kate.<eos> This is a scale model of war.<eos> Every war ever fought, right there in front of you.<eos> Because it's always the same.
I mean, you call this a war?<eos> This funny little thing?<eos> This is not a war!<eos> I fought in a bigger war than you will ever know.<eos> I did worse things than you can ever imagine.<eos> When I close my eyes...<eos> I hear more screams than anyone could ever be able to count.<eos> And you know what you do with all that pain?<eos> Shall I tell you where you put it?<eos> You hold it tight, till it burns your hand.
This is harmless.<eos> A baby rattle that you shook in your little, pink fist?<eos> To your brother, that is a piece of you.<eos> 'As intimate as hair, teeth, skin.'<eos> What will happen.. ...when you find him?<eos> 'We'll bring him to justice.'<eos> With lethal force if need be.<eos> You may not want this for your brother but it's necessary for the predator who put six girls through absolute hell.<eos> I'll take Officer Calderon's access card.<eos> I don't think you'll find it useful anymore.
This is all my fault.<eos> I have to come up with some way to break you out of the hospital.<eos> Uh, whoopsie-doodles!<eos> I'm a nutso!<eos> Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!<eos> Yeah, yeah, we get it.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> If you wanted to come in here, you could've just admitted yourself.<eos> You didn't have to dry-hump our mailbox.<eos> Yeah, you go out and get your mail and tell me if it's dry.
Sorry, pal, but I need that outfit more than you.<eos> Yeah, I don't think those clothes are gonna fit me.<eos> You look more my size.<eos> Next up, it's the Blues Brothers.<eos> Damn.<eos> No time to change.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's showtime.<eos> Roger, what about this pink skirt?<eos> It has sentimental value.
But, still, it could be good news.<eos> Well, then why is my cop sense telling me it's bad?<eos> Hey, guys. Got something.<eos> I was running those license plates on Emma's list, seeing if any of the owners have criminal backgrounds, when I noticed this car registered to an address right down the street from the coffee shop where Emma went the day she was killed.<eos> She was surveilling that car.<eos> She must have thought it was the one that Zoey got into at the truck stop.<eos> And when the owner of the car realized she was onto him, - he went after her.<eos> - Whose car is it?<eos> That's the weird thing.<eos> It belongs to this woman.
Well, there's got to be something.<eos> Okay, so this is your immediate future.<eos> Two of cups?<eos> You're going to have coffee. - Great.<eos> - It actually means romance.<eos> That's unlikely.<eos> Well, it could also mean friendship.<eos> Well, now you're just guessing.<eos> - I mean, so this card is the final outcome. - Okay.<eos> What does it mean?
Maybe I'm following in my father's footsteps, maybe I'm not.<eos> I've never even met him.<eos> my mother, and... he doesn't live near us.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Whew. Yeah, well, I don't know why I felt I had to tell you this.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> You know, m-maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe if I'd met you sooner, my life would be a whole lot different.<eos> Well, now you have.<eos> Maybe it will be.
I know. I spent the whole day with her.<eos> She jumps into new challenges all the time.<eos> And that's what this place is to her... her newest challenge...<eos> Until she finds her next one.<eos> And her next.<eos> But that's not me.<eos> See, I don't care if this place is the shiniest or the fanciest or if it's a beat-up hunk of junk.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, it'll always be the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.<eos> This is not a stepping stone for me.<eos> I believe in this hospital and what it can do.
Is one of them Booth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've got proof that Booth was there, and before you ask me if I'm sure, I sequenced the blood four times.<eos> Blood?<eos> !<eos> That's Booth right there.<eos> He was hit.<eos> I mapped the blood.<eos> There was a lot of it.<eos> And it's definitely his.
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, 'cause this is where the sickening first takes hold, so I need you to play that up.<eos> Are you sitting down?<eos> Why don't you get up out of your chair?<eos> Act like it's all taking over your body.<eos> The sickening!<eos> It's happening!<eos> The virus, it's eating my flesh!<eos> My eyes are on fire!<eos> What is happening in the lab?<eos> The room, it's contaminated!
Let's go do some coke and then play some laser tag.<eos> Oh, no, I'm not up for that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, hey! What the fuck? That's my jacket.<eos> - Uh... - She's trying to steal my jacket.<eos> Hold my drink.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> He bought it for me.<eos> It's from Paris.<eos> It's from fucking Topshop, and it's mine.
I've thought about screenwriting.<eos> So, yeah, I guess I'm kind of a writer.<eos> Well, I've got this idea for a movie, and I need somebody to bounce ideas off of.<eos> You interested in coming by my trailer to discuss it?<eos> Yeah, that'd be cool.<eos> Hey, why does your trailer always smell like Cinnabons?<eos> That's because I bake Cinnabons.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah. I have this small oven.<eos> It's fantastic.
Fly brand coke.<eos> Seen that before?<eos> No.<eos> Looks like he slit her jumpsuit here.<eos> To have sex with her?<eos> The cut was made after she died. See?<eos> It's a perfect cut.<eos> If she'd been alive, there would have been a struggle. It would be jagged.<eos> What if he drugged and raped her?<eos> The blood pattern is perfectly divided, which says it had already coagulated.
It's gonna make for our number?<eos> Better than expected.<eos> - Oh, that's good.<eos> - It sure is.<eos> Make sure you stay focused on the fine print.<eos> You got it.<eos> I'm buying your company, Sparky.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Your company...<eos> It'll now be a wholly owned subsidiary of Briggs Oil.
Now, personally, I think it's bullshit that he was ever charged in the first place.<eos> I think it's bullshit that you're still actually fucking holding him.<eos> - He got bail.<eos> - Yeah, but you know he can't pay.<eos> [Scoffs] Listen, detective, uh...<eos> You have my statement.<eos> Not gonna change it.<eos> There is weights and cardio, grappling mats, bags, and the women's locker room is back there.<eos> Is there a sauna?<eos> Yeah, but it's in the men's room, so you just have to knock.
Oh, no.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Well, that he is.<eos> Huh, looky here.<eos> All these little bottles of booze.<eos> You're lucky, Buzz.<eos> When you compare notes with the other reserve officers tomorrow, you'll definitely have the best story.<eos> Suicide note?<eos> More like the world's worst greeting card.<eos> "A love like ours must have been fated, even when it's so belated."
She was in my room, too.<eos> You think she took my pills?<eos> No, she usually asks.<eos> You know, Lieutenant, if the murderer tried to sedate Mr. Egan by dumping Valium into his energy drink and found a way into his room, it might've been surprising to find him still awake and lying in the bathtub.<eos> That would explain the hair dryer and the struggle afterwards...<eos> Oh, thank you. Thank you, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> As you will recall, I was the first person to point out that our victim probably had been drugged.<eos> I'll call Morales, have him focus his tox panel on variants of Valium. We should also look through the hotel trash, see if we can find this girl's prescription bottles.<eos> If we could print them, we might be able to still make the game.<eos> It doesn't start till 7:00.
Last night, right after her told me that I couldn't run away with Danny, I punched Brad in the face, and he didn't even try to hit me back.<eos> He just stood there, crying like a baby.<eos> I never thought he would take it out on Danny.<eos> Brad's so sensible.<eos> Okay, here's an idea.<eos> Since we still have the groom present, why don't we reunite this happy couple?<eos> Do we still have our privacy sign somewhere?<eos> Oh, the privacy sign.<eos> Just a little bit of advice, Brad.<eos> You can still save this wedding, but it's gonna take complete honesty, because if you begin the marriage any other way, it's not gonna last.
I didn't know you were coming.<eos> I just came for my things.<eos> Come in.<eos> I put them in this box.<eos> - As I was moving in...<eos> - No problem.<eos> Where's my ratings notebook?<eos> - Notebook?<eos> - The blue ring-bound one.<eos> Isn't it there?
The home's security system was hacked.<eos> Check this out.<eos> He always do that?<eos> Bury the lead?<eos> Ah, he loves the attention.<eos> You know, in his mind this is the bridge and he's Captain Kirk, you know?<eos> Anyway... one of the apps I was able to recover from the phone was for P-TECH alarm systems, and the last time the phone's app was accessed it armed the home security system in Scott Barrett's home.<eos> But according to the police report, no alarm was triggered during the burglary.<eos> I already called the security company.<eos> Their logs show an incoming command to disarm the system, but a closer look revealed it didn't come from the home keypad or the app.
And Scott Barrett.<eos> Clear!<eos> Rae said her doll told her to unlock the window.<eos> Her doll?<eos> Marla.<eos> Marla talks.<eos> So, the question is, how does Marla talk?<eos> When a little girl wants Marla to speak, she pushes this button which triggers a microphone.<eos> As Marla listens, audio recordings travel through the Web to a server where it's processed into a text.<eos> It creates a database so in the future, when the doll responds, it responds with something that the child likes.
How do I go back to work after this?<eos> How can I focus on anything?<eos> And when's Mr. Robot going to contact me again?<eos> What's he waiting for?<eos> Did I just destroy a man's life for no reason?<eos> I'm gonna talk to HR about a salary bump for you.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Take the raise.<eos> It's not gonna be much, but it's the best I can do right now.
No, it's city property, so you're not really supposed to take those home.<eos> Oh, for sure, for sure.<eos> Oh, hey, by the way, a bunch of us are gonna kill you in the shower later.<eos> Okay, so we're all on the same page, right?<eos> We bury the body, we never speak of this again.<eos> Deal. - Got it.<eos> Yup.<eos> Wow, that was exhausting.<eos> Wait a minute, is-is that-- is that his car?<eos> Aw, crap, it's still alive!
You are so predictable.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> You two are just adorable.<eos> So?<eos> What do you think, Sherlock?<eos> Well, it's ultimately for the experts to decide, but the original painting was stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.<eos> It's crazy how art has become a favorite currency of drug dealers and terrorists.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No wonder.<eos> If this painting is original, it's worth over $200 million.
Should I talk to him about it?<eos> Honey, that has to be your decision.<eos> We are through meddling in your love life.<eos> - Yeah. - Though I will say he's still very much engaged.<eos> Whereas, I would ‭want to know if he got fat because he was still in love with me.<eos> And now we're out.<eos> See, don't you feel better?<eos> No.<eos> Don't stress out about light and perspective and -- And color.<eos> You know, just let your painting be what it wants to be.
- Good. Then you'll also recall that you owe Lenny a favor for saving your life.<eos> Time to make good on that debt, Flash.<eos> I do not like her.<eos> Yeah, but she makes a point.<eos> We should at least hear her out.<eos> Right?<eos> Even if I wanted to help, how are we supposed to find him?<eos> Not a problem.<eos> See, when I rebuilt the cold gun, I didn't have time to place a tracker on it, so I devised a method of locating it by borrowing some military technology.<eos> See, the gun works the same as thermal imaging, only instead of infrared heat signatures, it's looking for ultraviolet cold signatures.
Ah, well, no more takeaways.<eos> My cholesterol is sky-high.<eos> No, his paperwork is obviously false.<eos> You can see it pretty quick.<eos> They come in here with their fake IDs and their licences, and I send them away just as quick.<eos> Can I take this?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Most of the drivers have their own cars, y'know.<eos> I never saw his car myself, but I'm told it was a piece of shit.<eos> My engineers said that it was... Well, it stank of kebabs.
Graham.<eos> There is an item missing.<eos> No there isn't.<eos> I was looking at the bowl.<eos> It's in with the loose pieces.<eos> No, I saw the bowl.<eos> There's supposed to be eight items in this bag.<eos> Without the bowl, there should be seven there's only six.<eos> The mask is missing.<eos> It's probably in the basement. I'll find it.
Fine. Fine. Fine.<eos> Nice to have met you, Lieutenant.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Just be careful with my stuff.<eos> His body fit in one box, and his personal effects in another.<eos> Couple of nice pens, a high-school graduation ring, child's baseball glove, compass, some books.<eos> That all?<eos> Well, the apartment came furnished, and his landlord sold everything else because Harrison was behind on rent, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, well, it might have looked like the victim left town.<eos> This baseball glove is too small for Harrison, it's too new to be something from his childhood, and the name on it says "Stinger."
OK.<eos> OK...<eos> Yes, OK, let's do this thing.<eos> First up, stop the countdown.<eos> 526 minutes, right!<eos> Yes, you know what, Local Knowledge, I don't know who did this to you or why.<eos> But I do almost certainly know... .. how to find them.<eos> There have always been rumours.<eos> Stories passed from traveller to traveller, mutterings about hidden streets, secret pockets of alien life right here on Earth.<eos> Like a smuggler's cove, only not a cove, because it's right here.
Come on!<eos> - There's something about this tech...<eos> - Doctor, we don't have time!<eos> What is it?<eos> It looks like medical data.<eos> But it can't be.<eos> She's dead -- she isn't breathing.<eos> This thing is a stasis pod.<eos> If you're dead, it's a kind of fancy refrigerator.<eos> But if you're alive... .. it simply keeps you that way.
Hope is a terrible thing on the scaffold.<eos> Where can he run?<eos> Where he always runs.<eos> Away.<eos> Just away.<eos> - What do you think of the new wheels?<eos> - Basic.<eos> - Classic!<eos> Look at the colour scheme.<eos> - It's all white.
- Why? ! That evacuates the waste tank on deck seven.<eos> - Does it?<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> Better avoid deck seven then.<eos> Something's interfering with the engines, which is technically not possible.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - How would you know?<eos> Maybe the engines are interfering with themselves.<eos> Wild theory, but what if this machine had certain safeguards.<eos> For instance, maybe it can't take off when a life form registers as being both inside and outside at the same time?

- Yes, ma'am.<eos> So, Ramone... .. you have a metal body now.<eos> Down, girl!<eos> - Now, that, my dear, IS a suit.<eos> - Happy Christmas.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't think you've ever given me a present before.<eos> It's a sonic screwdriver!<eos> How lovely!<eos> When I saw the sonic trowel, I thought it was just embarrassing, but, look.
The area is kinda dicey.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's a great area.<eos> Is it?<eos> You know, 'cause I'm pretty sure I saw a guy in a hoodie when we were coming in.<eos> Aw, Jimmy, you're wearing a hoodie.<eos> Did you see your own reflection?<eos> Possibly.<eos> You know, and it's just really expensive, and it's, like, ugh.<eos> I don't think it's that expensive.
With Ari dead, Logan continues to squeeze me, I'll take a reassignment.<eos> Logan is gonna know it was you.<eos> Ari's got a lot of enemies, Mike.<eos> The Bureau will be watching.<eos> They won't, actually.<eos> By Logan's design, dick that he is, I have no cover team.<eos> So, when I'm alone with Ari, I am alone with him.<eos> Okay, Logan is not gonna accept this convenient death as your out.<eos> If you don't do exactly what he says, he's gonna use that Juan Badillo tape against you.<eos> It was in my bag.
Everything we'd done...<eos> I just couldn't fathom wasting it.<eos> So I committed a selfish act.<eos> And I still see Lina in my dreams.<eos> Don't leave, Paige.<eos> You're lucky, you know that?<eos> You see her in your dreams, but when you wake up, she's gone.<eos> I don't have that luxury.<eos> You... this goddamn medal, is a constant reminder of what I did wrong.<eos> Why don't you let it be a reminder of what you did right?
Fuck the book.<eos> I wish we could destroy it.<eos> Oh, Ash said we can't.<eos> He tried.<eos> No dice.<eos> Actually, he said that he tried burning it.<eos> But we could... we could electrocute it, we could freeze it, or maybe even a pipe bomb...<eos> No, Ash said we can't.<eos> 'Cause we need The Book to help with the Deadites.<eos> But it doesn't help.
But it doesn't help.<eos> If anything, it just keeps those things coming back around.<eos> Wait, is that what you want?<eos> What?<eos> You want to keep The Book around so more Deadites show up for you to kill.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> Kelly, you need to be careful of revenge.<eos> My uncle, he always said, "Pablito, beware anger, fear revenge."<eos> If once you start down that path, forever, it will dominate your destiny.

Oh, so there IS lunch.<eos> You've already had all you're getting.<eos> I can't. Thanks.<eos> I'm just on my way to the gym.<eos> I've been going a lot lately.<eos> Do you mind if we go with you, Ash?<eos> I was just saying that Freddie and I should be in better shape.<eos> Speak for yourself. I'm in fantastic shape.<eos> People are always staring at my ass.<eos> Because it hangs behind your knees!
Ooh, I agree!<eos> Would you like a bit of lunch?<eos> How nice!<eos> I never thought I'd actually be enjoying myself here.<eos> We'll make something quick and simple and then dash out.<eos> There are peas.<eos> And I can roast a chicken!<eos> Oh, that was very nice to walk us home, Theo.<eos> No problem.<eos> I love your flat. It's fabulous.
I'd be all right if you died first.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm not going to.<eos> But I want you to know, it's OK if you do.<eos> As in completely and totally fine.<eos> I suppose none of that matters now.<eos> Since we're both going to die together in this gym.<eos> At least our corpses will be toned.<eos> I hope they don't bury me in this outfit.<eos> It's grabbing and pulling in lots of odd places.
Some of them got sick along the way.<eos> The rest were just damaged people.<eos> Traumatized themselves like you, but they could heal.<eos> Some more, some less, but they can.<eos> We all can.<eos> I know it.<eos> It's all a circle and everything gets a return.<eos> The door is open.<eos> That door right there.<eos> The cell door, it's open.
Gawain Maddox, milord.<eos> I come up from the South.<eos> Punisher by trade.<eos> You have tools in possession?<eos> Yea'on.<eos> Ride with us.<eos> I may need your services.<eos> My family.<eos> Ride the main trail north.<eos> It leads to Castle Ventris.
Welcome to Castle Ventris, executioner.<eos> Baroness.<eos> The priest, he said I could come for evening prayer.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> I welcome the chapel's use.<eos> Few spend time here but me.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Please.<eos> I wouldn't think one of your trade would complicate things with prayer.<eos> Perhaps it takes you in deeper.

- that my sister won't wake up?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> - In the medical profession, nothing's 100%.<eos> - Then that's it.<eos> No. We're not taking her off life support.<eos> Mr. Claybourne, I appreciate how you feel, but, respectfully, it's not up to you.<eos> It's up to Ms. O'Connor.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You have the medical power of attorney your mother signed before the surgery.<eos> It's still in effect.
I...<eos> 'Cause I learned from an early age that things aren't as they seem.<eos> Because I want to make sure that what happened to my mom and dad never happens to anybody else.<eos> Because I can only do so much as a cop.<eos> You guys like cops, right?<eos> 'Cause I'm grateful... for the peace, safety, and stability this country offered to my family.<eos> Because...<eos> That's her.<eos> She's your mark.<eos> Because I believe in this country and what it stands for.
It's obviously a part of the test.<eos> What if you're wrong?<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> Parrish is never wrong.<eos> She has "instincts."<eos> Yeah, but unlike last time, if she's wrong here, we're dead.<eos> Okay, if it is real, then we have to disarm it 'cause we can't go anywhere anyway.<eos> And if it's not real, if it's part of the test, like I think it is, then disarming it gets us out of here.<eos> I'm presuming this "bomb" is connected to the doors.<eos> Oh, okay, so you just want to disarm the bomb just in case it's real.
You just saw him two weeks ago.<eos> He didn't meet, fall in love with, and marry a woman in two weeks.<eos> No more blocking.<eos> Click that contact.<eos> Alex?<eos> Look, if I was the bomber, wouldn't I have gone through with it already?<eos> The convention isn't for hours.<eos> The convention?<eos> What does that have to do with this?<eos> The fact that it's today?
They're under this building.<eos> The dogs have been all through the building.<eos> They found nothing.<eos> It must be somewhere where they can't smell it.<eos> I keep thinking about that braided copper wire.<eos> Why use that instead of the blasting wire, like at GCT?<eos> Braided copper... It's non-corrosive.<eos> It's designed to withstand extreme temperatures...<eos> Fire, heat, cold, water.<eos> The EDC teams wouldn't be able to detect a bomb if it was submerged.
But my fertility clinic has a booth at the Manhattan Fertility Expo.<eos> Yeah, we started a pretty innovative new program.<eos> It's to convince girls in their 20s to want to freeze their eggs.<eos> It's called "Later, Baby!"<eos> And it was my idea!<eos> I'm a business partner. Frisbee!<eos> [disc clatters]<eos> - Sorry. - Really?<eos> No takers for a free dinner?<eos> Unbelievable. You lot would turn down a free car if it was from me!
Look, I don't want to go.<eos> I mean, he wasn't a great dad.<eos> - Neither were you, you dick.<eos> - These are beautiful family photos. - These are beautiful family photos.<eos> Interesting, he's got brown eyes and she's got brown eyes.<eos> But this old man, brown eyes.<eos> - You know, I think Eric got his blue eyes from somebody on Danny's side of the family.<eos> - Ah, yeah, probably.<eos> There's just one little problem with your theory there, lady.<eos> It's garbage.
It's nothing I haven't seen.<eos> Actually, I've never seen it like that.<eos> Can you not look at my vagina?<eos> Get out of here!<eos> ♪ Like a big pizza pie that's amore ♪ Oh, my God.<eos> ♪ ♪ Annette, Annette, good morning.<eos> I really appreciate you doing the laundry, but I was wondering if you could just look at the tags because I think some of my clothes have shrunk.<eos> Are you sure you didn't get bigger?<eos> Well, Leo is all fed and changed, and I put his gold chain back on again.<eos> It keeps disappearing.
Yes, I'll be over.<eos> I'll get Leo.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> I have to go pick up Leo from Annette's.<eos> I don't know how I'm going to prepare for this presentation.<eos> Okay, you're not going anywhere.<eos> You're going to sit there on your butt and you're going to practice.<eos> If you don't have time to prepare, you could let, say, your new partner give the presentation.<eos> I don't know how to explain this to you but, like, you're not my partner,<eos> I'm going to be doing this presentation by myself, it's going to be as compelling as a TED Talk, and as funny as "Ted 2." Okay?
- 'Sup.<eos> - No.<eos> - Annette, there you are!<eos> - Oh, Sonu.<eos> - [grunting] - Oh, you guys found each other.<eos> Oh, sorry, you guys are here together, but Morgan, didn't you have that story you wanted to tell Ma?<eos> Yes.<eos> About my wound, which is healed.<eos> But the rash around it is worse than ever.<eos> It's making, like, a little bit of a hiss sound.
He told me you two were trying for more kids, which is strange because you just asked me<eos> - for birth control.<eos> - Does he want more kids?<eos> I have no idea, I mean, I can't read his mind.<eos> If I did, I'd know his PIN and I'd steal all his money.<eos> Oh, don't play dumb with me.<eos> You're dumb about a great many things;<eos> the news, etiquette, where the moon goes during the day.<eos> I know where the moon goes.<eos> It hides behind the sun.
- I'm worried about you, Elliot. I really want you to keep coming here. We've got a lot more work to do.<eos> She wants more from me but she doesn't believe in me.<eos> I tried because I believe some part inside of you - wants to do this right.<eos> - You?<eos> Are you on her side?<eos> You should clean your sockets.<eos> Sounds too good to be true, but I'll bite.<eos> - What's the ask?<eos> - Given my client has information that could help your client's case, we want the meeting restricted to her, Colby, and myself,<eos> - and we want it conducted off-record.
I'm messing with you.<eos> It was a S.H.I.E.L.D. thing ... one of their ridiculous codes of bureaucracy, though I will say there are a few things that S.H.I.E.L.D. got right ... things they valued.<eos> And I don't mean money... or power or resources.<eos> Now, take this job, for instance.<eos> It's all about accountability, patience, an attention to detail that requires a... personal touch.<eos> Those kinds of things mattered at S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Almost a shame we're gonna bring it all down.<eos> - So, what's the job?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> - When's it going down?
- That's more like 100 meters.<eos> Unless there was some significant earthquake... it doesn't want us to leave.<eos> There it is!<eos> It's opening!<eos> There has to be a way to make that.<eos> We didn't come this far to fail.<eos> Maybe we don't have to get there.<eos> Hand me the bottle.<eos> We can fire it right into the portal.<eos> If it's not dragging any rope, it might just make it.
Come on, dear.<eos> You're very good, Penelope.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And so are you, Robert.<eos> Robert?<eos> But we've always danced wonderfully together.<eos> Do you remember our wedding, Robert?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It was so beautiful.
Do you hear me? Right now.<eos> By the way... I know.<eos> Know what?<eos> I wasn't talking to you.<eos> Go.<eos> Dad.<eos> Hello, son.<eos> When's the next batch coming in?<eos> What batch?<eos> What are you talking about? Just tell us when it's coming in.
Captain?<eos> Heavy Heavy Club, 4th and Pierce?<eos> What about it?<eos> It's where Lonnie Machin is holding Jessica Danforth's daughter.<eos> You said you're doing things differently now?<eos> Here's your chance to prove it.<eos> [Water dripping]<eos> Sorry to leave you hanging.<eos> I had a meeting.<eos> It didn't go well.
Will you consider the piano a donation?<eos> I must go.<eos> Thank you for lunch, Mr Goddard.<eos> Goodness me.<eos> A house call.<eos> Spontaneous appointments, the latest in modern medicine.<eos> How terribly unconventional of you.<eos> How is my Lois Lane?<eos> Oh, you'll be pleased to know that I've just handed in my first and last piece to Sir Richard.<eos> It won't see the light of day, but it was immensely satisfying nonetheless.
Casper, Melker and Baltazar.<eos> If you want to play with the manger?<eos> Be wary of Jesus.<eos> He disappears quite easily into the straw.<eos> Francis of Assisi made the first crib.<eos> -Stop, Alexander.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> you need to be a little careful.<eos> Can it break?<eos> Yes, it's old.
By the way, Chloe, this is what you should be doing.<eos> Thinking of ways to enhance all our wedding events.<eos> Isn't that what we're paying you for?<eos> I'm paying you.<eos> I'm really pushed right up against you, Ash.<eos> I don't even know where to put my hands.<eos> Not there!<eos> Your flat is so charming, Ash.<eos> I can't believe we've never been up here before.<eos> It's not too small?

Well, there's a lot you don't know about me, even after sneaking two of your agents into my workplace.<eos> Just to say it, technically, I was right to do that.<eos> You are working for Hydra.<eos> And also I'm sorry.<eos> Any sensible girl would swipe left in this moment.<eos> - Honestly, don't know what that means.<eos> - You're such a luddite.<eos> You know I have a flying car, right?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> It's from the '60s.
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, yes, but I'd hoped that I'd find someone to seize it with me.<eos> I thought it might be Pierce, but he was bloodthirsty.<eos> Thought it might be John Garrett, but his vanity led him to think of nothing but himself.<eos> John Garrett is the only reason I put my faith in Hydra.<eos> And that is the greatest thing he ever achieved for our cause.<eos> I'm no soldier.<eos> You're the finest we ever made.<eos> You're the only one that can do this.<eos> And if you cross over to that other side, you will finally see that your faith in Hydra was never misplaced.<eos> It's real.
Don't we look nice this morning?<eos> Oh no, my poetry!<eos> Oh!<eos> Sorry, sorry!<eos> Major brunch foul.<eos> This is amazing!<eos> And now for a Boo York specialty, scary cherries flambé!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> The food!<eos> It's on fire!
My guess is that the ones you're using are pretty primitive compared to what's going on up here.<eos> These are a sort of a Mark II, yeah?<eos> Obviously, I have tried to improve the process.<eos> Speed things up.<eos> You've succeeded there.<eos> But how does the dust become those creatures?<eos> You saw what happened.<eos> The dust conglomerates.<eos> It moulds itself into a humanoid form.<eos> It's adaptable.

Of course, sweetheart.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You're my bestest friend.<eos> Look, the child support is coming, all right?<eos> It's just hard finding a job when you have a record.<eos> I'm sure you'll figure it out.<eos> But for now, I want you out of my house.<eos> - No way! It's my daughter's birthday. - It's my house!<eos> - So what?<eos> It's my kid!
"You gotta be more specific."<eos> And he's like, "I'm looking for a guy that shrinks." And I'm, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous 'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.<eos> So I asked Ignacio,<eos> "Did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick "to tell you to tell me, because I'm tight with Ant-Man, "that he's looking for him?"<eos> And?<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He said, "Yes."<eos> There's something I want to show you.<eos> I realized you can't destroy power.<eos> All you can do is make sure that it's in the right hands.
Because I really hated that scheming Dickerhoof lady. - Hey, mom.<eos> - Hi, Rusty.<eos> How was your interview with Slider?<eos> Interesting.<eos> Knowing he was being filmed changed his attitude a little.<eos> Oh, Sharon, did you figure out how to explain things to Julio?<eos> Well, not exactly, but I think I've offered him a way to explain things to himself.<eos> And Lieutenant Provenza's gonna check in on him afterwards and see how it went.<eos> As the car began to roll over, the airbags deployed. While they softened the initial impact, they can't stabilize the neck.<eos> It broke on the first turn of the car.
Henry.<eos> May I cut in?<eos> It would be an honor to dance with the savior.<eos> I trust you're having a lovely evening.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Everything's... who's that girl talking to my son?<eos> The better question is, who are you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Let me tell you a story.<eos> Many years ago, a boy returned to his village in the enchanted forest to find it ablaze.
You know, it's customary to bring a gift for a housewarming.<eos> Maybe a nice bottle of wine.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I suppose we could bottle that rage and drink it instead.<eos> You're right...<eos> I'm not the savior. Glad you finally caught up with the rest of us.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> I know the only way to stop the fury is to pay its price.<eos> - Then why aren't you off paying it?<eos> - Because I know what it is.
Oh, Happy, there's something I learned as the Dark One.<eos> If your name is on something, hold on to it.<eos> If we're going to free Merlin, we need witchbane.<eos> Yeah, but the labels are all faded.<eos> Forget the decloaking potion.<eos> It's not a glamour anyway.<eos> You sure?<eos> If I'm getting this right, the tree could actually be him transfigured, right?<eos> We could find out with a sample.<eos> Yeah, and when we snap off a twig and it turns into a finger, who's crying then?
A dreamcatcher.<eos> Emma, this is dark magic.<eos> I know.<eos> These things catch more than dreams.<eos> I know.<eos> And you have to wave it over someone to capture a memory.<eos> I don't.<eos> This dark magic is stronger, more unpredictable than any magic I've ever used.<eos> The image just appeared.<eos> It showed me what Arthur did to them.
When I was seeing Rumplestiltskin in my head, he said he would only be with me until I embraced my dark powers.<eos> So recently, I've been thinking maybe not seeing him, maybe that's a bad thing.<eos> Have you embraced your powers?<eos> I've done some dark things recently.<eos> I hurt someone...<eos> My son.<eos> And if I dig deep down the darkness is winning.<eos> But there's hope, right?<eos> You wouldn't be bothering to get this spark if there wasn't still hope.<eos> There is hope, and it's up there.
My sister, where is she?<eos> You know, you don't have to fight us, Abbie.<eos> There is a place for you two Witnesses in the new world.<eos> You have a right by lineage.<eos> I swear, if you do anything to harm her...<eos> That is beautiful.<eos> That's loyalty to family.<eos> But I'm sensing something else underneath.<eos> There's an old wound.<eos> It's festering.
Wait, look.<eos> These are summoning spells.<eos> Some in Latin, some in Norse.<eos> Wait, Norse like those berserkers that came after Jenny?<eos> Nevins must have used this to summon them.<eos> Now I'm curious.<eos> What other creatures could this raise?<eos> I like where you're headed with this.<eos> Wait, so that book can pull monsters out of Pandora's box?<eos> If it can, it may be very handy indeed.
So, see, I combined all your ideas into one giant base.<eos> And I was thinking we could call it the Dragon's Edge.<eos> What do you guys think?<eos> Okay, I just need to point out that this is the first time that that has ever happened.<eos> Let's take a look.<eos> Everybody gets to make their section of Dragon's Edge whatever they want it to be.<eos> Astrid, you can make yours the most heavily-armed bedroom in the known Viking world.<eos> And, Fishlegs, your place is quiet and secluded, overlooking the ocean, very serene, very relaxing, with lots of room for your very own rock garden.<eos> Snotlout, your spot is up here.<eos> Now, it's not S-shaped, but you can go S-crazy and paint them all over it.
We just need to block the wave from hitting the camp.<eos> Isn't it a little late for that, Hiccup?<eos> No!<eos> Gobber's rock wall...<eos> that's big enough to stop the wave.<eos> We just need to reinforce it.<eos> The wave's coming!<eos> Hurry!<eos> The wall's not going to be high enough to stop that wave!<eos> And it's cracking!
Dragon riders, you asked for it!<eos> We built it.<eos> Presenting you...<eos> - with your new rock lookout tower!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> You guys never disappoint, do you?<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> Wait!<eos> It was here a minute ago!
The lord tristan and his sister the lady aurora.<eos> Cami: Right now, people like me are out there getting killed By people like you,<eos> Conveniently timed with the arrival of your old acquaintance.<eos> -What happened?<eos> -I was attacked.<eos> Kara, do not walk away from me.<eos> [chants]<eos> I'm regent.<eos> They should respect me.<eos> The target on your back, it comes with the job.
You take no responsibility for the wreckage your mistakes have caused.<eos> Admit it, Wells, and then maybe you can truly help me do something about it.<eos> Help you, because I'm the greatest tech entrepreneur of all time?<eos> You're the superhero, and we would all be safe if you would just do your job and stop Zoom.<eos> Well, I guess it's safe to say the speedster sensors work.<eos> - You okay, Dad?<eos> - I'm fine, sweetie.<eos> Now where was I?<eos> Oh, that's right, the future.<eos> Very strange to be holding your autobiography, especially when you didn't write it and it's not about you.
I guess we'd both gone for a while without a friend.<eos> Dipper, can I tell you something?<eos> You asked me earlier what I was working on.<eos> Well...<eos> I dismantled the portal.<eos> An inter-dimensional gateway is too dangerous for the world it feeds into.<eos> That's why I was mad at Stan for using it.<eos> He saved me, but as I feared, the instability of the machine created this.<eos> An inter-dimensional rift.<eos> I've contained it for now, but it's incredibly dangerous.
Think it would be more accurate to say that we made each other, but, yes,<eos> I turned him.<eos> What was your impression of Tristan de Martel?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He seemed... Incomplete.<eos> He has a sister... Aurora.<eos> To be perfectly frank with you,<eos> I'm surprised that he's without her.<eos> His devotion to her is absolutely pathological.<eos> It's dangerous.
Uh!<eos> (Gasping)<eos> You stupid girl, why would you do this to yourself?<eos> (Panting)<eos> It's Tristan.<eos> He forbade me from seeing Niklaus.<eos> Everything inside of me was screaming.<eos> I had to let it out.<eos> To take your own life?<eos> Aurora, this pain, it will pass.
From now on, you had to understand that it is not a simple notebook?<eos> How does it feel to kill?<eos> Shit!<eos> Papa.<eos> Sayu.<eos> Farewell.<eos> You do not want this notebook ? My presence does not mean that you will soon die. Light Yagami.<eos> The Gods of death do not take souls. Contrary to what humans say.<eos> Once the notebook falls into the human world. It belongs to the world of humans.<eos> In other words, it's yours.
Why in the [Bleep] would I ever do that, ever?<eos> And how dare you even ask me that?<eos> And why aren't you more ashamed of yourself?<eos> Dad!<eos> Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie.<eos> Jerry! Do you know what you just said to our daughter?<eos> Sor-ry!<eos> I wasn't paying attention.<eos> To a conversation about vampires?<eos> ! Clearly, I didn't know it was about vampires, because I wasn't paying attention, which you would know, if you ever paid attention to me!
Don't worry about Jerry.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> You hear me, Jerry?<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - Ooh, watch out for that stuff.<eos> It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send you into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.
Beth, can we talk about this privately?<eos> You know, I think the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud,<eos> "I prefer to keep my penis."<eos> But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis?<eos> ! Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?<eos> Hey, listen, is your mouth tiny and small?<eos> Then why don't you come to Lil' Bits...<eos> MAN:<eos> Lil' Bits! ...where the food is tiny.<eos> It looks like regular food, but really tiny.

- Are you okay?<eos> - Yes. I have to find somewhere to hide.<eos> Well, you can hide with us.<eos> Rick? - Yeah?<eos> - Do you think we could take --<eos> - W-What's your name?<eos> - Arthrisha.<eos> Could we take Arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge?<eos> Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you've done to blackmail me?<eos> Your vehicle -- ls it from the gods?
You let your wiener do the walking, and now I'm dead.<eos> - Rick, she took the car!<eos> - You fucking kidding me, Morty?<eos> ! She took my car and the gun.<eos> We're like the rest of these assholes now.<eos> W-W-We're gonna get purged, Morty.<eos> Help me up.<eos> Oh, geez, geez! Wait a minute, Rick.<eos> Why don't we just use your portal gun?<eos> It's in the car, dip-ass.
- My mother died.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> No.<eos> It was last week, but she didn't leave a will.<eos> It shouldn't be contentious.<eos> There's only two of us.<eos> It's my brother and myself, and my mother had put tack-on notes on everything to make sure that there wouldn't be any disputes over who got what.<eos> My mother doesn't have a lot of valuable things, but she was a friend of Marc Chagall's wife, Valentina, and she had given her a signed print.<eos> A signed Chagall?<eos> Do you know what it's worth?
I protected my own interests.<eos> - We had a deal!<eos> - We didn't have a thing.<eos> You think I bought that John Dellmore stunt At the restaurant?<eos> I was on to you the second you walked over to my table.<eos> I let you give me that bullshit speech About grinders and rainmakers just so I could do What I just did.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> You made your point, you made a name for yourself, But, Jack, you need to undo this.<eos> What makes you think I could have undone it In the first place?<eos> They voted for that proposal Because it put more money in their pockets, And now it's there to stay.
Was from Baghdad Station.<eos> Apparently, Samir Khalil was demanding to speak to me.<eos> He said he had important information.<eos> He was adamant about it.<eos> "Information"?<eos> That Ahmed Nazari was alive.<eos> Allison, listen, did you, did you have any reason to question the intel he was providing?<eos> No.<eos> No, his stuff was good.<eos> It always checked out.
That's a mistake.<eos> I can rehabilitate myself.<eos> Already, I've talked my way back in this far.<eos> You will never be fully trusted.<eos> And we will never fully trust the information you are given access to.<eos> Wait a minute, damn it.<eos> Take your hands off me.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.<eos> And you will see to it that it does.
Can you help me?<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I can't get a signal here.<eos> Would you take this phone to the next level and send my text?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't have time to do that.<eos> Please, I am a federal officer.<eos> It's a matter of life and death.<eos> May I see some identification?<eos> The attack on the news?<eos> It's happening here.
So is everybody excited for Father's Day on Sunday?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> I always try to avoid Father's Day now.<eos> Every year, I used to take my dad to the horse track.<eos> Now we just go rooting around for bargains at the mall.<eos> Oh, this is darling, isn't it?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Glenn, do you think you'd see my bra through this blouse?<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> Is it too sheer?

Do you think it's too sheer?
Oh, Dad.<eos> That would've been fine for the old me, but Brian and I have to be going.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Yeah, we're off to see an old movie on temporary screen in a muddy, freezing park.<eos> That sounds awful.<eos> It is awful.<eos> But at least parking will be impossible.<eos> Bye! Geez, I... feel like I just...<eos> lost my son.<eos> Aw, I got a skin tag in my crack and it stings when I don't wipe right.
Apart from the music.<eos> Denis paints when he's depressed.<eos> - It's a form of therapy.<eos> - So the painting is good, then?<eos> Well, no, because Denis needs to spend time in the community.<eos> Yeah, but if the painting makes him happy, then...<eos> Look, if you don't want to write the column, just say so.<eos> No, it's not that - it's just that when you say I ruined a man's life, I think you're taking it a bit too far.<eos> You ruined his life?<eos> Well, no, because it doesn't seem ruined, to be honest.
- I'm open to suggestions.<eos> - Now you're listening to me?<eos> - It's your city, Oliver.<eos> All right.<eos> That's new.<eos> Yep, comes in handy.<eos> We can't use that serum on Barry.<eos> That's up to him, isn't it?<eos> If Barry wants to stop Zoom, this is what he needs.<eos> Jay said it could hurt Barry.
Hannah's doing the job.<eos> I won't give you Sam and Dean.<eos> Sure you will.<eos> We're gonna hack your brain.<eos> Whatever's in that house, I can taste the power radiating from it.<eos> Oh, Jenna!<eos> Oh!<eos> You scared me.<eos> That thing...<eos> It's old...
They were gonna torture him, so I stepped in.<eos> And eventually, I took off and went back to that apartment building where you found us.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Most people would have been dead within hours.<eos> All right.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> Who are these guys and what is Loksat?<eos> I don't know exactly.<eos> What I do know is the person behind this is a very powerful and a very dirty analyst inside the CIA.<eos> I've been trying to get an identity for over a year, and every time I get a lead, it just evaporates.
We are gonna use your drone to put this bomb into that breach.<eos> Okay, how does that work?<eos> One down, 99 to blow.<eos> Basic physics, Ramon.<eos> Magnetism.<eos> Magnetism.<eos> Magnets of opposite poles attract one another.<eos> Help me out, Garrick.<eos> If we can change the dimensional frequency of this bomb and get it through that breach...<eos> It'll drag all the rest of the bombs right along with it.
Is it gamey?<eos> Gamey?<eos> I mean, you know, is it fishy?<eos> It's all fish. Is there a special way to prepare it?<eos> I'd cook it up.<eos> W-Well, what's the best fish here?<eos> What's your favorite fish?<eos> I don't eat fish.<eos> Ugh, when are you gonna get rid of that toothpick?<eos> It's disgusting, and it's starting to smell.
You'll see.<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> You're always trickin' me into going places I don't want to.<eos> Oh... you said we were going to a place Walt Disney built.<eos> No, Peter.<eos> I said supported.<eos> By the way, don't go on the train ride.<eos> I've been playing a game I invented called "mini racquetball" in your garage.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> It's pretty fun.
How much do you know about neuro-economics?<eos> We're experts.<eos> Well, I'm not, so go slow.<eos> Dr. Sarkisian and Dr. Weller were mapping the loci in the brain that light up when emotional responses are triggered, when opinions change.<eos> They were using the data to perfect an algorithm.<eos> It works a little like a personalized search.<eos> The program curates the news a user reads online.<eos> Curates?<eos> The program learns what kind of stories you respond to and gives you more of what you want, as a delivery system for favorable narratives.<eos> It renders users' opinions more fluid.
I only count two bombs.<eos> Naseem said there were three bombs.<eos> We only got two bombs here.<eos> We're missing a bomb.<eos> They must've deployed it.<eos> It could be anywhere.<eos> Son of a bitch is the only one who knows where the other bomb is.<eos> You hear me?<eos> You're not dying until you tell me where that bomb is, you son of a bitch!<eos> Where is it?
Your so-called inconclusive ballistics report told you as much.<eos> What's your point?<eos> I believe you have pursued a false suspect to disguise a truth you have known from the start:<eos> that the assassin is a Nazi agent.<eos> If it were known that a Nazi fired at our Prince, that would be an act of war, a war many in the Reich would be happy to see but one our empire would almost certainly lose.<eos> I do not deny your accusation, nor will I confirm it.<eos> I don't need you to, Chief Inspector.<eos> You see, I have the name of the assassin, the real assassin.<eos> Name your price.<eos> My price cannot be paid with money, Chief Inspector, but it is very, very high.
- Great. Okay.<eos> Conrad's all about his new golden boy, and I'm stuck playing second fiddle.<eos> More like they took my fiddle and gave it to Craig Sterling.<eos> So are you telling me that the president has given you the Heisman?<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> Which is pretty galling, considering that I-I didn't even want the stupid job in the first place.<eos> No offense.<eos> It's a tough job, there's no question.<eos> But I loved it, and I suspect that you do, too.<eos> Well, admittedly, it has grown on me.
Plus, Felecia here wanted me to give her my Cheryl Tiegs makeover to kick cancer's ass.<eos> Looking good.<eos> You must be freaking out.<eos> Your boyfriend and the Slayer have the same name...<eos> Kent?<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> That is, uh, a crazy coincidence.<eos> You haven't seen the news?<eos> No, I've been on the phone with a mechanic about my car.<eos> It broke down.
We learned a lot from him.<eos> Well, Thor, I've invaded Iceland because you've decided to investigate and prosecute your bankers after your banking collapse and put a number of them in prison.<eos> And that's just a genius idea I want to take back to the United States.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're the man.<eos> Thank you for this great idea.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - God bless you.<eos> Because Iceland didn't bail out their banks and instead prosecuted the bankers and turned much of the financial decision-making over to the women, their economy has completely recovered.<eos> In fact, it's doing better than ever.
I'm more than a side character in the Thomas Carver story.<eos> We both are.<eos> And the only way we can prove that to ourselves and to them is by breaking the cycle.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> Then please do this for me.<eos> - Any luck?<eos> - Nothing yet.<eos> You are just gonna have such a good time.<eos> It's a lot easier leaving knowing that things with Natalie and Olivia are resolved.<eos> Yeah, Natalie really stepped up, realizing that all this fighting is not worth the pain it's causing.
It just sucked.<eos> Aw, this is amazing.<eos> Baby pacifiers?<eos> ! Are congratulations in order?<eos> You, uh... you flatter me.<eos> These things are so cool.<eos> They're Bluetooth-enabled pacifiers, from England.<eos> Here, let me...<eos> Hold this.<eos> The teat can measure temperature... knows its own location, and then it tracks the medications that you're giving your child... and then all that information is sent back to the parent's phone.
I know how you love those.<eos> (gasps) He's arrived!<eos> Kevin the mentor, down from gold star mountain to bestow his knowledge nuggets upon little lamb Ricky, who's lost his way.<eos> (chuckles) That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?<eos> Although, gold star mountain is kind of cute.<eos> Let's keep that.<eos> Now, first thing's first. We've got to clean up this desk, huh?<eos> Maybe tuck in that shirt.<eos> _<eos> I didn't even realize it was out.
Well, I'm sorry. It's just...<eos> That's insulting to anyone who's ever done any kind of close-up magic, so...<eos> - And that you were the most useless person who ever lived.<eos> And now...<eos> you feel better?<eos> - It's the original version, the Danish version, that it's, like... it's dark.<eos> It's, like, 100 times better because the Danish people, they're... they're, uh... they have a dark soul.<eos> I mean, I get it.<eos> - Get...?<eos> - You're a kid, and your whole life's ahead of you, and you have these notions... about what life is... and... what it could be.
I...<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> Why don't you tell us about this time machine?<eos> Well, all we wanted after high school was to go to college u together.<eos> But rigby got in, and I didn't.<eos> So we tried to build a time machine to fix it.<eos> But it exploded and destroyed the whole science lab.
- Hey, Mom.<eos> - Oh, Rachel!<eos> You're just in time.<eos> The caterer dropped off some samples.<eos> I was just about to try them, but it'll be much more fun if we do this together.<eos> Okay, Mom, but before you pout that.<eos> I don't think that the crostini travels very well.<eos> Mom, please.<eos> I know that you have given this a lot of thought, but I need to talk to you about the size of the wedding.<eos> It's way too big.
See you around, Daniel.<eos> By the way, Mike pissed in your Bonsai.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Two times.<eos> By the way, nice Usual Suspects reference back there.<eos> Really, you caught that?<eos> Yeah, I caught it.<eos> What do you think I am?<eos> Nothing, I just didn't think you'd get it.<eos> It was so subtle.
Yeah, that's right.<eos> Two times.<eos> By the way, nice Usual Suspects reference back there.<eos> Really, you caught that?<eos> Yeah, I caught it.<eos> What do you think I am?<eos> Nothing, I just didn't think you'd get it.<eos> It was so subtle.<eos> Trust me, not so subtle.<eos> Well, if it was so ham-fisted, why didn't you just chime in back there?
"They"?<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> Do you recognize me?<eos> Get off my property.<eos> Well, he didn't get that Silver Star for his charm.<eos> Can we get a warrant?<eos> No.<eos> Tattoos aren't probable cause.<eos> Couldn't I just kick the door down?<eos> I mean, it didn't look that heavy.
Me, too.<eos> It's hard, all that quiet.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> I'm not.<eos> My brother was older.<eos> He mostly worked nights.<eos> I was alone a lot.<eos> So he drew that owl above my bed, so I wouldn't be scared.<eos> That thing was supposed to make you less scared?<eos> Well, owls are nocturnal, so he said it would keep away the bad guys.
What makes you ask that?<eos> Because he's pushing me away.<eos> And that upsets you?<eos> Perhaps Agent Weller is feeling the same need for boundaries.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Patterson needs to see us right now.<eos> She's not picking up her cell.<eos> I think the hack was an S.O.S.<eos> How do you know it was her?<eos> The first half of the code was written in Python and then it switches to Perl.
But they... they... they train you guys, right?<eos> To... to patch up bullet wounds?<eos> Like, in case of emergencies or something?<eos> They tell us to get to a hospital.<eos> Yeah, well, I can't do that, so...<eos> You want me to coach you through patching a bullet wound?<eos> Why would you expect me to do that?<eos> Because I'm innocent.<eos> Where is the bullet?<eos> Is it in your leg, still?

Yeah, roger that.<eos> I'll send them as soon as I can find them.<eos> Place is kind-of a mess.<eos> Zombie issues.<eos> Copy you.<eos> Listen.<eos> There's a massive Z storm headed your way.<eos> I strongly suggest that you turn south.<eos> Possibly as far as Mexico before you can outflank this horde.<eos> It's miles wide, and it's moving fast.
Well, between Katz and Kalfis, I've had complicated mentor relationships.<eos> I'm just... I'm confused about how to behave.<eos> No kissing.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Okay, I wonder who I get today...<eos> Blondie, Brainy,<eos> Or other guy.<eos> Sekara really needs a new nickname.<eos> Well, you can't rush a good nickname.<eos> It'll come to you.
How can I help you?<eos> I need to talk to someone.<eos> I was hoping to do it under the confessional.<eos> How long has it been since your last confession?<eos> Aren't you supposed to ask me that after we started?<eos> We have started.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Here?<eos> Why not?<eos> Confession's meant to be good for the soul and no one's ever said anything about it having to be done in a little dark box.
The catch of the day.<eos> Uh, I think your contacts fell out.<eos> Uh, have you seen an old guy around here?<eos> Big ears, orange nose, a real know-it-all.<eos> Flame retardant raccoon says, don't hug forest fires.<eos> Stan, where are you?<eos> I need your advice.<eos> Grunkle Stan?<eos> Hey, buddy boy. Remember how we were talkin' about my technique?<eos> Well, sometimes it leads to unexpected consequences.
I bet this guy's a hoot at parties.<eos> (weakly):<eos> Shut up, Mike.<eos> Oh. He speaks.<eos> Uh, and it's Cyril.<eos> And, unfortunately, you're stuck with me until we fix all this.<eos> Now, I-I am not worried about your head and your knee.<eos> We've got a great ortho who's gonna replace the knee altogether.<eos> Now, the real megillah is the second bullet.<eos> It shattered on impact, leaving all these little shards in your chest, meaning we got a lot of little bleeders, some of them not so little.
If you wanted, I could watch Carter overnight.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know how sometimes people just want to help other people?<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> So, you think that if you do me this favor, that I will owe you something.<eos> Well, this is the first time I've ever seen this quality in you, Keira.<eos> I love it.<eos> I didn't know you had it in you.<eos> This award is important to you.<eos> So, it's important to me.
Yeah, I got it.<eos> We need to get out of here!<eos> I can delay the detonation by freezing the circuitry.<eos> There's no time!<eos> Supergirl.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> Plenty of time.<eos> This bomb is like a high-tech daisy cutter.<eos> If it blows, it'll produce an overpressure of 2,000 pounds per square inch.
There's no way to disarm it.<eos> - Get yourself clear.<eos> - Me?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> - Hank, no.<eos> - I gave you an order.<eos> I said...<eos> Go!<eos> This bomb is rigged with altimeter.<eos> You try to move me off the train, it goes off instantly.
No.<eos> Might be broken.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Let's get...<eos> Here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You've got to be really careful with that.<eos> Why don't you let me take you to the hospital to get your arm looked at?<eos> No, it'll heal when I get my powers back.
That's an understatement.<eos> Blood work shows there was a severe deficiency in vitamin D due to lack of sun exposure.<eos> That's hard to pull off in Hawaii.<eos> So, this guy, he hasn't been in the sun or bought clothes since Reagan was president. That sounds like someone who doesn't want to be found.<eos> How does this guy end up suddenly in the middle of nowhere with an arrow sticking out of his chest and close to a million dollars in fake money?<eos> Look, if he was off the grid for 30 years, we need to find out what he looked like back in the day.<eos> That could give us the I.D. that we're looking for.<eos> Age progression software uses sophisticated modeling to predict visual changes in a person as they get older.<eos> However, the software can be used to age-reverse a subject as well.<eos> Can it bring back my Afro?
Yes, and he threatened to kill this Laura Ioane woman and come after me if I don't hand it over.<eos> That's a pretty desperate play.<eos> My question is how did he even know about the Hopper?<eos> Well, he probably had Crane under surveillance from the moment he put this thing in motion.<eos> If that's the case, last night when you went to Crane's house he would have you leave with the painting.<eos> Well, he said he would call back with a time and place for the drop.<eos> Well, that's perfect.<eos> When he does, you keep him talking, we'll run a trace.<eos> What we have to do, though, is get the painting back.<eos> So where is it now?
You're gonna what?<eos> I'm gonna change the toner myself.<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> You're changing the toner?<eos> I'm doing what no one else here is willing to do.<eos> Do you know what you're doing?<eos> It's not rocket science.<eos> It's like changing a roll of toilet tissue.<eos> When it runs out and it's empty, you put a new one on.
Yet there's evidence that one was used here quite recently.<eos> Had a sticky wheel, left scuff marks every few feet.<eos> That's one way someone could have gotten Abby out of here.<eos> They continue into the corridor.<eos> Let's track them.<eos> Trail ends here.<eos> You familiar with this room?<eos> No, I've never been down here before.<eos> Not exactly a surgical suite, is it?<eos> Actually, I think it is.
You're not punished.<eos> It just doesn't make sense.<eos> The housekeeper emptied the trash at 6:00, after which the stick just happened to appear out of nowhere?<eos> Maybe Zac had a wrapperless ice cream bar in the freezer that he saved for a rainy day.<eos> That's not a thing.<eos> Okay. So, if we figure out how the stick got into the apartment, maybe we'll figure out how the killer got in.<eos> - Good thinking.<eos> - So, where did the stick come from?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - No, I'm actually asking where it came from?
Amanda?<eos> Move! Move!<eos> What the hell happened to her?<eos> Omec. Okay, I need a heart monitor, a saline IV, and as many bandages as you can find... now!<eos> All right, set her up for a plasma transfusion.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Lie still.<eos> - Doc, why...<eos> - Listen very carefully.<eos> You've got a hole in your abdomen, and if you keep moving, it's gonna reopen and blood is gonna gush outta you like Christmas.
Why do you ask?<eos> Well, I overheard some intelligence officers say that they were bringing Gorev's daughter to the embassy.<eos> - Olga?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They said she would stay for a month.<eos> Then I thought maybe she's some kind of leverage.<eos> But maybe this is at her request.<eos> Go back to your dorm.<eos> I know this is disappointing, but in many ways, the entertainment industry is like the federal government, right?<eos> It's large, somewhat inefficient, and it's very resistant to change.
The President would love to visit the Wind River Mountains.<eos> He's heard they're beautiful and worthy of national park status.<eos> How does, uh, next Tuesday look for a helicopter tour?<eos> I've done a bunch of research and I jotted down some ideas for your Cuba speech.<eos> - I told you...<eos> - You're writing the speech.<eos> I know, but I have an idea that I wanted to swing by you.<eos> You're adorable.<eos> - I am?<eos> - You disagree with the policy but you still want to write the speech anyway because you think it may just have become historic.
(gun chamber cocks)<eos> (tires screeching, sirens blaring)<eos> (sirens blaring)<eos> Lou, what have we got?<eos> Hostage situation.<eos> Somebody calls in a phony gas leak.<eos> They tried to evacuate the building.<eos> All of a sudden, one of the security guards says this guy wearing a gas company uniform trying to steal a painting.<eos> Must be a very valuable painting.<eos> Well, it belonged to King Kalakaua, so it's priceless.
JERRY: Well, I did it again.<eos> DANNY: What'd you do?<eos> I think I blew this case wide open.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Well, are you gonna tell us what you did or are you gonna break your arm, patting yourself on the back?<eos> Your stolen painting is a treasure map.<eos> I'm almost sure of it.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Here's the painting as it looked when it hung in the palace, shortly before it disappeared.<eos> And here is how it looked when it was recovered 40 years ago.
They're not thieves.<eos> They steal boats and chase treasure.<eos> They're pirates.<eos> And pirates pillage as they go.<eos> It's what they do.<eos> "Take it all.<eos> Leave nothing behind."<eos> That's their mantra.<eos> This painting belonged to King Kalakaua himself.<eos> It's priceless.
Fisher had a Thoughtful Dissent sticker on the back right side of his car, and a couple of days ago, somebody put an identical sticker over the one that was already there.<eos> Now, I think that is where the chip is.<eos> Brian, I know.<eos> We found it under the bumper sticker about an hour ago.<eos> Stephen Fisher's death was a homicide.<eos> That's... Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> You're really good.<eos> Um, what about the bomb, though?<eos> It would have to be small enough that it broke apart in the crash, and it'd also have to fit onto the fuel check valve of a Jeep.
Mike and Ike tackle you?<eos> Do you go to Guantanamo?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But it'd be a lot easier if I didn't have to find out.<eos> Well, picture the layout.<eos> Remember when you walked in?<eos> You walked through the whole place.<eos> You know exactly where everything is.<eos> That room where they're giving the flu shots.<eos> It's right next door.
I don't know.<eos> But it'd be a lot easier if I didn't have to find out.<eos> Well, picture the layout.<eos> Remember when you walked in?<eos> You walked through the whole place.<eos> You know exactly where everything is.<eos> That room where they're giving the flu shots.<eos> It's right next door.<eos> If I can get in there, I'll have access to the hallway that leads out of here.<eos> That wall... it cuts the ceiling tiles off right in the middle.
I took this job because they promised that if I do it for a year, I'll get a permanent placement in the CJC as an investigator.<eos> They gave me two rules... one pill a day and don't let you get hurt.<eos> No way I'm breaking rule one.<eos> What about rule number two?<eos> One pill a day.<eos> I'm not saying I'm an FBI agent, per se. I mean, it's complicated.<eos> But basically, uh, they noticed that I have aptitudes... command of certain facts, if you will, and decided to make me a consultant.<eos> Okay. Uh... command of certain facts?<eos> Yeah. Like, uh... for example, um... synthetic marijuana.<eos> Seemingly innocuous but, actually, it's very addictive.
I mean, it doesn't have to be that way.<eos> You definitely have to lie to someone, but you can choose who that is.<eos> I'm not sure why you'd pick the one person who's looking out for you.<eos> He was right. Or I was right.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Sands doesn't know what's in the FBI files on NZT.<eos> So, how would he know if he's getting real files?<eos> I didn't take NZT until 10:30 that morning, so I had some time to work with.<eos> I made up a fake history of NZT in the FBI, based on speculation and guesswork.<eos> Was it convincing?
We can only stay for an hour. I'm meeting my sister super early.<eos> Ok, fine.<eos> Stop stressing.<eos> Show off your assets, please.<eos> This is the first time I've seen you dressing for fun. Ok!<eos> That's enough.<eos> Get ready to have your mind blown, because this party is going to be epic.<eos> This guy was in class today asking why his Python encode wouldn't work. I'm like--<eos> Girls are here.<eos> So it wasn't epic.

Let's not.<eos> We tied him to the murder of 3 of the victims, including Kathy Miller.<eos> Look, we need to talk.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry that I went off to meet him.<eos> You're right. It was --<eos> I'm stupid and reckless.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> What you survived in college is trauma.<eos> It doesn't just go away because we do good for somebody else.
- Scott! - Huh? Huh?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry.<eos> We have the semifinals coming up against the Glendorables.<eos> They're the a-cappella group from Glendora.<eos> - They're the best in the state.<eos> - Okay, I'm looking for that white tablecloth that we have, the one with the roses on it.<eos> - Yeah, I saw it.<eos> - Great!<eos> - Where is it?
She wants to race.<eos> Go insane mode.<eos> Win the race and her heart.<eos> Jimmy, this is a residential street.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> She's pushing you outside of your comfort zone.<eos> This is exactly what you need.<eos> I like my comfort zone.<eos> It's very comfortable.
I just wrote this song about you and your secret crush.<eos> My secret crush?<eos> Yeah, Tessie.<eos> ♪ You'll never need a key to spark her ignition ♪<eos> ♪ She got you beggin' please ♪<eos> ♪ And revving' her engine ♪<eos> ♪ Ain't no shame in this ego decision ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause this love's got zero emission ♪<eos> - Eh, get it?<eos> - 'Cause it's... ♪ 'Cause it's electric ♪
Yeah, well, you know.<eos> Old Nate... he would have put down a protective sheet.<eos> But new Nate...<eos> Oh, he went with it.<eos> Thrice.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, new Sam is writing a song about her feelings for Atticus.<eos> So...<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> It's not ready yet, but, um... ♪ Atticus, oh, Atticus ♪
Well, I host four or five of them each weekend.<eos> I'm happy to help. But I doubt I'll be able to remember one looky-loo.<eos> Liv, anything you want to ask?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your bag. ls it a Stella?<eos> - Timeless, isn't it?<eos> - I can't even...<eos> I wasn't sure if it would be appropriate for a police interview.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> It's businesslike, but with an informality that says, "l am not a suspect."
Whatever it takes to find Raymond.<eos> If I'm dead, they're safe.<eos> I found a link.<eos> The revenge fantasies arranged by The Djinn occurred around the world, but two of them drove down the earnings of one company.<eos> How?<eos> Well, it seems cannibalism isn't good for business.<eos> The victim's body was found in a dumpster outside the hotel wrapped in hotel towels.<eos> Now no one wants to sleep there.<eos> Just like no one wants to fly a certain airline in South America.<eos> It went bankrupt after a hijacking planned by The Djinn.
Three weeks ago, you bid on it at an auction, and you lost.<eos> This morning, it was stolen, and a man was found shot to death.<eos> Mr. Carter just got back from Singapore this afternoon.<eos> No, we don't think you killed him.<eos> But you are in contact with the man who did.<eos> Liam Hollister, the transporter.<eos> According to the Falcon Unit, you've engaged his services numerous times.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He called, looking to unload the painting.<eos> I only bid on it 'cause Lorenzo thought it would look great hanging in my G5.
Have you heard the good news?<eos> - Jesus saves.<eos> - That is good news.<eos> Do you know where he shops?<eos> What happened to "ask and ye shall receive"?<eos> That part of my life is over.<eos> Maybe we've hit you in the dome one too many times, Gabe.<eos> I told you.<eos> Your formula is special.<eos> It'll cure people.

I was given a choice...<eos> And comparing this to broken windows-- what the hell is that?<eos> !<eos> We have mountains of data suggesting there is a direct correlation between targeting lower level crimes to prevent bigger ones from ever happening!<eos> It wasn't my analogy.<eos> And there's not one iota of evidence suggesting collaring cops to squash a summons has any effect eradicating corruption at higher levels!<eos> I didn't say it.<eos> Well, you danced around it.<eos> Well, what the hell was I supposed to do?<eos> Like you've never coughed up some jive on account the mayor liked the way it sounded?
Um, but it was very nice meeting you, Jason.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Call us old-fashioned, but we don't like it when people - take hammers to our artwork.<eos> - Given the subject matter... a naked photo of my client at eight years old...<eos> I think you can understand why Erik did it.<eos> And I'm sure you can understand the bad publicity that would result from a prosecution.<eos> All we're asking, Mr. O'Neal, is that you drop the charges, and we won't take this any...<eos> If you don't mind, uh, we'd like our law firm to sit in on this.<eos> So sorry that I'm late, but I made the mistake of passing through the Wyeth exhibit.<eos> And, oh, my gosh, it's beautiful.
How are we supposed to do that?<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> You handle a lightsaber well, apprentice.<eos> Well, I've got some time, if you wanted a lesson.<eos> You have great potential, but perhaps it is I that might teach you, as your master never achieved the rank of Jedi Knight.<eos> Did he?<eos> Maybe not, but he took out the last Inquisitor.<eos> So I think I'll just stick with him.<eos> Yes, the death of the Grand Inquisitor was a surprise to all.<eos> Yet, it does present the rest of us with new opportunities.
Hey, Uncle Ford, are you okay?<eos> Oh, yes, I'm fine.<eos> I just said that to make sure you'd come in here quickly.<eos> But your face is on fire.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's much faster than shaving.<eos> Now listen, Dipper.<eos> I have a very important mission, and you are the only one who can help me.<eos> Remember the rift in dimensional space-time I showed you?<eos> It's cracking.

If you can avoid growing up, do it.<eos> I'd give anything to be 12 again.<eos> Anyway, what are you guys doing here?<eos> Just looking for a place to have my 13th birthday party.<eos> Wendy Borduroy?<eos> I mean Corduroy.<eos> See what I mean?<eos> Master Mabel to Dippity Dog.<eos> We can have our party at the gym, but we gotta talk about high school.<eos> I'm starting to think it might not be the awesome future we were expecting.
Oh, yeah?<eos> You think you can scare me?<eos> Do your worst!<eos> Nothing in this universe is gonna take away my uncle.<eos> So go ahead, give me what you got.<eos> I thought I was a goner, kid.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> what happened?<eos> The orb didn't detect any chemical signs of fear.<eos> It assumed the threat was neutralized and then self-disassembled.
- There was a lot of pressure. - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> We're all overworked.<eos> You, Detective.<eos> You, Counselor.<eos> It's not a crime.<eos> It's a reality.<eos> Why don't you let your client answer the question?<eos> Actually, I'll answer for him.<eos> Shame on you... using this tragedy to score political points.<eos> If your idea of a deal is to pit co-worker against co-worker, well, it's a non-starter.
I've got to go.<eos> Bishop Mick's gonna say a few words about Dobbs at the morning service -<eos> Forget about Bishop Mick, forget Dobbs, you need...<eos> Hell!<eos> How did you get that?<eos> Have you had that seen to?<eos> It could be infected.<eos> Look, Huw, I can look after myself, OK?<eos> If anything, it was the fact that you were there, with all your doubts and misgivings undermining me.<eos> Now, listen, I prayed with you last night, Lass, and that hand - it was red hot, I could feel it.
I wouldn't be if it wasn't what I wanted.<eos> Years ago, you had a shot at your own team.<eos> You turned it down.<eos> Yeah, that was my decision.<eos> Do you want to be a leader or not?<eos> You mean, do I want to be you?<eos> Day I joined NIS, all I had was a reason.<eos> Things change.<eos> The reason stays the same.<eos> It's always with me.
That's when music becomes something. Very good, very good answer.<eos> I have a question.<eos> Yes?<eos> What does music mean to you?<eos> It's... it's my life.<eos> It's what I...<eos> It's what I think about all the time.<eos> I wake up with it. I go to sleep with it.<eos> It's actually the way that I communicate with the world and with myself.<eos> So it means everything, really.
It's a side effect from one of the early vaccines given to everyone on Zona.<eos> But not you?<eos> I've never been.<eos> I've only seen the inside of this sub since we evacuated Mt. Wilson.<eos> How do you even know Zona's real then?<eos> I worked for some of the people who first founded Zona before the outbreak.<eos> They're the only ones left with enough power and resources to stop this plague.<eos> We almost had it.<eos> But the vaccine only slows down the virus.<eos> It doesn't kill it or make you immune.
(phone ringing)<eos> Anybody else coming in today?<eos> It's still early, boss.<eos> Yeah, Abbs.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Be right down.<eos> McGee, when DiNozzo gets in, you two go to Quantico.<eos> You talk to Master Sergeant Dillon.<eos> This little baby is really cool.<eos> It's GPS-enabled, and it keeps track of your distance jogged and your pace and time.

So I pulled her Maryland driver's license that she surrendered, and this is her new Virginia driver's license.<eos> Same woman, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> And probably what the DMV clerk thought, also.<eos> Same hairstyle, same hair color, the exact same glasses.<eos> But look what happens when we superimpose the photos on top of each other-- everything's a little off.<eos> The jawline, the shape of the nose...<eos> Check out the beauty mark.<eos> It moved 15 millimeters, Gibbs.
I can't speak Russian.<eos> I'm not on NZT, okay?<eos> I tried to save you.<eos> I tried to keep you alive.<eos> Give me the pill. You speak English?<eos> Everyone speak some English.<eos> Give me the pill.<eos> I can't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This pill, it gives you answers, da?

And the fourth DA?<eos> Escapes me.<eos> I see.<eos> You're attempting to bribe an assistant district attorney.<eos> Add that to the illegal ex parte communication, I might have enough to bring you back in here to see the place during work hours.<eos> You are not lacking for pluck, huh?<eos> And I admire the work ethic.<eos> The late hours.<eos> And this wall thing?<eos> But it is a little out of date.
You won't believe me.<eos> Okay. Well, uh, enjoy your Lizzie fest.<eos> Oh, hey, uh, no touching.<eos> I-I never touched you.<eos> I don't know what that girl did to me, but I haven't been right since.<eos> I can't eat or sleep.<eos> I-I don't dream.<eos> And all the things I used to love -- my Lizzie blog, the ghost conventions -- they leave me cold.<eos> I-I put this whole collection on eBay last night.<eos> Now it belongs to some machinist in Ohio.
The Darkness -- what do you know?<eos> Okay.<eos> So I misjudged.<eos> You're not scared.<eos> You're mad.<eos> And I get it.<eos> I mean, it must suck being everyone's tool, manipulated and used by the angels, by your enemies, by your friends.<eos> Aah!<eos> ♪<eos> You thought if you could get your Grace back, it would help fix you, but it hasn't!
- Let us through, please.<eos> - Jade, are you all right? !<eos> I caught her head.<eos> She didn't hurt her head.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my. I'm so stupid.<eos> I'm so stupid.<eos> She might've aggravated her spine fracture.<eos> That's too small.<eos> It won't support her.
Pack!<eos> More!<eos> - Pressure's down to 85.<eos> - Try 5% Albumin.<eos> - Pressure's down to 75.<eos> - More suction.<eos> I still can't see a thing.<eos> Oh, hey, Bailey.<eos> So, your adenoma resection had a rebleed.<eos> It's stable now.
Olivia is the only reason that you're alive.<eos> She's also the reason I'm shackled to this chair.<eos> Family is a burden.<eos> We're brothers.<eos> After all we've been through, all we've seen...<eos> - We won't let... - [Gunshot]<eos> Rowan: A pressure point, soft tissue, an illness, an antidote to greatness.<eos> You think you're better off with people who rely on you, depend on you, but you're wrong, because you will inevitably end up needing them, which makes you weak, pliable.<eos> Family doesn't complete you.<eos> It destroys you.
We should double back and wait for them.<eos> You're right.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> You twist your lips when you're writing.<eos> I twist my lips when I'm frustrated.<eos> Is this a code or is this a cipher?<eos> My code-breaking software is so much faster than we are.<eos> I should get this back to the lab.<eos> Hey, come on, your software can't stand in that arch and compare the bricks.<eos> And it can't pull this book off the top shelf and flip to the right page.
I think it's time we open that Blanton's your uncle gave you.<eos> I...<eos> I can't do this.<eos> You...<eos> I know you're different.<eos> Um, but I'm still the same.<eos> And I'm the reason that they move out.<eos> And this job...<eos> I love this job.<eos> But it takes all of me.
Is that the same thing as legal?<eos> This woman is the key to finding out the kind of danger your friend is in. And you want to what? Just let her go?<eos> (PIANO PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND) Mmm.<eos> Oh, the best.<eos> You really should try these. Best in the city. I don't enjoy bi-valves.<eos> Silt and filth. Not for me.<eos> So, tell me, why are we here?<eos> Not for the pleasure of each other's company, I'm assuming.<eos> I have a situation.<eos> It's going to result in a forfeit.
We found it empty. All the items had already been removed.<eos> Mr. Mogg, I'm going to need the details of every meeting Minister Fergus has had since he began at that ministry.<eos> Every person he met with, what was discussed.<eos> - What's going on here, Murdoch?<eos> - Liquid hydrogen isn't an explosive.<eos> It's a propellant.<eos> Project D isn't a projectile, it's a rocket.<eos> - The difference being?<eos> - A projectile, um... A bullet, or a cannonball... expends its energy before leaving the barrel.<eos> A rocket takes its energy along with it, accelerating even after it leaves the barrel.
Todd!<eos> - Oh, you're the bacon man!<eos> - No, you're the bacon man.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I told you not to do this.<eos> Now they know about the bacon.<eos> What if they find out about the rest?<eos> It's all taken care of.<eos> All the evidence is gone.<eos> If you've got a bacon-sniffing dog out there, it wouldn't even notice.

Samuel Letts is dead.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're encased in marble and concrete.<eos> I can't see you.<eos> You need to get out of that mausoleum.<eos> Use thermal imaging.<eos> There's a funeral procession entering.<eos> I've got moving heat signatures everywhere.<eos> Radio frequencies in the area?<eos> If I make it to my car, I don't want it to blow up in my face.
So does the girl... same tumor.<eos> Both invading the kidneys, both causing early heart failure.<eos> What happened is they have to go tell a mother and a father that both of their newborn babies are dying.<eos> Both of them?<eos> They're just babies.<eos> This has to be some kind of mistake.<eos> They can't have cancer.<eos> You can't be born with cancer.<eos> Hepatoblastoma is a common liver cancer in kids.<eos> It's also very aggressive.
- No, I got it.<eos> - No, I got it.<eos> - No, really, I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> I'm not sure about that bag on you.<eos> Well, perhaps with a different shoe?<eos> Nah.<eos> - You jealous?<eos> - Jealous?<eos> Of how bad it looks on you?
Come on...<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Blanket, blanket.<eos> Oxygen.<eos> Okay... okay.<eos> There you go.<eos> All right.<eos> - I'll take him to the NICU. - I'll take him.<eos> She hasn't delivered the placenta yet.<eos> It has to come out.
Well, maybe he did that because he saw something.<eos> Like what?<eos> Something that made him think that someone else was piggybacking on the burglary to pull a heist of their own.<eos> Who else knew about your plan?<eos> No one.<eos> At least not from me.<eos> But maybe from Victor.<eos> Hey, wait a minute.<eos> When we accessed the building's service elevators in the basement, Victor wedged the door open.<eos> But when we left, it was closed.
Okay?<eos> Yes, I made a mistake.<eos> But I need you now.<eos> Hm. This could be bad.<eos> Brody, I am your brother, okay?<eos> I need your help on this one.<eos> (sighs) I can't help you, Jordan.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> RYAN: I really appreciate your help.<eos> It means a lot to me and Isabel's family.
It's rather ingenious.<eos> And it would also explain why Mr. Sutton was the only one affected.<eos> We have yet to isolate the poison itself, but my official report will state that Byron Sutton was the unfortunate victim of homicide.<eos> So, the question becomes:<eos> Who wanted Mr. Sutton dead?<eos> Murdered?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We now know that the pipe that Mr. Sutton smoked had been poisoned.<eos> His pipe?<eos> Now, it was brand new!
It was Lawrence!<eos> It was his fault, it's not mine.<eos> Not mine.<eos> Despite the darker side of opium, I enjoyed our little experiment. Yes.<eos> Not one that I would care to repeat.<eos> No?<eos> Not even the sensation it invoked?<eos> I prefer not to alter my reality.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> - Because... nothing could make my reality any better than it already is.
Isn't it great having a Whole Foods?<eos> This is where I come for lunch every day.<eos> Got to eat healthy to stay fit.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> It's that guy.<eos> And how are you today, sir?<eos> Great.<eos> Uh, listen, before you ring me up, I just want to let you know I'm not gonna be giving extra money to charity, so can we... can we just skip that part?<eos> Oh, no problem, sir.<eos> They've updated the system so it's a lot more streamlined now.
That's just your culturally insensitive taste buds talking.<eos> Okay, I can only stay for a second.<eos> I'm making pies for people that I hate.<eos> Which is mixed emotions for me, because I like pie.<eos> Okay.<eos> As discussed, here it is.<eos> This brooch contains a small video camera and microphone.<eos> It's exactly like the teddy bear nanny cam that we used in the Gatwick divorce, but with audio.<eos> No...<eos> So it will transmit everything you see and hear directly to an app on my phone, so I will not miss any of your triumph.
You think that's the first Netflix quit I've seen?<eos> Had a busboy do the entire Peter Finch speech from Network.<eos> Shouted out of a window and everything.<eos> Oh, it was Javier.<eos> Welcome back, Greg.<eos> "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"<eos> Oh, it was great.<eos> You should have been there.<eos> Ah, they all come back.<eos> Greg, you want your job back, it's yours.
How do you keep finding new ways to say things that men never say?<eos> I can't believe you thought Justin and I were already sleeping together.<eos> We've only been dating two weeks.<eos> We're ladies.<eos> Right, Les?<eos> - How long did you and Mike wait?<eos> - Let's see, I met him here in the bar, then I walked him to his car.<eos> How long was that?<eos> Okay.<eos> Definitely something wrong with the security feed, because now it's just showing a random crowd
Kill this man...<eos> Tomas Edribali.<eos> Edribali was found dead in Pakistan less than four hours ago.<eos> I needed to talk to him.<eos> Do you want to find your wife?<eos> I would do anything.<eos> Then let me help you.<eos> An S.D. card?<eos> I need all the information off of it.<eos> It was Ginny's.
But if he was only here for a quarter of an hour, I didn't think he'd charge.<eos> And you think a veterinary surgeon works for eggs?<eos> Stardust had a chill.<eos> I can get father to pay.<eos> No, no, no, you're right.<eos> I'll pay it.<eos> Well, now that you're fixing up the shed..<eos> Yeah !<eos> The telegram has been sent.<eos> It should get to Paris, within 24 hours.
I... is this gonna work?<eos> To be fair, you really need 12 sessions to start to see the full effects of it, so...<eos> No, but I don't have 12 sessions.<eos> I can't. I can't, because this is something that somebody put in me, you know?<eos> And it... you don't believe me when I tell you...<eos> No, no, I do believe you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Your whole aura is just very, well...<eos> I mean, it looks like shit.
- Heh-heh-heh...<eos> - Maestri! Actually, I must say I did some of my best work here in the New World.<eos> Thomas Pembridge, the man who fucked my first wife.<eos> And the second, but who's counting?<eos> - [speaks foreign language]<eos> Rumor has it, Maestro Pembridge, you think you are a composer now.<eos> That's right.<eos> I am a composer.<eos> And actually, I've just finished a masterwork, thank you.<eos> People say it's fucking brilliant, yeah.
It's just so weird.<eos> If they've been gay this whole time, Have they been checking me out?<eos> I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener.<eos> Should I kick his ass?<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> What's wrong with two guys liking each other?<eos> I just don't understand it, Cupid Me.<eos> Wanting to, like, kiss a dude?<eos> But if love is love,<eos> Then it takes form in all shapes and sizes.
I'm right here.<eos> Who's this?<eos> That's Clyde.<eos> And I am Token.<eos> Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.<eos> Oh, Jesus. ISIS.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> This chicken tastes like shit.<eos> What'd you do to it? Okay...<eos> Okay, Dad, it's not organic chicken.
Oh, listen, a friend of mine offered us his boat.<eos> I figured we'd go pick up some supplies, go fishing, motor up the coast. Guatemala's two hours that way.<eos> Sure you don't want us to stay here and dig another hole for you?<eos> See you downstairs in half an hour.<eos> Bring your bathing suits.<eos> What's up with the box?<eos> Oh, that's paperwork.<eos> Has to do with the sale of the company.<eos> Hey, the guys told me what you said last night, about leaving us the villa.<eos> - Yeah, it's yours, man.
- the day after tomorrow?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I come back then.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Why would Milo know anything<eos> - about a stolen boat?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe he doesn't.<eos> Whoever took it must be crazy.<eos> It belongs to a man named Jesús.
We really have led full lives.<eos> Someone will show.<eos> Maybe you don't want someone exactly like you.<eos> You know what they say: opposites attract.<eos> Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh?<eos> Not to cast aspersions, but I can't shake a stick around here without hitting that.<eos> You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.<eos> I have a DVD of that lecture.<eos> Really?<eos> Wasn't it great?
Matt? - Hey.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Gabi, I'm not seeing an IUP.<eos> Damn.<eos> It's abdominal.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - The fetus is implanted outside of her uterus, somewhere in her abdomen.<eos> - Somewhere?<eos> - I won't know where until I go in.<eos> The placenta leeches off the blood supply of whatever it attaches to and when it tears, so does that site.
Her pressure just bottomed out.<eos> Start pounding those fluids, and call for blood.<eos> She's rebleeding.<eos> Call the OR.<eos> - Bag her.<eos> Let's intubate.<eos> - Right away.<eos> She's crashing.<eos> A piece of the placenta was hidden behind the bowel.<eos> When it broke loose, Gabi started bleeding again.
Talking.<eos> I don't think we can ignore the fact that the Rhodes...<eos> Barry, listen.<eos> I can understand the need to cultivate donors.<eos> Mr. Rhodes can make a $200 million gift, but I still will not let him dictate who performs surgery in this hospital, and I think going to war for that conniving S.O.B. is not a good idea.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Wait till you get the headset on.<eos> It's like I'm moving around inside of his body.<eos> Okay, so tell me how this thing works.<eos> It combines images from the CT angiogram and creates a three-dimensional model of the patient's anatomy.
You stay off the roads. (chuckles)<eos> Come on, Gayle.<eos> Gayle?<eos> It's me, Bob.<eos> Your five locks were unlocked, so I'm-I'm coming in.<eos> And if there's a murderer in here, uh, don't murder me.<eos> GAYLE:<eos> Bob? Is that you?<eos> Yep.<eos> Uh, car's out front and it's really coming down, so we-we need...
And he told me that the most powerful men are the ones that no one knows exist.<eos> Is something funny?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> None of that was true.<eos> Your grandfather was Ira Goldstein, owner of a schmatta business in Queens.<eos> He died a pauper after his brother-in-law cheated him out of a uniform consignment with the NYPD.<eos> And that quote?<eos> You changed it.<eos> It's from The Usual Suspects.
I don't feel bad for you, you friggin' sad, sad man.<eos> Who needs someone right now.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Jerk.<eos> Okay, so, this is for you, Erica.<eos> Thanks, Carol.<eos> I originally made it for Yorbalinda, but since your baby's coming first, I want you to have it.<eos> Is this how big a newborn's head is?<eos> Well, a baby's head's not flat like that.<eos> It's big like a bowling ball that's been waterlogged after baking in the sun.
He has boxes of records.<eos> Why would he do that if he killed his wife?<eos> Okay, he doesn't sound guilty, but how are you gonna prove he's innocent?<eos> Lawrence has thought about the events of that night over and over in his mind a thousand times, but it happened nine years ago.<eos> What if we can help him remember something more?<eos> You want to give NZT... to one of the FBI's ten most wanted.<eos> We can handcuff him to a chair if it makes you feel better, but this is the only way he's going to uncover something new.<eos> Mr. Drake, I need you to understand something.<eos> I'm a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and I am bound by oaths.<eos> If we give you this pill, it may help you remember something useful, and if it doesn't, I'll take you into custody.

Some lady called it in.<eos> Is Forensics still on the way?<eos> Show me.<eos> ♪ You got a pile of broken wishbones ♪ Hey.<eos> We're almost to your place.<eos> Who was that guy?<eos> The one that helped us?<eos> He's someone I work with.<eos> Someone very good at his job.<eos> And your job is... it's really dangerous, right?
I hate guys like that.<eos> Just 'cause he has a hot girlfriend, he thinks everyone wants to bone him.<eos> Mr. Jaffee, we've almost got the all-clear.<eos> We just need to take you upstairs for a pre-op chest X-ray and an EKG, and then we're good to go.<eos> So, you're gonna need to lose the hat.<eos> He, uh, won't take it off.<eos> I tried.<eos> Look, my late wife gave me this hat.<eos> You know, I caught 22 prize-winning bluegills in it!<eos> It goes everywhere I go.
It's almost cute.<eos> Just plopped there.<eos> "Hello."<eos> He's waited 18 months for this kidney.<eos> We finally have one, and now he has cancer?<eos> - What if he didn't?<eos> - Didn't what?<eos> Have cancer.<eos> His tumor has gorgeous margins.<eos> It's like a ripe, juicy piece of fruit that's hung low on the branch.
Geez, Rogelio, if you hated my theme song that much, you could just tell me... you don't have to leave the state.<eos> What?<eos> ! No, no.<eos> Xiomara... your theme song was like a thousand tiny angels tickling my eardrums.<eos> Really?<eos> You loved it?<eos> - Why didn't you say anything?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I've been the tiniest bit focused on myself lately.<eos> But know that I sent your song to Telemasivo, because I think it would be perfect for Hombres Locos.
Congratulations.<eos> The baby is safe. Mazel tov.<eos> My god.<eos> A girl.<eos> I'm having a baby girl.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, tonight, I can't do another bad cup of coffee, so I was thinking instead, we could go to this little bar.<eos> - It's just down the street.<eos> - Okay, Kris.<eos> This thing we have, right, it's pretty powerful.
Hello?<eos> !<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> I'm sorry, Pamela.<eos> Paula.<eos> Oh, well... I apologized to Pamela, so I guess I'm not sorry.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Pam-spray, did you rewrite my brief for the Caswick case?<eos> Yeah, three days ago.<eos> It's on your desk.
Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob but he's not real, so I can't do that, can I?<eos> But you can pal around with a hagfish?<eos> Hey, let's not pull at that thread.<eos> Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other.<eos> Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which is the problem I'm having with my current friends.<eos> Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.<eos> Isn't that gross?<eos> I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.<eos> I know.<eos> It makes its own gravy-- it'll slide right down.
- Who's Mitchell?<eos> I'm Magic Mitch.<eos> Welder by day stripper by choice.<eos> My unwed sister is seven months pregnant.<eos> My mother has some uterine issues not covered by medicare.<eos> But if you want to make it rain, I will<eos> - Mitchell! Sweetie, are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> How's the lamp?<eos> Is it okay?

Yes, Doctor.<eos> But from my vantage point I can see paramedics.<eos> The police say the shooter's in custody.<eos> They're bringing him here now.<eos> Multiple gunshot wounds.<eos> A civilian shot him.<eos> A high school algebra teacher.<eos> He's on his way here too, and the press is gathering outside.<eos> "The media is the most powerful entity on Earth.<eos> "It can make the innocent guilty, and the guilty innocent."
Oh, balls.<eos> Look... Nausea, no nausea.<eos> I now have a much clearer picture of what's going on.<eos> I needed to get around mother and see that girl eat.<eos> I could report you.<eos> I should report you.<eos> Dr. Manning, have you ever heard of "bias confirmation"?<eos> - What?<eos> - Bias confirmation.<eos> Interpreting information so that it conforms to one's preconceptions.
♪ I love cars ♪<eos> Put them down!<eos> You, you tell me what's going on with Shelly or I'm going to rip out your chest hair for real.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Easy, easy...<eos> Let it go!<eos> Are you guys okay?<eos> All right, look. I'll tell you what's going on, all right?<eos> Shelly's mom lost her job so he's got to cover her rent, okay?<eos> So he can't have his place anymore because it's too expensive, so he moved in with his mom and he's all bummed about living with his mom and he asked to stay here, and I told him look, it's, it's, it's... okay.
- Yep.<eos> That's about right. 61 to main.<eos> I need manpower assist.<eos> I think I pulled a muscle on that last call.<eos> That's definitely going in my tell-all memoir.<eos> I'm calling dibs.<eos> All yours.<eos> I do not get how someone could skip out on their husband for that.<eos> It's pretty cute how outraged you are.<eos> Just because I can't make romance work doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Then there's Lieutenant Casey, and he's calm, and in control, and that makes me feel calm.<eos> Why are you still talking?<eos> You asked me about being in my first fi...<eos> So you don't want to know about the fire.<eos> No.<eos> Not even a little bit.<eos> Who, hey, Herrmann, Herrmann.<eos> Turn it up.<eos> A firehouse is called a house for a reason.<eos> It's a part of the community it serves, and that's what today is all about.
This is me, I was traveling at 35 miles per hour down Bosworth Avenue, when I saw the light at Le Moyne changing, so I pulled to a stop.<eos> And did you see something in your rearview mirror?<eos> I did.<eos> A car coming up behind me.<eos> And how fast was it traveling?

But he didn't slow down?<eos> He didn't stop?<eos> - That's right. - Would you like to say<eos> - something, Mr. Ephraham? - I'm not being deposed.<eos> It wasn't my fault, and you know it... it was your car's fault.<eos> Why don't we take a moment, please?<eos> Tim, I thought we agreed.<eos> We're going in there with a united front.<eos> Yeah, somehow a united front means I get screwed.<eos> It was in driverless mode.
Okay. Let's move on to the financial...<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You heading out?<eos> Prior accidents of a self-driving car.<eos> Ah. What?<eos> New case. Four hours, capped.<eos> Um... can you do me a favor?<eos> That depends.<eos> Could you find out about a company called KLT and what connection it has with the head of the Democratic Committee, Frank Landau?
Is it legal for this car to drive itself in the state of Illinois?<eos> No.<eos> But it is in Michigan.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Why is it illegal in Illinois?<eos> Well, some states want more data.<eos> Unfortunately, data like this nuisance suit - won't help.<eos> - Well, it's unfortunate that my client got in the way of your car's progress.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Ms. Searle's injury is unfortunate, but it has nothing whatever to do with my car.
But you yourself admit the software will learn.<eos> So there must be something to be learned.<eos> There's always something to be learned.<eos> Because every situation on the road is unique?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Actually, Mr. Ephraham, don't you mean that there might be slight variations in a road encounter, - and that's all?<eos> - Yes, that's right.<eos> Thanks, Cary, for that correction.<eos> And why is it important for the software to learn?<eos> So it knows how to deal with all possible street encounters.
Thanks.<eos> I, um, wanted to see if you could sign this for me.<eos> It's just a standard release for liability reasons.<eos> Mm, in case I beat someone up?<eos> No, just in case anything.<eos> You know, you... trip on my stairs.<eos> Or... cut yourself.<eos> On an ice tray.<eos> I hate doing it.<eos> But, um, the insurance is expensive and it cuts down on cost.
Good thing your place is so quiet.<eos> Not a lot of luck in finding T-Port accidents.<eos> The car is pretty damn safe.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> And yet?<eos> Two things.<eos> A month before the accident they added a fuzzy driving feature to the software.<eos> - A what?<eos> - Fuzzy driving... they found that the car obeyed traffic laws a little too well.<eos> It would stop at a four-way stop and let all the other cars keep going through, because it was supposed to wait for them to come to a complete stop.

I'm bringing this up for another vote this week.<eos> Then I'm gonna ask Landau to stand down and nominate you to take the chair.<eos> You... What?<eos> There are enough votes to put a woman in charge.<eos> Everybody's been feeling the pressure - from their home districts...<eos> - Mr. Hallman, I just... but I need you to vote against KLT.<eos> - Then I can make you chair.<eos> - But I don't want to be chair.<eos> Mrs. Florrick... corruption doesn't start out there.<eos> It doesn't start in D.C. or Springfield.

Obviously somebody deliberately erased the data - after the fact.<eos> - No.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Anthony Edward Dudewitz.<eos> And what this... engineer is suggesting - is complete balderdash.<eos> - If you don't mind, Mr. Dudewitz...<eos> I do mind.<eos> I do mind mediocrity.<eos> It has a taint, like burned toast, and you stink of it.
Yup, that's where I was headed.<eos> Caroline, you broke up with me.<eos> She broke up with you?<eos> I hadn't heard that.<eos> See?<eos> All bitter... better.<eos> Max, do you want to try it on?<eos> Ahem, she doesn't need a hat.<eos> Romes said I could have the sweet hat!<eos> Oh, it looks adorable on her.
You should have it.<eos> What is this, a hat tasting now?<eos> Well, it's not a cupcake tasting anymore 'cause you ate them all.<eos> You guys are hilarious.<eos> I don't need to taste those.<eos> You and Max are a part of Andy's past, and I would honored if you'd do our cake and come to the wedding as our guests.<eos> Oh, that is a great idea.<eos> Hey, there will be a lot of self-destructive man-children there.<eos> Max, feels like your kind of party.<eos> And it's on this awesome yacht.
See?<eos> He is so not perfect.<eos> You so would not have had it all.<eos> - Caroline.<eos> - Andy?<eos> I'm kind of in a hurry but I think you should know something.<eos> I lost my business.<eos> I didn't want to tell you because I was too proud.<eos> I wanted you to think my life was perfect, and it's not.<eos> I mean, it's great, but it's not perfect.
Any other witnesses?<eos> No, there weren't any.<eos> Sebastian might have something.<eos> Graphology for the win.<eos> You lost me already, kid.<eos> Oh, uh, handwriting analysis.<eos> Clues into someone's psyche.<eos> Like, Dwayne, the reason that your O's are so broad is 'cause you're...<eos> I know what graphology is.<eos> What does it have to do with our case?
I said that once to her and she corrected me.<eos> She said she was an escape artist.<eos> You know, like a performer?<eos> Like Houdini.<eos> Exactly.<eos> She did shows at this club called the Magic Palace.<eos> She went by another name?<eos> Yep, Klarissa Bilbao.<eos> Will you stay in the left lane, Bones?<eos> It always moves faster.
You've got me on the torture, but not the killing.<eos> That's because I left her alive.<eos> Man, I knew it.<eos> They were monitoring every word we said.<eos> I guess what they say is true-- even paranoids have enemies.<eos> I'm afraid this re-creation is not right.<eos> Uh, no, I think it is.<eos> The-the lid is a perfect match for the blow that killed her.<eos> Look.<eos> It's a perfect fit for that blow, but the other depressions on the skull do not match the edges of this lid.
(whispering): You're going to get it when you get home.<eos> People, I need to you stay back and stay calm.<eos> There's really nothing to... nothing to see here.<eos> Just stay back.<eos> Where did the statue come from?<eos> No one knows.<eos> It certainly wasn't commissioned.<eos> A nude not commissioned by our city fathers...<eos> Why am I not surprised?<eos> I must say it's very good.
Had he had time to have a second drink, it likely would have come from a brand new bottle...<eos> - Pure gin.<eos> - And the real stuff<eos> - would have counteracted the poison.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> For the poison to take effect, he had to be prevented from taking that second drink.<eos> The bar fight.<eos> You think it was staged to stop Slauson from taking another drink?<eos> Well sir, he likely wouldn't have died if the bar fight hadn't happened.<eos> It played a crucial part in his murder.
You need to know, because you admitted to kicking in Ms. Holmes' door, Detective Wheeler is pushing to upgrade the charge from aggravated battery to home invasion.<eos> - Meaning? - If convicted, instead of 3-5 years, you're looking at 30.<eos> [exhales sharply]<eos> [knock on door] 81's incident report for that last call.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Matt, I appreciate you getting my back with Otis.<eos> Chain of command, that's all.<eos> Appreciated nonetheless.<eos> The confrontation with Severide...<eos> It warrants a formal report?
Spent his whole career chasing Admiral.<eos> He was gone a lot.<eos> And when he wasn't, we often wished he was.<eos> Wasn't easy on my mother.<eos> She spent a lot of time in the hospital, a lot of time in rehab.<eos> You don't need to tell me this.<eos> My point is... I did a few things I'm not proud of as a kid.<eos> Those records were supposed to stay sealed.<eos> I had one copy.<eos> It's yours now.
I've seen better.<eos> Eh, maybe I'll practice on you some time.<eos> Chopper, plug in and find Ezra and the crew.<eos> Transferring him to a secure cell?<eos> That means they know who he is.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Hurry up. Hit the button.<eos> Which, which button?<eos> I don't know where it is.
Could have been a lot worse.<eos> And it didn't have to happen.<eos> I'm glad it did.<eos> Really?<eos> A group of peaceful protestors being attacked on live television?<eos> That's a good day for us.<eos> You're lucky a lot of your people weren't seriously injured.<eos> No thanks to your officers.<eos> The police assigned to protect us intentionally failed to do so.<eos> I didn't figure you for the kind that plants a bomb and then blames the bomb squad when it goes off.
The one you ripped apart?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're putting her on the stand.<eos> - Thank you for coming.<eos> - We-we know you're very busy.<eos> I am, but...<eos> - We understand you're not entirely hap...<eos> - As my father would say, wha gwan.<eos> We'd like to tell you about our firm.<eos> It's not as big as Canning's, - but we see that as a plus.
Is that right? Mm-hmm.<eos> Where you going?<eos> I'm going to get coffee wit somebody.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> Who you going to get coffee with?<eos> None of your business. How's it your business?<eos> Is it that girl you hung out with last week?<eos> What did I just say to you?<eos> Is that her right now?<eos> 'Cause if it is, let me talk to her.
Yep.<eos> OK, got that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> They've found a boat.<eos> You seen we've got a shadow?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That'll be one of Campbell's.<eos> Right, there's your boat.<eos> Shall we?<eos> How did it get here?
They've found a boat.<eos> You seen we've got a shadow?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That'll be one of Campbell's.<eos> Right, there's your boat.<eos> Shall we?<eos> How did it get here?<eos> It fell out the sky?<eos> I mean, the body's 12 miles away - how can the boat be here and the body be over there?<eos> Maybe it sailed on without him?
Man of few words.<eos> Which is odd because most of the people I deal with who you know... use a lot of words.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've gotten over words.<eos> How'd you find Jason?<eos> - Eli, what?<eos> - What?<eos> What are you after?<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> I know your private life is none of my business... but when it begins to... spill into your public life...
- Really?<eos> - How do you figure?<eos> - It's customer based.<eos> I mean, the auto-complete is based on most used search requests, so, obviously, more people who typed in "Jamal" were interested in arrest reports than anything else.<eos> So, Chumhum's not racist... its users are?<eos> Well, one could argue that it's racist to override the results.<eos> Okay, we need to deal with the "animal" incident.<eos> I don't like the sound of that.<eos> Chumhum has photo-identifying software.<eos> It sorts your photos into categories.
In one of them, the state paid for the whole cleanup.<eos> In another, the current property owner was on the hook.<eos> Are you talking about the person who bought the property after the landfill was sealed?<eos> Yeah, doesn't seem fair, does it?<eos> But that's how the Superfund law works.<eos> It's like buying a used car.<eos> You need to check under the hood, because once you pay for it, it's yours, warts and all.<eos> The building owner.<eos> The one who was in a hurry to fill in the hole that Eddie Ross dug.<eos> Maybe that's not just because it's an eyesore.
Why aren't you out there, looking for whoever did this?<eos> Who's Herriot?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Here's that report for Donald Sidwell.<eos> Oh, right, OK.<eos> Thanks, Jim.<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Guess how much Napoleon's violin is worth.<eos> 70p. Hello?<eos> It's Napoleon's!
I thought you liked living with us.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Not fancy enough for you?<eos> No, Mum, it's not that.<eos> What is it, then?<eos> I talked to Herriots.<eos> Look, Mum, I'm really sorry, can we talk about this later?<eos> The violin's a fake.<eos> What?<eos> What? It's old.
'Well, you know how proud your father was, how private.<eos> 'He caused a scene, walked out.<eos> 'Too embarrassed to ever go back.'<eos> Shut up!<eos> Did you know he was depressed?<eos> He always seemed so... strong.<eos> I guess he hid it.<eos> And the more he hid it, the more ill he got.<eos> And when he found out Napoleon's violin was a fake, well, that was the final straw, nearly.<eos> It's not a fake.
And him and Mr Scrooge, rowing in the street.<eos> What about?<eos> All I heard was, "Jaggers shall settle it."<eos> It's why Marley was so riled.<eos> And that can't come from me, Inspector.<eos> It just can't.<eos> I understand, miss.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> I forgot my newspaper.<eos> It's under your arm, sir.
You know what, I would tell you what Jane said next, but I'm a gentleman.<eos> Hi, I'm Jane Villanueva, and I'd like to make an appointment with the dean.<eos> Urgently.<eos> But very respectfully.<eos> Oh, did you decide to enroll next semester after all?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm a full-time grad student.<eos> Oh, well, since you didn't pay tuition next semester, we assumed you were taking a little time off.<eos> No, I have the Elodea Gale Vigor scholarship.<eos> It covers the whole year.
Look, if you want to get into it, that wasn't just going over my head.<eos> That was pole vaulting the entire chain of command.<eos> I'm sorry if that made things difficult for you.<eos> Don't expect a Christmas card from my supervisors, but... I get it.<eos> Look, just about everyone in this line of work is crystal clear about their patriotism.<eos> At the expense of their humanity sometimes.<eos> And I'd put myself at the front of that class.<eos> You're different.<eos> I'm not sure if that's a compliment.<eos> Your conscience may not make you the ideal spy, but it certainly makes you a better person.
It could not have come from him.<eos> Now we know that with certainty.<eos> Whether that alone would've been enough to grant him a new trial, I don't know.<eos> But even more dramatically, they took that profile from that pubic hair and they ran it through the state crime laboratory data bank and they got a cold hit.<eos> That is to say, they matched it to somebody in the data bank who they didn't know was in there.<eos> And that somebody was Gregory Allen.<eos> I feel free.<eos> When I left the prison, the anger left.<eos> It was gone.<eos> It stayed there, behind them gates.

_<eos> Tell me everything that happened this morning.<eos> Okay, after we checked into the hotel, I asked the concierge where I could buy some presents for my family.<eos> What was his name, this concierge?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Oh, yeah. It was Victor.<eos> So he gave me the address, and then when I got to the street, these two guys appeared out of nowhere.<eos> One of them hits me on the head.<eos> The other one grabs my violin case.<eos> Why did you take your violin with you if it's so valuable?
Warren Boyd.<eos> Good morning...<eos> Good morning.<eos> ...my new friend.<eos> I love the gray in your beard.<eos> It's the march of the time, you know?<eos> It's sexy.<eos> And your skin.<eos> What about my skin?<eos> It's like a goat skin pouch where I can keep all my little jewels.
- Wait for a good one!<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Ball! Maestro?<eos> "Hai Lai," hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Are you spying on us?<eos> No.<eos> I told them not to do softball, and look at them. They're softballing.<eos> Well, why don't you just go in there and stop us?<eos> I wanted to. That was why I came for, but then I saw the game, it got good, and I got conflicted.
Someone...<eos> That's my son in there!<eos> And he will not say another word until he gets a lawyer.<eos> King.<eos> Wish I could say I was here to catch up on old times, but... I got to take him in.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Doc.<eos> I'm right behind you.<eos> I been fishing with Danny.<eos> He let a trophy bass go 'cause he didn't want to see it suffer.
And that they interrogated him and made him say what they wanted to hear.<eos> I came to pick up Jodi.<eos> - Did you hear me on that talker thing?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> They made a mess, didn't they?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You know, I wouldn't even know where to look for my purse.<eos> 'Cause it was on the bed.
Mr. Avery achieved some degree of notoriety back in 2003 when he was exonerated.<eos> And at the close of this case, I'm gonna point to every one of you potential jurors and say that has absolutely nothing to do with this case.<eos> When deciding who's accountable... for the death of 25-year-old Teresa Halbach, Mr. Avery's past and his past exoneration have nothing to do with this case.<eos> The State intends to prove to you that the defendant restrained... murdered and mutilated Teresa Halbach.<eos> The mutilation of this little girl...<eos> Excuse me, not this little girl, this young woman, absolutely occurred because this is what's left.<eos> Small, tiny pieces of bone fragment.<eos> Now, despite Mr. Avery's efforts to completely obliterate all these bones by burning, to incinerate these bones completely, this bone survived.<eos> It's Teresa Halbach's shin bone.<eos> It's Karen Halbach's daughter's tibia.
"You know, can we really acquit this man when we don't know... We can't tell them who we think did it?"<eos> That's gonna be, on a human level, the hardest thing, I think.<eos> And the judge has really tied our hands on that.<eos> [Buting] We can't point the finger at other suspects.<eos> All we're gonna be able to argue is failure to follow this lead and that lead which, in a way, points at other suspects, but there's a lot of leads that if they had been followed up, might have led to motive, opportunity and access and a direct connection to the crime.<eos> But in a case like this, where there's such tunnel vision, you can't go too far down that road because they didn't go very far down the road.<eos> And by the time we're on the case, the trail's cold.<eos> Or it's been altered.<eos> My mom had called me, um, that Thursday, November 3rd, that afternoon about Teresa and said that she had tried calling her and Teresa's inbox was full.<eos> So, um, I guess what I was interested in was, um... why it was full or when the first new message was, you know, received in her inbox. Um...
- No, sir.<eos> - OK.<eos> But you know that somebody searched it on November 5.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - How about on November 8?<eos> Do you know whether Mr. Colborn took all of the stuff out of the bookcase?<eos> All the magazines and the photos and that type of thing were taken out of the bookcase.<eos> So that he could look in the bookcase.<eos> I suppose.<eos> And did you get a chance to look into the bookcase - when it was empty of its contents? - I may...
- You think that's easy...<eos> - Don't start with me!<eos> To think they'd pick this hotel when there so many others!<eos> Just my luck!<eos> Instead of complaining, grab your jacket and let's go.<eos> - My jacket?<eos> - There, in the closet.<eos> What did you do with my hat?<eos> I don't know!<eos> It must be here.
I nominate you.<eos> It's a terrible job and she smells horrible.<eos> You'll have to dress like me and grow your hair long,<eos> - so there are perks.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> What did I miss?<eos> I'm just... [sighs] preparing myself.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Astrid, have you seen that moon?<eos> When it rises to its apex, which I think is a word that means the tip-top, I'm going full dragon.
- [mumbling] I don't know.<eos> I think I've gone blind from all the venom.<eos> Ugh!<eos> He's out.<eos> Tuffnut on the loose.<eos> This is bad.<eos> This is very bad. [Snotlout continues groaning]<eos> I can't be contained, chicken.<eos> Look at that moon.<eos> In a matter of [growls] hours, it will finally apex, and I will be transformed into a great scaly beast with nothing to do but feast on my prey!
Come on.<eos> I'm not a complete idiot.<eos> I don't know how to get this into your thick skull, but whatever it is you're talking about, I'm simply not involved.<eos> Play.<eos> Sir.<eos> You've missed Hall.<eos> Not hungry.<eos> I tell you, there is a war coming, no doubt about it.<eos> Because we are being led like mindless, spineless sheep and no one bothers to question any of it.<eos> It's coming, all right.
You don't belong here and you can tell your Master Hardy I said as much!<eos> Now, get out!<eos> My sacred thread.<eos> It's to help ward off evil spirits.<eos> How did it work with Mr. Howard?<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I got too excited.<eos> Not a word often associated with his lectures.<eos> How did you know that theorem?<eos> It came to me.
Well, I've been having some reservations about some of his work.<eos> Well, what did you expect?<eos> He may belong to a world beyond us, but he's not God.<eos> Well, that's a relief.<eos> He's not.<eos> How will Janaki ever come now?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They say it'll be over by Christmas.<eos> Please finish by telling him that, of course, I will come and not to worry about the war.<eos> It is far away from here.
Over here!<eos> I'm being punished.<eos> It's just the fever.<eos> Has he wrote yet?<eos> No.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You forgot me.<eos> You see, you were right.<eos> Cauchy's theorem will work.<eos> It's just leading to the circle concept.
Suit yourself. But I think you'll find the result will be the same.<eos> - Hardy.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Now what have you got yourself involved with?<eos> John.<eos> Good of you to come.<eos> Wouldn't have missed it for the world.<eos> So, now we see the work on partitions and the enormous breakthrough that has been achieved.<eos> All this, mind you, by a man whose limitations of knowledge when I met him were as startling as was its profundity.<eos> Opinions may differ as to the importance of Ramanujan's work and the influence it may or may not have on the mathematics of the future, but one gift it does show is its profound and invincible originality.
You know, the most likely explanation for all of this is a chemical imbalance.<eos> - Really? - Mmm.<eos> Onto the bed.<eos> That would explain the pain, the confused state of masculinity and the infertility.<eos> Let's hope it is that, because that, at least, we can cure.<eos> I don't need to do this.<eos> There's nothing wrong with me. - That's not true.<eos> - Gerda, this can't be right.<eos> Radiation is a miracle, Mr. Wegener.<eos> It destroys the bad and saves the good.
Tasks, which is what you should be doing, but you're not.<eos> You are here. Why?<eos> Are you special, Mason?<eos> No. But in regards to the ethics work, I think I work hard.<eos> Many times I spend entire weekend taking photos.<eos> Like football, Mason?<eos> - Not much.<eos> - I knew that.<eos> So I just ordered that you cover the college game today.<eos> It starts at 7 and 30 Arrive early.
Incredible.<eos> We decided to come early to see you.<eos> Term and will be with you for a while.<eos> I guarantee that you did nothing wrong.<eos> Those Loves Secondary never work.<eos> All are are changing so fast, you know?<eos> The odds that two young remain on the same wavelength are ...<eos> - Yes, but ...<eos> - I also guarantee ... every day of your life you spend crying over a silly girl ... It is a waste of time.<eos> But it was not a silly girl.

That's the painter that painted all your early work.<eos> It's Scenic!<eos> That's my nickname in Paris!<eos> All my art school pals loved my scenic views so much, they called me... well, they couldn't pronounce it properly, so they called me "Cenic."<eos> The more you lie, the smaller you seem.<eos> How dare you accuse me of lying!<eos> I'm proud of my early Cenics!<eos> Then why did you paint over the name?<eos> A piece of advice, never use water-based over an oil.<eos> It'll just fleck right off.
- Laine, we're only trying to help you.<eos> - You can't.<eos> I'm not even sure who can.<eos> Trevor.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> All of us.<eos> You made us play.<eos> Now, Isabelle's dead.<eos> I know, and I'll never forgive myself.<eos> This thing, it's haunting us, wherever we go, watching everything we do.

You would be right to do so.<eos> There is little beauty about me.<eos> There is little beauty in what I have done.<eos> Say what you must.<eos> I beg of you... and all of Athens!<eos> The god-king will burn this city to the ground!<eos> What does he mean?<eos> Quiet yourselves!<eos> Leonidas' and Sparta's great sacrifice was no defeat.<eos> It was a beautiful victory.
My mom is in love.<eos> Well, that's nice for her.<eos> The specifics are very hard to explain.<eos> Very, very hard.<eos> But I realized something.<eos> I have never been in love.<eos> Not like that.<eos> I've been too busy chasing this idea that I had about this perfect life and life is not perfect.<eos> It shouldn't be perfect.<eos> It should be unpredictable and irrational and complicated.
Oh, come on!<eos> That's funny!<eos> As the days went on, Stefan darkened... further consumed by paranoia and vengeance.<eos> Pull down! - The torch!<eos> Flame!<eos> Make ready!<eos> Release!<eos> You failed me.<eos> The wall cannot be burned.<eos> It is indestructible.
The World Chess Championship looks to be ending in humiliation for the American, Bobby Fischer, whose demands that the game be held in a rec room have led to widespread ridicule.<eos> Stop here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You won't believe it.<eos> Spassky's agreed to play in the Ping-Pong room.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Wait, where are you going?<eos> Only one camera.<eos> It does not move.
Stop here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You won't believe it.<eos> Spassky's agreed to play in the Ping-Pong room.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Wait, where are you going?<eos> Only one camera.<eos> It does not move.<eos> It makes no sound.
Yes.<eos> Yes, I think it is.<eos> Fine!<eos> At last a decision.<eos> I can get on with my meaningless life.<eos> Oh, shut...<eos> Darling, sweetheart.<eos> Where is my fucking pen?<eos> Oh, Diego.<eos> Um, it's... it's here.
Yes, I think it is.<eos> Fine!<eos> At last a decision.<eos> I can get on with my meaningless life.<eos> Oh, shut...<eos> Darling, sweetheart.<eos> Where is my fucking pen?<eos> Oh, Diego.<eos> Um, it's... it's here.<eos> Actually I've got it. It's, um, here.
You are our first guest.<eos> Have we met before?<eos> The condom came off inside my vagina and at present I'm unable to locate it!<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Ruby, would you please see our guest upstairs to his room?<eos> Of course.<eos> And free champagne!<eos> All right, follow me and then...<eos> Yeah, a brand new bed, and...<eos> It's massive and you get to see the sea.
I'm fine, really.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Look at your painting.<eos> It's completely ruined.<eos> No, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> In fact, it's improved.<eos> No, no, Mustafa, you cannot mean that.<eos> I do, I do!<eos> But it's so ugly.
And then he assigns you to his sacred fire That you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast<eos> All these things shall love do unto you That you may know the secrets of your heart And in that knowledge become a fragment<eos> Now if in your fear you seek only love's peace and love's pleasure<eos> Better cover your nakedness And pass out of love's threshing-floor Into a seasonless world where you shall laugh But not all your laughter<eos> And weep and weep, but not all of your tears<eos> Love gives naught but itself And takes naught but from itself<eos> Love possesses not nor would it be possessed<eos> For love is enough<eos> You should say, "I am in the heart of God"<eos> You cannot direct the course of Love If Love, it finds you worthy, directs your course
I've got 20 in private rooms they can't afford.<eos> Okay, what about the guys who don't have health insurance...<eos> - artists, actors?<eos> - I've got eight of them in another ward where I shouldn't put them.<eos> Why don't you wear gloves and a face mask?<eos> Never have and I never will.<eos> And I'm still here.<eos> Why is all the food sitting outside their rooms like this?<eos> - It's getting cold.<eos> - It's always cold because the appropriate staff won't bring it into the rooms, so it sits and rots until one of my staff can.
Okay, good. Got it.<eos> So, the money's there, right?<eos> It just hasn't been spent.<eos> So there's this new drug in France.<eos> Why doesn't the N.I.H. study it?<eos> I mean, what I want, what we want, what we desperately need is for somebody to help us cut through all this red tape.<eos> I can asure you that not a week goes by that I don't bring new information and reports to the president.<eos> The progress that's been made on this disease<eos> - is unprecedented.<eos> - But it's contagious.

Don't tell me what to do.<eos> You look good, Vic.<eos> Which is ironic, considering it means more time rotting in jail.<eos> Don't take this the wrong way, Rose, but...<eos> I probably should have killed you.<eos> There's a compliment in there somewhere.<eos> I spent a lot of money on that charm.<eos> It didn't quite work out the way I wanted.<eos> Mmm.<eos> It worked out well enough.
He has.<eos> I'm not quite sure what you think...<eos> Shh!<eos> Not now, dear.<eos> Blood.<eos> Blood is what connects us all.<eos> Blood is sustenance.<eos> Blood is family.<eos> Blood is pain, and blood is death, be it the fang of the Strigoi or a drunk driver on the wrong side of the road.<eos> Blood is many things, and sometimes it gets so crazy and confusing that you need a best friend to tell you, "it's OK."
Anyway...<eos> Here you go.<eos> He's just gonna play for a while.<eos> And, kids are crazy.<eos> They're fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what were we talking about?<eos> We're thinking about launching this game.<eos> We want it to be a space station simulation strategy game.<eos> We want it to be authentic and completely immersive.
Let's go, what time is it?<eos> Really late, like 1:30 AM<eos> Yeah, forget about it.<eos> My mom would never let me go.<eos> We can go... hidden.<eos> What's fun about an Eclipse?<eos> -Watching the moon disappearing from the sky<eos> -What do you mean disappearing?<eos> -It disappears...<eos> I mean... it ceases to be illuminated.
-You're such an asshole, Fábio, I don't have a problem with the game<eos> -Prove it, and stay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll stay.<eos> Let's sit there, then.<eos> Dmitri, move...<eos> Turn, turn, there. Sit.<eos> So, I'll start<eos> I'll spin the bottle.<eos> And whoever it's pointing at Will have to kiss me.
Shit! I like to think that coincidence is a way of reminding us that there's somebody up there with a master plan.<eos> Yes?<eos> Hello?<eos> Who is it?<eos> Hello, is this the Claremont daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Well, I'm having a bit of an emergency.<eos> An emergency?<eos> All right, you probably just think it's an emergency!
...is not the only such affliction.<eos> And so we come to that condition which most often afflicts the more nervous sex.<eos> Hysteria.<eos> Derived from the Greek for "uterus". Much studied by the French, it has of late come under the scrutiny of our Austrian colleagues.
It strengthened the bond between the men and... kept morale high.<eos> And I believe the same principal applies here.<eos> It's therapeutic for the patients to mix with polite society, and, I might add, for polite society to mix with them.<eos> Dinner is served.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Tell me, boy, what do you think of our little asylum?<eos> Why, it's quite... unlike anything I've ever known.
The cops said they'd drop charges if we put you in the scene... which they already knew you were.<eos> - I'm, like, so sorry, Larry.<eos> - Call me Doc.<eos> It's cool, Jade.<eos> - That copper?<eos> - Bigfoot?<eos> He's a warped sheet of plastic.<eos> So was it Bigfoot who put me on the Buenos Noches Express... or did he subcontract it?<eos> I missed all that, man.<eos> Last thing I remember was eating Bambi's pussy... and Puck Beaverton's tattoo, like, it was pulsating.
I say permanent and forever because there is no way to ever fully eradicate terrorism.<eos> So, the first step in the war on terrorism is to declare war on...<eos> - Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - Can I say something I'm ashamed of?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's not generous. - And I probably don't really mean it.<eos> - Okay. Go.<eos> - I think Jamie's great.<eos> - Just say it!<eos> I can't fucking believe his idiotic Facebook idea paid off! It's so fucking stupid!
- That's old man talk.<eos> I can't let Cornelia and Leslie walk down this road with you. I want you to go in there and tell them what you've done.<eos> If you won't do it, I'll do it for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What else can I tell you?<eos> After all these years, I still don't have all the answers. And for the sake of documentary cinema, I intend to leave it that way.<eos> Thank you so much for this tribute.<eos> You know, it's just the way... - Josh!<eos> - Sorry I'm late, Leslie.<eos> I caught your speech from the lobby, though, and it was really inspiring, spot on.
-Hey!<eos> Get off!<eos> -I told you.<eos> I am running a bit late.<eos> It's over, Spider.<eos> Really? !<eos> I know we all think that we're immortal.<eos> We're supposed to feel that way.<eos> We're graduating.<eos> But, like our brief four years in high school what makes life valuable is that it doesn't last forever.

How much?<eos> Hey, you're that spider guy.<eos> I'm Spider-Man.<eos> This Spider-Man.... He's not the police, he's not a fireman.<eos> What gives him the right to get involved in other people's business?<eos> Peter, honey?<eos> Can I come in?<eos> No!<eos> Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.<eos> You said you would take my car into the shop because it keeps dying, remember?
-He's completely erased.<eos> That's Oscorp.<eos> And what about you? Why are you here?<eos> Harry.<eos> -Osborn?<eos> -He's dying.<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -He's dying.<eos> And he thinks the only thing that's gonna save his life is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.<eos> And as far as I know, if I give it to him, it could kill him.
Yeah.<eos> I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn. I really, really do.<eos> I can't give you my blood.<eos> Not right now.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> If our blood is incompatible, you could die.<eos> I'm already dying.<eos> Your blood can't make me die more.<eos> But it could do something worse.
Finish your hush puppies.<eos> I'm full.<eos> In a minute, Lauren.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What?<eos> - What are we doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Fixing the sink.<eos> We're fixing the sink. It leaks.
That's all I have.<eos> You rearrange everything!<eos> All right, Mary.<eos> Wait, what, what, what?<eos> What?<eos> Goddamn!<eos> Don't be a you-know-what, Mary!<eos> Don't be a you-know-what.<eos> My memory plays tricks on me.<eos> It plays tricks on me.
Yes.<eos> Wished him ill?<eos> I did.<eos> Dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> Deputy Hanson testified that you told him... that only you were allowed to drive that car.<eos> Not even your late wife.<eos> It's my car.<eos> But now a man's blood, a man that you hate... was found on a car that only you drive.<eos> But you don't know how it got there.
They captured her that day... tortured her, experimented on her.<eos> In her DNA, they discovered the secrets to her powers of transformation.<eos> It gave them the key they needed... to create weapons that could adapt to any mutant power.<eos> And in less than 50 years... the machines that have destroyed... so many of our kind were created.<eos> But it all started that day in 1973... the day she first killed.<eos> The day she truly became...<eos> Mystique.<eos> You want to go back there.<eos> If I can get to her, stop the assassination... keep her out of their hands... then we can stop the Sentinels from ever being born.<eos> And end this war before it ever begins.
Just because someone stumbles, loses their way... it doesn't mean they're lost forever.<eos> Sometimes we all need a little help.<eos> I'm not the man I was.<eos> I open my mind... and it almost overwhelms me.<eos> You're afraid, and Cerebro knows it.<eos> All those voices... so much pain.<eos> It's not their pain you're afraid of.<eos> It's yours, Charles.<eos> And as frightening as it may be... that pain will make you stronger.<eos> If you allow yourself to feel it... embrace it... it will make you more powerful than you ever imagined.
Get up, scum!<eos> Back to work!<eos> Why did you save my life?<eos> No gladiator should die from a blade to the back.<eos> When you die, the blow will come from the front.<eos> I promise it will be tomorrow.<eos> And it will come from my hand.<eos> Well, I can make you a better promise.<eos> When the time comes, your death will be quick.<eos> And it will come from my hand.
If you ride you have a chance.<eos> - A chance at what?<eos> - At freedom.<eos> But at what cost to you?<eos> Tell the guards I brought you here by force.<eos> The blame is mine.<eos> Get him off that horse!<eos> It wasn't his fault.<eos> The horse bolted.<eos> It was out of control.
The medicine always tastes bad.<eos> YOUNG SHEM: She was the only one moving.<eos> METHUSELAH: Was she hurt badly?<eos> YOUNG SHEM: She had a big cut on her belly.<eos> Mother helped and I held her hand.<eos> That must have made her feel safe.<eos> Well?<eos> Fire consumes all.<eos> Water cleanses.<eos> It separates the foul from the pure.
These are the charities you specified with their bank details.<eos> Each of the transfers is logged in to our system and is ready to go.<eos> Oh. Would you please check all the details?<eos> The name of the account holders and the money assigned to each recipient and then authorize each one with your signature.<eos> I would like to make a substitute.<eos> I need to change a name.<eos> Seven Friends Navigation Company?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is a shipping company, but one whose business is charity.<eos> We can have all the aid in the world but it's worthless unless you can get it to the people who need it.
See, Theseus had promised his father that if he defeated the Minotaur, he'd hoist a white sail on his ship as a tribute but he was so excited to get back home he forgot and he flew the same black sail that he set out with.<eos> Well, thinking his son was dead, the heartbroken king flung himself onto the rocks below, another victim of the cruel tricks gods play on men.<eos> Well, I hope you ladies brought your handkerchiefs, 'cause the next thing you're about to see has been known to make some weep at first sight.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Completed in 438 BC, the Parthenon.<eos> From the Greek word "parthenes", meaning "virgins".<eos> "The ancient Greeks were masters of deception.<eos> "Even though the base of the Parthenon appears straight to the naked eye, "it is, in fact, completely crooked.<eos> "Indeed, if one were to leave one's hat on one side of the temple steps,<eos> "it would vanish altogether when viewed from the other."
"Homie, let's do it. God, homie."<eos> "That's amazing."<eos> Okay, enough!<eos> Stop imitating!<eos> I get it!<eos> He's got a huge dick!<eos> And her vagina, "Bye!" It's ruined!<eos> Destroyed.<eos> Gone!<eos> It's like when you lend a fat friend your shirt, and it comes back, and it's all stretchy and flappy!
You know what I see?<eos> Losers.<eos> I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff.<eos> And we have. Man, we have. All of us.<eos> Our homes, our families,<eos> normal lives.<eos> And, usually, life takes more than it gives.<eos> But not today.<eos> Today, it's given us something.<eos> It has given us a chance.
We're just making a film! Down,now!<eos> Let'sgo.<eos> Ta-dah.<eos> Come on, Viorel. Forward march.<eos> You've played your parts very well.<eos> Now get over to the police van.<eos> Not that you were very talkative, but still.<eos> Right. No,I wantto comewithyou and split the money.<eos> Outofthequestion.<eos> You stay here, rehearse for the big parade and don't come back until it's over.
- Stand. - Thank you, sir.<eos> Feeling okay?<eos> Flying is not my cup of tea.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> - You're a doctor.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Your bag.<eos> Can you fetch it up, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's right down here.
- What is he saying, Elliot?<eos> I'm saying your mother never wore a seat belt.<eos> Michael, wait in the other room.<eos> - Elliot?<eos> - Just wait in the other room.<eos> For real?<eos> OK.<eos> That game ruined me.<eos> I had everything before and nothing after.<eos> It poisoned me.
- out in that parking lot? - Yeah.<eos> I remember I kicked one over the telephone wires, and you said...<eos> You know what, you're right. I did have it.<eos> Look at that!<eos> I just saved humanity!<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe I should hold on to that box.<eos> I don't think so, mister.<eos> Dr. P encrusted that to me.<eos> And I'm gonna make sure it gets to my daughter, safe and sound.
Whoa! That's a bump.<eos> I stuck the landing.<eos> You want to go ride a cow?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Where the hell are we? Shh, shh, shh. Come here.<eos> When I was a young girl, I used to feed deer right out of my hand at my grandparents' cabin, and there was this one... hee-yah!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> You never did appreciate nature.<eos> Uh, not when it totals my corolla.
I know, but it's time to give it a little break. What are we gonna do for the party?<eos> Please don't wear that shirt to the party.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> You're gonna doll me up, and then I'm gonna have to be beatin' the ladies off with a... with a lesbian stick.<eos> There you are. Look at you.<eos> Oh, my gosh. Wow.<eos> You look so... Softened.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Susanne made me put on lenore's shirt.<eos> It actually looks better on you than her.
I'm coming right up.<eos> - Got wall cloud to the east. - Whoa.<eos> Yeah, but no vortex.<eos> - Jacob. I got some circulation over here.<eos> - Over here, got it.<eos> It's heading towards those trees.<eos> I'm on Oakwood Road.<eos> If you're in Shaw County, you need to get yourself to a safe place now.<eos> This thing is going to track right, almost towards town.<eos> There it is now.
Yeah, there's the guy I know.<eos> - Guys, we gotta get out of here.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Everybody in the Titus.<eos> We are tracking a massive tornado.<eos> Pete, you seeing this?<eos> - There's a second tornado formation.<eos> - I see it. This storm is heading northwest.<eos> There.<eos> And it just touched down.
It won't turn off.<eos> I think I broke it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, it's just not turning off.<eos> - How does that thing turn off? - I don't know.<eos> - Uh...<eos> This button?<eos> - There's usually like a button on the top.<eos> - How did you turn it on? - I don't know.<eos> It was already on.
- Did you do this?<eos> - Of course they did it.<eos> What are you, stupid?<eos> Look at the crime scene.<eos> OK, you don't have to be rude to me!<eos> I'm just trying to move in here.<eos> I hired these guys to do it.<eos> And accidents happen.<eos> Well, the car is an antique, missy.<eos> I mean, it's worth a lot.
My wife gave it to me.<eos> I don't want to get blood on it.<eos> Jean-Claude, you hang on to it right now.<eos> We are no longer observers to war.<eos> We're active participants, subject to the same heartache as the rest of these soldiers.<eos> When we lost Donald Jeffries, we earned the right to wear the uniform.<eos> And now we've lost our second man.<eos> From the beginning, I told you that no piece of art was worth a man's life.<eos> But these last months have proved me wrong.<eos> This is our history, and it's not to be stolen or destroyed.
- What?<eos> Boy, it is burned to heck in here.<eos> Everybody just stay where they are.<eos> Looks like the lieutenant here is standing on an unexploded mine.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> - I asked him the same thing.<eos> - He did.<eos> Well, you're going to have to... - step off of it eventually.<eos> - Well, eventually, yes.<eos> And either the mine is so damaged from the fire that it's a dud...
-My granny made it for me from a wolf that attacked us.<eos> And she gave me this beautiful knife for protection.<eos> Well, look what I have!<eos> A golden egg.<eos> Where did you get that egg?<eos> I stole a hen that lays golden eggs from the kingdom of the giant.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> It's true.<eos> And you should see the giant's toy harp.<eos> It plays the most beautiful tunes without your even having to touch it.
As the prince anxiously waited, the stepmother took matters... and florinda's foot... into her own hands.<eos> Careful, my toe...!<eos> Darling, I know...<eos> It'll have to go.<eos> But when you're his bride, you can sit or ride.<eos> You'll never need to walk!<eos> Aaaaaaaaa!<eos> Minus one toe, florinda mounted the prince's horse, unaware of the blood dripping from the slipper.<eos> Lucinda was next.<eos> Why won't it fit?
Something like that.<eos> Katie!<eos> Oh, this is beautiful!<eos> - Wow. - Mmm.<eos> - Whoa! - Nice.<eos> This is pretty.<eos> Did you ever think when we had that shitty little apartment on Charles Street that we'd end up here?<eos> That wasn't a shitty apartment.<eos> That was a great apartment.<eos> Remember how tiny it was?
Once online a sentient machine will quickly overcome the limits of biology.<eos> And in a short time, its analytical power will be greater than the collective intelligence of every person born in the history of the world.<eos> So now imagine such an entity with a full range of human emotion.<eos> Even self-awareness.<eos> Some scientists refer to this as "the singularity."<eos> I call it "transcendence."<eos> The path to building such a super-intelligence requires us to unlock the most fundamental secrets of the universe.<eos> What is the nature of consciousness?<eos> Is there a soul?<eos> And if so, where does it reside?
And there isn't a number you can quote us that's too big.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cell phones.<eos> You know, I, I used to work for Thomas Casey.<eos> I interned for him.<eos> One night, he invites us all over to the lab, gives us this whole speech about history, hands out champagne, like he just cured cancer.<eos> And you know, when he uploaded that rhesus monkey, I was actually happy for him.<eos> We all were.<eos> And then I realized we had crossed a line.<eos> The machine that thought it was a monkey never took a breath.

- You're Bob Smith.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - From Pittsburgh?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> You're gonna be in room number 6.<eos> I want room 13, please.<eos> - 13?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Not many people ask for room 13.<eos> So it's available, yeah?
Why don't you tell me about him?<eos> I don't know anything about him.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> You wanna talk about this?<eos> Anything you wanna tell me?<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> I'm gonna give you a chance to answer honestly.<eos> Did you look in that bag?<eos> Don't have to look in the bag of allegiance to know that it's worth more than what you're getting.
-Now, that's a real man.<eos> -Quiet, Carlos!<eos> Manolo... If Maria didn't say yes to joaquin... Then she said no.<eos> So, what are you gonna do about it, son?<eos> After stealing xibalba's magic medal in a battle...<eos> Chakal had risen to become the king of the bandits.<eos> But when xibalba stole it back, chakal had come undone.<eos> We found the medal!<eos> The medal of everlasting life!<eos> It's in the town of San angel.
That is so nice of-- wow.<eos> I'm speechless.<eos> I know.<eos> Right? I get that a lot.<eos> Good night, joaquin.<eos> Wait. Maria.<eos> Yes?<eos> My bonnet.<eos> You kept it all this time?<eos> Well, it's what's kept me going.
Chakal and his men are at the gates of San angel!<eos> Man, this is a whole lot of bull.<eos> Maria posada... Do you take joaquin to be your husband?<eos> Yes.<eos> For San angel, I do.<eos> And joaquin... Do you take Maria to be your wife?<eos> I...<eos> Chakal is here!<eos> My medal.<eos> It's on my other suit.
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.<eos> And he clubbed me.<eos> Icoflapsed.<eos> That club was actually the handle to a Punch and Judy puppet.<eos> Right.<eos> Treasure hunt.<eos> I'd hidden some puppets at Go's...<eos> Then how did Desi have that handle?<eos> I'd just found it.<eos> It must have fallen off.
Times have changed.<eos> The thermal baths are very beautiful.<eos> They were in their first condition.<eos> It couldn't be maintained, of course.<eos> Too decadent for current tastes.<eos> But I love it all just the same, this enchanting old ruin.<eos> How did you come to buy it, if I may ask?<eos> The Grand Budapest.<eos> I didn't.<eos> If you're not merely being polite, and you must tell me if that's the case, but if it genuinely does interest you, may I invite you to dine with me tonight, and it will be my pleasure and, indeed, my privilege to tell you
If you're not merely being polite, and you must tell me if that's the case, but if it genuinely does interest you, may I invite you to dine with me tonight, and it will be my pleasure and, indeed, my privilege to tell you<eos> Two ducks roasted with olives.<eos> Rabbit, salad?<eos> Pouilly-Jouvet '52, plus a split of the brut.<eos> That should provide us ample time<eos> - if I commence promptly.<eos> - By all means.<eos> Well, it begins, as it must, with our mutual friend's predecessor.<eos> The beloved, original concierge of The Grand Budapest.<eos> It begins, of course, with...
I thought we were going to actual college, not online college.<eos> Listening for coded messages in lectures.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Look around.<eos> This is our city.<eos> What do we want to be in college for?<eos> You're right.<eos> Partners for life.<eos> At Metro city port, the tide comes in at 10:30 A.M.<eos> Then it will return to the sea.
Family is family, Gus.<eos> Woody's not going out like that, not on our watch.<eos> Trout threw us out, Shawn.<eos> And, again, there's no way for us to get back inside there without getting arrested.<eos> You're right.<eos> Trout threw out Shawn Spencer and Darnell Guster.<eos> But he did not throw out Satchel Gizmo and Soupcan Sam.<eos> Come on, son.<eos> Do you have your half of the beard?<eos> Man, you know it's in the glove compartment.
I'm gonna watch every single move, okay?<eos> We're up to it.<eos> Yeah, I recognize him.<eos> He would buy quick picks all the time.<eos> Never hit the big one, though.<eos> Speaking of which, do you mind checking these, please?<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> Since Wilson was murdered, he's due some good luck now.<eos> At least that's what math says.<eos> Would you please stop quoting math like it is a person?
Well, I'm not scared.<eos> You will be when it creeps into your room at night.<eos> That's enough.<eos> You will be when it eats your insides!<eos> I've decided you're not having your birthday with Ruby this week.<eos> No cake, no games. That's the end of it.<eos> Samuel!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen!<eos> Mum and Dad!<eos> Life is not always as it seems. It can be a wondrous thing! But if can also be very treacherous.
How many six-year-old boys do you know, Robbie, who still believe in monsters?<eos> I hate you!<eos> She won't let me have a birthday party, and she won't let me have a dad!<eos> Don"r eat it.<eos> The Babadook did it, Mum.<eos> Go and watch a DVD, and I'll make something else.<eos> The Babadook did it!<eos> Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys, welcome to The Great Martin's DVD School of Magic.<eos> Life is not always as it seems. It can be ca wondrous thing.
Maybe to you.<eos> You might want to see this.<eos> See what?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Damn!<eos> He's really good.<eos> Say it again and I'll shoot you.<eos> Get in.<eos> Where's the bomb?<eos> It'll be here.
I know I feel comfortable with someone when I can just sit, not talking to them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just like sitting there, not talking.<eos> I just feel comfortable sitting' there, you know.<eos> I had a pain in my side real bad.<eos> It's starting to hurt.<eos> I think maybe I gotta do something with it.<eos> Don't look bad?<eos> Let's put that bandage back on.<eos> I think it broke, man.
Amazon Expedition, day seven.<eos> Two thousand miles from Rio... we've reached the center of the rainforest.<eos> We are surrounded by plants and animals... struggling for survival... as we glide effortlessly down the river.<eos> Effortless for you.<eos> How pretty.<eos> Spit it out, spit it out!<eos> We are near the nesting grounds of the Amazonian Wood Quail.<eos> Odontophorus gujanensis.<eos> Six months ago, we rescued this little bird... from smugglers.<eos> It was sick, malnourished... with a broken leg, but now... my trusty assistant...
No. You're the bird.<eos> - No, you're the bird.<eos> - You're the bird!<eos> We get it.<eos> You're both "the bird."<eos> Now, can we stop yakking and start partying?<eos> Wow!<eos> I remember this song.<eos> How could you forget?<eos> It's in our blood, baby.
You got a bathroom?<eos> It's a fucking house, we have the whole jamboree--<eos> - Don't need bathroom, we're leaving.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> I need to take a piss.<eos> Oh, firecracker.<eos> - Is she negotiable too? - No, she's not.<eos> - She's with me.<eos> - I'm not with you.<eos> My price is fixed, it's too high for Jonas.
We decide.<eos> Women in the tenements of Dublin and Cork, bearing 17, 18 children in as many years.<eos> What sort of life would those youngsters face?<eos> Aren't they better off here, with families to take care of them?<eos> Weren't you better off with me in Carricklee?<eos> Do you know the kinds of things that went on in that place?<eos> I got you out.<eos> This racket with the babies.<eos> Not a racket!<eos> Is it going to continue?
What the hell are you doing?<eos> You don't own this car!<eos> You don't get to joyride it!<eos> Top speed just over 230.<eos> 234.<eos> According to this.<eos> Hey.<eos> That was some driving, son.<eos> And that is one hell of a car.<eos> It's going to cost me $3 million?
Do you think I...?<eos> - Who else?<eos> It was Lambert.<eos> Lambert?<eos> - Lambert saw Bella.<eos> He must have told.<eos> The room.<eos> Your box.<eos> - We looked.<eos> It's still there.
So I need you to clean yourself up.<eos> Put your best face on.<eos> And have lunch with us on Wednesday.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> Wait a minute, I just told you that your son is dying.<eos> And you say, you can't do this?<eos> Who are you?<eos> You are going to do this. Or I'm going to make your fucking life more miserable than it already is.
Okay.<eos> - Joe, come on, we're partners.<eos> - Not with me, you're not.<eos> And this is my house...<eos> And I didn't invite you.<eos> Tommy, Tommy. Why don't you take Collin and Finn... Tell them to wait in the car...<eos> - Tomorrow is D day .<eos> - Yeah, I know it.<eos> You ready?<eos> - No, it's not ready.
I certainly deserved to be.<eos> But you know what my parish priest told me?<eos> He said,<eos> "A saint is not a moral exemplar."<eos> "A saint is a life-giver."<eos> He heard my full story, told me that if it happened again I would be defrocked, and I left his office committed to walking the path of grace.<eos> So I do know how difficult it is.<eos> But you need to unburden yourself, Sarchie.<eos> You need to deal with that hidden pain.<eos> It's killing you inside.
Look at me.<eos> 'Cause that's not what I want.<eos> You don't know what you did.<eos> You didn't do it. Let me go.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Do you want me to come with you?<eos> You don't have to go there alone.<eos> Thanks for coming, Gracie.<eos> And... I'm sorry about your rock collection.<eos> It wasn't really mine anyways.
I was a dancer when I was a kid and I loved it and then this shit thing happened to me and everything changed... until I met you and you inspired me, so I learnt to dance again.<eos> I re-learnt all the old steps.<eos> I tracked down my old teacher, Ron Parfitt who's just...<eos> He's a horrible, horrible human being.<eos> I shaved my chest.<eos> I went to some amazing clubs.<eos> I met some amazing people and now... finally I feel like me again, which is what I always wanted.<eos> You know?<eos> To... feel like myself.<eos> - Yeah, I shaved my chest, and it's very itchy, all the time.
Days.<eos> Lean days.<eos> It's been three months with no profits to speak of and nobody knows what it's all been for because you don't trust them with the truth.<eos> I don't trust them with the truth.<eos> So here we are.<eos> Singleton.<eos> They think he has any idea how to put money in their pockets?<eos> All they know or care about Singleton right now is that he isn't you.<eos> I just need a few more days.<eos> The page is gone. It could be anywhere.
- Jack.<eos> The very man.<eos> Just checking on that case of whisky you promised.<eos> Is later alright, mate?<eos> I'm just heading out.<eos> Yeah. Long as it's not too much later.<eos> Right?<eos> Give us your car keys.<eos> What's wrong with your car?<eos> It's still at the paint shop.
Hello?<eos> Emergency here.<eos> Which service do you require?<eos> Better send them all.<eos> Hogan!<eos> Hogan?<eos> You put Alice on the machine?<eos> I was trying to help her.<eos> I thought if she saw a better side of herself-<eos> I've seen that better side, Hogan, and it isn't pretty.
They are what you might call a recruitment agency.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> A recruitment agency for what?<eos> For people with exceptional abilities.<eos> People like yourself.<eos> People without families.<eos> Without husbands and wives and children.<eos> No past.<eos> No ties to the future.<eos> You see, the work we do is complicated and it requires employees with advanced motor skills, remarkable memories.
Hippy bullshit.<eos> It's easier to hate than to love, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's easier to destroy something.<eos> Kill somebody.<eos> You think you could do that?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I see it in your eyes, too.<eos> That bitterness.<eos> It can take over.
Pray to God that all will be forgiven.<eos> Go away now.<eos> Try to smile as you leave.<eos> Avoid... shattered memories.<eos> The police are coming. You must leave.<eos> Words.<eos> I don't want to hear about them.<eos> No nudity in nature.<eos> Animals are not naked because they are naked.<eos> Now that I have seen war, I know that if it ended, everyone would ask: what do we do with the bodies?
Words.<eos> I don't want to hear about them.<eos> No nudity in nature.<eos> Animals are not naked because they are naked.<eos> Now that I have seen war, I know that if it ended, everyone would ask: what do we do with the bodies?<eos> Perhaps only for them is the war over.<eos> A philosopher is worried by others' existence, perceiving the revolutionary force of signs.<eos> The water spoke to him in a deep, serious voice.<eos> So Roxy began to think.<eos> It is trying to talk to me, as it has always tried to speak to people over the ages.

How old are you now?<eos> You know how they say all the greats die at 27?<eos> No.<eos> I'm 28.<eos> Sorry about your girlfriend leaving.<eos> I don't know how I came to this.<eos> She told me I lost myself in her.<eos> She needed space.<eos> I wanna tell you a story.<eos> It's about...
Stop it.<eos> Get your hands off the glass.<eos> Stop it.<eos> No.<eos> I can see it!<eos> It's right there.<eos> Hands off the glass.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Give me my car.<eos> It's right there.
My other piece, where is it located?<eos> - We placed it in the anteroom.<eos> - The anteroom.<eos> - Mr Carew!<eos> - Turner!<eos> - Stanny.<eos> - Hello, Mr Turner, sir.<eos> - Is it for His Majesty?<eos> - Indeed.<eos> - I hope it meets his expectations.
I do thank ye, Doctor.<eos> Let me show ye out.<eos> - Good day to you, Mrs Booth.<eos> - Good day to you, sir.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Mr Turner.<eos> My father and I are marvelling at this glorious work.<eos> Er... might I be correct in remembering that we had the good fortune of viewing it at the Academy last summer?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Well, I must say, it is no less impressive on its second viewing.

Typhus epidemic amongst the cargo, slaves die on board, no insurance.<eos> Sling 'em in the drink, drowned dead, cash.<eos> I am struck by the column of bright white, placed precisely off centre here, applied over the darkened background, impasto, contrasting with the scarlet and ochre hues in the upper left corner, which in turn contrasts with the presence of God,<eos> revealing to us that hope exists even in the most turbulent and illimitable of deaths.<eos> Bluebottles.<eos> - Eh?<eos> - Up in the muslin.<eos> Knock 'em out.<eos> Well, I didn't put 'em there.<eos> Would it not sit splendidly above the fireplace in the library, Father?
Correction, it's a tie.<eos> Let's just say, you're the Tinker Bell of Dust Keepers.<eos> But why do you say it like it's a bad thing?<eos> Because we don't work with twigs and acorn caps.<eos> We work with pixie dust.<eos> It's our lifeblood.<eos> There's no room for error.<eos> Blue dust.<eos> One of nature's mightiest multipliers.<eos> It takes the golden dust from a trickle to a roar.
Okay, but if there's blue dust, why can't there be other colors?<eos> Because there aren't.<eos> And maybe those other colors do other things.<eos> What if there was, I don't know, purple?<eos> What if there's pink?<eos> The day someone finds pink pixie dust is the day I trade in my kilt for trousers.<eos> Well, what if we don't find it? What if we make it?<eos> Listen carefully, Zarina.<eos> We do not tamper with pixie dust.<eos> It is far too powerful.

Well, we have to rescue her.<eos> But they're...<eos> Deep breaths.<eos> Deep breaths.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Magnificent!<eos> - Quite right.<eos> A fine haul.<eos> We got their blue dust!<eos> Well, it's not theirs anymore.
- Good luck!<eos> - Where you going?<eos> Hold on, Charlie.<eos> I'll call you back!<eos> Wait!<eos> - Stretch!<eos> - Hey, man, where you going?<eos> Bro, this car is dead.<eos> - Can you help me push, please?<eos> - No, it's not going anywhere.
Are you going to do that?<eos> I ask the question purely academically, but you know, what could be the spine to that story?<eos> Well, I always thought Paradise Misplaced was about second chances and how it's never too late to redeem yourself and to start over again.<eos> Interesting, Miss Carpenter, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm sorry, I just had an unrelated thought.<eos> - Maybe instead of going to Hell this time, they go into space.<eos> OK, yeah.<eos> I think I see where you're going with that one.<eos> It needs a love story.<eos> It should be in 3-D.
So, the ahi tuna actually sounded delicious.<eos> And I will have a glass of Chardonnay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like to see ID?<eos> Hey, I'm driving you home.<eos> Wow, this is a full-service restaurant.<eos> Well, you had two glasses and you had two at the bar and if you die, I don't get to take your course and it's going to screw up my whole schedule.<eos> What about my car?<eos> It's a Hyundai.<eos> It'll be there in the morning.
But look, you do have a roof over your head and you have some money coming in...<eos> And you must be teaching those kids something because I love that script you sent me from that boy in your class.<eos> That's good.<eos> You should call him.<eos> You should call him and tell him.<eos> You sure that's OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm glad someone's career is alive.<eos> Your career is alive.<eos> It's just, you know, dormant right now.
PUBLISHER PUBLISHED MY BOOKS<eos> I'm back.<eos> Tonight I'd like to take a look at what actually constitutes a performative contradiction to normative repetitive actions in the enactment of gender-specific identities...<eos> So I got almost two-thirds wrong.<eos> Well...<eos> You have to deduce logically what other people grasp intuitively.<eos> And how do other people do it?<eos> You do it, too.<eos> But you do it in other areas, your procedural memory, for example.<eos> It's responsible for physical procedures.
Yeah of course I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I'll get this.<eos> No, no let me get this, please.<eos> This was my idea.<eos> You can get the next one.<eos> Alright.<eos> I like your hat, by the way.<eos> Thank you!<eos> It's new.
Tell me about it.<eos> Scissors?<eos> Last blood pressure was 105 by palp.<eos> Okay, I'll expose the wound.<eos> Alex?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Hey, someone want to relieve me of this thing?<eos> It kills!
Well, if he's not seeing his patients, I'm his department head. I could talk to him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Gavin: Dr. Dey. - [sighs]<eos> Thanks for sharing an office with me.<eos> Don't you ever knock?<eos> No.<eos> You a vegetarian?<eos> - No.<eos> - Your washing machine broken?<eos> No, it works fine, thank you.
I mean...<eos> I'm in love with a gay man.<eos> And I ruined my brother's life.<eos> God, I'm a study in tragedy.<eos> You are so young.<eos> There's gonna be plenty...<eos> A few quality boys in your future.<eos> It's not puppy love.<eos> I hate that.<eos> It's real.
I appreciate it.<eos> Okay, that's fine.<eos> But life is short.<eos> A lot of people are fond of saying that.<eos> Life is short.<eos> And it is.<eos> Life is short if, uh, you're a child who died.<eos> But it's... it's not.<eos> At 46 it's not short anymore.<eos> It's long, man...
Come see me when you have something fun like a blood disease. That's what I went to school for.<eos> Okay, I think I got it. All right.<eos> Thank you very much. Bad back, huh?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I guess there's no cure.<eos> Want to know what I do?<eos> My back always hurts because of this chair.<eos> This really works.<eos> You just rub it all over your upper back, lower, wherever you can reach.<eos> Yeah, life is long and then it's over.
I don't care.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was just... You know, before you come tomorrow night.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I'm going to destroy your play.<eos> But you didn't even see it.<eos> Um, you know, did I do something to offend you?<eos> Actually, you did.<eos> You occupied a theater which might have been used on something worthwhile.<eos> Okay. But you don't even know if it's any good or not.
They're lighting candles for him in Central Park.<eos> Turn on the TV.<eos> A vigil for actor Riggan Thomson.<eos> They're praying for him all over the country.<eos> He did it.<eos> You did it!<eos> I've been reborn, brother.<eos> And I can see the future.<eos> This play is going to last forever.<eos> It's going to open in London, Paris.
He's dumb but he's not stupid.<eos> At the end of the day, he wants a career, as dumb as he is. Fudd has a chance of getting put back in, so why would he jeopardise that?<eos> -I need to look at the music.<eos> -It's right here.<eos> -Why isn't it on you?<eos> -Where's the folder? -You're joking.<eos> You're fucking around?<eos> -No--<eos> I swear I had it here two seconds ago.<eos> It's gotta be around here. -Did you see--?
- The trophy? - Yeah.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I've been looking for a way to tell my father I kind of hate basketball.<eos> Go to town!<eos> Always!<eos> An Imperial Affliction. Yes.<eos> I'm so glad that you liked it.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> But the ending. I know.<eos> It is rather abrupt.
I think you're right.<eos> Meaza, come in!<eos> You've grown thin.<eos> Are you eating enough?<eos> Enough to survive.<eos> - I'm hungry!<eos> Let's eat?<eos> - Ok.<eos> How is work?<eos> I have to say, it's different from working for you.
The past is history.<eos> Our task is to suppress nature to our will, according to the present plans.<eos> But, monsieur, the money being spent.<eos> The aqueduct will carry sufficient water to the gardens of Versailles because it must.<eos> That is your brief.<eos> Madame?<eos> It is essentially your plan, number six in your submission, I believe.<eos> This part is entirely original to myself.<eos> You see?<eos> It fits onto this end of your plan.
- Yeah. I bet you do.<eos> "Jackinoffsky."<eos> Loser.<eos> You gotta give me a little more room, man.<eos> You gotta give me room.<eos> - You've got plenty of room.<eos> - No, my Wiener is right on the bar.<eos> My vvienefis on the bar, and I dorft Want yourvviener near my butt-<eos> My vvienefis not near your butt.<eos> I know, but if it cloes, like, it's just gonna ruin it all.
Had a place couple streets down.<eos> They moved out, though.<eos> COHLE:<eos> Do you know the Fontenot girl, one went missing?<eos> MAN: Her?<eos> Her family come to our service once or twice, 5 or 6 years back.<eos> Is that the girl?<eos> Oh, Lord.<eos> HART:<eos> No, sir, it's not.
COHLE: Well, that's good.<eos> You don't want to shoot people.<eos> But you have.<eos> Marty says you're from Texas. Yes, south Texas. COHLE:<eos> Narcotics, mostly.<eos> Um... was on the Robbery Squad in Houston until '89.<eos> [Pager buzzing] Ahem. Oh. Be right back.<eos> Y'all keep eating.<eos> Do you like your job?<eos> Not exactly, but it's worthwhile.
She knows what she's doing.<eos> Eating here?<eos> No.<eos> I'm seeing Noémie.<eos> There's chicken in the fridge. - Yeah?<eos> - By the way...<eos> Noémie told me about your brief liaison.<eos> It's kind of a funny coincidence, no?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It isn't a problem for me.
It looked like he was burned.<eos> Yeah, I don't know about that.<eos> I mean, did you see his suit?<eos> It was fine. It wasn't even touched.<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> I mean, you read his journal.<eos> He broke the cardinal rule.<eos> You don't fuck with time.<eos> Jasper, please take his hat off.<eos> It's my thinking cap.
Gates: Singleton, he has the votes to remove you as captain.<eos> They think he has any idea how to put money in their pockets?<eos> Landfall.<eos> We're home.<eos> - Silver: Is this English soil?<eos> - Logan: It was once.<eos> - Whose is it?
It's old news.<eos> Besides, we really never knew anything about that old tablet.<eos> We just worked there.<eos> Something's up with it.<eos> I told you, I can't help you.<eos> Maybe this kid can.<eos> Maybe we'd better talk alone.<eos> Expedition like that is a pretty amazing thing... for a 12-year-old boy.<eos> I tried to move on... but there was something about that tablet.<eos> It's turning green, like some sort of corrosion.
It's almost a shame to harvest it.<eos> What'd your father say about all this?<eos> Probably wouldn't say anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But he'd probably be thinking you're alright.<eos> Really?<eos> Flem, you ride on back.<eos> I'll see you when we're through.<eos> Why are you talking about my land?<eos> It's not your land, boy.
Maybe see why.<eos> Calvin, please come to the showroom.<eos> Calvin, please come to the showroom.<eos> We're getting on the body work tout suite.<eos> It shall be tip top.<eos> Excuse me a moment.<eos> This is a machine, the Simulit Shadow.<eos> Look at that, in very good work...<eos> The machine hurt?<eos> No, I'm just thinking it knows how hard the work's gonna be around here.
Quote from Corinthians.<eos> "The body is not one member, but many."<eos> "Now are they many, but... of one body."<eos> What's that mean, though?<eos> I was just trying to stay a part of the body now. Heh!<eos> The fishing pole's not working.<eos> - Just ask Grandpa.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Grandpa, I can't tell if it's working.
"Now are they many, but... of one body."<eos> What's that mean, though?<eos> I was just trying to stay a part of the body now. Heh!<eos> The fishing pole's not working.<eos> - Just ask Grandpa.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Grandpa, I can't tell if it's working.<eos> You'll know, honey.<eos> It'll yank at you hard.
You need to give her more time.<eos> You will replace this chip with the one that works.<eos> You don't have that chip.<eos> I will shortly.<eos> What am I doing in a safe house? I'm pulling you out. You're what?<eos> !<eos> In the last 24 hours, you almost got yourself killed twice.<eos> That's the job. The F-35's the most expensive airplane ever built.<eos> The first thing they did was throw it in a war zone.<eos> This thing in my head may be valuable, but you don't want it sitting in a hangar.
I've been out with those girls.<eos> And you are so much better.<eos> - Hmm. - You're gorgeous.<eos> Everything you've just said is bollocks.<eos> Or to put it another way?<eos> Woolly liberal bollocks.<eos> Sorry, but calling the Beveridge Report "a wholly positive force"...<eos> The NHS and the welfare state were founded on the post-war re-evaluation of society.<eos> Which your essay suggests is some kind of socialist utopia!<eos> I'm just saying, the culture of dependency it fostered...
Granddad's Viking brooch.<eos> We put it on the raft.<eos> All Vikings went to Valhalla with their treasure.<eos> You morons!<eos> Well, that's just rude.<eos> You, stupid, stupid little...<eos> - Whoa, whoa, enough!<eos> - They've destroyed a family heirloom.<eos> - Dad found it.<eos> - It's worth £15,000.
So what'd you do?<eos> I was angry, and, um... I started shouting at him through the door.<eos> I called him a coward.<eos> Was there an answer?<eos> No.<eos> And it made me angrier.<eos> The fact that he was ignoring me.<eos> So I went round the back.<eos> I knocked on the back door.<eos> When I hit it, it swung open.
So the chance that I have it wrong is exactly zero.<eos> So based on this indelible memory, you were able to accurately identify the spider tattoo on the shooter of Miss Petrakis as the same tattoo worn by Mr Collard?<eos> That's right.<eos> How many tattoos did the police show you?<eos> Just one.<eos> I drew what I saw and they brought back a photo and I said, 'Yes, that's it.'<eos> So to put it another way, Miss O'Shaughnessy, you never identified Mr Collard as the shooter at all.<eos> You merely identified a tattoo.<eos> Well, the tattoo on his hand.<eos> But was it on his hand?
We'II see.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Enough.<eos> Why turn it off?<eos> Want it back on?<eos> Yes, stop protecting me.<eos> I'm not protecting you.<eos> You are.<eos> You thought the song was too depressing for me.<eos> Well, it's not exactly...
That's the crazy thing.<eos> It is you in there, you know?<eos> What about the physicality... Do you notice any differences?<eos> No.<eos> No, not really.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what, the hair.<eos> There's something about the hair.<eos> The hair?<eos> Mmm-hmm. It's a little different.
Crazy Man taught me it.<eos> He had lots of books. He had lots of them.<eos> And the other books are gone.<eos> Now he's gone, too.<eos> And I don't think he's coming back.<eos> Come on, son.<eos> 'We know he had some trauma to the organ.'<eos> Let me show you.<eos> Here a large haematoma just above the liver.<eos> Now when I examined the liver during the postmortem, it had suffered serious injury.
!<eos> Taylor?<eos> Sir?<eos> I didn't want you.<eos> Not many people do, sir.<eos> But those that do, are satisfied.<eos> PC Ashton's note book?<eos> If there was history between him and Simon Thomas it would be in his note book.<eos> I thought I had them all.<eos> Where is it?
What about Gary?<eos> Yeah, he went there too.<eos> Just...different route.<eos> Did you see him go?<eos> No, but five minutes later he were on the stage.<eos> Five minutes?<eos> Why did you try and check out early?<eos> Gary came to find me, when the staff had heard about the girl... the dead girl.<eos> Well, the music we heard, Gary thought it were a bit odd.<eos> It was too loud, out of character.
I couldn't imagine life out of this uniform.<eos> I suppose, given the circumstances, I don't have to.<eos> When so many want you dead, it hardly seems good manners to argue.<eos> Whatever you're doing in there, James, stop it, right now!<eos> I will kick this door down!<eos> Mr Holmes, you and I are similar, I think.<eos> Yes, I think we are.<eos> There's a proper time to die, isn't there?<eos> Of course there is.<eos> And one should embrace it when it comes.
Nicked it yesterday.<eos> Only gets us as far as the canteen.<eos> If I was to use this card on that lift now, what happens?<eos> Well, the alarms would go off and you'd be dragged away by security.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Get taken to a small room somewhere and your head kicked in.<eos> Do we really need so much colour?<eos> It passes the time.<eos> But if I do this...<eos> If you press a keycard against your mobile phone for long enough, it corrupts the magnetic strip.

She's Daddy's cleaner.<eos> I asked her to come and serve drinks but she thinks she's a guest.<eos> That is hilar!<eos> You've got to tell her.<eos> I can't now.<eos> She's all dressed up.<eos> Dressed up?<eos> She looks like Feed The Birds.<eos> There's a sandwich man at work who wears a yellow T-shirt.<eos> It's a jersey but it's T-shirt material, and all the girls call him Mustard Mike.
Shh.<eos> That's what I was trying to do, sweetheart.<eos> - Shh. - Those men, I paid them.<eos> - I know.<eos> - They were actors.<eos> They were meant to hit me with a fake bottle.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did they use a real bottle?<eos> - I-I don't...<eos> - It should have been fake.
They said if you don't stop drinking, you're gonna die.<eos> So I'm just supposed to stop drinking so that you don't feel guilty?<eos> You're supposed to stop drinking because you have children at home who love you.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> Then I would know what I've always feared is true, that you don't give a shit about any of us.<eos> Hey, Carl.<eos> Carl, hey.<eos> You got any bears stuff I can wear to the game today, like a hat or a Jersey or something?<eos> I got a "Fuck Jay Cutler" T-shirt.<eos> It might have blood on it, though.
That would be a "D".<eos> Yeah, no, thanks, I get that.<eos> Um, but why?<eos> I mean, I misspelled Tennyson or something?<eos> Uh, yeah, I remember this one.<eos> I graded it.<eos> Oh, you... you graded it, not the Professor?<eos> Tenured professors don't grade freshman class survey papers.<eos> Okay, so if you graded it, what was wrong with it?<eos> Uh, it sucked.
It's how you stay in contact with me and the command center.<eos> - All radio communication should be done using call signs.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Dave, you are "dung beetle,"<eos> - What?<eos> - And Aaron, you are "aardvark."<eos> I can't even carry this thing!<eos> What do you mean you can't carry it?<eos> Aerodynamics are all off.<eos> It's hitting my leg.

In these times of great stress, do you do karaoke?<eos> Yes, I do, Dave.<eos> I believe that it is important for those in power to remain in touch with the beauty in life.<eos> You are also a very accomplished painter, aren't you?<eos> Well, how can I not be?<eos> He's reading the scripted questions.<eos> He lulls them and then he gets them.<eos> It's his technique.<eos> The beauty guides you.<eos> It guides my hand.
Open the door, Audrey.<eos> Audrey, it's just you and me, honey.<eos> See... you need to tell me what's going on.<eos> Audrey, open the door, please.<eos> Years.<eos> You ever heard of something called the M-brane theory, detectives?<eos> No.<eos> That's over my head.<eos> It's like in this universe, we process time linearly forward... but outside of our spacetime, from what would be a fourth-dimensional perspective, time wouldn't exist, and from that vantage, could we attain it... we'd see... our spacetime would look flattened,<eos> like a single sculpture with matter in a superposition of every place it ever occupied, our sentience just cycling through our lives like carts on a track.
Look at the ceiling.<eos> Fitzie, turn off your light.<eos> Look at the ceiling.<eos> In between the hieroglyphs, all those dots.<eos> That's the star map!<eos> So what exactly are we looking for?<eos> The tetrahedron.<eos> The three-sided pyramid is also the hieroglyphic symbol for the Sirius star.<eos> Look!<eos> There it is.

- Who is this?<eos> I'm a lineman in your California division.<eos> Let's leave it at that.<eos> They tell me it's orders from the Unification Board... and to mind my own damn business.<eos> What's your name?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I'm outta here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Wait!<eos> Thompson's PR people were heavily promoting his big speech, predicting it would be the most-watched broadcast in history.
Yeah, see you around.<eos> Bugger.<eos> Nikki?<eos> Nikki, have you seen this press release?<eos> I saw it.<eos> CHAIR SQUEAKS<eos> Is it wrong to like things that are familiar?<eos> It's not wrong, is it?<eos> My life has too many moving parts.<eos> It squeaks.
- Esben knocked his glass off the table.<eos> - Did he? Then you'll have to clean up, boy.<eos> Now.<eos> Do you want some?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> How are things with your mom?<eos> She's fine.<eos> There, there. Easy, easy.<eos> Oh my! I think we caught ourselves a lobster.<eos> - Is it a lobster?
So I bought the boys a round with the pesos, traded the pocket watch for a bit of tail, and spent two weeks that winter in New York trying to deliver that fucking letter to his sister.<eos> Looked high and low.<eos> Never found her.<eos> So on the way home, I waited till we were in open water and I could see no land in any direction, and I dropped it over the side.<eos> Returned to the sea.<eos> There are no legacies in this life, are there?<eos> No monuments.<eos> No history.<eos> Just the water.<eos> It pays us and then it claims us.
Spend your life keeping the devil in the bottle?<eos> Robbie said he was into photography, black and white.<eos> Arty stuff.<eos> He said he wanted a few keepsakes, so... I gave him my old camera.<eos> Ros lent us her penthouse, her love nest as she calls it, not that I think it's ever seen much love.<eos> When he stopped returning my calls, I got scared.<eos> I knew he'd want money and gifts.<eos> Price you're paying for dirty little secrets.<eos> When I'd heard he'd died, it felt like a reprieve.<eos> All I could think of was getting hold of that red book before it fell into the wrong hands.
Bargaining chip, I suppose, in case the Cundalls went after him.<eos> The press conference is tomorrow morning.<eos> After the report is handed down, he'll have nothing to bargain with.<eos> Well, that's right.<eos> They'll be under arrest or in jail, and he'll be free.<eos> The book won't mean anything to him. The bloody book is still out there!<eos> If Pat and Ellie find out about this, it'll break them.<eos> Judicial Inquiries,<eos> Royal Commissions, where the shit interfaces with the fan.<eos> Until that book is destroyed, it's going to hang over my head like a sword of Damocles.
Spirit?<eos> Signal us once for "Yes."<eos> Twice for "No."<eos> Harry, are you okay?<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Spirit, if you can hear me, give me a sign.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I mean, damn it, Stanley, we've both done levitations.<eos> I once raised a real tiger, but we both have our tricks.<eos> There was nothing supporting this candle, no threads, no wires, it was floating until I brought it down.
- All right.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> You'll break it, you'll break it...<eos> It's lightning, it's lightning.<eos> We'll be killed.<eos> - There must be a catch somewhere. - What do we do?<eos> - Get under the car!<eos> - God, I don't want to go under the car!<eos> It's fine.<eos> It's on four rubber wheels!
Who Means my happiness Who<eos> Would I answer yes to<eos> Well, you ought to guess who Who?<eos> No one, but you<eos> Penny for your thoughts.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Well, you know what my thoughts are?<eos> I've already told you I want to marry you.<eos> That we'll get married at summer's end at the Donaldsons' yacht.<eos> It's enormous, and it can accommodate all the guests we'd want to have.
And when Sophie excused herself at my aunt's to make a telephone call, she called you and you fed her information about my aunt.<eos> At first, I couldn't believe you would betray me like that.<eos> But, as you know, I am a misanthrope.<eos> And that people do unconscionable things does not run counter to my normal view of humanity.<eos> As boys, we both chose magic as our calling.<eos> We both practiced day and night, I as much as you.<eos> My skill was the equal of yours, and yet, you emerged onto the world stage as the great artist.<eos> But it wasn't fair.<eos> Life's not fair, Howard.<eos> In fact, as a general rule, as I've often said, it's pretty nasty.
Are you one of Emily's friends?<eos> This sounds like one of her silly jokes.<eos> Is she there with you?<eos> No, I'm all on my own.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I just told you.<eos> Lucy, right?<eos> Yes, sorry.<eos> I read your theory on the use of the brain's capacity.<eos> It's a little rudimentary, but you're on the right track.
- That'll be a dollar. - Oh.<eos> Of course.<eos> Where is the dairy farm located?<eos> Take a left, about two miles down the road.<eos> Can't miss it.<eos> - We'll have them through in a moment.<eos> - Oh. Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Is this the dairy farm?<eos> Indeed, it is.
Luck, I guess.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, while you had your wife, I had my son.<eos> And believe me, you had a far better deal.<eos> And then you left.<eos> And the way you got out, lying to yourself that the past held no sway over the future.<eos> But in the end, a lot of us are rewarded for our misdeeds, which is why God took your wife<eos> and unleashed you upon me.<eos> This life follows you.<eos> It clings to you, infecting everyone who comes close to you.
Yeah.<eos> Frankie, do you have any idea, how handsome you are?<eos> If I were 20 years younger and not your mom...<eos> I made it weird, didn't I?<eos> Yep, a little bit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, Mom, uh, thank you so much for all the new school clothes, but I'm not so sure if this shirt is me.<eos> It's got two sleeves and a neck hole.<eos> It's you.<eos> Listen, honey, that shirt is heat-sensitive, it changes colors.
♪ whatever the hell we want ♪<eos> Rain!<eos> Real rain!<eos> Check it out!<eos> It's water!<eos> We need to collect this.<eos> Whatever the hell you want.<eos> 10 more, one after the next.<eos> Abby, look at plasma osmolarity.<eos> It's going up across the board.
I need your help.<eos> - The operative that killed your agent was sent by Navarro.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Navarro and the killer were in the same covert unit together.<eos> He was his handler.<eos> Why would Navarro want Jordan killed?<eos> Before I could confront him, he took off with the override device.<eos> Kate, this thing is more dangerous than we thought.<eos> It's not restricted to drones.<eos> It can access multiple weapon systems.
Maybe because we had the babies.<eos> It's a beautiful last line to end on.<eos> "The sky out of my window has gone real blue now."<eos> The sky in Brighton is unlike anything I've ever seen.<eos> Living by the sea, looking out my windows, I feel like I'm part of the weather itself.<eos> Sometimes the sky is so blue and the reflection of the sea so dazzling you can't even look at it, and other times, great black thunderheads roll across the ocean and you feel like you're inside the storm itself.<eos> What I fear most is nature.<eos> Now that it's sent its weather to exact revenge, we're all in for it now.<eos> Soon the weather is gonna put on a real show.<eos> Funnily enough, the more I write about the weather, the worse it seems to get and the more interesting it becomes and the more it moulds itself to the narrative I have set for it.
Exactly, no one.<eos> If you have a girlfriend and get driving herein she finds you great.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - I'm at work, I can not.<eos> Then time.<eos> We should go.<eos> Jiffy.<eos> Burnell, take over, I'm back.<eos> Who steals a yellow car now?<eos> It is well with my green jacket.
See, this is what I needed.<eos> Some alone time with you.<eos> What is it?<eos> We have to go back right away.<eos> In the tradition of Pack members before us, and Pack members that will follow, we come together today to bid farewell to one of our own.<eos> Pete, uh... was one of a kind.<eos> He squeezed the most out of life every day and night.<eos> We were blessed to be your family.<eos> I have so many... wonderful memories of Pete.<eos> This life, it... hasn't always been easy for me, but... somehow Pete always knew the right thing to say to get me through.
You looking for my sister?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's out back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, Ninja caught a rat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A big one.<eos> That's great.<eos> Yeah, it's in the barn.
Oh, can you tell me if the building association will let me see patients here?<eos> What kind of patients?<eos> I'm a psychotherapist.<eos> You've come to the right place.<eos> And this wall. What does this wall do?<eos> Hold up the ceiling maybe?<eos> Thanks.<eos> See if we can take down this bedroom wall.<eos> Open it up a bit.<eos> God knows it needs it.
Yeah.<eos> But not right now.<eos> I've got too many other responsibilities.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Studies have shown that having a larger orbitoprefrontal cortex correlates to having more friends, which proves once and for all that... size matters.<eos> That's not all that matters.<eos> What kind of friends are we talking about?<eos> Work friends, Internet friends... friends with benefits?<eos> Friends who put up with your garbage or a best friend?<eos> Common sense tells us that the more you nurture a friendship, the deeper it grows.
- Yeah.<eos> Why's it called that anyway?<eos> Uh, the local tribes called it that because when the trail ends it circles around this really small lake.<eos> And the earth around the lake is black.<eos> So when they hunted they followed animal tracks in the black earth and called it Blackfoot Trail.<eos> So what's the lake called?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> No, no, no, picture it, picture it, picture it, alright?<eos> You come up this steep rocky trail and then all of a sudden it levels off and it's this beautiful, pristine lake.
God gave you life, not man.<eos> It is your Christian duty to live this life to its fullest.<eos> Was it an attempt on my life?<eos> The young woman merely wanted to present this petition to the Queen.<eos> To me?<eos> Why?<eos> She was an orphan from a humble background.<eos> It has something to do with a plea for women's education.<eos> If she was an illiterate orphan, she could not have written this.<eos> It is misguided, but not unintelligent.
Look at the right sleeve.<eos> It has a blood stain down by the cuff.<eos> - I panicked.<eos> - What?<eos> I-I went to... room 1044.<eos> I... I waited.<eos> Jimmy didn't show.<eos> - That's...<eos> - Let me finish!<eos> The thing about a violent temper is that when it comes out, it doesn't care who it goes for.
I got to room 1044.<eos> The door was open. It...<eos> it didn't seem right.<eos> I looked inside.<eos> There was a body.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> I went inside.<eos> My training kicked in.<eos> I felt for a pulse.<eos> The blood - that's how it got on the sleeve.
You think two divorced people can keep a little secret?<eos> Katie only told me what dad did years later.<eos> Like I said, he never lied, but he did trick us a lot.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look who I found.<eos> [Dog whines] Damn it!<eos> Come on.<eos> When people say "seeing-eye dog," they're wrong.<eos> The dog doesn't see for you.<eos> It guides you safely in the direction you're supposed to be heading.
Hell, purgatory, heaven.<eos> Happy ending.<eos> It's perfect, really.<eos> Are you being serious?<eos> Dante was in love with a beautiful Beatrice, and then she died.<eos> Heartbroken, he goes in search of her, but he also goes in search of a meaning to life and death.<eos> Listen, Caroline's commissioned you to make a true crime thriller.<eos> Are you really saying you're trying to write a medieval morality tale?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It would be modern.
- He'll be fine. He'll be fine.<eos> - Oops. Sorry.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Allowing us to predict that some particles can, in fact, escape a black hole.<eos> So, black holes are not, in fact, black at all, but glow with heat radiation.<eos> The steady emission of heat energy causes the black holes to lose mass and eventually they disappear in a spectacular explosion.<eos> It's very, very simple, in the way that a body loses heat.<eos> - Second law of thermodynamics.<eos> - Right, it's thermodynamics.<eos> If we can imagine that a black hole is, indeed, losing particles and over time, will diminish in size, it will evaporate, it will...
You're not supposed to be helping me. I thought...<eos> I thought I was the enemy.<eos> Perhaps I'm deliberately deceiving you.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Maybe you are.<eos> See you.<eos> Marguerite!<eos> Marguerite, you know, the sweet corn from the market?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm finding it quite tough, dense.
You know they hate us.<eos> Aren't you angry?<eos> No.<eos> We're not visitors anymore, Mahira.<eos> This time we will not run.<eos> You know what they say.<eos> If you can't beat them, join them.<eos> I can clean my own wall.<eos> The outer wall is not your wall.<eos> Technically, it belongs to the village.
Papa?<eos> You know, I, hear she's a wonderful dancer.<eos> - You like to dance, too, no? - Look.<eos> You should take her dancing.<eos> Don't be absurd.<eos> We are not children.<eos> If you say so.<eos> So, Hassan?<eos> What's a Michelin star?<eos> - What does it look like? - They're like...
Should I put it back?<eos> With champagne, that is not possible.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's better.<eos> We did it.<eos> We did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The star is for all of us.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's for you.
I'm the one who's gonna get inrole.<eos> I don't need you to protect me.<eos> I'd know that 'tude anywhere.<eos> Fixed it.<eos> It's the music box.<eos> It worked.<eos> Claire took us here.<eos> Claire, that thing's bad.<eos> You should put it down.<eos> No, it's not bad, Claudia.

Mr. Gray.<eos> Do you have plans for dinner?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> My young friend.<eos> Professor Van Helsing.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Oh, I have known my great love.<eos> My Hannah, God bless her. And you?<eos> I was cursed with poetry very young.<eos> It creates extremely unrealistic expectations.
For the dead travel fast.<eos> It's not her.<eos> She must be here somewhere.<eos> Why have you told me this?<eos> Because you would have come to the same place without me.<eos> - And then?<eos> - You would have pursued it.<eos> And that I would have had to prevent.<eos> If I had a son I would wish him a long and easy life.<eos> I think your life will not be easy, but it should be long.
My God.<eos> What's happening?<eos> There is no real name for the interdiction.<eos> Immodestly, I confess I invented the solution that makes it visible to us, so I named it after my late wife.<eos> That is Hannah's Wink.<eos> This blood contains a unique property that prevents coagulation completely.<eos> To what end?<eos> Does it have to have an end?<eos> Nature does not create such rare occurrences with no purpose.<eos> Well, if one had to give a purpose to it, it would assist with hematophagy.
The moon.<eos> Whatever they thought important enough to, uh... remember.<eos> Why do you like them?<eos> They're primitive.<eos> No.<eos> They're honest.<eos> Can art be honest?<eos> You're the expert there.<eos> I think music can.<eos> Perhaps only music, because it's ephemeral.
How dare you speak to me of shame?<eos> Get upstairs yourself and make amends to my father.<eos> I have to see her.<eos> To do what?<eos> Make this right.<eos> I always thought my traveling would kill my family.<eos> Being away so long.<eos> My thoughtlessness...<eos> I never imagined it would be a cruel little girl.<eos> When the illness came, it was absolute.
To do what?<eos> Make this right.<eos> I always thought my traveling would kill my family.<eos> Being away so long.<eos> My thoughtlessness...<eos> I never imagined it would be a cruel little girl.<eos> When the illness came, it was absolute.<eos> I was aware of almost nothing.<eos> The doctors were at a loss to explain it.<eos> Because, you see, it was inexplicable.
Nothing I would say would come as a surprise.<eos> So you simply want the satisfaction of hearing me say it.<eos> Very well.<eos> I would sacrifice you to save my daughter.<eos> I would choose her over you.<eos> I might even hope I get the chance.<eos> But until then, you are invaluable to me.<eos> Your connection to Mina is my lifeline, so I must keep you alive.<eos> I put the photograph in the drawer because I couldn't bear it.<eos> It broke my heart.
It broke my heart.<eos> Not a young girl's heart, Vanessa.<eos> A man's heart.<eos> You must handle your guilt on your own.<eos> I'll not help you.<eos> Neither of us is free from guilt.<eos> Yes, but you want to be.<eos> That's the difference between us.<eos> Then you should put the picture back.<eos> Let it break your heart.
Do you have the new harry potter book?<eos> No.<eos> This is not the new harry potter book.<eos> This is the old one.<eos> I already read this one.<eos> I want the last book.<eos> Which one's that?<eos> The last book?<eos> It's, you know... you... you see that book there?<eos> It has no cover on it, huh?

He's... busy with other matters.<eos> Thanks for the flowers.<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Well, it was worth a try.<eos> He's a fucking prick.<eos> You want something to eat?<eos> No, I'm not hungry.<eos> Can I borrow the car again?<eos> Please.<eos> It's on the street.
God knows, it was coming.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> There were many occasions when I had to go up to the hide to fetch him when he was half-cut... cos he'd sloped off for a session.<eos> So, you knew he drank, then?<eos> When he first arrived, he played the Oxford golden boy to a tee.<eos> After a while, I got to know him.<eos> I saw a different side to him.<eos> Which was what?<eos> Crippling self-doubt about the work.<eos> "Is it good enough?
Anna had her head in the sand about the whole thing.<eos> You're not thinking I had something to do with her death?<eos> -I never said that. -Jimmy...<eos> You really think I could do something like that?<eos> I don't think anything of the sort.<eos> I'll tell you this, though.<eos> It's not just Anna Blake who could stick her head in the sand.<eos> -Tosh?<eos> -I've just had a thought.<eos> I'm not sure if it's a good thought, but it's a thought.
17 is young...to be living alone.<eos> Is that a question?<eos> No. I mean, it's a lot of freedom, nobody asking where you're going, what you're doing, when are you going to be home.<eos> Do you know what she did with it?<eos> She went out.<eos> Not so much.<eos> She liked her own company.<eos> You know, I went to that school.<eos> From Fair Isle.<eos> It was right cliquey.
Seat belts.<eos> - All clear!<eos> - All clear.<eos> - All clear.<eos> - All clear.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, it's moving.<eos> We're moving.<eos> This thing must be, like, a bazillion pounds.<eos> How's it gonna fly?
I haven't thought much about the group.<eos> That's good to hear.<eos> But when you left I didn't know what to do.<eos> And I started praying in there.<eos> I started to pray, and then... prayer turned to meditation and...<eos> You can tell me.<eos> I imagined myself...<eos> I imagined myself stepping outside of Claire's body And being able to see in a way I've never seen before.<eos> Something told me to walk through the bathroom door, So I did.<eos> It opened?
Well done!<eos> Goodness!<eos> I certainly feel as though I've earned my spurs!<eos> We've only cycled half a mile.<eos> And that was just the warm-up.<eos> We'll call in on Joan Rickart first.<eos> She lives at number nine.<eos> What's that smell?<eos> It's the communal lavatory.<eos> Is it broken?
"Snozzberry?<eos> Who's ever heard of a snozzberry?"<eos> "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of the dreams."<eos> I can't believe they remade it.<eos> - That's what I'm talking about.<eos> - Hey, sorry.<eos> - It's time for us to go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> By the way, have you seen my notebook?<eos> It's a big, blue thing.
Like, really knew him.<eos> He came to your birthday party, et cetera.<eos> He wasn't invited to my birthday party.<eos> What?<eos> I think Adam's feeling is that you're callous and disconnected.<eos> Are you feeling anything?<eos> Yes.<eos> Beyond wondering when your book is gonna hit the stands?<eos> It's an e-book, Adam.<eos> It's never gonna hit the stands 'cause there are no stands and you know that.
I was just showing Herm your, uh, music.<eos> You were showing him my music fail?<eos> - Is that what you guys were doing?<eos> - I think it's great.<eos> You actually have a better understanding of that song than Edie Brickell did.<eos> - Oh, fuck you, Hermie.<eos> - Hey, come on.<eos> Why would you show him this video, Ray?<eos> Because it's a bold and pioneering form of self-expression.<eos> Brickell sang it with, like, a playful vibe, but it's actually much more severe.

I'm like, "where did my youth go?"<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Hey, do you have someone helping you?<eos> Because opening an art gallery's, like, really hard.<eos> It's a lot harder than anyone thinks, and I feel like I see galleries opening and closing every single day in Bushwick.<eos> Oh, no, mine's in noho.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> You should totally stop by sometime.<eos> I'm really excited for our first show.<eos> It's gonna be super fresh, funky-funny.
Are you watching this, Jason?<eos> I wish we could have met before all of this. I used to play this game with my friend McKee at the mall. We'd see how much free stuff we could get.<eos> Not like shoplifting, just... free samples from the food court and perfumes and stuff, and- just wish we could do stuff like that- normal, ordinary stuff.<eos> ("Fin") And over here we have our resident demonologist, Jason Herowitz. Fuck off, Tim.<eos> ("Fin") Dude, did you steal those from her room'? Go away.<eos> Today is October 15. I got my hands on- [loud bang] I got my hands on this holy water.<eos> (Adam) I pretty much let all my family down. Um, my progression through the years from marijuana, alcohol, hallucinogenics to the harder stuff.<eos> Um, my life became unmanageable. (Eric) When I'm- when I'm high, I, uh- just opens my mind, man. I can write for hours.<eos> (Felice) Either makes it better, or it just numbs you. Like, that's what I used to use when I had sex to numb me out. I don't want to feel shit.<eos> (Julia) It's the pain that's inside. It's eating you. And I hate being here.
The Stein Foundation has to stay intact.<eos> It cannot be compromised.<eos> It already is.<eos> The Israelis will know.<eos> Hamas probably already does.<eos> But the world doesn't.<eos> What's just happened, it can be cauterised.<eos> Cauterised?<eos> That's clinical.<eos> But what that company stands for, what it's trying to do, in the eyes of the world,
And I can link that device to the Americans.<eos> And I can link the Americans to the killing of Samir Meshal.<eos> I just can.<eos> But...as yet I don't have a link for this.<eos> His name's Enad Geffen.<eos> He's Israeli.<eos> He entered this country a month ago on a visitor's permit.<eos> What's the link between Monica Chatwin and the Israelis?<eos> There isn't one.<eos> Except there it is.
And they decide to call a meeting between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government.<eos> And their message is simple.<eos> "Resistance is useless!<eos> Lay down your arms!"<eos> I can't really tell you the detail of what happened next, but basically by the end of it your sympathy was with the aliens.<eos> 29 years ago, my father, Eli Stein, was murdered here in this room.<eos> He was a wonderful father to my brother and me.<eos> But first and foremost, I think it's fair to say, he was a great son of Israel.<eos> He arrived here in Britain in 1939, a refugee and an orphan.<eos> This country took him in, and the protection it offered became the defining experience of his life.
Modeh ani I'faneykha.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I'm safe.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> If it's the price...for a nation.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is your secret safe?<eos> Tell me what it is.
Who?<eos> What happened when you were kidnapped?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What happened to Kasim's father?<eos> You know what happened.<eos> Well, tell me again.<eos> He was driving the car the day we were taken.<eos> He was killed.<eos> The toothbrush wasn't Kasim's.<eos> It was new.
Sookie Stackhouse, you shameful slut.<eos> You killed Jim sure as if you had stabbed him in the heart.<eos> Where'd they take 'em?<eos> Holly and Arlene-- which way did they go?<eos> They went south.<eos> Alcide went after them, and I'm pretty sure Sam did, too.<eos> Miss Daniels, you need to drink my blood.<eos> - I ain't drinking' no vampire blood.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> But you're hurt and it will heal you, I promise.
It's not a joke.<eos> You understand that, don't you?<eos> Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one.<eos> I couldn't--<eos> I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies.<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> You fell in love with a whore.<eos> Yes, I fell in love with a whore.<eos> And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me.<eos> That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted.
- The earthquake?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Earth stage comes first.<eos> Then comes wind, and since each stage is more intense than the last,<eos> Let's just say you'll blow the roof off this place.<eos> The after the wind is water.<eos> Rain, flood.<eos> How bad?<eos> Quite bad actually, but that's not the worst of it.<eos> The last stage is fire, and since it's the last...
Oh. Thanks, Bev.<eos> Tara, I have to leave early.<eos> Can you cover my shift?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you working on so intently?<eos> Uh, nothing.<eos> It's the end of a story.<eos> It's not ready for public consumption yet.
Didn't expect you home yet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Likewise.<eos> Uh, do you have everything you need?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And what doesn't Jason know?<eos> Ken and I are getting a divorce, and I'd like to tell Jason in person.<eos> I go to court next week, and so your father was kind enough to lend me some of his legal expertise.<eos> Well, I should probably get to the post office before it closes.
Well, I texted Travis.<eos> He has a tow truck, and he doesn't know enough to ask questions.<eos> We are about ten minutes away from a complete downpour.<eos> It's Travis.<eos> He can get us, but it'll be two hours.<eos> I'm definitely gonna have to pee before then.<eos> I know a place we can wait.<eos> - Where?<eos> - A cabin.<eos> It's my uncle's.
What'd you do, Frank?<eos> Ray, calm down.<eos> What'd you fucking do?<eos> I'm coming there.<eos> Ray... ?<eos> Ballistics came back.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The fucking ballistics, Ray.<eos> So how'd you fuck it up, Frank?<eos> They pulled the bullet from Avi's chest, and it matched Sully's gun.
Hey.<eos> Put the baby on.<eos> Hello, Lilly.<eos> This is your daddy.<eos> Jules.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Shawn.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Look, it doesn't matter which dispatcher made me promise not tell you that she gave up the crime scene you were working at-- Loretta-- what matters is that our life together starts now.<eos> And if we don't get busy living it, it is gonna pass us by.
We need to get to the Pandalla Canyon, where the gato berry grows.<eos> It's the only thing that can save him now.<eos> - Let's go. - Right.<eos> Stay calm, big brother.<eos> Anne, prop his legs up.<eos> Give him plenty to drink. And make sure he stays awake.<eos> - Your brother can't fall asleep.<eos> - Okay.<eos> The stripe is getting longer and longer.<eos> When it reaches his heart, then...
No, I...<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> I would like to get a drink with you...<eos> If you still want to, 'cause I know I've been really weird tonight...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would like that very much.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> I actually did have gum, but it was my last piece.
Open the bag.<eos> What the hell?<eos> That won't happen again; you have my word.<eos> No, Sarah, it's OK.<eos> I've been around some nasty hot agents, but I've never seen anything like that.<eos> - No one has seen anything like this.<eos> - You still thinking retrovirus?<eos> Looks more like some kind of hemorrhagic fever.<eos> Blood loss is consistent with Ebola or Marburg, but... this kind of tissue degradation...<eos> This thing doesn't kill, it annihilates.
Ha-hah!<eos> Last time... Mind the uniform.<eos> It doesn't look right on you.
She was a housewife. I work full time.<eos> She married. I never have.<eos> You can get married and not be like her.<eos> I hope so.<eos> So, I wanted to ask you...<eos> Will you be my maid of honor?<eos> [Laughing] Hell yeah!<eos> All right.<eos> Strange as it sounds, the brain tumor is great news.<eos> Our surgeon, Dr. Bickman, is sure it's operable.
Grab her!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Garza?<eos> Dead.<eos> I suppose it doesn't matter now.<eos> You can't escape your fate, Kiera.<eos> Neither can we.<eos> What's going on?<eos> This time line is starting to collapse.<eos> It will die, and so will we.
Hear that, Lester?<eos> A corner office.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Real good.<eos> - And him, your younger brother.<eos> - Yeah, I said I heard.<eos> - Vice president, sales.<eos> - Midwest region. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Bought the surround sound to celebrate.<eos> I mean, it's pretty sweet, huh?
I mean, no-one tells you, do they?<eos> Your body's never the same.<eos> I had forceps.<eos> That was a shock.<eos> If you'd been more relaxed, you'd been less afraid.<eos> All that oxygen going to your muscles helps them to stretch.<eos> When I saw the forceps, I couldn't believe they was going inside me.<eos> Ooh!<eos> And that reaction, that shudder, is what happens to your cervix.<eos> It tenses, holds on to baby, afraid to deliver it into a world that doesn't feel safe.
Excuse me, sorry to trouble you. There's been a bereavement...<eos> Good seats.<eos> Dress circle.<eos> Excuse me! May I have a word?<eos> Of course.<eos> ♪ Slumber warm when night winds blow<eos> ♪ May you always live with laughter<eos> ♪ For a smile becomes you so... ♪<eos> 'Hope is a thing of extraordinary power.<eos> 'It feeds the soul and yet it can torment it.'

I think I'm gonna take a break from the cello.<eos> I mean, I was only suggesting a week or something.<eos> And then, you know, come back to it.<eos> No. You're right.<eos> No one under the age of 75 is interested In that dusty and antiquated music anymore.<eos> Its time has come and gone.<eos> That isn't true.<eos> I didn't mean a long break. I wasn't suggesting that.<eos> No, I think a break is in order.<eos> It's old-fashioned and obsolete.
Let's go for a walk in the park.<eos> Do you happen to know who Liu Hoi Sing is?<eos> Why don't you practice the cello?<eos> You could take it on one of the balconies and play.<eos> He was the first Chinese person to settle in New York.<eos> He arrived in 1862. He married an Irish woman who bore him two daughters.<eos> Get your cello.<eos> You haven't practiced in weeks.<eos> Ah, I'm done with the cello.<eos> It takes too much out of me.
I think maybe I did.<eos> On the one hand, I hate her guts.<eos> On the other hand, it sucks being dissed by someone that you used to have a close personal relationship with.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Have you considered vaginal reconstructive surgery?<eos> Why would I consider that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just keep seeing these pamphlets at my doctor's office.<eos> At the home, they used to serve steamed cauliflower on Wednesday.<eos> It was my favorite.
Okay, the first one was like this.<eos> Then...<eos> That's "when."<eos> - Then there was this, twice.<eos> - That's door.<eos> And this in between it.<eos> That's it?<eos> - Yeah. - "When is a door not a door?"<eos> "When is a door not a door"?<eos> When it's ajar.
Look, it's none of my business.<eos> I don't know, can we just please go find some artifacts?<eos> We're going to find the artifacts.<eos> And here we are.<eos> I love this car.<eos> Could you say that more often?<eos> Because once every two minutes just isn't enough.<eos> No, seriously, how many cars tell you where the campus is, where the best parking spot is?<eos> It even tells me which building we want.<eos> Ah, but can it give me a good reason to actually go to college?
He downed it with pleasure and breathed his last breath.<eos> TYSON:<eos> Some believe that it was on a night like this that Isaac Newton finally took his revenge against Robert Hooke.<eos> TYSON". But Halley's prophecy was not forgotten.<eos> Fifty years later, as the time of the predicted return approached the world's astronomers vied to be the first to catch sight of his comet.<eos> They weren't disappointed.<eos> It's been welcomed back every 76 years since.<eos> When Halley's Comet returns to our skies, sunlight will warm up the ice on its surface once again setting loose the dust and gases trapped within.<eos> Halley's Comet most recently visited our neighborhood back in 1986.<eos> And if you're seeing this in 2061, then you'll know it's back.
Never!<eos> Okay, why don't you and your family go into the conference room, and we'll keep you posted as we go along.<eos> We'll send in some dinner, okay?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Cee-cee, the police are just trying to do their jobs, all right?<eos> Let's go.<eos> This way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ma'am, the blood was in the little girl's room.<eos> No telling who it belongs to.
When the children were just missing, but now that they're dead...<eos> She held back crucial information.<eos> I don't trust her, and for that, she has no one to blame but herself.<eos> Captain, I've found something on the surveillance video from the airport.<eos> Now watch the traffic here.<eos> You'll see it in a second.<eos> There.<eos> That red car.<eos> It goes underneath the overpass, but then look.<eos> Now, it stays there for 47 seconds before... It comes out the other side.
No.<eos> May I invite you?<eos> Why not?<eos> Those would be some hours of quite and beautiful travel.<eos> First of all Egypt, and its Nile,<eos> and its green trees, and its palms and the cornfields, and the dark okra villages.<eos> After that Sudan, and its never-ending southern desert, so wonderfully pink.<eos> I would like to insist that this desert's pink is really something:<eos> but it's even more impressive its vastness.<eos> It never ends and never changes, from Khartoum to Rudolph Lake.
Hanna.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm sorry, just looking at the sign gives me heebie-jeebies.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> They're all behind glass.<eos> Hanna, come on.<eos> There's nothing to be scared of.<eos> Reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago in Carboniferous Period.<eos> The snake is so cool.<eos> Do you think it eats mice?
You stop the cart, and I'll get the girl!<eos> Pete, look out!<eos> Myka, look. It's working.<eos> Claude, just hold on.<eos> Mykes, her hand!<eos> Is that it?<eos> I don't know. Bag 'em.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Where the hell did it go?
Riddle me this: When is a door not a door?<eos> It feels like drowning, doesn't it?<eos> When the answer is at the edge of your cortex, but you can't seem to grasp it.<eos> You're trying my patience.<eos> The answer?<eos> When it's ajar.
I like you, cowboy.<eos> You're loco and me likey your loco-motion. - Aah!<eos> - What's the plan?<eos> A week ago, while in my employ, a lowlife calling himself the Riddler... managed to gain access to my computer system.<eos> He downloaded a file containing the identities and histories... of every current, past and potential member of the suicide squad.<eos> Including ours.<eos> That's right.<eos> He's threatening to release them all on the Internet.<eos> You're going to get it back.<eos> Riddler's got one copy and it's on a thumb drive in his cane... which is currently locked away in the Arkham property room.
What's he talking about?<eos> Who knows what these wankers get worked up about.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I swear.<eos> I'm not firing blind against The Bat.<eos> Waller, what the devil's going on?<eos> You don't get to call me up and demand answers, Deadshot.<eos> What are they talking about?<eos> Joker stole a dirty bomb and hid it somewhere in Gotham.<eos> Apparently it's large enough that the radiation would kill half the population.
For now, yeah. So, my book is dead?<eos> Um...<eos> Do you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I do decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?<eos> Okay, um, if I do give you another name, will you get the fuck out of here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> Great, I'll be back.<eos> Honestly, I just...<eos> I loved your husband.<eos> You know the person who gave me this told me that it used to belong to Edna St. Vincent Millay.
- Right, but she holds back.<eos> She'll go there, but she doesn't go all the way there, you know what I mean? I definitely do.<eos> She just never...<eos> She never takes it there.<eos> You take it there and then you take it even further, and I'm just like, "Whoa! How the fuck did we get here?"<eos> Mindy Kaling's not writing about choking on long balls, so... (LAUGHS)<eos> Well, neither am I.<eos> You wish, Mo.<eos> Anyway, the book obviously needs some work.<eos> It's not as tight as it can be, but I really think we can get it there.
But, honey, I think you're projecting a little bit.<eos> You feel my pain?<eos> How do you feel anyone's pain?<eos> All you do is talk and talk and talk and talk.<eos> And every time I come home to my apartment, you're just here talking.<eos> And at first it was kind of fun, but now I'm getting pretty fucking sick of listening to your mouth run.<eos> Just... (SPEAKING GIBBERISH)<eos> I'll go to my room, give you a little space.<eos> It's not your room, it's my room.<eos> The whole apanment's mine, and for the low, low price of $2,100 a month, it could be yours, but it isn't.
You have people who are looking out for you: me, Linda, your wife.<eos> I might be losing control of her too.<eos> I shouldn't have said that...<eos> Of course she wants the best for me.<eos> Has Claire said anything?<eos> I know they talk.<eos> Not much... just that things have been a little rocky.<eos> [chuckles] Well, that's an understatement.<eos> You have the most difficult job on earth.<eos> It would take a toll on any marriage.
The poor giant baby's in trouble again, isn't he?<eos> Are you done?<eos> Depends.<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Excellent.<eos> When do we leave?<eos> Soon as I can scrounge up a ride.<eos> Well, I have a vehicle.<eos> It stopped a few miles from here, inexplicably.
Hey, you have any oatmeal?<eos> Yeah, I wish.<eos> No, but we have, uh, something that's tofu over there.<eos> I -- what is that?<eos> It's a pancake.<eos> It's tofu.<eos> I feel like a baby asking this, but...<eos> Will the treatment hurt?<eos> Not at all.<eos> The only drawback of cupping is, it leaves a suction mark.
You may now go break your numbers, darlin'.<eos> ...free and clear through Lewisville and Carrollton, but starting to slow down...<eos> A-16.<eos> Hey, that's me. That's my spot, A-16.<eos> ...high from Love Field today is 86...<eos> A-16!<eos> A-16.<eos> - You're my SE for this sales call.<eos> - Oh, fantastic.<eos> We'll take my car, it's closer.
We may have a problem.<eos> Not any better.<eos> We only found 0.5 kilograms of Red-X in Malik's stomach.<eos> Analyzing the pattern of structural damage from the Afghan combat outpost,<eos> Zafar ingested approximately 0.5 kilograms, as well.<eos> This means that Ibrahim is still in possession of 1.1 kilograms.<eos> Get to the point, dad.<eos> That is more than enough for another attack.<eos> Another attack!<eos> And it would be the largest yet.
Well, at least make sure you take some of your work with you.<eos> I don't want you to get in any more trouble with Larissa.<eos> Thanks, but I should be good tonight.<eos> My calendar's clear.<eos> I'm just gonna go home and crash.<eos> Okay.<eos> I still have some serious reservations about these projected earnings, especially considering your client's recent deal with Bell Atlantic.<eos> Uh... why?<eos> There's nothing wrong with that deal.<eos> I've heard from reliable sources that it may not go through, which would change the stock valuation considerably.
Look, let's not worry about that.<eos> We've got months to figure that out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> You know what?<eos> I gotta go hit the men's room.<eos> We can head out, take a walk or... something.<eos> I like the sound of something.<eos> Hey, do you have any chapstick?<eos> Yeah, it's in my jacket.
I don't acknowledge it, then it'll just go away.<eos> So if I never tell my dad that I lost my job, and I'm moving to Malibu, that will go away?<eos> See?<eos> Running and hiding has its appeal.<eos> Mmm, yeah, it does.<eos> Well, look at the little lovebirds.<eos> Tommy, my friend, we are.<eos> I cannot wait to marry this woman...<eos> So much so we're moving the wedding up.<eos> Oh, it's two weeks from Friday.
One, extremely satisfied, two...<eos> - (Others clamoring positively) - Hey! This is a no-bull zone.<eos> You have my permission to speak freely.<eos> Well, when you do the same thing every year, people start to expect it.<eos> Like birthday husband stuff.<eos> Predictability is a performer's worst enemy.<eos> Makes it so damn hard to take an audience's breath away.<eos> How do I... freshen my act?<eos> My aunt has a housecat that she paints like a zebra.<eos> It's very aggressive with people.
Short answer is yes.<eos> Long answer is, it's a little more complicated.<eos> - Okay, what does that even mean?<eos> - Let him talk.<eos> It means I need to tell you a few things that might seem a little shocking.<eos> But just keep in mind your daughter's gonna be fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Allison, you had what's called an ectopic pregnancy<eos> - and it spontaneously aborted.
I'm calling it off.<eos> Guys, nothing's changed.<eos> We still grab them, and we roll them up.<eos> If we don't control the time or place of the meet, I can't guarantee your safety, Mike.<eos> - My safety?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Since when are you concerned about my safety?<eos> Used to be you'd march me to the gates of hell if it meant a shot at the Caza cartel.<eos> Look, let it go, man.<eos> If Briggs says the mission is over, it's over... come on.
- Johnny, give me 20 bucks.<eos> Damn it.<eos> You gonna pay me back?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Look, brother, I'm looking for a friend of mine, okay?<eos> He was just here a couple of minutes ago.<eos> Yeah, I saw a car.<eos> It was red.<eos> Anything else?<eos> It was old.
Yeah, probably, if we wait long enough.<eos> Oh yeah, the book changes.<eos> The fairy-trapping spell that was there yesterday, it's gone today!<eos> Fairy-trapping what?<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> And there's new spells now.<eos> You need your crops cleared from a beetle infestation?<eos> I got you.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Blood magic, it costs.
I resuscitated it.<eos> I'm president, secretary treasurer and faculty advisor.<eos> That took a lot of fancy paperwork.<eos> But it was worth it to be left alone.<eos> Can I join?<eos> Hmm.<eos> I'll have to check with Freedom.<eos> Habemus Papam!<eos> We have a poop!<eos> It's white.
This is an early-career Oldenveldt.<eos> Quite valuable.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I expect it to go somewhere between 80 to $100,000.<eos> Nobody touch it!<eos> Bart, stop looking at it!<eos> But I want to see it!<eos> No, you'll wear it out!<eos> Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right.<eos> Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years, and never knew how much it was worth.
Stop the auction!<eos> That painting belongs to me!<eos> Dawn?<eos> Good to see you again, Beef Kirky.<eos> Who is this woman?<eos> While you two were separated, Kirk and used to be friends... with banana-fits.<eos> You told me you didn't see anyone during our separation.<eos> Madam, are you saying this painting belongs to you?<eos> Kirk stole it from me!<eos> But I didn't know it was valuable till I saw the story on TV.
Maybe you want to tell your side of the story.<eos> Which way?<eos> Bravo!<eos> Well done.<eos> Sorry about all the theatricality.<eos> I just wanted to see what you two were made of.<eos> So, what, are we underground?<eos> No.<eos> No, my fortress is right where you were standing.<eos> But it's invisible.
Hardly anybody was chosen!<eos> And ground forces is still a very important assignment.<eos> It was an honor to have even been considered for the squad.<eos> What "squad"?<eos> There is no squad. Yeah, says you.<eos> It's a highly guarded secret.<eos> Oh. And what you be doing, exactly?<eos> No?<eos> Wait a second. Just, please, uh... Clarify this for me.<eos> You desperately wanted this job, but you didn't know what it was?
Well, look around.<eos> You've seen earth.<eos> You've had a taste of free will.<eos> I got to ask you -- do you like it?<eos> I mean, the way you've flocked off to follow Castiel tells me you need to follow someone.<eos> It's in your DNA.<eos> But Cass -- he's not what you think he is.<eos> He sends angels out to die.<eos> Have you told them about your stolen Grace, Castiel?<eos> How it's fading away, and when it burns out, so will you?
Previously on Intelligence...<eos> Your wife took part in an attack she was sent to prevent...<eos> That doesn't mean she turned.<eos> What would your government do to you if they learned you made a second chip?<eos> Because the candidate had to possess an extremely rare genetic mutation.<eos> It's Athens-4U7R.
- I have no more lust.<eos> - Then go!<eos> I can not leave you alone!<eos> - Then I go.<eos> - You're not going anywhere!<eos> - Let me.<eos> - You stay here, understood?<eos> - My foot!<eos> - What?<eos> It hurts.
- You're right.<eos> I've been thinking too small.<eos> - Barry!<eos> Barry!<eos> This thing's getting closer.<eos> Wind speeds are 200 miles-per-hour and increasing.<eos> Barry, can you hear me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> - If it keeps up, this could become an f-5 tornado.
Please don't start.<eos> Our take on...<eos> You can't have a take on pizza.<eos> Either it is pizza or it isn't, and this isn't.<eos> See this?<eos> This is a slice of bread.<eos> There is no pizza doughlike substance anywhere near this thing.<eos> Look, you've got cheese, you've got some sort of tomato-based sauce.<eos> Yeah, but that's not what makes it a pizza.<eos> You can put any old shit you like on top of the pizza, make a terrible pizza, but it's still a pizza, because the thing that makes it a pizza is the base.
We believe the accused tied him up...<eos> Mr Greene, please.<eos> ..and then made their way to the 23rd floor, in which time the guard managed to pursue them, whereupon they turned on him, discharged their weapon, killing him.<eos> Oh, gee whiz, well, then, my clients are guilty.<eos> Sorry to hear that, boys.<eos> Detective, if you would be so kind as to play the actual footage that shows this.<eos> Well, there is none.<eos> I beg your...<eos> I didn't quite...<eos> It's missing.
At this point, I find myself wondering if you ever saw the episode of Perry Mason where...<eos> You Honour, please.<eos> Yes, I think we have well and truly overplayed that card, Mr Greene.<eos> Your Honour, uh, Detective, my point is that you have never found the gun that killed Roderick Howley, and you have absolutely no evidence that my clients were in the TWE building at 1:21am.<eos> You may answer 'correct' if you wish.<eos> OK. You don't deserve a thing, but I'm going to give you 20 grand from the sale of the house.<eos> But if you argue with me or if you dare complain...<eos> Wendy, that is just not fair.<eos> 19,000.<eos> OK, my point is this, and it's a legal one.
Why? Your uncle feels it's an inappropriate gift.<eos> No! You deserve beautiful things.<eos> I do. I really do.<eos> But...<eos> Wait!<eos> Just... Keep it in your closet.<eos> uncle Spence doesn't have to know.<eos> No! No, Ty!<eos> I can not accept a jacket this expensive.<eos> Even though it goes with everything I own.
For you?<eos> Always.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Look, I've been thinking about what happened yesterday.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's something we need to talk about.<eos> I know.<eos> You're worried about the massive age difference.<eos> It's not that massive!
Take them away.<eos> If this is about last night...<eos> All women lie about their age, and real friends back them up.<eos> Oh, I wasn't thinking.<eos> I was too busy watching you flirt with my boyfriend.<eos> I wasn't flirting!<eos> I was being delightful.<eos> You can be delightful without fondling his abs.<eos> You are paranoid, insecure, and threatened by my ageless beauty.<eos> It's not ageless!
But then someone got killed.<eos> I told you what will happen if you bail on me.<eos> Damn it, Ty!<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Jason just got accepted into Yale,<eos> Carter's gonna be an intern at C.A.A. this summer, and I've met a girl that's really special.<eos> Our lives are just beginning.<eos> Why would you want to ruin them?<eos> What about my life?<eos> When does it begin?
Like I said, he's just not up for it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, we'll, uh, come back tomorrow.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Come on.<eos> There you go.<eos> Very good, Mr. Kenneth.<eos> See?<eos> I knew you could do it.<eos> Therapy is p-p-painful, but it's working.
Well, I don't get that, but...<eos> Okay. You're like every other woman that has kids, you know? They find out that I don't have the "mom gene,"<eos> And they look down on me.<eos> I don't mean to insult you.<eos> It's just... I love having a child.<eos> Miguel makes me very happy.<eos> You know what I love having?<eos> A dream.<eos> And the day my dream comes true, I'm gonna be as happy as you are.<eos> What if it doesn't come true?
Open the bag.<eos> What the hell?<eos> That won't happen again; you have my word.<eos> No, Sarah, it's OK.<eos> I've been around some nasty hot agents, but I've never seen anything like that.<eos> - No one has seen anything like this.<eos> - You still thinking retrovirus?<eos> Looks more like some kind of hemorrhagic fever.<eos> Blood loss is consistent with Ebola or Marburg, but... this kind of tissue degradation...<eos> This thing doesn't kill, it annihilates.
Vincent?<eos> You've got company.<eos> Can a man not sleep?<eos> Sorry to disturb you, sir.<eos> Is he a meths drinker?<eos> Not yet.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> He's been fighting the bottle since he opened his first pay packet.<eos> That's the trouble with drink.<eos> It hates those who love it most.

I will say that China teams are all great.<eos> Every player in the team is strong.<eos> You don't recognize China players as a player.<eos> You just recognize them as a whole team. You just fear the whole team.<eos> The Chinese teams that have come to this competition are scaring the shit out of everyone else.<eos> We had two of the top Chinese teams in our group.<eos> Online Kingdom has not been regarded as one of the favorites to win it.<eos> In fact, they were considered bottom four or just bottom eight for sure.<eos> This is our first time on LAN together.<eos> The team together has only been around for around 4-5 months so it's a relatively new team, and Pajkatt, our newest addition, playing Carry for us, he's only been on the team for three weeks now actually.
He goes for the Dream Coil!<eos> He gets them!<eos> He gets EHOME!<eos> Holds them in the middle lane.<eos> Na'Vi already on their way out of the pit.<eos> They're coming in to help out Dendi.<eos> Then we just went in and demolished them.<eos> Now they're on top of the Tier 3 tower.<eos> They're going to bring it down.<eos> Yes, it does go down.
I saw you spin at the Jane on New Year's.<eos> You saw me spin?<eos> Isn't that what you call it?<eos> Anyway, I tried to pick you up.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Did it work?<eos> No. You went home with that model.<eos> You were all over each other.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's my girlfriend.<eos> It wasn't your girlfriend.

- Dennis, from now on, just say, "I am sorry, Chief.<eos> As of now, I do not know shit."<eos> Fine.<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> Now, I got an hour before the meeting, so I'm gonna head over to Animal Control and...<eos> Whoa, whoa, Chief.<eos> You don't have an hour.<eos> - That meeting was rescheduled.<eos> - No!<eos> It starts in 5 minutes.
That building.<eos> Notice anything about it?<eos> Yeah, it's brick, and it's another triangle.<eos> This was a gunpowder room.<eos> Yeah, probably the most guarded place in the entire fort at the time.<eos> What do you have?<eos> This part of the wall isn't brick.<eos> - It's clay.<eos> - Looks like brick, though.<eos> It's pretty hardened.
- Hank, stop it.<eos> Don't be stupid...<eos> - "Dear Karen."<eos> That's how it starts.<eos> God, I'm sorry.<eos> "I've been thinking about us."<eos> That's us with a capital "U".<eos> "The story of us.<eos> How the fuck do I sum it up?"<eos> "Has it been perfect?
Is she next door?<eos> I installed these speakers and microphones, you know.<eos> -(SOBBING)<eos> -ALAN: Is she listening?<eos> Sarah,I 'msorry,my love.<eos> Thismustbe suchashock.<eos> Are they looking after you?<eos> Alan, what is Operation Glass?<eos> How do you fit into it?<eos> Philip Denmoor is building a bomb and today is the day it detonates, unless you help us.
- Nice.<eos> (Cell phone rings) Ooh, it's from Annika.<eos> "Thanks for the drink.<eos> I had a lovely evening."<eos> - Aw. - Now, that is a class act.<eos> And that is a picture of a vagina.<eos> (All gasp) Who-ah, that's a hoo-ha!<eos> Close up, fully shaved.<eos> Imagination not required.<eos> Look at that, it looks like it's winking at you.
I'm fine.<eos> I killed my son.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> How could I live with that?<eos> That's my punishment.<eos> This.<eos> I asked them for a day out so... I could see his grave.<eos> They said no.<eos> I just want to see his grave.<eos> It's beautiful.
Well, you better go.<eos> Your mom's gonna be waiting.<eos> It's 12:00.<eos> I do not know you.<eos> [Dog growls softly]<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What is it exactly that makes that man not recognize his dog?<eos> So, there's a part of the brain.<eos> It's called the fusiform gyrus.<eos> It's, uh, what connects what we see to how we feel.
He arrived at 8:45 A.M. on an Arabian stallion.<eos> Anything you ask, Leo has his usual elaborate answer.<eos> He always answers yes, and he's almost always wrong.<eos> Ignore her, Dr. Black.<eos> She's obviously jealous.<eos> Do you really believe that, Leo?<eos> Bickman arrived on a stallion?<eos> I saw it when I got off the bus.<eos> What color was the horse?<eos> Was it... was it pink?
You know what I do when I'm not here?<eos> I mark time... I drink, I screw, and I sleep.<eos> You know where I live?<eos> No.<eos> In the Hotel Mirabella, where I bumped into you and your niece.<eos> And when I get bored of that, I'll move to a different hotel.<eos> No obligations. No strings.<eos> Every morning, I wake up, and the day is there before me...<eos> The job, the work.<eos> It's incomparable.
Hello.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Let's start by showing Dr. Black what you showed me.<eos> I'm a bank teller at Seaton Savings Loan.<eos> - Or I used to be.<eos> - He was fired.<eos> I'm lucky I wasn't put in jail.<eos> Do you know what your hand's doing, Gordon?<eos> I have no clue.<eos> It has this life of its own.
All right, let's close him up.<eos> I think we hit a vessel.<eos> Get suction.<eos> Suction.<eos> Clip.<eos> Clip.<eos> I got it.<eos> It's clear.<eos> Bleeding has stopped.<eos> The hematoma worsened slightly, but it's still very small.
Rabies?<eos> But we need to get the lab results to know more, all right?<eos> So, just... just get some rest.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> And, uh, I'll be back, okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> And would you mind telling me how it feels to be dead?<eos> My flesh is... is rotting.<eos> It's covered in l-legless larvae.
You have to give the medications time to work.<eos> It takes four weeks.<eos> I couldn't wait that long.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't realize you were in such... in such agony.<eos> You didn't care.<eos> You wanted to know what death was like.<eos> You thought it was interesting.<eos> Death is hideous.<eos> It's putrid, painful... sad... boring and pointless.
Fun. You a new guy, huh?<eos> How do you like Gotham so far?<eos> Well enough.<eos> See you around.<eos> Oh, hey! Everything all right back there?<eos> It's always good to see you, Harvey.<eos> Wow.<eos> And look at you in your excellent suit.<eos> You know, I'm so happy you don't have to wear that silly uniform anymore.<eos> You told me it looked good.
I thought it might be a chance to reconnect.<eos> It's just for one day.<eos> I'm afraid that would be counterproductive to his treatment.<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> May I see him?<eos> Given your part in his breakdown, we'd prefer not.<eos> Dr Stewart and I believe it's too soon, too raw.<eos> I see.<eos> I understand how hard this must be for you, but it is for the best.<eos> This aversion therapy, what does it involve?
Katelijne, can you go and see whether the sheep still have enough water?<eos> Yes.<eos> No!<eos> -You have to help me.<eos> -Rogier, Christiaan get down here!<eos> Yeah a tidy counter and a clean toilet are the signs of a good housewife.<eos> Yes... that's what I mean.<eos> At least you understood.<eos> The water was very black after scrubbing.<eos> I refreshed the water three times and each time it was very black again.
And I was just like, "Oh, I'll just go to, you know, Do my go-to little boy voice."<eos> Twilight!<eos> Y-You know I love eating diamonds.<eos> You know, he's just like this little guy.<eos> I didn't...<eos> I didn't end up getting cast as Spike,<eos> But I got a call-back for... not Spike, but for Applejack and Rainbow Dash.<eos> I just ended up getting both roles, which is pretty crazy.<eos> My job is fun.<eos> It's cool.
I'm not really worried about, you know,<eos> What she'll think of us.<eos> Like, she's being brought up in all this. We just want to bring them up with this happy,<eos> You can like anything.<eos> It doesn't matter if you're a child, an adult,<eos> A girl, a boy... if it makes you happy, there's nothing wrong with that, you know, you just do it.<eos> And if that makes people uncomfortable, that's their issues that they have to work out, because if you're walking down the street smiling, Ponies on your shirt, nothing can hurt you.<eos> It has such a positive message, and it can... it's great at appealing to every end of the spectrum, both kids and adults alike.<eos> There's no bad this show can bring.<eos> We had a particularly bad thunderstorm about a month or so ago, so the next morning, she told me, she said, "Daddy, there was a big thunderstorm, and it was really loud, and I got scared.
I really wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.<eos> I was a little nervous.<eos> I wasn't quite sure what to expect and who these people were... like, who are Bronies?<eos> I'd had a couple interactions in the past, But not at this capacity at all.<eos> To get this response from any group of people is incredible, and it just happens to be that this particular group of people are mostly grown men who are into this series about girl ponies... which is pretty bizarre,<eos> when you think about it, but at the same time, they're not doing anything wrong, and they found each other, and I think it's an honour to be a part of that.<eos> - Yeah, - it's a beginning of something.<eos> It could fizzle out.<eos> Things like this have happened before.<eos> There's a big rising tide, there's a force, and then it doesn't go anywhere because nothing picks up the torch, and I really hope that something comes along that will do that, because this is not selfsustaining.
Why are you dressed like a clown?<eos> Because he is a fucking clown.<eos> This is officer Munoz.<eos> Does anybody in the building read me?<eos> Come in.<eos> I'm not even getting static.<eos> Honey, let's just call 911, huh?<eos> Nobody's getting reception.<eos> Oh, that alarm is giving me a headache.<eos> It's giving us all a headache.
Huerta: I didn't say that.<eos> If you have any intel you want to share,<eos> - I'm willing to look at it. it.<eos> - What exactly does that mean?<eos> Huerta: Don't call us.<eos> We'll call you.<eos> Jack: Nice horse.<eos> On your jacket.<eos> Sonya: It's not my jacket.<eos> Jack: Well, whoever's jacket it is, you're wearing it.
- I'm sorry about this.<eos> - No.<eos> Eva: I-I've been too much trouble, I'm...<eos> Wade: No, you haven't.<eos> Nothing to be sorry about, Eva.<eos> I need to have a word with this guy first, all right?<eos> Eva: Okay.<eos> Wade: You're late.<eos> Bob: Dang stray dog...<eos> I tried to catch it, but it eluded me.
I doubt it, but we could try.<eos> You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?<eos> We've been thorough, sir.<eos> He doesn't leave footprints.<eos> You want to shift tactics?<eos> The casino.<eos> We go public as soon as possible.<eos> You said that was a last resort.<eos> Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.<eos> If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.<eos> Yeah, Jane.<eos> Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?<eos> I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations. Mark.<eos> The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese business...<eos> Unless this has to do with the statement I just made...<eos> It does, Mr. President.<eos> Feng has ties to the standing committee and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese. Economically...<eos> Thank you all very much.<eos> It's not beginning the story that I fear, it's not knowing how it will end.
What's this I hear about Queenie performing the Seven Wonders on Saturday?<eos> Cordelia, please.<eos> Maybe we could be kind to one another for a change, huh?<eos> My God, look at you.<eos> My beautiful little girl.<eos> Did you really think self-mutilation would restore your power?<eos> Right up until I tried it.<eos> You cannot lose your power.<eos> You never will.<eos> It's inside of you.
Gin rickeys.<eos> Unzip me.<eos> Your daughter... she paid me a visit.<eos> Please tell me she's in the bathtub.<eos> She's pretty, but she doesn't have your cheekbones.<eos> She came, I guess, to... to rile me up.<eos> I imagine she wanted me to do her dirty work for her.<eos> What is the world coming to, huh, when the Supreme's daughter has to outsource her own killings?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> It wasn't on paper... it wasn't stamped by a notary, but we had a deal!
Well, I guess it's different when it's your own family.<eos> How true is it that a prophet is never recognized in his own country?<eos> Madison was not born to the Supremacy.<eos> But you, Cordelia, you have royal blood in your veins.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I was a fool not to have realized it earlier, seeking all this time in the dust for that which may have been right before us all along.<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> First, you were suppressed by your mother, then by your own theories.<eos> You have great power, my girl, power that has been seeking expression in these young vessels.<eos> But it's in you.
I can't get anything off it.<eos> You said that you and Norris were once best friends.<eos> What happened?<eos> Fallujah.<eos> Fubar clusterbang if I ever saw one.<eos> We shouldn't have survived it, but we did.<eos> After that, our backs were glued together.<eos> Combat changes people.<eos> No.<eos> It reveals them.
Or if you so desire, I will embrace my penance.<eos> (MUTTERS)<eos> (MUSIC AND CHEERING) (CHEERING)<eos> (CHEERING)<eos> (CELEBRATIONS CONTINUE OUTSIDE)<eos> Duke Federico's men have abandoned the city.<eos> I thank you, Leonardo.<eos> Anyone would have done the same in my position.<eos> Where does this humility come from?<eos> It doesn't suit you.
- They're good, right?<eos> I think that half of the guests would have had sex with them if they could, especially Evelyn, the one with the cheekbones.<eos> She wants to book us for next week, by the way.<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm gonna be in Australia, remember?<eos> My family reunion.<eos> - Oh, I thought that was months away.<eos> - Yeah, it was months away.<eos> Now it's tomorrow.
-<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Ohh. It's just Scott.<eos> You know, I think there might actually be something there.<eos> Oh, my... Oh, my sweet Jesus.<eos> What is on your neck?<eos> Uh, do you like it?<eos> Uh, that better be henna.<eos> No, it's real.
- Well, yeah, but it's... more than that.<eos> I mean, I'm discovering parts of myself that were probably always there, but I was always too afraid to do anything about them.<eos> You're acting on your impulses, even when it's outside your comfort zone.<eos> I totally get why you guys are worried, and I so love you for it.<eos> Thank you. But, really, I'm fine.<eos> Me too. I'm glad we talked.<eos> Me too.<eos> Now, can I please see this tattoo?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yes. It's on my neck. See it?
You've paid your dues in that respect.<eos> The whole recovery and everything after, and, yes, you were right about Zack.<eos> And I should have listened to you.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm so rarely right that I'm not surprised you didn't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> - Can we hug now, please? - Yes.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Wow, this place is white.<eos> - It really is just white.
- No, Daniel is over. - [Sighs]<eos> And besides, I am so happy for the distraction.<eos> So, what's the problem, okay?<eos> You had a fight with Scott?<eos> Okay.<eos> He bought me a Tesla.<eos> I think we have different definitions of the word "problem."<eos> April, do you remember how excited I was when I bought my coupe?<eos> I saved every penny and I bargained my sweet little ass off to get the best deal and it's finally paid off and it's cute and it's dented and it sputters.<eos> But it's mine, and I love it.
You know what?<eos> At the moment, I don't even want to go tomorrow.<eos> Honestly, I'd rather you not go, either, if you're gonna act like this.<eos> Wh... are you un-inviting me?<eos> You just said...<eos> No!<eos> I'm going!<eos> For Grandma June.<eos> And I'm bringing my soap dish.<eos> It was good enough for Eleanor Roosevelt.
Record player.<eos> What's that?<eos> Uh, Joss' father died when she was 6 years old.<eos> She never had a chance to know him, but he... he left her a stack of records... some Dylan and Neil Diamond, and she...<eos> She keeps them all in this special case under her bed, I think, and...<eos> Yeah, I've seen it.<eos> The case of records with...<eos> I know what you're talking about, yeah.<eos> They're her only real connection to her father, and I'm sure you know how Joss is about family, right?<eos> It's everything to her, probably because she never... Never had one... not a proper one, anyway.
I put those checks and balances in place, then ignored them.<eos> And here we are.<eos> What does Jack Crawford drink?<eos> Whatever it is, I need to send him a very expensive bottle.<eos> He said I'm a killer because he drove me insane.<eos> - No, he paved the road for your defense.<eos> - Well, he didn't say I'm innocent.<eos> Innocence isn't a verdict, Mr. Graham, but "not guilty' is.<eos> This isn't law, it's advertising.<eos> Advertising trivializes, it manipulates, it's vulgar.
You could pass as an orderly, get a job doing it when you get out.<eos> They may never know you were in.<eos> Obviously, you realize Chilton records every word said in here.<eos> Who do you think wired the mics?<eos> Or unwired the mics, as they currently are.<eos> - You killed the bailiff during my trial.<eos> - I thought it would exonerate you.<eos> I had read your file often enough.<eos> Easy to recreate your work.<eos> It was so specific.
Well, apparently, I went about putting him down the wrong way.<eos> He's still alive.<eos> Doing bad things to bad people makes us feel good.<eos> What's your relationship with him now?<eos> Has it changed? I think he thinks I've calmed down.<eos> Have you?<eos> I'm calm.<eos> Are you going to try again?<eos> This is where therapy gets a little tricky.<eos> It doesn't have to be tricky.
Anyone other than yourself that can verify that?<eos> I can.<eos> I was with Hannibal all night, Jack.<eos> What are you accusing him of?<eos> I'm not accusing him of anything, only asking his whereabouts.<eos> That's not all you're asking.<eos> Rôti de cuisse.<eos> Clay-roasted thigh and canoe-cut marrow bone.<eos> I love cooking with clay.<eos> It creates a more succulent dish and adds a little theatricality to dinner.
I want an admission.<eos> I want you to admit what you are.<eos> Must I denounce myself as a monster while you still refuse to see the one growing inside you?<eos> Why not appeal to my better nature?<eos> I wasn't aware you had one.<eos> No one can be fully aware of another human being unless we love them.<eos> By that love we see potential in our beloved. Through that love, we allow our beloved to see their potential.<eos> Expressing that love, our beloved's potential comes true.<eos> I promised you a reckoning.<eos> Here it is.
Put my head back, close my eyes, wade into the quiet of the stream.<eos> If I'm ever apprehended, my memory palace will serve as more than a mnemonic system.<eos> I will live there.<eos> Could you be happy there?<eos> All the path's chambers are not lovely, light and bright.<eos> In the walls of our hearts and brains, danger waits.<eos> There are holes in the floor of the mind.<eos> In the few jerky seconds of sleep I do get, all I see is dark, swarming behind my eyelids.<eos> I dream darkness comes into me.<eos> It comes and it's insidious.
Are you saying we should have just let Jack hang himself?<eos> But Will and Jack are still your best chance to catch Hannibal.<eos> No.<eos> This man that Will Graham killed in self defense... he was mutilated.<eos> At a certain point, self defense stops.<eos> Will Graham didn't stop.<eos> Jack Crawford sanctioned this and then he hid it from us.<eos> I have to believe that Will was trying to maintain his cover identity.<eos> Reality doesn't go away because you stop believing in it.<eos> It's stubborn like that.
I'm into Widener's handset and am searching for anything having to do with the soldiers.<eos> You think I wanted this?<eos> I didn't want this.<eos> I didn't want the life I built taken from me.<eos> I don't want to put my family or these children in danger.<eos> I don't want to wage war against the agency I love.<eos> All of these things cause me pain.<eos> But the most effective way to deal with pain, is to embrace it<eos> is that way...<eos> It has no power over you.
- Another modern tradition.<eos> - And here I thought science had won over superstition in modern America.<eos> Very well, a wish.<eos> - I wish...<eos> - Not out loud.<eos> Is there no end to this birthday madness?<eos> Just wish for something good.<eos> Given everything we've been through, we could use a little celebrating.<eos> Revenge won't bring them back.<eos> No, but it will be eminently satisfying.
Life: it's literally all we have<eos> But is it any good?
Life... it's literally all we have.<eos> But is it any good?
Life... it's literally all we have.<eos> But is it any good?
Life... it's literally all we have.<eos> But is it any good?
Life, it's literally all we have, but is it any good?
Yeah, they're probably laughing about how gigantic his dick is. [laughs]<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> She is [bleep] her lawyer.<eos> Oh, okay, this business lunch just became a jizz-ness munch.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I knew something was happening with them the first time I saw the two of them together.<eos> She is [bleep] her divorce attorney!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - No!<eos> I now understood that road rage is just like regular rage, except that it usually happens in a car.
Oh, my God.<eos> She is [bleep] her lawyer.<eos> Oh, okay, this business lunch just became a jizz-ness munch.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I knew something was happening with them the first time I saw the two of them together.<eos> She is [bleep] her divorce attorney!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - No!<eos> I now understood that road rage is just like regular rage, except that it usually happens in a car.<eos> It must come from within and I had plenty of it now.
Paul used to pee in it.<eos> Eww... It's disgusting.<eos> Whatever.<eos> There is chlorine.<eos> When I was a little girl. My parents wouldn't allow me to go south of 8th mile.<eos> And I didn't even know what that meant, until I got a little older.<eos> And I started realizing that. That's where the city started and the suburd ended.<eos> And I used to think about how shitty and weird that was.<eos> I mean. I had to ask permission to go to the state fair with my best friend and her parents.<eos> Only because it was a few blocks past the border.
God, I hate time zones.<eos> Does the Kremlin know?<eos> Hetty and the White House are on the phone with them.<eos> Correction.<eos> Was on the phone.<eos> The Russian president just informed us.<eos> The missile launched five minutes ago.<eos> We were too late.<eos> According to the Russian military, the missile was supposed to detonate harmlessly in the Arctic Ocean.<eos> But with the way the Chechens have altered GLONASS, it will now strike San Francisco in 31 minutes.

NCIS.<eos> Well, you better have a damn good reason for being here.<eos> It's taken us four years to build these covers.<eos> Believe me, we get it.<eos> We have some bad news about Agent Green.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're just waiting for Kensi and Granger to come online.<eos> You all right, Deeks?<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> I just... I got this new shirt, and it's just, uh... super itchy.
Well, you can count me in.<eos> Next time.<eos> Where do you deploy next, Nate?<eos> Well, I could tell you, Sam, but then I'd have to...<eos> It's classified.<eos> He's learning.<eos> Ah. Interesting. It's Joelle.<eos> She's revising her score.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> A score's a score; it's permanent.
That's for pickup.<eos> By who?<eos> Well, I have no idea.<eos> Where is it going?<eos> Damned if I know.<eos> You're the warehouse manager, and you don't know who's picking it up or where it's going?<eos> Nope.<eos> Never have.<eos> There have been others?<eos> Mr. Stanfill marks up a box, and when it's ready, I text a number, and some woman comes by and picks it up.
And you are so much less irritating than spending time with Deeks in a car.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think.<eos> So, how long ago did that warehouse manager sent the text?<eos> Uh, 92 minutes and 30 seconds. Mm.<eos> You know what they say about a watched pot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Eventually, it's got to boil.<eos> Showtime, guys.<eos> The GPS in the case of wine says it's on the move.
You know, it's stupid to beat yourself up 'cause you're a man too good to torture another human being.<eos> If I knew it would have worked...<eos> I would have cut off his head off with a razor blade.<eos> Oh, torture... it only works in giving our rage a place to go.<eos> And you my friend-- you have a lot of rage.<eos> My partner, um...<eos> My partner is the person I care about most on this planet.<eos> And she's here because of me.<eos> Like you, I despise this man and the Taliban.<eos> But in the end, the question of war and torture-- it's not what it does to our enemies, but what it does to ourselves.
Elevate her legs.<eos> Got something here.<eos> What?<eos> Fresh puncture wounds.<eos> There's fragments in the skin.<eos> They're hard and sharp.<eos> Oh, what is that?<eos> SAM: That is a dorsal spine from a stonefish.<eos> Deeks, get some hot water.<eos> It'll destroy the venom.
Just because you put the hammer down doesn't mean you lost it, G.<eos> Come on, Switch.<eos> I'll buy ya a beer.<eos> Switch.<eos> Ah, Deeks.<eos> Hey, yeah.<eos> Uh, tonight.<eos> Let's, you want to talk?<eos> Yeah. Let's start with my gym bag.<eos> Where is it?
I'll buy ya a beer.<eos> Switch.<eos> Ah, Deeks.<eos> Hey, yeah.<eos> Uh, tonight.<eos> Let's, you want to talk?<eos> Yeah. Let's start with my gym bag.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Evidence locker.<eos> Your gym bag was part of the operation, so it had to go to the evidence locker.
All right, pass my roll.<eos> I'll be back, okay?<eos> Don't be long.<eos> We don't want the dice to cool off.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I'm on fire, baby.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Callen, the door on your right, it leads to the roof.
Jelko probably thought like we did That banfill was sitting on something big, Went over there to rip him off.<eos> - These are m995s, Teflon-tipped, kevlar-penetrating rounds.<eos> Ballistics has 'em linked to several recent homicides.<eos> - And we found 100 of these at the scene.<eos> It's for type r insulin, which is a canadian designation.<eos> - And with any luck, our little surprise visit Got the gun runners scrambling, which means They're gonna make mistakes, okay?<eos> Eyes open.<eos> Erin, come here a second, will you?<eos> - Do you want the door closed?<eos> - Assume I always want it closed.
As in...?<eos> Yes, Richard.<eos> I can see that you're packing a lot of equipment.<eos> Well, we're outfitted with the proper gear to handle any situation.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Look, I've got to get to work.<eos> Can we fight about this later?<eos> Maybe, if I'm not too busy... dad.<eos> So what does a girl have to do to get her hands on your nightstick?<eos> Well, it's actually bigger than it looks. If you...
This thing means the death of everything that we are.<eos> So, no, I'm not gonna sell it to the English, not even to make my fortune, Ed, not at any price.<eos> I came here for the love of you, Ed.<eos> And that love now compels me to say, don't be absurd.<eos> Destroy this device.<eos> Let the English mourn its loss.<eos> And let us just go on as we were.<eos> And if I choose otherwise?<eos> Then may God help you, Ed.<eos> So your legend may have eclipsed the mortal man of your memory, but you can rest assured, it hasn't eclipsed him in mine.
And Alaric.<eos> We're gonna need more booze.<eos> She tried to kill me at least twice.<eos> She did kill me, although I'm weirdly better off.<eos> They're talking about me, aren't they?<eos> They're reminiscing.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm sure I deserve everything that they're saying.<eos> Does my hand look wrinkled to you?<eos> It looks fine.
I can see how this might be a problem.<eos> [Music playing]<eos> You think the fella loved milking cows?<eos> Probably.<eos> Then she became one, so he drank himself into oblivion, she cheated with the pastor.<eos> Hey.<eos> Just because you lost your true love doesn't mean you have to dump on others.<eos> There's no love in there.<eos> Look at that picture.<eos> It's old, and the milkmaid's nowhere to be found.
I tried to kill you.<eos> I'll do it again.<eos> Go, Enzo!<eos> [Grunting]<eos> [Music playing]<eos> Stefan: Car's done.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Hey, um...<eos> Would mind grabbing me my shirt?<eos> It's the... the green one right on top.
You stay here.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Mystic Falls is a beautiful town.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Picket fences, block parties, uncannily high death rate. You take your homes for granted.<eos> Are we walking so I don't fall asleep?<eos> 2,000 year ago, Silas and Ketsia cast a spell for immortality.<eos> It created a schism in the Traveler community, giving rise to the witches.<eos> They tried to keep us scattered to make us forget how powerful we can be.<eos> And thus began the war between the Travelers and the Witches, and it's still rages on and on.
I just need a few more days with him before I...<eos> How did you do that?<eos> How did you move that?<eos> You can't move things from the other side.<eos> That doesn't happen.<eos> That's what I'm trying to tell you.<eos> This place is falling apart.<eos> Tell him soon.<eos> False hope doesn't protect him.<eos> It protects you.
- I will accept it when that darkness comes and yanks me into oblivion.<eos> I will accept when I no longer exist.<eos> I spent over 50 years stuck in a cell, poked, prodded, tortured.<eos> By all rights, I had no hope of ever getting out, but I clung to it, so I will accept it when it's done and not a minute prior.<eos> I know you.<eos> You tried to kill my boyfriend in the caves.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - A traveler just died.<eos> Please tell my husband I tried.<eos> I'd invite you to stay for dinner, but I'm not very familiar with the traveler cuisine, although I'm sure it involves lots of trail mix and gruel.
It's the best pizza in the world.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Have you ever been to gennaro's in Florence?<eos> Yes, I have. Mm.<eos> And Paglioni's is better.<eos> You're such a liar.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And you're pretentious.<eos> Are you really eating my floor pizza?<eos> Yeah. It landed cheese side up, okay?
What we do for a living would make anybody paranoid.<eos> Natalie thought that we should have a plan just in case we needed to disappear.<eos> - Plan X.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, could we see your tattoo?<eos> Natalie did that.<eos> She had one, too.<eos> Frankie.<eos> No, I tried.<eos> It doesn't open.
As the company grew, so did the facility.<eos> Level R contains our early labs and living quarters, along with maintenance for the entire base.<eos> The ventilation system in this room is separate from the rest of the facility.<eos> The walls are concrete, three feet thick, and the door is double-plated steel.<eos> - Nothing is getting in or out.<eos> - What kind of research were you conducting with nuclear reactors?<eos> I spent time at Sandia Labs.<eos> Controlled fusion, a project we abandoned. When was the last radiation screen down here?<eos> We test every six months, and the lab has been empty<eos> - for about five years. - So it's safe?
We take her down to the fusion lab.<eos> - Thanks to your quick thinking. - My quick thinking shouldn't have been necessary in the first place.<eos> All right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> She was unarmed and asking for our help.<eos> I was only trying to protect Dr. Hatake.<eos> She wasn't threatening him; she was scared.<eos> - The situation was escalating.<eos> - It didn't escalate until you panicked and almost murdered an infected patient!
I had a horse as a kid.<eos> Who didn't?<eos> - Mmm... - I mean, have a pet is what I meant. -Yeah.<eos> Well, ma'am, in your book, you say that pony grooming taught you about how tough it is for American farmers.<eos> - That's right, I did say that, 'cause it did.<eos> - That's funny!<eos> - Why is that funny?<eos> - I can't watch it. Did you see it?<eos> No, I don't watch this show.<eos> It's completely juvenile.
I'm giving you a chance.<eos> Is there anything that you can tell us that might help us identify and convict your son's killer?<eos> I've got nothing to say.<eos> He thinks his police commissioner campaign makes him untouchable.<eos> He wants us to let him get away with murder.<eos> Helen.<eos> Matt was killed after an argument that caught out of control.<eos> A killer with a short fuse and the presence of mind and expertise to tamper with the crime scene.<eos> I want that tape.<eos> I don't know where it is.
Where are you getting this hidden resentment stuff from?<eos> There's almost no evidence.<eos> There's little physical evidence.<eos> But there is behavioral evidence.<eos> Eh, listen to this.<eos> - Can you believe this...?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Take a look at camera three at three minutes, 25, frame 15, just after the victim's been shot.<eos> The killer turns and looks directly in the camera.<eos> He knows it's there.
- Martin?<eos> - No, no, the weight thing.<eos> I know what I'm going to do.<eos> Because, you know I run the weight watchers class and I could work a regime for you based on your body mass index, ya know. a reduction of glucose, cut out the white wine, basically.<eos> Look mom, I'm already bored of this conversation.<eos> I'm just going to lay low, stay out of the public eye.<eos> Just hide, basically.<eos> Ah, Father Roche, about that Fidelma Moone situation...<eos> Did you happen to find a little pin cushion in here anywhere, Father?<eos> Eh, What does it look like?
Me, either.<eos> You have another one of those?<eos> Oh. I'm real sorry, hun, I don't.<eos> One of the black girls didn't come round when you got in?<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Leanne, I feel free as a bird.<eos> No, like, not even a bird, like a snake!<eos> More like a snake.<eos> Like an anaconda.<eos> Like, I had to, like, shed that scaly skin 'cause it just didn't suit me anymore, you know?
Your shoe?<eos> I see your shoe.<eos> It's a nice shoe.<eos> - Nice?<eos> - High.<eos> These are fucking Louboutins with gum on the sole.<eos> I stepped in gum, not two feet into the building.<eos> Where are the prisoners getting gum?<eos> Gum is contraband, Caputo.<eos> How the hell is it getting in, chewed, dropped and stuck to the bottom of my very expensive shoe?
Man, look, I appreciate your concern, but I'm actually well covered on the menstruation front.<eos> Just take one.<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace.<eos> Yeah, how the hell am I supposed to light this?<eos> What, I gotta rub two sticks together or something?<eos> Behold the Litchfield lighter.<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> Man, it's like the third-best day of my entire life.<eos> Man, blow into the drain!<eos> What happened was the critic changed his mind because the rat made stew, and it was delicious.
Unh. Unh. Mmm.<eos> - Unh. Mmm.<eos> Then... Unh.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> A little much for a 9-year-old.<eos> Yeah, if you mean a little much swagger, you got that right!<eos> I wish you were here for all my birthdays.<eos> Last year, Mom got me clothes.<eos> It's what you needed, baby.
For the greenhouse.<eos> It's rosemary from my bush at home.<eos> Grows into a whole new plant.<eos> Anyway, sorry I had to crack the whip yesterday.<eos> No, it's...<eos> It was...<eos> This job may look easy, but it isn't.<eos> I got ambition, you know?<eos> I could be warden one day.<eos> This whole shot-quota thing, who knows if it works?
How kind of you to remember.<eos> Did you read this?<eos> It's about kids with cancer.<eos> I don't know why the sick fuck wanted to write about this.<eos> Anyway, I... I thought it might be right up your alley.<eos> I got enough depressing shit in my life.<eos> I don't need it in my books, too.<eos> So, what's your escape, then, huh? Is it pain pills, booze?<eos> Everybody needs a little bit of help with reality now and then.<eos> The thing about reality... is it's still there waiting for you the next morning.
Don't you have a special dedication for me?<eos> Boo, thank you, for always being a pain in my ass.<eos> Let's stick together from now on, huh?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Hear you have a pretty good system worked out for yourself in here.<eos> Norma... get the nice young woman a form.<eos> Write down what you want, and I'll do my best.<eos> We're a little overwhelmed with orders lately, though.<eos> I ain't here to place no orders. Here to buy the company.<eos> It's not for sale, sorry.
I need you to help men retrieve a certain item.<eos> This is the item.<eos> You know it, yes?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Do you know what you're messing with here?<eos> Won't be cheap.<eos> This is not a problem.<eos> You do know that thing could kill hundreds of people?<eos> No, Mr. Turner.<eos> It will kill thousands.
Leave him.<eos> He's not important.<eos> Hello, Laurel.<eos> Laurel.<eos> It's me.<eos> Someone came after Laurel.<eos> Do you know where they took her?<eos> I think I have a pretty good idea.<eos> If that mask is supposed to scare me...<eos> All that it's doing is confirming what I've already known for a while now.
The car's a rental.<eos> Address is in the Glades.<eos> Sara. Call your father.<eos> Sebastian, I am so sorry.<eos> I have a bad habit of standing you up.<eos> Look, I know you have to pull your support for my campaign.<eos> Blood is thicker than politics.<eos> And it should be.<eos> Well, thank you for understanding, and I really hope that this doesn't affect our friendship.<eos> It's important to me.
Take the knife.<eos> Now we have a show.<eos> We won't be needing this.<eos> We tried copper in Paris and it failed.<eos> An alloy with silver is preferable for proper conductivity and corrosion.<eos> You were gonna let us use the wrong wire?<eos> I never would have let you get that far without me.<eos> You roughen it to increase the conductivity?<eos> Seems to double the effectiveness.<eos> I'll now feed the wire through so that it coils in the aorta, making good contact with the aneurysm.
To what do i owe the pleasure?<eos> I was wondering if i might talk to you, ma'am.<eos> I had a small farm.<eos> First, it broke my heart. Then it broke my back.<eos> As you and i both know, the heart heals.<eos> The back never does.<eos> I took up trapping.<eos> It's a meager lmng... Ruined the Indians. Now it's ruining me.<eos> Thing about trapping is you get your good catch at night.<eos> But by morning, it's someone else's meal.
Why don't you just shut the fuck up and give me my hormones, hm?<eos> S01E01 The Other Davina<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi, they're releasing an Anne Murray box set, and the paper wants me to write about it, so it's been Anne all day.<eos> I'm saturated with Murray.<eos> Do you like her?<eos> I like Anne Murray.<eos> I don't particularly like Anne Murray but I'm trying to give her a chance.<eos> I've listened to Snowbird maybe 15 times so it's safe to say I'm going mad basically.<eos> At first, it was like being suffocated by a high-quality down pillow but... now the song's growing on me, it's growing on me.
What I said is that as archeologists, sometimes, we're following a map.<eos> Other times, local legend.<eos> But when you're staking your career on myth, maybe you have to be a little crazy.<eos> And if that's the case, well, color me crazy, too.<eos> No further questions.<eos> Why would Ziff change his statement?<eos> Maybe to spare Mason's feelings.<eos> Or Ziff is behind this.<eos> Is the death mask in there?<eos> Does it even exist?
Perhaps we should adjourn, then, till the captain can be here<eos> - and we're able to do this properly.<eos> - Yes.<eos> If you strongly object to my father's wishes, Mr. Habershorn,<eos> I will understand if you need to make your apologies and leave.<eos> Then let's get to the business at hand.<eos> I'd like to welcome Dr. Thackery to his first board meeting, seated in place of the late Dr. Christiansen.<eos> My condolences, Dr. Thackery.<eos> Dr. Christiansen's untimely passing has brought added strain to the Knickerbocker.<eos> Aside from the public disaster it presents, it further hampers our efforts at financial solidity.
Much more preferable.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is something that I invented yesterday... or the day before.<eos> It's a sheath that allows the bladder to keep its correct shape for insertion.<eos> You know, if a penis can make the trip one way and a baby the other...<eos> Look, this is what we do.<eos> We insert the basketball bladder bullet, the BBB, up into the vagina, up into the uterus, and then we leave the air tube trailing and remaining outside.<eos> We then remove the sheath so that the bladder can open.<eos> We then attach a pump to the air tube and we pump up the bladder inside the woman so that it expands and hardens against the bleed.<eos> We then add a weight to the tube so that it puts pressure on the wound, slowing the bleeding, giving ourselves more time.
We got to find her first.<eos> Families like these use only two agencies to find their help.<eos> Mrs. Grover's for the new money and Bigsby's for the old.<eos> If she's working for the wealthy in New York City, she's been through at least one of those doors.<eos> Then we're gonna have to go through them, too.<eos> Where are you, Typhoid Mary?<eos> Where did you say this machine was originally?<eos> The fellas at Johns Hopkins had it.<eos> They've since found a better model, so I took it off their hands, which is fortunate for you.<eos> - And it works fine?
I'm sorry.<eos> We're gonna see each other again very soon.<eos> - Where'd you park?<eos> - On the side.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> We'll go out the back so Carl won't see that you've left.<eos> Take the old fire road from the factory.<eos> - Remember how to get there, Jacob?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It leads out of town.
Got it.<eos> I decided to start today so you could get a dose of a normal day and a special event, like the science fair.<eos> Because there will be a fight tomorrow.<eos> The dirty little secret is, when bullies aren't around, nerds are total bastards.<eos> You don't have to tell me that.<eos> I went to Space Camp.<eos> The key is to recognize the fight hot spots.<eos> That north wall... that's close to the computer lab.<eos> That's where all the dorks hang out.<eos> But it also borders the gym, which sets up a lot of jock-on-dork violence.
You are a natural linoleum polisher.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> JOEL: I saw your bracket.<eos> I think Lily is a great choice.<eos> She is.<eos> She's gonna win the whole thing.<eos> And she didn't even need my help.<eos> Also, last night, I went online, I found the perfect apartment.<eos> And it's across the street from a Porsche dealership.
Do you like Wilco? - Uh, is there anyone in the world who does not like Wilco?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, sweet Kenny Rogers.<eos> We're locked out of the Lock-In.<eos> No!<eos> Oh, you decided to stay.<eos> Why? You know when you decide you hate an item of clothing so you give it to your maid?<eos> And then you see your maid wearing it and you're like, "Why'd I ever give it away?<eos> Because it looked so much better on me?"
We'll be in touch.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> That was the other doctor.<eos> He has an appointment for you tomorrow.<eos> Kiki, when we were all sitting together earlier on,<eos> it was all fine all of a sudden.<eos> For the first time.<eos> My life... My life wasn't too long perhaps.<eos> But it was pretty good.
What you've been through?<eos> I can't imagine.<eos> Well, you've been through some tough times yourself.<eos> Mm, nah, nothing like that.<eos> I don't buy the tough girl act.<eos> I think... you cared about Vargas a lot, and it hurt you deeply when he was killed.<eos> Sure, it hurt.<eos> Well, loss has its way of paralyzing you.<eos> It...<eos> It stops you from moving on in your life, and as hard as that is and as guilty as you feel, it's...
As keen-eyed as ever, young Rigsby.<eos> Van Pelt.<eos> Are you enjoying Internal Affairs?<eos> Dealing with mistrust and disdain for half the paycheck I got at CBI?<eos> No, I am not enjoying Internal Affairs.<eos> But you're not here to discuss my problems, are you?<eos> I believe Lisbon called.<eos> Your old team's phones are being bugged, Ardiles' murder -- yes, she -- she told me.<eos> To be honest, I am not interested in the headache that seems to accompany you all.<eos> As bad as this job is, it's drama-free.
W-what's all this?<eos> Oh, well, that's the art squad.<eos> They deal with stolen art and stuff like that.<eos> Yeah, their offices on the sixth floor are being remodeled, so I told them to set up in the conference room for the time being.<eos> Huh.<eos> Mrs. Hennigan, why was your husband trying to save this painting in particular?<eos> That's me.<eos> John painted it years ago, when we first met.<eos> We fell in love as he was painting it.<eos> It's not worth any money, but it was worth a lot to us.
How was your date with agent Pike?<eos> It was okay.<eos> Mm. Just okay?<eos> It went well.<eos> Good, huh?<eos> Oh, well, that's great.<eos> That's great.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Hey. The hospital says there's only one death.<eos> He was right next to the bomb when it went off.
Just a minute.<eos> Do you have Madison's phone?<eos> Here.<eos> The techs say that there's an audio file recorded at 5:52 the morning of Madison's murder.<eos> Apparently, she recorded a message for herself.<eos> That was around the same time she was killed.<eos> What if she got audio of the -- of the killer?<eos> What's on it?<eos> They don't know.<eos> It's too damaged.
I'm sorry for your suffering.<eos> Madeline pratt.<eos> How do we find her?<eos> Finding her is easy.<eos> Catching her is difficult.<eos> Luckily, she has asked me to help her plan a heist.<eos> To steal what?<eos> Novak: The effigy of astarte.<eos> The effigy was thought to be lost. Disappeared from the british museum in 1983.<eos> Two months ago, it pops up at an estate sale in henderson, kentucky.
We can't just arrest her, we have no evidence.<eos> What you do have is an opportunity. Which brings us back to the effigy of astarte.<eos> Madeline feels her profile is too high right now to steal it herself. So she's asked for my help.<eos> Where is the effigy?<eos> Secure wing in the syrian embassy. For now.<eos> But it will likely be repatriated at any moment,<eos> Which means maddie is rushed and vulnerable.<eos> She's trying to make a grab that would normally take months to plan.<eos> Do the syrians know what's inside the effigy?<eos> If they did, it would be in damascus by now.
Then what?<eos> I played him for a little bit, then I kissed him off, And told him he'd get more next week.<eos> Then frank and I went away.<eos> And lived happily ever after.<eos> The end.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in happily ever after.<eos> I didn't come here to audition.<eos> Wait.<eos> The job.<eos> It's yours.
Want me to rough him up for you?<eos> I hate this job.<eos> How do you know madeline pratt?<eos> She called me last month. Asked about the effigy.<eos> I'd never met her before, And I don't know how she found me.<eos> So why did she call you then?<eos> Because the effigy of astarte once belonged to my father.<eos> He stole it from the british museum.<eos> He was a patriot who revered astarte.<eos> He thought it belonged in syria.
Welcome to the United States, Mr. Itami.<eos> Hello, Agent Maguire.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> You will.<eos> Mako Tanida, former clan boss of the Azuma-Dojin, based out of osaka.<eos> By the time our task force caught up, he controlled a large part of the heroin trade traveling along the silk road.<eos> After Tanida's arrest, we thought his empire would collapse.<eos> It didn't.<eos> In fact, it expanded... grew to include alliances with the Chinese triad, Korean tong, even Russian bratva.
Abed, give me your other hand.<eos> It's down to us.<eos> You or Britta will be the winner.<eos> I'm not leaving, okay?<eos> Just...<eos> I promise.<eos> The floor's not lava.<eos> Just give me your hand.<eos> I don't think the lava's here because you're leaving.<eos> I think it's here because I won't let go.
I have both, actually, it's just...<eos> It's just what?<eos> I was planning on making some soup.<eos> Uh, Brian.<eos> Examine the injury.<eos> What?<eos> - You wanted to run point.<eos> - Take a look.<eos> Uh, Brian, how's it look?<eos> It's up there.
It's just what?<eos> I was planning on making some soup.<eos> Uh, Brian.<eos> Examine the injury.<eos> What?<eos> - You wanted to run point.<eos> - Take a look.<eos> Uh, Brian, how's it look?<eos> It's up there.<eos> It's really up there.
So, why hack a power grid?<eos> That doesn't fit the extortionist M.O.<eos> Well, most likely, it's a, uh... ego thing.<eos> You see, these high-level hackers are all out to prove that they're the best.<eos> The physical grid is just the next frontier.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Cortez screwed up with the power grid.<eos> How so?<eos> It's just the nature of the security system.<eos> It only allows access from local I.P. addresses.
Okay, I'm compiling the system code to build our reactor's H.P. network.<eos> You're compiling?<eos> It's a figure of speech.<eos> Gabriel's on with Cybercom, where they're building the phantom reactor.<eos> Okay, Troy.<eos> We've got the basic build.<eos> Now we have to ensure our reactor gets hit first.<eos> How do we make this thing sexy to the worm?<eos> It's about the payload.<eos> The bigger our target, the more likely it'll distract from the real thing.
This included mandating a single coinage, making uniform all weights and measures, the widths of carts and roads, as well as the precise way the Chinese language was to be written, including what you were allowed to write and think.<eos> Emperor Qin's philosophy-- the only one permitted-- was called "legalism,"<eos> which is just what it sounded like, do as the law says... or else.<eos> It's a philosophy that's not highly conducive to questioning authority.<eos> ...that all the books of the hundred schools of thought shall be be burned, that anyone who uses history to criticize the present shall have his family executed.<eos> The works of MoTze and Confucius and other philosophers were destroyed in the world's first book burning.<eos> Hundreds of scholars bravely resisted by trying to preserve the forbidden books.<eos> They were buried alive in the capitol.<eos> Science needs the light of free expression to flourish.<eos> It depends on the fearless questioning of authority, the open exchange of ideas.
No.<eos> "No" what?<eos> You're not.<eos> Not coming along?<eos> I do believe I am.<eos> I can help.<eos> I didn't ask for help.<eos> Well, that doesn't mean you won't need it.<eos> That flying monkey back there wasn't after my son.<eos> It was coming after you.
I would hate for him to lose his father, too.<eos> Well, then, you should have stayed with the others.<eos> So...<eos> Roland's mother... what happened to her?<eos> After our boy was born, I... inadvertently put her in harm's way during a job.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> Like I said, I own my mistakes.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> That door... it's open.
They're all perverts.<eos> It's not just kidney doctors.<eos> Ever since the presentation, I'm propositioned a dozen times a day.<eos> I get notes on my windshield.<eos> Just today, somebody left a dildo... a dildo... on my desk.<eos> One of the girls in the bullpen, no doubt.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Women are so vicious.<eos> The financial repercussions are even worse.<eos> DePaul's salary... it doesn't even cover essentials, forget about extras.
How did you know that I would be here?<eos> It's where you used to take me after mom... after I thought she died.<eos> I suppose you're gonna tell me that most parents<eos> - would take their children to the playground?<eos> - They do.<eos> But I liked it here.<eos> I liked the quote.<eos> "Uncommon valor was a common virtue."<eos> I like it, too.<eos> It used to remind me of mom.
The married man you can't seem to stay away from had me abducted and locked me up in chains and spoke to me about the way you taste while he allowed the terrorist who snaked her way into my marriage bed to clear U.S. air space.<eos> What happened was the man you screwed betrayed me by freeing the woman who gave birth to you as a bargaining chip.<eos> What happened was the man who defiled you also defiled an organization that I gave my soul to build.<eos> That is what happened.<eos> What is currently happening is that President Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III has made an enemy... the worst kind of enemy, because I know all his secrets.<eos> I know where every body is buried.<eos> And the greatest weapon I can use against him calls me "dad."<eos> Uncommon valor was a common virtue.<eos> The thing about that quote, Olivia, is that is from the good old days.<eos> It no longer applies.
No.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> The role of B613 is not to protect the president or the president's wife or the president's chief of staff.<eos> It's not about people at all.<eos> In fact, it's about the Republic.<eos> And me getting involved in some petty white house squabble, it's...<eos> "Petty white house squabble"...<eos> You really have no idea what you're talking about, do you?<eos> The fate of the Republic may not hinge on me or Fitz or Mellie, but it does hinge on the American people continuing to believe that their elected officials are not murderers.
What?<eos> "What" as in you're surprised I asked, or "what" as in you didn't hear me?<eos> I'll repeat the question.<eos> - Why hasn't...<eos> - Shh!<eos> I'm not gay.<eos> So, why are you whispering?<eos> Because your question is outrageous.<eos> And yet you shaved your beard.<eos> - It itched.
Because I can't do this alone.<eos> Yes, I'm the one running for President.<eos> But that's just me...<eos> Y-you're going to miss the end of my guy's speech.<eos> He gave the same speech two days ago, and the day before that, and three times last week.<eos> Sometimes it feels like a thing of the past... A relic from a bygone era.<eos> It's a good speech.<eos> What?<eos> The speech.<eos> It's... It's a good speech.
Too long. [Chuckles]<eos> I saw that sit-down you did on Dominique Strauss Khan.<eos> - Nicely done. - Thank you.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> [Inhales deeply]<eos> We're gonna have to push the interview.<eos> - Olivia.<eos> - We just need an extra hour or so.<eos> It's live.<eos> I'm not at liberty to discuss it, but the President is in an important meeting, and it's running long.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Rowan:<eos> Where's the bomb? - You must be Eli.<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Exactly as Marie described you.<eos> - Where is the bomb?<eos> - And you must be Olivia.<eos> I haven't seen you since you were... how old were you?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Where is it, Dominic?
Who knew gypsies could be chemists?<eos> Oh, I don't know, Richie.<eos> That's basically like a racist assumption.<eos> Really?<eos> Name me a gypsy chemist, Dom.<eos> Why don't y'all try it again?<eos> Uh... - It was pretty intense.<eos> - Humor me.<eos> Ooh. - This shit stings, man.<eos> - It's so worth it, bro.
I think it's time I had hers.<eos> You know?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm in.<eos> - What next?<eos> - Well, we uh need some of Trick's blood.<eos> Oh, well that's good. 'Cause I thought it was gonna be difficult.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He told me back in the day he would store his blood in an ink well... ready to write at a moments notice.<eos> You think it's in here?
Okay.<eos> I'm in.<eos> - What next?<eos> - Well, we uh need some of Trick's blood.<eos> Oh, well that's good. 'Cause I thought it was gonna be difficult.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He told me back in the day he would store his blood in an ink well... ready to write at a moments notice.<eos> You think it's in here?<eos> Well he's a creature of habit, our Trick.<eos> It is definitely in here.
You're fog, right?<eos> That's the answer.<eos> Eugh!<eos> - Your turn, Princess.<eos> - Oh, not big on losing huh, Levi?<eos> The game is not over yet.<eos> And don't call me that.<eos> - Go!<eos> - Ok, Ok, I'm going.<eos> - It's not here.
I've met turtles.<eos> No.<eos> This turtle was the cursed daughter of the Emperor.<eos> She gave the fisherman a magical box...<eos> if I'm not mistaken...<eos> - it is this magical box.<eos> - Like, make a wish, magical box?<eos> Or just like have a late period, magical box?<eos> Like protect you from evil but don't you dare open it unless you know the combination magical box.<eos> It opens from all sides.
Or, uh... Someone Trick has written about.<eos> I'm sorry Kenz.<eos> Ah, Kenzi!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Tamsin let go!<eos> - Agh!<eos> I can't!<eos> I must take his soul.<eos> It belongs to me.
[ Knocks ] Hi.<eos> Look, I know you don't want to talk, but I... I need your eyes for a second, professionally.<eos> My professional eyes?<eos> You were a clerk for a criminal court judge, and I remember because back then, I thought "clerk" meant you worked at the cash register.<eos> What is it, Jane?<eos> Okay, look at this.<eos> Just... just tell me, is that blood spatter?<eos> Probably.<eos> Why?<eos> And for blood to look like that, it must've been from a severed artery, correct?
You brought a gift?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> It's a party.<eos> I always bring a gift to a party.<eos> Janet Guggenheim didn't raise no fool.<eos> Normally, I'd bring scented votive candles, you know?<eos> But that hardly seemed appropriate.<eos> Hardly.<eos> Then I was thinking maybe a nice bottle of champagne, but I didn't want to be the ignorant white guy whose only knowledge of black culture comes from rap videos.<eos> We all know it's much more than that.
The downside of these high-end alarms with those shock sensors, neighborhood punks decide they want to have fun with you, all they got to do is<eos> - run up and smack the bumper. - When I was a kid, we'd just... Ring a guy's doorbell, run like hell.<eos> Ding-dong ditch.<eos> - It ended for me the day Mose Sawyer came to his door with a scatter gun.<eos> Some guys just can't take a joke.<eos> I was about to outgrow it, anyway.<eos> Kind of thing you drop as soon as you discover girls.<eos> Yet here you are, all growed up, still dinging and donging and don't have the sense to ditch.<eos> I never said I was the one - that set your car going.<eos> - It's not my car.
Bill.<eos> Mr. Nygaard, we got some questions we'd like...<eos> This is Molly.<eos> Deputy Solverson.<eos> Sure, nice to meet ya.<eos> Like I was saying, we got some questions, so...<eos> How you holding up, Lester?<eos> How's the head?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, it hurts.
Well, Jackie's a tough customer.<eos> 25 years he's been an active member of the Electrical Trades Union.<eos> I mean, you're not even a union member, are you, Dave?<eos> Plus he's been selling raffle tickets at every branch meeting since Gough Whitlam was a boy.<eos> Do you know what they say in the Boy Scouts, Davo?<eos> Be prepared.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> I got us some chicken from De Luca.<eos> Was it a little wrinkled?
I thought you weren't having one on purpose.<eos> Following the American-style...<eos> Let's be friends.<eos> You're just too gentle and kind.<eos> The wives here are a bit aggressive.<eos> Yes? I'm sorry... I just wanted to say how encouraging your visit is.<eos> It's my pleasure.<eos> Such a handsome man... It's a pity that your leg is...<eos> Well, I can't do anything about it.<eos> What's amazing is it still itches like I have a leg.
- You abandoned me.<eos> - Calm down... - You left me there.<eos> Vietcong!<eos> Vietcong!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Doctor!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I think I lost my earring.<eos> Where did it go?
I am going to great lengths, long, long, Tom-Long lengths, to make this farm happen for Wanda.<eos> The least you can do is fight the good fight with Lavon.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right, you're right.<eos> I'm gonna go over there right now. And I will not take no for an answer.<eos> How's that?<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, go deliver that pizza before it gets cold.
Three weeks, the Himalayas, no shoes, and I discovered that I have been an absolute ogre of a human being.<eos> I could have saved you that entire trip.<eos> I hear your anger, bro, and I get it.<eos> But I am changing, metamorphosing, if you will.<eos> Trying to heal the world.<eos> I quit my job with Mayor Gainey.<eos> I took a gig with GreenWorld International in Mobile.<eos> Oh.<eos> You? Defending the environment?<eos> It's not gonna defend itself, now, is it?
- That's impossible!<eos> It's...<eos> - Benedict Valda.<eos> (Machine whirring) (Gasps)<eos> Time to rise and shine.<eos> Who are you?<eos> (Breathing heavily)<eos> - What is this thing?<eos> - That won't come off.<eos> It allows me to control your prodigious powers, miss Donovan.
Fine.<eos> I'll be Caretaker myself.<eos> Claire?<eos> Claire?<eos> Wow, I've always loved the sound of your voice.<eos> Oh!<eos> Claud, okay, good.<eos> Myka and I gonna try and stop Valda from consecrating Warehouse 14.<eos> Meanwhile, try and get that thing off her eye.<eos> I tried, but it won't come off.
So we split up.<eos> You take the strike team and go after Centipede.<eos> We'll investigate Skye's lead, see if Coulson's there.<eos> You backed my decision to kick Skye off the plane.<eos> - Seems like it worked out.<eos> - Seems like you played me.<eos> Look, this isn't personal, but I am taking my team and we're gonna find Coulson.<eos> Send backup if you want.<eos> What makes you so sure this machine will even work?<eos> It worked on me.
Headed to the dining car now to tag the package.<eos> May?<eos> May?<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Conductor.<eos> Could you be so kind as to help me with my bag?<eos> I'm sorry, Miss.<eos> I'm very busy.<eos> I'll send someone else to help you.<eos> One quick moment.<eos> It's very heavy.
It worked!<eos> I did it.<eos> The ice stopped.<eos> So it's ending?<eos> No. It's just beginning.<eos> We're in the eye of the storm.<eos> A storm?<eos> But crystalline nucleation<eos> - should only create ice around the ...<eos> - It did... up there.
Help me.<eos> He wants help.<eos> The only thing that can help him now is morphine.<eos> Let go.<eos> Let go.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Frankie!<eos> Oh, fu-- Oh, damn!<eos> Put your mask on!<eos> No! It's off!
There's an ancient creature, imprisoned for a hundred years.<eos> Most are afraid to even speak its name for fear it might return.<eos> Go on.<eos> It's more powerful than any army.<eos> And once you tell it what you want, nothing, no one can stop it.<eos> But I beg you not to...<eos> I need a name.<eos> It is called... the Jabberwocky.<eos> So, if the bottle rolled down this hill...<eos> It most likely ended up here.
We're marching.<eos> We're in a parade.<eos> Who's the leader of the band?<eos> Big tasty. Big tasty.<eos> All right, I want you to be completely honest with me, Dave Kim...<eos> Mom or no Mom, my body's shaping up nice, am I right?<eos> You people are weird.<eos> Dave kim, your parents are out of town.<eos> You're throwing a party.<eos> How is it going?
Are you playing Pac-Man?<eos> No, I-I'm trying to set the timer.<eos> The directions are in Japanese.<eos> It's very complicated.<eos> Oh.<eos> There we go.<eos> We're on the clock.<eos> Are you sweating?<eos> It's the velour shirt.<eos> It doesn't breathe.
No!<eos> It's always a story.<eos> Everything is a story.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Story feeds on conflict.<eos> If I stop resisting, it'll stop being a story.<eos> No, Abed.<eos> Me with a beard?<eos> Keep fighting the story.<eos> Keep fighting it until it falls apart.
Love its potential.<eos> This'll be your office.<eos> Why?<eos> Okay, we'll check in on that later.<eos> What, can't wait until Greendale's corpse is cold before you put it on a 6-inch white bun?<eos> Young lady, that's not fair.<eos> Subway doesn't call its bread "buns," and we don't serve white.<eos> We serve Italian, honey oat... - ...nine-grain wheat.<eos> - Thanks for making my joke accurate.<eos> - Now it's hilarious.
He was recruited by the Army Rangers.<eos> After that, it was a stint with Chicago PD Homicide.<eos> He was involved in a questionable shooting.<eos> IAD had put a righteous face to it,<eos> Chasseur resigned from under a cloud. Landed him in Hemlock Grove.<eos> - He give you anything?<eos> - Nada.<eos> Searched his place, canvassed the neighbors.<eos> You know, Marie's not so reckless she's just gonna take off without telling anyone.<eos> I've done enough rooting around this place looking for Shelley to know that whatever Marie's situation is, it isn't benign.
I knew this day would come.<eos> Did you just hear about a body telepathically?<eos> It's not a body.<eos> It's a bullet.<eos> Bullet...?<eos> I had so many questions to ask him.<eos> I didn't want to interrupt his silent thing, so I held it in.<eos> Solid choice.<eos> So we're looking for a bullet because...<eos> It clipped the guy.
Ahem, well...<eos> It's Bay, but from really, really high up, like outer space.<eos> Very minimalist.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Well, some artist guy sells a blank canvas for millions of dollars.<eos> I at least got a dot.<eos> That should be worth a "B," right?<eos> It depends on what kind of a statement you're making with your dot.<eos> Um... Well...<eos> It's round, uh, like... the earth.
And Father.<eos> No.<eos> Jeremy?<eos> You died.<eos> Murdered by my mother's own coven.<eos> Condemned...<eos> As an orphaned, wayward warlock, and left to whither in a plain, pine box.<eos> Yet my blood...<eos> Our blood was strong enough to breath life back into my lungs.<eos> Just as it gave my beloved golem life when I was a child.
Katrina!<eos> Now you'll know what it's like to lose faith.<eos> When it's gone, you have nothing.<eos> And when you have nothing, there's nothing holding you back from what you're capable of.<eos> Behold the second seal!<eos> Don't!<eos> War isn't coming to Sleepy Hollow.<eos> It's been waiting all along.<eos> And now...<eos> It begins.
- I'm throwing it out.<eos> - No, you can't!<eos> I'm going to use it!<eos> Rae!<eos> This is very important to me, so just be bloody normal!<eos> Just for five minutes!<eos> Inshallah, we can soon open our arms and welcome a new child to Islam.<eos> It's very important to Karim that his baby be born unto Islam.<eos> And thus, it's very important to me, too.<eos> I've been reading your book, and I must say, it speaketh to me.
Well, that "punk" used to work for your uncle.<eos> Who's pretty good with a sharp blade himself.<eos> What if Springer threw Dillon under the bus as a distraction?<eos> Distraction from what?<eos> Collins.<eos> Maybe he's still working for him.<eos> You know, we thought we loosened your uncle's grip when we found his "secret room."<eos> But it looks like he's got another one, out by the west entrance.<eos> Caleb, I've been in that chapel.<eos> It's small, it's quiet, it's a lot like my grave.
I don't want a backup plan.<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> I wanna do this...<eos> I'm gonna give it a shot.<eos> It's not gonna happen if I don't believe in myself.<eos> I believe in you Lydia, I do.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> It's just that, you know, life's tough.<eos> It is tougher than you know and I...
- [Anna] Five weeks.<eos> I know it's very early days, but, um...<eos> With the timing of things, how we found out... and when we did, well, it really worked out in the end.<eos> Great.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> [Tom] So mom, how are you feeling?<eos> - Uh, mostly fine.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah I um, I use this thing, you know, instead of a memory.<eos> It reminds me to take my medication and things like that.
It's--they've got live sheep.<eos> The kids can pet the sheep.<eos> There's a knitting workshop.<eos> The kids go crazy for it.<eos> There's a yarn toss.<eos> - Remember, we went last year.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Oh, is that where you made the pizza hat?<eos> Nope, Blanca got me this hat.<eos> 'Cause I was gonna say, it's awesome. - Yeah.
Don't say anything.<eos> Danny likes surprises.<eos> I can't even look at this.<eos> Oh, my God, what is that?<eos> What?<eos> - Babe, you're an asshole.<eos> - Just relax.<eos> Fluid looks great.<eos> Yes, my fluid.<eos> It looks good.
You look like a Tim Burton creature.<eos> What was going on with you and Danny?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Did he make fun of your shirt or something?<eos> What's wrong with my shirt?<eos> I can't believe how long you've been here.<eos> Yeah, it's crazy.<eos> No, no, it's, like, it's flown by.<eos> Do you like your room? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's nice.
But I'm sure Dr. Kalfas already explained to you... they're pre-viable.<eos> They won't survive.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't lie here and just... I can't let him just die inside me.<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> How do I do that?<eos> I know it's awful.<eos> But your other baby will continue to grow and develop.<eos> Carrie, you had a very difficult problem.<eos> It was threatening your life, and we've looked after that.
Now that said, you three did make the cut.<eos> So congratulations on that.<eos> But the winnowing process continues.<eos> We haven't finished separating the wheat from the chaff.<eos> So how many of us get to keep our powers and become Ultra agents?<eos> And how many get chemically castrated?<eos> And how exactly are we being evaluated?<eos> By not screwing up.<eos> By not losing breakouts.<eos> By holding your hand over the candle until it burns you to the bone, if that's what I ask.
Yeah.<eos> Tommy talked about you all the time.<eos> You knew him?<eos> Screwed up kid, but, damn, he was really in love with you.<eos> You know where I could find him?<eos> Why?<eos> This is chaos.<eos> Is Bobby around?<eos> No!<eos> Ward trucking was supposed to get a package, but it hasn't arrived yet.
Yes, I know.<eos> You're very tough.<eos> - Okay, and you are...<eos> - Handsome? Charming?<eos> - I don't know, you tell me.<eos> - Yes, but you can't come over here unannounced.<eos> Danny can come home any second, and I need to focus on him right now, make sure he has a normal life, you know?<eos> What about you?<eos> What kind of life do you get?<eos> Because I think it should start with something like this.
- valedictorian with you.<eos> - Well, not if your genome models turn out like I think they will.<eos> - You really think they're that good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, so, thanks for the offer.<eos> But I've got to run.<eos> I'm just grabbing this coffee for my dad, so...<eos> Oh, I forgot to ask.<eos> How was your night?<eos> Oh! It was... it was uneventful.
Look, I...<eos> There has to be more to this than money.<eos> I really want to care about what I do.<eos> Don't you ever miss getting your hands dirty - and selling?<eos> - I've moved up in the world.<eos> I'm not freezing and covered in sap.<eos> I'm making spreadsheets.<eos> It's like Old Man McCue used to say.<eos> The reward is in the destination.<eos> It's not in the journey.
I mean... I-I don't know, honey.<eos> You're the doctor.<eos> Why don't you explain?<eos> No, as always, I think we should eat in silence.<eos> I second that.<eos> It's out in the open.<eos> - They might as well know the facts.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Okay, let's say this chicken is your mother.<eos> It's not.
If it were a memorial service, then I might agree, but a stone edifice on the green, to remind us for ever of death and a pointless war - what's the good of that?<eos> To say nothing of the waste of money.<eos> Forgive me, but you're talking nonsense.<eos> Forgive me, but I suppose she's allowed an opinion.<eos> Not that opinion.<eos> Not in this house.<eos> I think what she means is -<eos> She is here as your friend, so of course you must defend her.<eos> But was the war worth fighting?<eos> What did it achieve, beyond the Russian Revolution?
- What's next?<eos> - Ta-da.<eos> I know this crest.<eos> It's from the Order of the Knights of Raina.<eos> It means loyalty.<eos> To their queen.<eos> Not just their queen.<eos> "The" Queen.<eos> When I was collecting souls on the battlefield; knowing who served whom ... I had to memorize every crest there ever was.<eos> See this crown, how it hovers over the coat of arms?
You're a scientist.<eos> You are really, really gonna dig this.<eos> This is the Origin Seed.<eos> The Seed.<eos> No, Massimo.<eos> I will do anything.<eos> Please, please do not eat that.<eos> Whoever takes this seed will have the combined power of the Una Mens.<eos> And that means all power.<eos> And it is all mine.
Previously on Helix...<eos> - You believe you can save her?<eos> - No, but Julia can.<eos> - It's incredible.<eos> - So it worked.<eos> Ugh, this migraine, it's killing me.
No, you can't.<eos> You know you can't.<eos> You'd wither away anywhere but the Hill.<eos> It's never been about the money, no matter what you tell yourself.<eos> When I left, Frank begged me to stay.<eos> Power vs. money, he said.<eos> Don't reduce myself to a tax bracket.<eos> He was right.<eos> And I doubt he begged.<eos> He was half right. Power is better than money, for as long as it lasts.

- They're gonna come in here...<eos> - Art!<eos> This comes straight from the director.<eos> He wants Howard's head on a stick, and he wants it yesterday.<eos> Idiot!<eos> Colonel, we're ready for you downstairs.<eos> We're not through with the questions.<eos> Time to start your debrief.<eos> My trip to Montreal...<eos> is it happening soon?
Are you a communist sympathizer?<eos> Oh, good lord. No.<eos> Your system's a disaster.<eos> Uh, my future wife spends a lot of money, and I'm going through an expensive divorce.<eos> To your wives, then.<eos> _<eos> Something's wrong?<eos> Let's talk about your information, hmm?<eos> - What?<eos> - It's good.
Come on.<eos> We're gonna be late for math.<eos> - I'm not going to any more boring classes.<eos> - You're just gonna cut?<eos> No, I'm just not gonna go because I'm in my 60s.<eos> Teacher's lounge.<eos> They got a TV in here.<eos> - We can't go in the teacher's lounge.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Um, it's for teachers only.
- I just had to win.<eos> - And did you?<eos> Yep.<eos> Know what the winning word was?<eos> Responsibility.<eos> Is that what you feel?<eos> A responsibility to win all the time?<eos> To always be the best?<eos> That's one way to put it.<eos> And this responsibility -- where does it come from?
Yep.<eos> Know what the winning word was?<eos> Responsibility.<eos> Is that what you feel?<eos> A responsibility to win all the time?<eos> To always be the best?<eos> That's one way to put it.<eos> And this responsibility -- where does it come from?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> It's just... there.
That's if Klaus doesn't get you first.<eos> So, what, maybe I should hide out in bucktown like you?<eos> I think you're here because you don't want to leave your home.<eos> I sure as hell don't want to leave mine.<eos> A battle is brewing, T, and while everyone's busy choosing sides,<eos> I'm gonna find a way to take back our city, so...<eos> You with me?<eos> You were always great with words, Marcel, but it's gonna take more than a big speech this time.<eos> Is that really necessary?<eos> The sickness, it's... It's overtaking my inclination to forgive, replacing it with one thought that I could barely contain at the summit...
It was just for a second, but it was him.<eos> I don't know, Cami.<eos> I mean, maybe he's still in there underneath all the crazy, but the crazy is pretty thick.<eos> Maybe he just needs a shock to his system, something to wipe the slate clean.<eos> Josh, I think I have an idea on how to fix him.<eos> Can I help you find something?<eos> Yes.<eos> In fact, I believe you can.<eos> I'm looking for a book about yay big filled with our mother's most powerful spells.<eos> It appears to have been misplaced.
I assure you, once I am finished here, you will have my undivided attention.<eos> In the meantime, please stay out of trouble.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> Elijah is with me.<eos> Uh...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> That wound should be healing by now.<eos> She never killed anyone, never activated the werewolf Gene.<eos> So she can't heal, not like us.<eos> My blood, it could heal her.
So sad about her uncle, by the way.<eos> Kieran is in transition.<eos> He has been released from the hex.<eos> A hex of that magnitude?<eos> Kieran's hex will return...<eos> If it hasn't already.<eos> No!<eos> Not yet, priest.<eos> There's more work to be done, a final offering to complete your penance, that which you hold most dear.<eos> That boundary spell, on the other hand, now that he's died, I imagine it won't be quite so confining anymore.
Look, dad, I don't have time for this, okay?<eos> Nick is on his way over here right now, and I don't want another episode.<eos> The Grimm is coming here?<eos> I didn't come here to argue.<eos> Oh, what, you got a few more cultural cliches for me to live by, or what?<eos> Dad, listen, I have no interest in trying to change you or mom, okay?<eos> But I do have a very real interest in living my life my own way.<eos> I get it.<eos> But believe me, that's not the real problem.<eos> This friendship, if that's what you call it, with the Grimm, it goes against everything we believe in!
Look how high these ceilings are.<eos> Check out this crown molding right there.<eos> That's priceless. Whoa.<eos> Oh, there's a massage table.<eos> Yeah, I'm taking classes at the Swedish Institute.<eos> Cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you let me practice on you, I could knock a few dollars off the rent.<eos> Abbi, you gotta check out the sink.<eos> It's so deep, you could wash a baby in there.
One of you is gonna tell me what it is I want to know.<eos> How lucky are we, Agent Hersh?<eos> I thought I was getting Arthur's broken toy, Samaritan, but you, Harold...<eos> I know who you are, what you've done for us, but since you stole my device, I've been worried its intel might dry up.<eos> That's why you've done these terrible things to Arthur, obliterated his wife's identity, stolen her life... all for a contingency, a plan B?<eos> But now you're here.<eos> A plan B might not be necessary.<eos> You can tell me where you hid my program.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It moved itself.

The chance of disaster.<eos> We fail, we learn, we fail.<eos> My program was too perfect.<eos> You're talking about evolutionary algorithms, genetic programming.<eos> That day, Harold, I broke it.<eos> I forced it to delete bits of itself-- its code, its blood-- and then reboot.<eos> Rebirth...<eos> Flailing in the dark.<eos> A loop, ten times a second, and after ten hours,<eos> Harold, 360,000 mutations, it would live or die trying, and it lived.

Come on.<eos> Say they're my...!<eos> Say they're my children.<eos> Babe...<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, I got a package for a Kevin and Donna Russell?<eos> I'm...<eos> Donna.<eos> I'm also, uh, tracking down a missing package.<eos> Uh, it wouldn't have, uh, landed on your doorstep, would it?
I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot?<eos> Is it a little? That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.<eos> Hi, I'm Mr. booby buyer.<eos> I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels.<eos> It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline.<eos> Rats!<eos> What a shame.<eos> Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out.<eos> You keep heckling my adventure, Rick!<eos> - You know why? - Uh, because it's lame?
- Morty Jr.?<eos> Oh crap, he named it.<eos> Well Dad, it's a living thing. And it's half human.<eos> And it was born on America's soil which entitles it...<eos> Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake.<eos> Don't punish us for it.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm gonna take this thing into my workshop, and do a little bit of investigating.<eos> Do not let that thing out of your sight.<eos> It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous.
You know, the guy on TV?<eos> Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff from a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but [beep] with you in unforeseeable ways?<eos> Bring it to "Curse Purge Plus".<eos> I use science to un-curse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers.<eos> This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster, but guess what?<eos> He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless.<eos> I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I don't know, $8 million.<eos> See you at the olympics.<eos> This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family.<eos> Now it does their taxes.
Oh, come on.<eos> Don't look at another man's portal-gun history.<eos> We -- we all go to weird places.<eos> Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occurred.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> That's Rick-diculous!<eos> I'm obviously being set up.<eos> Earth Rick C-137, the council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you've known becomes impossible to grasp.<eos> Also, every 10 seconds, it stabs your balls.
Sit down, Esther.<eos> You shouldn't even be here.<eos> This is man's business.<eos> It's about the children.<eos> Mother.<eos> And that makes it woman's business.<eos> A mother's heart is a tender thing.<eos> These good men are trying to spare every mother in this town.<eos> War is a beast, yes.<eos> It consumes the young.
Previously on Arctic Air...<eos> If I'm going to stick around, full partners.<eos> You want my company, it's yours.
Underground, perhaps?<eos> You think no one can get to you?<eos> You think no one can touch you in the safety of your hidey hole?<eos> Felicity...<eos> But I can.<eos> How bad?<eos> Tockman used the skeleton key to penetrate our firewall.<eos> And recode our security.<eos> Basically, he told our system to commit suicide.<eos> And it did.
Ms. Queen.<eos> I wanted to offer my sincere condolences on your loss.<eos> Your mother was a good woman.<eos> She would have made a wonderful mayor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'd love to speak with Oliver.<eos> Well, if you see him, tell him he missed his own mother's funeral.<eos> No one's seen Oliver for a few days.<eos> We all deal with grief in different ways.<eos> And the loss of a parent is... Well, it changes you.
It was a lie that killed her.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Slade Wilson.<eos> He was on that island with Oliver.<eos> And despises him for some reason.<eos> There was a psychopath in our lives and my brother never warned us about him.<eos> Thea, your brother loves you more than life itself.<eos> You should keep that photo.<eos> This sub is over 60 years old.<eos> It was carrying the Mirakuru during the war when it ran aground.
Stay back!<eos> How did you do that?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> We failed.<eos> Jafar has the heart.<eos> There's no stopping him now.<eos> I'm not so sure about that.<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> The needle... it's following you.<eos> Is it following me... or or is it following the staff?
Have faith that my plans proceed as they must.<eos> I intend to take my rightful place at the appropriate time.<eos> The Bible has offered me no guidance here.<eos> So you've turned to another book?<eos> Oh, Lupo.<eos> The Book of Leaves is a distraction.<eos> Here my brother and I agree.<eos> Your brother has hidden the page from me.<eos> Locked it away in the bowels of the secret archives, forbidden me from even touching it.<eos> It cannot solve the world's ills.
Wait, you pay $80 a month?<eos> I know.<eos> So what's this new job?<eos> Oh, I'm writing for this big comedian now.<eos> Do you know Lou Cannon?<eos> Is he the one that's Jon Stewart?<eos> - No.<eos> - I love Jon Stewart.<eos> So how's the job?<eos> Honestly, Oscar, it's bad.
I'm a workaholic.<eos> Ooh, my fingers.<eos> I can't feel...<eos> Rub your fingers together. It will help the circulation.<eos> Tex, let's lift up your shirt.<eos> Garnett's lost blood flow to her fingers.<eos> She's hypotensive.<eos> I'll get the saline.<eos> This rash...<eos> You have any idea when it started?

Oh, my God, there's Parker.<eos> Parker, hey.<eos> Ilana.<eos> Ilana Wexler.<eos> From NYU.<eos> We were roommates for a second.<eos> Oh, my God, Ilana, you're so cute.<eos> So what's this party for?<eos> It's amazing.<eos> It's for change.
That...<eos> That was poetry.<eos> It was the California raisins making a sex tape.<eos> - Not to me.<eos> I was moved.<eos> Horse...gone.<eos> See ya, guys.<eos> I don't think I'm ever gonna get that man's saggy scrotum Outta my head.<eos> - Or her ass.<eos> It was so, uh, wrinkled.
Hey, drop your weapon!<eos> Got him!<eos> Suspect down, corner of Morgan and 18th.<eos> Officer down... medical assistance required.<eos> - Yo, nice shot, T. - No.<eos> - He got me in the arm.<eos> - No, no, no, you got him.<eos> No, he got me right in the arm.<eos> No, T, I'm looking at it.<eos> It looks fine.
(Ilana) You should come down here.<eos> Sit in your seat, you brought me here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Scene!<eos> We're gonna take a quick break and be back with another hour of Statutory Crepe!<eos> Woohoo! (Ilana) Oh, my God, that was the worst thing I've ever seen.<eos> I feel like I've been hate-crimed.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> The dot's back!<eos> (Abbi) Ew, it's still in Times Square!
Hi, would you mind making sure they don't take those clams?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I know you're in your head, but... this birthday is a maje improvement from last year's.<eos> Yeah, well, I shouldn't have tried to throw myself a surprise party.<eos> You should have tried.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> Hi.<eos> Want a hit?<eos> Thanks for the food.<eos> It's amazingly delicious.
- I need a night out, Josh, please?<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> I mean, anything for you, Mae.<eos> I don't think I've ever been in a room with a baby and no adults before.<eos> Aw, she's so cute.<eos> Is she?<eos> I just can't get my head around the fact that I could make a child.<eos> Yeah, every time I look at my sperm, it doesn't seem that magical.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> It never looks that impressive.
Yeah.<eos> It's old so it must be... good.<eos> Oh, and it's Asian.<eos> I can never understand why middle class white people think that Asians are magic.<eos> - Well, I don't think they're magic.<eos> - Yeah, they've just mastered energy.<eos> I mean, what is this energy?<eos> How are they manufacturing this energy?<eos> - Look, it just...<eos> - Where does it come from?
- Like a shark.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Stop it.<eos> What are you reading?<eos> "History of Sexuality."<eos> You're reading an erotic book?<eos> No.<eos> How much have you read?<eos> About half.<eos> What's it about?
He has all the sensations of having been hurt in the automobile accident.<eos> It takes him a long time to recover, because he's still wearing the automobile accident.<eos> If you said, "hey, why don't you take "this automobile accident and throw it away?"<eos> Well, all of a sudden, he recovers from the automobile accident, naturally, because the thing that's keeping it impressed upon him and his body is his mind.<eos> An auditor is a practitioner in scientology.<eos> He listens and he computes.<eos> We have a meter.<eos> A meter simply shows where an individual is aberrated.<eos> The e-meter is a very powerful instrument.<eos> It's one-third of a lie detector.
I believe that, yeah.<eos> You know, there isn't and hasn't been any effort which has been taken to, quote, "silence critics."<eos> "No, that doesn't happen.<eos> "Oh, we would never do that."<eos> But according to many insiders,<eos> Hubbard was growing more and more vindictive toward those who stood in his way.<eos> He created what he called the rehabilitation project force.<eos> The rpf was what we called it.<eos> It was the prison camp, where you'd go for re-indoctrination.<eos> It was on the 7th floor of the Hollywood headquarters, a confined space to rehabilitate members who might be harboring subversive thoughts.
We were not only suing them in every possible jurisdiction there was, we were investigating the IRS for crimes generally, or things that would offend the public.<eos> These hearings into IRS integrity...<eos> In the late '80s, there were hearings about IRS abuses that had nothing to do with scientology, had nothing to do with nonprofits, had nothing to do with churches.<eos> They had to do with Joe taxpayer.<eos> And they we were publishing these glossy, expensive magazines.<eos> In fact, the exposã©s of IRS crimes were so hated that possession of "freedom" magazine was banned by IRS officials in the IRS building.<eos> There is going to be a IRS conference in the catskills.<eos> Right? And so we would send a pi, find out which hotel it's gonna be at, get down there during happy hour, socialize.<eos> And this guy's tallying who's drinkin' what.<eos> And so we go through freedom of information act to find out that the taxpayers are paying the bar bill, and it's so much money.

There's things that we can do to help.<eos> They even did a calculation, where they figured between his films and all the "opinion leaders" that he had met and all the travel he had done...<eos> Tom cruise has introduced lrh technology to over one billion people of earth.<eos> No question, he has been a huge asset to them.<eos> Which is why the story of tom cruise, scientologist, has only just begun.<eos> I think it's a privilege to call yourself a scientologist, and it's something that you have to earn.<eos> Scientology loves to use this word "end phenomena."<eos> Every level has an end phenomena, you know, that you attain, and tom cruise shows that.<eos> That video with him in the black turtleneck sweater?<eos> A scientologist is someone who can look at the world and really see what it is.
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS MAN SNIFFS<eos> FAINT WHIRRING SPEAKS HALF-FORMED WORDS<eos> George-could-murder... m-m-m... m... BEEPING<eos> Please give me a description of the man. PETE:<eos> OK.<eos> That one is...<eos> What is your emergency?<eos> I mean, none of them will hurt you.<eos> If you could read me the serial number.<eos> It's just inside the bottom lip.
DISTORTED: Hello.<eos> Do you recognise me, Max?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Max...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, there's holes in his root code everywhere and they're growing.<eos> His mind's breaking down.<eos> - His brain's been without power for too long.<eos> Their root code rewrites itself constantly as they learn, think and feel.<eos> It degrades.
- Where is she?<eos> - Don't know. She hasn't come home yet.<eos> If what you say is true, and you are actually our friend, then why am I still a prisoner?<eos> You haven't agreed to help me yet.<eos> You could snap my neck in the blink of an eye.<eos> I'm an optimist, not an idiot.<eos> Hm.<eos> When I was very young, my father brought me an injured fox cub he found.<eos> Its leg was broken... crushed.<eos> It could not survive.
We might be able to get out.<eos> No, no.<eos> You could get hurt.<eos> You can't protect us anymore, Mum.<eos> We don't need you to.<eos> And that's OK.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Dad, you in?<eos> First problem, they've already taken Leo's laptop.<eos> It's in their van outside.
So, we need to run some tests.<eos> We'll make you comfortable.<eos> You can't just keep me here!<eos> Well, I've had a chat with our lawyers and legally speaking, you're not entirely human, so your rights are, well... a bit of a grey area.<eos> PHONE VIBRATES<eos> Hobb.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I'll be right there.<eos> I'll have them bring you down some soup.<eos> It's really quite good.
I thought she was a person -- a friend.<eos> Do you think Hobb's got her as well?<eos> I'm not sure what's happening, but I know he's the key.<eos> Mr and Mrs Hawkins.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> We have a computer with copies of Leo's memories.<eos> They show everything.<eos> If you don't let Mia and the others go...<eos> - .. we'll take it to the press.<eos> - Where is it, then?
Well, if it's worth anything, you're not a shitty teacher.<eos> You've given me hope that I might be able to control what happens when I'm cut.<eos> Why did you lie to me about Azra?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I know the way, but it's all jumbled in my head.<eos> That's why I thought the Widow's book would help.<eos> I got my compass to work.<eos> I put it in the cutout of that book.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did it point somewhere?
He didn't catch a fish that day.<eos> No.<eos> No, you -- you caught a fish, a small one.<eos> Daddy?<eos> He wants to know why you're keeping him here.<eos> There's something in me...<eos> A voice.<eos> And when it starts, I can't ignore it.<eos> I can't think about anything else until I go out... Find someone...<eos> And then it goes away again...
I wasn't worried.<eos> I've faced bigger challenges.<eos> Like trying to dress Jonah Hill for the Oscars.<eos> Okay, okay, perfect.<eos> Tell him to stay exactly that weight.<eos> Yes?<eos> Damn it!<eos> Oh, my God, Brian.<eos> This ship, it's... it's unbelievable.<eos> It's even more magnificent than I imagined.
- It's not important.<eos> Veracruz, what you mean it's not important?<eos> What you need to know was that officer was complaining because your sister was only carrying six ounces of coke when they stopped her.<eos> Six?<eos> That's a misdemeanor.<eos> She should have walked that same day.<eos> And then she got arraigned... felony possession.<eos> And the arrest report said that she was carrying eight ounces.<eos> Over the limit.<eos> I went to the courthouse to look at the arrest report, but it was sealed.
- Amen.<eos> Thomasin, what's thou done with the silver cup?<eos> Is't not on the shelf?<eos> Nay-<eos> In the six board, then.<eos> T'ain't there neither.<eos> It's been disappeared for some while.<eos> Didst lose it?<eos> I've not touched it.<eos> Where has it gone then?
And?<eos> That night Alex mentioned when you said you were at the hospital, but it was actually flooded, do you remember where you really were?<eos> No idea.<eos> Why?<eos> I was just thinking about it earlier today.<eos> That night.<eos> The night of the storm.<eos> I was in Saudi Arabia negotiating a radar sale.<eos> CNN reported on it, on the storm.<eos> It was bad. I was worried.
But I'm also paying him a visit.<eos> He'll be suspicious if I didn't.<eos> Look, Kiera, if you really could go home, would-<eos> In a heartbeat.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Find any way of doing it?<eos> You know the first thing Kellogg's skeeze corp will look for is a virus.<eos> Send in a virus, who catches a cold?<eos> Emily does.<eos> Not if it's in a pre-existing one.
I'm not protecting him.<eos> Why are we lying to Carlos?<eos> We need to preserve that site until we know more.<eos> If what you discovered about the anti-matter fuel cells is true, then-<eos> This is all about you, then?<eos> What about Kellogg and his plans?<eos> Whatever he's up to is going to ensure that I get what I want and Kellogg gets what he deserves.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> Garza and I were investigating Kellogg's soldiers.<eos> They're building some sort of machine, I don't know what it's for.
Everything's changed.<eos> The energy patterns here?<eos> They're not explosive.<eos> They're implosive.<eos> The device is literally punching a hole In the space-time continuum.<eos> And what is that?<eos> It's a tethered wormhole.<eos> Uh, you want to try explaining that to me Like I don't have a degree in physics?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's like an elevator, But instead of going up and down It moves through time.
Drop your weapon!<eos> Back up.<eos> I need everyone to take a step back.<eos> I need an ambulance at the Essex Street subway platform for a gunshot victim.<eos> This is an officer-involved shooting. [Cellphone beeps]<eos> - Did he have a gun?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did you pick it up?<eos> - No.<eos> Where is it?
I need an ambulance at the Essex Street subway platform for a gunshot victim.<eos> This is an officer-involved shooting. [Cellphone beeps]<eos> - Did he have a gun?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did you pick it up?<eos> - No.<eos> Where is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> - Where is it, Korsak? !
[Cellphone ringing] You wouldn't even know it was kale.<eos> [Cellphones beep] Gross, Ma.<eos> Rizzoli. - Isles.<eos> - Got to go, Ma.<eos> - I'm gonna bring you a snack at work.<eos> - Chocolate cake!<eos> - Oh, god.<eos> Really?<eos> - What?<eos> It's not white.
Wait a minute.<eos> What about the family home?<eos> The deed says it's still owned by Jeffery's mother and father.<eos> We're gonna need that address.<eos> - I warned you not to go near that door.<eos> I go out for 10 minutes to get us a nice bottle of wine, and this is what you do?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Where's my dinner?<eos> I'll get it.<eos> When I say I want my dinner on the table, - it damn well better be there!
And I'm sure he told you he would take care of you no matter what, get you the best lawyer money could buy. [handcuffs click]<eos> Where is this lawyer?<eos> [door opens] Don't say a word.<eos> Move.<eos> And over the last few years,<eos> Ainsley's become increasingly unhinged.<eos> And where was it, again, you said he might've hidden some evidence?<eos> He has a small cabin off upper Mystic Lake.<eos> It's not registered in his name.<eos> I think it's on old Pine Ridge road.
Oh, god, I'm so sorry I'm late.<eos> Angela, sweetheart!<eos> You look fantastic.<eos> - Come here. Come here. - Aw.<eos> Nice to see you, Carlo.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you too, honey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I will leave the two of you to catch up.<eos> Before we sit down, I need to use the restroom.<eos> - It's broken.
There were 15 Daniel o'Neill narratives all stuck in with other patients' files.<eos> So... we're looking for the serial killer/psychopath checklist, huh?<eos> - Fire, torture.<eos> - Voyeurism, antisocial behavior.<eos> I wonder how long it took his mother to realize there was something really wrong with him.<eos> Well, for most parents, I think there's a significant degree of denial that has to be overcome, as well as the guilt about having your child be such a person.<eos> I can't imagine.<eos> "Fire is alive.<eos> I love to watch it breathe, jump around, dance.<eos> It consumes everything that falls into it, that I put into it.

Do you have anything case related to share?<eos> Yes.<eos> To figure out how the poison was ingested, I had the victim's stomach contents analyzed.<eos> I found coffee, salmon, kale, brown rice.<eos> - All were contaminated with strychnine.<eos> - That's a breakfast I'd skip.<eos> But the small amount of food was not consistent with the large amount of poison in her system.<eos> So, I sent a tech over to the house, and he found salmon, kale, and brown rice in a container in the refrigerator labeled "dog food."<eos> All tested positive for strychnine.<eos> Well, if the poison was in the dog food, why didn't it kill the dog?
Witches draw their magic from different sources.<eos> Katrina's power flows from nature.<eos> Others from fire, from the moon and the stars.<eos> Blood magic is one of the dark arts, a destructive form of sorcery that taps into base, evil forces.<eos> Here's the security cam footage from the auction house.<eos> I thought it proved inconclusive.<eos> Huh, some kind of electrical surge wiped out most of it, but a few frames survived.<eos> Called in a favor from a friend at Quantico.<eos> They're experimenting with a new image enhancement algorithm.<eos> It isolates pixels off reflective surfaces in the environment.
All you monks do is spout off such nonsense.<eos> I'm telling you to not be rough!<eos> What's wrong with being rough?<eos> And he isn't lost.<eos> Starting now, he's my disciple!<eos> Disciple?<eos> I told you already.<eos> You forgot?<eos> You're taking a human child as your disciple?<eos> It doesn't matter whether it's a human or a broom!
he said he knew that Damon had been dipping into shadier collectibles, like the bones of serial killers, but he just looked the other way.<eos> Shady business brings shady people.<eos> Maybe Harlow was doing some after-hours deal with somebody, and the sale just went sideways.<eos> And Harlow paid with his life.<eos> So if the killer swiped the knife off the table, maybe he left something behind.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Let's check the tablecloth for touch DNA.<eos> I was also thinking, since Harlow was dealing in illicit goods, it might make sense to learn about the product.<eos> The knife.<eos> You know, it might bring us closer to some of his shadier associates.
Whatever she has planned tonight, I'll be there.<eos> Ready to take a drive?<eos> You want me to get in that?<eos> Cruella enchanted it to drive itself, Or you could take the wheel if you prefer.<eos> Yes, I'd very much prefer.<eos> Where are the other two?<eos> Don't worry about them.<eos> It's just you and me tonight, like old times.<eos> You have to try some of this cake.<eos> It's delicious.
: I'm sorry about that guy Galecky not hugging you from behind in the water on a motorized thing...<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> We will finish what we have started!<eos> Yay! We will feast on the spoils of this night for a thousand moons!<eos> In the name of love and booze!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> My crush is back.<eos> I hate myself.<eos> Oh, this person will not stop texting me.<eos> Where is it?
God willing.<eos> He poisoned them all.<eos> That child has gestated in death.<eos> It must not be born.<eos> It's Rachael.<eos> She's inside.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's the baby.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> It's hurting me.
Did your God teach you to do that?<eos> Henry, what'd he say?<eos> I think ma truly believes that.. Rachael's baby's hurting Jacob.<eos> - Hurting him?<eos> - Luce, this guy's pulling everyone's strings.<eos> I'm going to check on him.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> That child.<eos> It's never known anything but death.<eos> It's not like us.

B-but then...<eos> War.<eos> The war for Emerald City.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> Until not so much.<eos> We were gonna lose, so I made a deal with the wizard... of Oz.<eos> Wears a hood and a creepy mask, kind of a jerk ... good times.<eos> He said for us to win, I had to unleash my true darkness, which he meant literally.<eos> He used the inner key of Oz.<eos> It opens a door to your soul and lets the darkness out.
Possession with the intent to distribute.<eos> Ten years.<eos> You coming down with something?<eos> Oh, no, it's just one of the problems of being around sick people all day.<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen, I, uh...<eos> I pawned a lot of the clients stuff, the ones who died.<eos> But I would never kill anyone.<eos> Why wasn't Scott's phone with the others?<eos> I could have sworn it was there.
Maya, you all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Inside.<eos> Shaw's wounded.<eos> And Winthrop and Briscoe are dead, I think.<eos> Let's roll, boys.<eos> Check the back.<eos> Briscoe's dead.<eos> I got a pulse, but it's faint.
You pay taxes on it.<eos> You guys need a front, and I'm sorry, Allie, but your garage-made soap's not going to cut it.<eos> - I... I have a plan.<eos> - You do?<eos> What plan?<eos> It's something I've been mulling over for a while.<eos> It's a business plan.<eos> We have five minutes.<eos> So, this protein.<eos> It's in my blood.
- I... I have a plan.<eos> - You do?<eos> What plan?<eos> It's something I've been mulling over for a while.<eos> It's a business plan.<eos> We have five minutes.<eos> So, this protein.<eos> It's in my blood.<eos> That's right.<eos> It's similar to something we found in one of... uhm, your husband's brothers.
Okay.<eos> Well, you figure out how I diagnosed this woman's paradoxical emboli stroke on the operating table.<eos> You got two hours.<eos> [laughs] Seriously?<eos> Ticktock.<eos> Ticktock, okay.<eos> [chuckles] Okay.<eos> No, no, no, no, you can't cut the ghost.<eos> Hamlet needs the ghost.<eos> It's what urges the hero to...
Exactly.<eos> See, we couldn't either.<eos> But if you look really closely, see this area here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - It suggests blood flow between the chambers.<eos> Yes, and remember, Dr. Harris was once married to a heart surgeon.<eos> Suspecting a heart problem, we went up into the ICU and asked the patient if she would consent to a bubble study.<eos> And she did, which is why we're late.<eos> [chuckles] Sorry.<eos> It shows that she has patent foramen ovale...
Jimmy: Wow, Maggie.<eos> That was some detective work back there.<eos> You're a regular Miss Marple.<eos> Is that how you see me...<eos> as an aging spinster?<eos> Thank you.<eos> No, it's just, uh, you know, how you solved this, uh... [inhales deeply] Okay, forget it.<eos> So, anyway, um, a friend of mine gave me this gift certificate for a seafood restaurant, and I'm wondering if you'd like to go.<eos> How's that celibacy experiment going?<eos> Uh, well, it's off... in theory.
It's what's happening right here.<eos> Smell tells us everything we need to know.<eos> We can smell if someone is sick.<eos> It's not a good idea.<eos> We can smell if a woman is ovulating-- very good idea.<eos> We can smell fear.<eos> We can smell revulsion.<eos> We can smell... desire.<eos> Now, this perfume does not smell like desire.<eos> It smells like a bouquet of fresh flowers, which is telling us what, exactly?
I can't sleep.<eos> When hell freezes over.<eos> But I'm miserable.<eos> I also threw up.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the john.<eos> But I still feel awful.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll get you some ginger ale.<eos> It'll settle your stomach.
And that was 10 years ago.<eos> The bloom is off the rose.<eos> Hm.<eos> Perhaps. Which is why I've decided to give her my name.<eos> Just my name-- no "MD" after it-- and put it together with hers on the next book.<eos> Kind of a renewal of our vows.<eos> And you think that's gonna make a difference?<eos> It's a little too late.<eos> You've pushed her too far, no?<eos> Well, in my experience, when the train is pulling out of the station and you're not on it, you run twice as fast and twice as hard to make sure it doesn't leave without you.
People are probably going to die during this hurricane.<eos> I am doing this for those who will live.<eos> That's-- that's ridiculous.<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> The health department is here!<eos> - What if I did the dance and no singing?<eos> - That's even worse.<eos> Jim, I'm just disappointed in you that you don't understand this.<eos> The dance is ironic.<eos> It's a commentary on the failure of our leaders to do anything.
Wonderful, actually.<eos> But it was a one-time thing.<eos> I don't want to hurt another woman.<eos> No, no, no. I told you we're separated.<eos> Y-yeah, we still live in the same house, but you can be together and be separated.<eos> How would you do that, magic?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me tell you what I love about you.<eos> I love that you say that you like American chocolate.<eos> Although we both know it's not as good as the British chocolate.
Come on.<eos> There.<eos> One sample of damning DNA evidence coming right up.<eos> Sorry, Sherlock.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Pros will take it from here.<eos> A cigarette butt?<eos> Is that supposed to mean something?<eos> It was recovered at the scene of Shana Baker's murder.<eos> Preliminary DNA tests indicate it's yours.
I know exactly who.<eos> Ursula.<eos> She sold us out for a reunion with daddy dearest. Gold: All right.<eos> We may have lost our informant,<eos> But we still have his information.<eos> Bring us the illustration of the door.<eos> Maybe there's something in it the puppet missed.<eos> I suppose this is farewell.<eos> It is, but first, I have to hold up my end of the deal.<eos> Gold's plan... I'm afraid it involves Emma.
Never thought you'd see me again, did you?<eos> I was certainly hoping not to.<eos> Then why don't you make this easy and give me back what you took?<eos> Can't do it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> With one whistle, I can send a hundred snarling dogs after you.<eos> You could, but you and I both know that even with all your magic, you don't have enough power to hurt me.<eos> I do hate it when you're right, darling.<eos> Though I do like this new shade of confidence.<eos> It's so... masculine.
I'm not going into a land without magic without bringing some of our own.<eos> The Snow Queen's scroll...<eos> in case we have any trouble getting through the cloak put around this town.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> What is it?<eos> Something on Lily?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One of my contacts found an address.<eos> But it's five years old.
You are not as responsible for your own misery as you would believe.<eos> The deck has been stacked against you, Lilith, and it's not your fault.<eos> Everything you do will be harder.<eos> And I owe it to you to let you know why.<eos> I owe you the truth.<eos> Okay, Yoda.<eos> Enough riddles.<eos> What's the truth?<eos> Let's start with the necklace.<eos> It isn't exactly a stone, but it did belong to your mother.
No.<eos> What is it?<eos> You were forced to marry her.<eos> You are not in love.<eos> I would think a child born of passion Would be your choice as heir to your kingdom.<eos> My sister's blood is pure.<eos> I would be obligated to choose a son from her womb, And she would remain my queen.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This sword was given to me by ka when we were children.<eos> It was his father's.
You're safe.<eos> Uh, w-- uh, what about Mr. Reddington?<eos> He's, uh, pursuing his own leads.<eos> Aram, the doctor?<eos> Yes, right.<eos> Uh, sorry.<eos> Okay. Her name is Dr. Selma Orchard.<eos> She's an attending in neurology at Walter Reed and was part of a team that discovered a gene that makes it possible to erase memories.<eos> I'm sorry. Erase memories?<eos> Yeah, the gene is known as TET1, and it's critical to a process called memory extinction, where painful events are replaced with more positive associations.
No!<eos> Zeke?<eos> You should be in the principal's office.<eos> He was... um, 'cause I took him, obviously.<eos> She never took him.<eos> She never took him.<eos> Tina, is this true?<eos> Yes.<eos> How's your cell phone doing?<eos> It's dead.
- What?<eos> Um...<eos> The, uh... condom...<eos> Isn't here.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Uh...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I don't see it.<eos> Uh...<eos> It's gotta be somewhere.
It's up to us.<eos> I should've known Margaux was too smart to play dumb.<eos> God, if this gets out...<eos> It's gonna destroy Jack.<eos> How much time do we have?<eos> She's releasing it tomorrow.<eos> Well, then, we'd better get hacking.<eos> If your computer system's been compromised, it's likely to be a cyber attack.<eos> We'll send over a task force.<eos> The computer in question is air-gapped, which means it's untouched by the Internet and therefore unhackable.
That's usually more cramp-like.<eos> OK, um, should we...<eos> - I think we should go to the hospital.<eos> - How? She can't drive.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> - Why do you get to drive?<eos> For one thing, I'm a way better driver than you.<eos> - You had to take the test twice.<eos> - Because it was too easy.
A gift from Captain Irving.<eos> John Dee's Grand Grimoire.<eos> The enchantments within the Grimoire are the most powerful ever assembled and most dangerous.<eos> Whoever holds it is capable of so much destruction.<eos> I no longer seek wanton carnage, Mother.<eos> I've found my path.<eos> To bring back our kind.<eos> Our kind?<eos> You mean the Awakening Ritual.<eos> I tried the ancient rite this morning, but it didn't take.
No, I'm okay, thanks.<eos> I can't dance on a full stomach.<eos> Well, I didn't know you could dance at all.<eos> Hanna says you've been taking lessons since you were four.<eos> Three, I stopped when I was in seventh grade.<eos> My mother was hoping for a ballerina instead of a jock.<eos> Emily, do you think she knows what she's getting herself into?<eos> I'm having disturbing flashbacks to that campaign for Homecoming Queen.<eos> That was different.<eos> This pageant isn't about proving something to herself, it's only about winning tuition money.
I've been offered a chance to make things right for your sister and her friends.<eos> Mona, what are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about exposing "A" and finally bringing that person down.<eos> Is that your blood?<eos> Yes.<eos> And soon it's going to be smeared all over this house.<eos> And Alison DiLaurentis is gonna look responsible for killing me.<eos> Because "A" wants to see her locked up.<eos> Why would you want to be involved in all this?<eos> Because "A" came up with this plan, Mike, and it's brilliant.
If things get worse, I want you to find a way out.<eos> What do you mean out?<eos> Out, away, gone.<eos> I want you to get on a plane or a boat and go somewhere where they can't find you.<eos> Caleb, I can manage as long as you're safe.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> Well, that's what I want you to do.<eos> Promise me.<eos> Well, is the phone number a dead end or not?<eos> What if it's Mona's and it's a dead end?
You walk in this apartment unemployed again, you're gonna be the one on the table getting your insides Hoovered out, and trust me, I am not playing.<eos> I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.<eos> Layla?<eos> Annie?<eos> Rich people always have the best bathrooms.<eos> I thought you split.<eos> It's a bright, sunny morning in the Age of Aquarius, and that meth-head is somewhere else by now.<eos> Yeah, that wasn't a meth-head.<eos> I'm not even sure it was human.<eos> Whatever the fuck it was, it went straight for my chest.
I'm clearly being set up here.<eos> Obviously, someone knew that I was coming to see you.<eos> That's your lead, not me.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> It's not sophisticated, but she was right.<eos> Somebody did know that Rebecca was going to see Gibbs.<eos> Her cell phone is bugged.<eos> She and Diane have been texting about Gibbs for weeks.<eos> Can you trace the bug?<eos> It's pretty unique.
Like a bad itch.<eos> When it gathers its Intel and tries to phone home, we can trace it back to Sergei.<eos> In theory.<eos> Do you remember what happened last time?<eos> It blew out all of our systems.<eos> The furnace overheated, almost burned down the building.<eos> I've learned from my mistakes, okay?<eos> I've been studying this virus.<eos> I think I can defang it with this.<eos> It'll run, but it won't have any teeth.
A new life.<eos> Drink up.<eos> You frightened me before.<eos> Where did you go swimming?<eos> There never was any drowned boy.<eos> Nicolas!<eos> You're a good boy.<eos> Nicolas!<eos> See its mouth?<eos> It's scary.
Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you see three kids just walk through here --<eos> Claire bennigan?<eos> Yes?<eos> Mother of henry bennigan.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think it's safe to assume any attack would come from the sky.<eos> So -- so the fact that the -- the last rock we found Was buried under the sahara desert doesn't mean anything?<eos> Wes, we know it crashed when it collided mid-flight With sean bennigan's plane.
I mean, Leon didn't have any siblings or any other children I can see, and Tommy was never married, so I...<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What?<eos> Tommy did have a son, estranged, who lives with his mother in Ohio, uh, Austin Reynolds, 12 years old.<eos> Is the kid still alive?<eos> As of an hour ago, yeah.<eos> He updated his status.<eos> But, I mean, come on.<eos> It's a kid.
Full sail, please!<eos> Can you just get her to calm down, so the Guard guys don't revolt?<eos> Laverne, you read?<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> You might want to ease up a bit.<eos> It's like none of these knuckle-draggers have ever done electrical work before.<eos> Well, most of them haven't.<eos> And yet they call themselves men.<eos> You got the trouble census?<eos> Yeah, it's... here.
- Nathan?<eos> - Parker!<eos> It's stuck.<eos> Nathan, the door won't open.<eos> It's stuck.<eos> It's not, it's locked.<eos> Well, unlock it.<eos> I can't.<eos> The chair moved by itself.<eos> It was attacking Audrey.
I met a guy on a cancer support chat group online.<eos> Said he had access to black market Lindrexia and said I could have some if I helped him distribute it.<eos> Did you ever meet with him in person?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> It was always a dead drop.<eos> No one was ever there.<eos> Lung cancer.<eos> Kicked it twice.<eos> It came back a third time.
Well, can you tell how far he ran?<eos> That would narrow down where he escaped from.<eos> Well, I can give you time, not distance.<eos> He ran for about 30 minutes, adrenaline pumping on full.<eos> Well, that'll add a few square miles and... several thousand buildings to the search.<eos> So that makes it more difficult.<eos> I also analyzed the tissue using liquid chromatography, and it didn't help with the ATP levels, but it did turn up traces of etorphine.<eos> Isn't that an opioid?<eos> Yeah, a very strong one.<eos> It should have knocked him out completely.
Did you get a stripper?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, Roman sent them up as a gift.<eos> "Them." So there were more.<eos> Two, more?<eos> Yeah, there were two.<eos> The cops called me down to the station.<eos> They played that 911 recording of the guy who found Andreas' body.<eos> So?<eos> So whoever made that call sounded like he was trying really, really hard to disguise his voice.<eos> How do you know they're disguising their voice if you don't know - who it was in the first place?
Then you got 10 minutes to row away before it goes boom.<eos> My God.<eos> I thought that Sackett wouldn't let you touch this thing.<eos> Let's just say I grew on the bastard.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure you did.<eos> How on earth do you navigate this while underwater?<eos> Ah, Ben Franklin suggested to Sackett to coat the gauges with foxfire.<eos> You know, from dead trees.<eos> So now the compass glows in the dark.<eos> And I'll be damned, Benny, but it works.
Only Mr. Dubrovensky never delivered. He kept it for himself.<eos> But you couldn't complain to the auction site or go to the police. Not without admitting that you had tried to purchase a very valuable stolen object.<eos> You track Mr. Dubrovensky down, you confront him, things go poorly.<eos> I'm not sure how you knew to frame the SDS cartel for his murder, but, I don't know, perhaps you bought furniture from him before.<eos> You're right, I did buy that bureau.<eos> But if you're saying this Dubrovensky person was the seller-- okay, sure.<eos> I only ever knew him by his account name.<eos> Ms. Conway...<eos> He threw the flower in for free.<eos> It's in the conference room if you'd like to see it.
I understand why you waited to tell me. Um, I do tend to react poorly to change.<eos> Well, like I said, this shouldn't be much change at all.<eos> I'll still be at the precinct all the time.<eos> Even if you weren't, it's your life, Watson.<eos> I've no right to a monopoly.<eos> Uh, the truth is, I've been considering a change of my own.<eos> It's completely unrelated to your news, I assure you,<eos> (phone ringing) but it has been weighing on my mind and I thought I should apprise you of it.<eos> (ringing continues) Um, isn't that your phone?<eos> It can wait.
Our owner wanted a celebrity clientele. Somebody told him not to put them in.<eos> Then I'd like to see your receipts for Monday night.<eos> It'll help us figure out who was here.<eos> Yeah, you can have whatever we got.<eos> Including...<eos> Hold on. There was a phone.<eos> One of the servers found it under that table at the end of the night.<eos> We figured it might be hers. Don't.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> It's not hers. It's a disposable, but it might be his.
I won't pretend for a moment that there aren't questions that need answering, but every piece of evidence that we have can be reviewed, every assumption we'd ever made can be reexamined.<eos> I will help you do that, but you should prepare yourself for the possibility that your uncertainty... is the only uncertainty that remains.<eos> Someone hurt me, Sherlock.<eos> You hurt yourself.<eos> You don't know anything about how I am feeling.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hey, it's Del.<eos> I tried you on the company phone, but it went straight to voice mail.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Oh, it's dead.
Who was that?<eos> Kitty, what are you doing...?<eos> Who was that?<eos> My boss at Leda.<eos> Del Gruner.<eos> Why?<eos> You said I could come here if I ever needed to.<eos> You gave me a key.<eos> Kitty, tell me what's going on.<eos> Before we got De Merville on the phone the other day, I wondered... what it would be like to hear his voice again. After five years, what it would do to me, if I would even recognize it.
This will remain the case.<eos> You will attend court, dance, flirt, gossip, play cards, seduce<eos> but henceforth you will do it in my service.<eos> You will tell me what people are doing what they are saying who is sharing a bed with whom who is cheating on their wife and who cheats at cards.<eos> If you disobey me, you will suffer the same fate as your mother.<eos> From now on I own you.<eos> That is my offer.<eos> Very well.<eos> - Why this color?<eos> - Because it's regal.
All my orders.<eos> I wasn't crazy.<eos> These coolers are full of brains.<eos> Zombies are real, liv.<eos> I'm gonna kill them all.<eos> It is like a cult over there at max rager.<eos> It's this secret report that max rager had these seriously dangerous side effects.<eos> Your product kills people and you know it.<eos> The memo does exist.<eos> It'll bring max rager to its knees.
"need to talk." dollar sign.<eos> Dollar sign.<eos> Dollar sign.<eos> And then she gives a phone number.<eos> You say, "she," but look at the timestamp.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> This came in a week after kimber died.<eos> The killer sent this.<eos> Nate called the number the day he got the message and had a three-minute conversation.<eos> Of course, i called the number today, and it's a dead line.
I've been misusing the word "literally"!<eos> [intercom beeps] and certainly overusing.<eos> [electricity crackles] [tango music playing] [archer] you're not worried?<eos> [lana] why should I worry? Because I'm the one that ripped of conway's hand?<eos> No.<eos> About-- or that he'll double-cross us again?<eos> Which, a blowjob says he does.<eos> And mother and slater and the cia are idiots for trusting him,<eos> But I'm talking about us flying on the same plane, lana.<eos> What if it crashed?
We can't just expose all our secrets to the world.<eos> - It's on top shelf!<eos> In the fridge. - Oh!<eos> - Hello... I'm in here.<eos> - Oh, I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Our shower's still busted and I got rounds.<eos> You know what?<eos> I told him a thousand times...<eos> You put the bread on the counter, it molds.
Hey.<eos> Hey. Oh. Perfect.<eos> Okay, first you berate me on the phone, then you show up to my office and berate me in per...<eos> Oh, w-what is this?<eos> I don't care for this.<eos> We got in an accident.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> We almost got in an accident.<eos> That seems like a really important distinction.<eos> There was this big truck, and it barreled through a stop sign, and it missed our car by inches.
You sure, Manny?<eos> Positive.<eos> I-I'll walk home.<eos> - We almost died.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> White.<eos> Yes, I'm sure.<eos> Why is it so hard for you to imagine that a criminal can be white when most of the...<eos> Ah, the bicycle.<eos> Yes, yes, it was white.
Why are we stopping?<eos> Ohh.<eos> Oh, my God! I thought I lost you.<eos> What's to tell?<eos> A truck runs a stop sign, I avoid it, everyone walks away...<eos> Bing, bang, no boom.<eos> - Um, there was a truck!<eos> - That was crazy!<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - Where did it even come from?
I'm not proud of it.<eos> What's wrong with my baby?<eos> It's... it-it's like it's carrying a virus.<eos> And it affects the fetus.<eos> And the mother.<eos> But it happened to you and you're alive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But my baby was extracted from me before it reached full term.<eos> "Extracted"?<eos> Did-did it survive?
There's something you need to know.<eos> We have Molly Woods in custody.<eos> She's dying.<eos> What?<eos> Her final wish is to see Ethan.<eos> Dying of what?<eos> We recovered the hybrid bodies for research.<eos> We're going to conduct some tests.<eos> Ethan...<eos> I'm leaving you this video log... in hopes it helps you fill in the blanks one day.
Um, now, baby, here.<eos> You get busy bringing these aliens back to Earth, okay?<eos> And don't you wander off now, you know?<eos> Gonna pay my respects.<eos> - I don't want to be alone, Daddy.<eos> - Don't worry, I'll be back.<eos> Please.<eos> Want to help the Galactic Attack?<eos> Here's the thing about tofu tuna.<eos> It tastes like tofu that's been stored in dirty socks.
John knew I had a way to shut them down.<eos> A kill switch.<eos> Taylor decided to stop him.<eos> So Taylor killed my husband?<eos> Taylor knew that if John shut down Humanichs, the human race was in danger, because Humanichs were the best defense against the invasion.<eos> If Taylor discovered... that humans were threatened with extinction... what would he do?<eos> If he had to kill a billion people to save eight billion... that's just what he would do.<eos> So, the kill switch is the amulet.<eos> It is.<eos> Unfortunately... it disappeared when the government confiscated my property.
- There's... no going back, Ares.<eos> Down here, the young ones call you the "hand of death."<eos> You invented the hybrid-virus.<eos> You chose your side.<eos> I made mistakes.<eos> They were more than mistakes!<eos> They were lives!<eos> MOLLY: We have to stop running and stand together.<eos> Your problems are not ours.<eos> Okay, look... look, in a few hours, a new virus is gonna be released on the world, and it's gonna kill humans and hybrids alike, and it's gonna spread.
Why not me, too?<eos> No.<eos> No, honey.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Charlie and Julie are inside right now finding a way to protect you.<eos> We... are gonna figure this out.<eos> But if it doesn't work, this is what needs to happen, Mom.<eos> We both know that.<eos> We don't have to time to build and upload a true antivirus, but we could target the first few lines of the worm's code.<eos> Maybe we can get Ethan's neural net to reject it before it does any real damage.
The future says:<eos> The man who has broken my heart is too the man in whom I fall in love?<eos> That...<eos> That's then Carl.<eos> My... my ex husband.<eos> Wait, I'll check it again.<eos> Well: Your next great love has to do with your broken heart.<eos> This ex is sitting now with a physiotherapist in a bungalow in the Maldives and hear Rihanna.<eos> You have to go out and increase your hit rate.<eos> - It is zero.
Who gave you this name?<eos> Jesus Christ of Nazareth.<eos> don't you honor your father, Peter?<eos> I do.<eos> But apparently less than you honor a man put to death for blasphemy and sedition.<eos> Peter is a nickname, a term of endearment.<eos> It simply means "my rock."<eos> You see, a rock can be something to build with...<eos> A new temple, for instance.<eos> Or it can be a weapon.
Do you suppose it's possible that they knew you were coming, that someone had alerted them?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't think so.<eos> There... there was no sign that anyone had fled our arrival.<eos> But, um...<eos> There were no women at the market today?<eos> The men seemed to have decided to keep women out of sight.<eos> I trust you, Stephen, which is why I want you and Philip to look after the camp.<eos> Really?<eos> It's growing so fast, and we have so many new converts.
You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.<eos> The Lord will send on you curses, confusion, and rebuke in everything you put your hand to until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him.<eos> We all knew we'd have to make sacrifices.<eos> That's what Jesus told us, Stephen.<eos> Not like this.<eos> Shall we go home... To Galilee?<eos> You mean to live?<eos> Why not?<eos> The camp's set up.<eos> It's growing.
- Whoa, this is all on you, I gotta bounce. - Hey!<eos> You know what? If you run this league like you run your business?<eos> You know what?<eos> Your kid couldn't play hockey on a basketball court.<eos> Happy hour at Molly's, two for one drinks for every dad in pee wee's, huh?<eos> So, what do you guys think?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's my dad's old footlocker from the Navy.<eos> Sylvie mentioned you guys needed a coffee table, I thought this would be perfect.<eos> It's great.
If this gets out, I'll lose my placement, the parish, everything we've worked for.<eos> You really think you are fit to be a priest?<eos> You fraternity boys are dropping like flies.<eos> Maybe I'll pass on the membership.<eos> I don't think you've got what it takes.<eos> Badge of honour, the oath of allegiance, come on.<eos> Even Inspector Sullivan will make the connection in the end.<eos> The police have got nothing on me.<eos> Maybe they'll perk up a bit when they find that prayer book of yours.<eos> That's to say if it's still in your room.
I don't know.<eos> See these?<eos> The tumor's tentacles are expanding into uncharted areas of his brain.<eos> And activating regions in impossible ways.<eos> I guess giving him the ability to...<eos> Overload electricity?<eos> It's what Neuroprosthetics is based on, right?<eos> The ability of the brain to control objects wirelessly.<eos> And in Alton's case, this tumor is allowing him to take that to the next level.<eos> So, whoever's behind these experiments, they're trying to see how far they can evolve the brain, what it can do?
No. I mean, she talked about her sex life on the air all the time, but her lovers always got code names.<eos> The All-Nighter, Sir Cries-A-Lot.<eos> So, there were a lot of lovers?<eos> From what she said, yeah.<eos> I don't know any names or anything, but everybody around here knew she had a thing for men already in relationships.<eos> Do you think one of her lovers did this?<eos> We'll look into every possibility.<eos> This way.<eos> This is the line to Sasha's mic.<eos> It should ground into this panel, but the killer ran it over there into the backup generator.
I can't do worse, Elena, ok?<eos> I didn't even think that there was a worse.<eos> It's better this way.<eos> Better?<eos> Care, you're talking about flipping the humanity switch.<eos> There's nothing better about that.<eos> That is your experience, ok?<eos> I have more control over my vampire self than you ever did.<eos> My experience will be different.<eos> It's not gonna be different, care.
They're using a monitor cable as a land bridge.<eos> Now they're destroying our technology.<eos> This is an invasion.<eos> They're in my yogurt.<eos> Now it's personal.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> We have gotta fight back.<eos> This is our planet!<eos> Just use Boyle's cologne.<eos> It's repulsive to everything.
She sees that some clients stay out of the papers and others are in.<eos> (Kiki) I'd like for you to donate a vehicle to City Bounty Food Bank's benefit next week to be auctioned off at Cipriani.<eos> It's a nice event.<eos> It's a good photo op, Jimmy Fallon.<eos> Oh, I love him.<eos> (Thanassis) We show who Harry is.<eos> You're not a man who batters children.<eos> You're a man who saves them.<eos> (Thanassis) Hmm? I can turn Harry into that man.<eos> But I need a character witness who will get on the stand, someone of unimpeachable pristine credentials, and it cannot be an employee.

You going to sleep?<eos> Uh, maybe, yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Because I was thinking you need a suit for the trial.<eos> Could go buy one in the morning.<eos> I have a suit.<eos> (Rosie) No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It's slightly iridescent, but the pants match the coat, and that's what makes it a suit.
Mrs. Weschler, do you breast-feed your son to help him get to sleep?<eos> (Rosie) Yes.<eos> Even after consuming three or four alcoholic drinks?<eos> I wouldn't...<eos> I wouldn't feed him straight away.<eos> I wouldn't... Not...<eos> And you breast-fed Hugo at the barbecue at certain points, did you not?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> (Thanassis) More than once, twice?<eos> I'm sorry, but you have to answer the question so that it's on the record.
Sure.<eos> This isn't due for another three weeks.<eos> [Sighs] I know.<eos> We're going on a vacation.<eos> Well, you know, your insurance is not gonna cover it.<eos> It's okay, I'll pay for it, and they'll reimburse me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be back in a few minutes.<eos> (Dr. Fletcher) This is good.<eos> I was worried the baby was in breech, but it turned around.
Thank you for getting us the luxury box.<eos> - Yeah, thank you.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> It's not many times a year I have the opportunity to rock this.<eos> You have a bolo for every occasion.<eos> No, but I will by Hanukkah.<eos> It lights up.<eos> Hey, I wanted to see what time we should be at the game tonight.<eos> Ooh, I rented a party bus, so no one has to worry about drinking and driving.<eos> It'll leave the courthouse promptly at 6:00
- Mommy.<eos> You guys, I'm not gonna make it.<eos> Just tell the story of what I did here.<eos> Rosebud.<eos> Hold on, Tedward.<eos> Don't you have an earthquake kit underneath your desk with a bunch of granola bars in it?<eos> Gary, I found your phone in my office.<eos> You weren't snooping by any chance, were you?<eos> No, that's weird.<eos> I don't know how it got in there.
Bank's probably gonna be closed for a while.<eos> I recommend the branch over on Magnolia until they get the blood out.<eos> Go Kings!<eos> If we get on that bus right now, we will be in our seats when the puck drops.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Let's do this, people!<eos> No, no, no. Nobody's going anywhere till we figure out what happened to my last granola bar.<eos> Oh, there it is.<eos> That's funny.<eos> It was in my holster the whole time.
- A new hobby?<eos> - An old one, actually.<eos> The care and feeding of Gotham City.<eos> That's one of the things that drew us together, wasn't it?<eos> The Waynes and the Vanavers have both spent generations... trying to make this city great.<eos> My father had a saying:<eos> "Tomorrow is one dream away."<eos> Sentimental words, I know, but they stayed with me... even after my parents were killed.<eos> Rather than focus on the demons, on the darkness, on all that's wrong with Gotham... something I've been guilty of for too many years... it's time to focus on how exceptional this city is.<eos> And how much better it can be...
I'm a good mom-- ask anybody.<eos> I was just thinking about my kids.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Okay, Christine, the tea is ready to be poured.<eos> Look at this.<eos> And Daddy has an extra big piece of cake for Buddy.<eos> Buddy isn't hungry.<eos> He just wants you to read a special book.<eos> What am I gonna do with all this cake that I got?<eos> It's gonna go to waste now.
He's messing with us.<eos> It was another trick.<eos> Is Dwyer there?<eos> I'm here, Hank.<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> I got C-4 taped to her body.<eos> He set up this whole... this whole perimeter around her.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need you to find the trigger.<eos> I'm showing no receivers or transmitters checking in, so it's either on the bomb or it's wired to it.
Nurse Shipton, a woman's been killed.<eos> Niceties have to be set to one side.<eos> Freddie!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll pump by hand.<eos> All day, if we have to.<eos> Sweet Lord Jesus.<eos> Nurse Shipton, I... I didn't realise.<eos> He's completely dependent on the machine.<eos> If it stops, he dies.
How is that possible?<eos> I think he was using the bank's money to prop up Billy's business and keeping it off the books.<eos> He needed to recoup his losses.<eos> He knew I wouldn't be able to repay a loan quickly, so... he turned me down.<eos> But why was he setting up a charitable trust when the bank was short of money?<eos> - I didn't know he was.<eos> - What was Billy's business?<eos> An exclusive members' club.<eos> Well, that was the idea.<eos> In reality, it was as seedy as they come.
- Yeah. Yes, please.<eos> [whispering] Son of a bitch.<eos> - What? - Nothing, take it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Huh. (Morgan) Yeah, this guy in the subway, I asked him if he was done with his coffee, and he was sleeping, so took it.<eos> Wait a minute, Morgan, is that a dad penguin protecting his baby penguin from the Arctic cold?<eos> Well, yeah, it's the "Nature's Dads" issue, so good call, Eisenstein.<eos> [chuckles] Can I borrow it?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> So cute, it's just nestled up next to him.
- For protein.<eos> - I'm gonna kill you.<eos> (Jeremy) Good morning.<eos> As you're no doubt aware, the practice is once again facing a moment of crisis.<eos> I know!<eos> The homeless guy sleeping in our courtyard is back.<eos> I keep finding his trash out there.<eos> I'm buying a BB gun.<eos> You can use my gun.<eos> It's in the fridge.
But admits to theft.<eos> Well, you saw Jess Chambers.<eos> She seemed keen to avoid us.<eos> Didn't you also think it odd, what he said, that there's no way she's a beginner. Why pretend?<eos> She wanted to be here for some other reason.<eos> Jake, maybe?<eos> - He was an attractive man. - Mmm.<eos> Married, though.<eos> Dr Slater, er, one quick question.<eos> And we do need to ask, tricky though it might be.

Was it a happy one, do you think?
Sir?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - The postmortem's in.<eos> A 9mm bullet was recovered from the heart.<eos> Death almost instantaneous.<eos> Gunshot residue on the victim is consistent with being shot at close range in a struggle.<eos> I've been through these now, Chief.<eos> All the fingerprints at the workshop either belong to the victim or those who we know were at the school.<eos> And Jake Peters' fingerprints are on the bullets.<eos> Implying that he might well have had a gun, though the wife denies it - so where is it?
It was a good day to die.<eos> He spent his last hours with the woman he loved doing what he lived for.<eos> He then came back to his workshop.<eos> He locked the door.<eos> He staged a struggle.<eos> Stripped himself of his valuables and hid them away.<eos> And then the final act.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> The gun would still be there.<eos> Well, it was.
All right, well, we're gonna get it out of you, okay?<eos> How? !<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> We...<eos> Man, that was a dumbass move coming here alone.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I should have let the machete brothers cut my buddy's head off.<eos> Well, if you did, maybe you wouldn't be choking down a damn Khan worm right now.<eos> What's a Khan worm?<eos> You think that's what it is?
You know that, right?<eos> I should have let the machete brothers cut my buddy's head off.<eos> Well, if you did, maybe you wouldn't be choking down a damn Khan worm right now.<eos> What's a Khan worm?<eos> You think that's what it is?<eos> Or some sort of freak cousin.<eos> Freak cousin of what?<eos> A couple years back, Dean and I worked a case.<eos> We got stuck in a cannery with this worm.<eos> It would get into people's bodies and -- It was freaking awful.
Now, I found Tiliacora triandra, leaves used in kaeng nor Mai som.<eos> Thai food.<eos> Yeah, wow, very good.<eos> Well, we had a Thai family in the cooperative.<eos> Ooh, Thai coffee would be good about now.<eos> Since I also found traces of fish sauce and coconut milk, as well as the palm oil, I decided to check out Thai restaurants in the area.<eos> Chan Yim Thai.<eos> That's only a couple blocks away from the game.<eos> That might be where Jeff Dover was murdered.<eos> And the metal that was left in the wound, it wasn't from a knife, it was aluminum from a trash can.
No, we're moving, but we just have to figure some things out first.<eos> Would we really move without Dad?<eos> Of course not, moron.<eos> James, enough of that.<eos> No, Michael, we would not move without your father.<eos> But your father can be stubborn sometimes.<eos> But eventually, he always comes around and sees the error of his ways.<eos> Mom, can you tell us what the new house looks like again?<eos> Okay, put your heads down on your pillows and close your eyes.<eos> It's on a beautiful tree-lined street, and right on the front lawn is a giant, 100-year-old sycamore tree.
I got it!<eos> Oh, you seriously need supervision.<eos> Okay, now we know what polonium is.<eos> How do we find out where Dr. Lin was poisoned?<eos> A Geiger counter.<eos> This puppy will clickety-clack whenever it's near the stuff.<eos> Look at this.<eos> How long is it detectable?<eos> Well, polonium's not the kind of thing you just wash off with Ajax and bleach.<eos> It hangs around.
And then in high school I kept going and he stopped.<eos> When was the last time you ran together?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> Do you?<eos> I don't know what I believe about anything anymore.<eos> What do we got?<eos> Brody and Borin are working on getting a warrant for Cam's house.<eos> In the meantime, I found out the Omnicore development project?<eos> It's worth $300 million.
- Clear.<eos> - Clear.<eos> Clear.<eos> They got prison cells in Angola that's nicer than this.<eos> No bags.<eos> Bed's made.<eos> Room's awful neat.<eos> Guys...<eos> Placement of this dresser is off.<eos> Indentation marks in the carpet where it used to sit.
So we're gonna have to pick this up first thing tomorrow morning.<eos> Hopefully we can get the address by lunch.<eos> You guys...<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm never gonna clear that case fast enough<eos> To get in two more by Thursday. Hey. Yes, you can.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> Oh, my god. I almost forgot to tell you.<eos> I think I saw my old van the other day.<eos> Yeah, michelle and I were having lunch, And it turned left on riverside.
Oh, that's a long one.<eos> Did you at least get the medicine?<eos> I tried, and I failed. Miserably.<eos> But I'm willing to work this out in counseling.<eos> (groans) We've been to every counselor from Avery to Zabinsky.<eos> But not Zilowitz.<eos> HOMER: And that's why there'll never be another golfer as good as Chi-Chi Rodríguez.<eos> The name and the game, he had it all.<eos> Okay, I think we got a little off-track here.<eos> I know this marriage isn't perfect, or even great, but now I treasure the moments where it's just so-so.
LAUGHTER Well, Ron Greenwood had good reason to be worried, and that's the point.<eos> Football trophies do have a history of going missing, and Aston Villa seem to have been more to blame than anyone else.<eos> In 1895, their FA Cup was stolen from the window of a sports shop in Birmingham and, 63 years later, a man called Harry Burge confessed that he had been the man who had stolen it, - and he had melted it down and made counterfeit half-crown coins. - Wow!<eos> The second major trophy to have been mislaid by Aston Villa<eos> - was the European Cup in... What year did they...?<eos> - 1981.<eos> Yes, they mislaid it in '82. Two members of the...<eos> - 1982.<eos> - It would have been, yes.<eos> Two members of the team decided to take the cup to a darts match, where it disappeared.
- Break the sound barrier.<eos> Break the sound barrier, unaided.<eos> And it was the highest balloon ascent ever.<eos> Those are three records - the highest balloon ascent, biggest freefall...<eos> - Do you know what else it was, Stephen?<eos> - What's that? It was "incrensely" dangerous.<eos> Incrensely...<eos> It was incrensely dangerous!<eos> But it was the largest balloon ever constructed.<eos> And let's have a look at how bigot it was.
Not hunting beasts or mutants or whatever freaky things are threatening the world.<eos> I can't always cover for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Yes, actually.<eos> Do not go pestering JT, either.<eos> I know that he is helping you track down Bob and Carol, but he... he has his own issues to deal with.<eos> Oh, what's going on?<eos> It's that, uh... the healing factor in that serum.<eos> It's... it's accelerating.
Just, um... a few nosebleeds, that's all.<eos> Nosebleeds? Yeah, but the doctors think it's probably just a reaction to the attack.<eos> Wait, you don't think it's a serum symptom, do you?<eos> No, no, I-I don't think so.<eos> I mean, I'm not getting any, so how could it?<eos> I just wish I knew why the hell that maniac's still after us.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You're not the regular doctor.<eos> No.<eos> I'm just checking on your oxygen tank, making sure it's full.
What was that for?<eos> For trying to save my life.<eos> Well...<eos> Ditto.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Coming?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You didn't answer your phone.<eos> Sorry, I... I didn't even hear it ring.
He's our computer specialist.<eos> He's in charge of the mail robot.<eos> It was actually his idea to upgrade the message-delivery system.<eos> Okay, mangia, sweetie, before it gets cold.<eos> You may be right about Zinaida.<eos> What did you find out?<eos> Nothing definite, but, uh... I was looking around the Rezidentura, asking questions.<eos> And, uh... something doesn't seem right.<eos> I have a way we can know for sure.<eos> It's risky.
Turn right in 50 feet.<eos> Um, Billy, I don't think this is the way to taco town.<eos> What do you know?<eos> Your phone's 3g.<eos> Trini doesn't make mistakes.<eos> Continue for .3 miles, then turn left.<eos> [ sighs ]<eos> It's freezing.<eos> Can you please turn off the air?<eos> It's not on.
- Idiot.<eos> Whoa, wait a sec.<eos> The train's coming today?<eos> - Today?<eos> - Yeah, less than two hours.<eos> We're not gonna have enough time to get to the dead drop and get the rail charges.<eos> the train itself is an explosive.<eos> - T3 torpedoes, rounds for deck guns.<eos> - Ok, here's what we do.<eos> We get inside the train when it stops for servicing, take apart the casings, rig them with pencil fuses.
For a laptop purchased in Rego Park.<eos> I have the BIA, which means if someone is using the laptop<eos> - we can find them in real time.<eos> - How?<eos> I'll just enter the I.D., into our system, see if it pings anywhere.<eos> If not, we'll have to submit warrants to all the telecoms, so maybe we can find it that way.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ahem.<eos> That was fast.<eos> It's in the building.

It's reading as passively connected.
And-and I would do anything to help her.<eos> We're in love.<eos> Love is imaginary.<eos> What's real are those chemicals.<eos> Which ones did you give her?<eos> Phosphorus trichloride and liquid trans-methyl propylaxine.<eos> Now, the third one that I haven't brought her yet is O-ethyl methyphonic acid.<eos> Combined, these chemicals make pesticide.<eos> They can also be adjusted.<eos> If you methylate the phosphorus trichloride, it forms methyl phosphorus dichloride... Which, when combined with the liquid trans-methyl propylaxine and the O-ethyl methyphonic acid, creates tiny particles.
Dr. McGee insists on having all the latest technology.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> I spotted you, at the rally today, and I'm guessing you saw what happened.<eos> Cisco, I can't come back.<eos> Okay, check this out:<eos> we found this on a victim at the nuclear power plant, but the badge shows absolutely nothing at all, which is so weird.<eos> What's also weird is that at the same time that meta-human grew, all the x-ray machines within a mile radius just went belly-up.<eos> - Cisco.<eos> - Just... if you could just... See if the badge was tampered with or something.<eos> I mean, if it's broken, or...
Ron!<eos> Oh. What's wrong with this picture, Ron?<eos> Uh...<eos> There are actually customers in here!<eos> Right.<eos> (sniffing) Smells... yeasty. (sniffing)<eos> I've never smelled this tangy... (sniffing) sour... yeast here before.<eos> Oh, uh, well, we have started baking bread, so maybe you're smelling the yeast from that. Yeah. And where is this yeasty bread, Bob?<eos> Uh, we, uh... we threw it away.<eos> It wasn't any good.

And you better have sausages, Bob!<eos> We'll have it!<eos> BOB: So, this is what the kids have been up to?<eos> I had no idea it was, like, you know, actual racing.<eos> It is a beautiful day for racing.<eos> Hey, want a hit?<eos> Sure. Thanks, Crit.<eos> Mmm, this homebrew of yours is oh so refreshing.<eos> Your bread is, uh...<eos> Whoop, hey, there it goes!
Sure. Thanks, Crit.<eos> Mmm, this homebrew of yours is oh so refreshing.<eos> Your bread is, uh...<eos> Whoop, hey, there it goes!<eos> Got away from me there.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Uh, you-you kind of threw it.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> So it didn't get away from you.
Water hemlock.<eos> Found exactly where we thought it would be.<eos> In the wood near the campsite.<eos> It's so similar to the rest of the herbs - someone must have picked it, put it in the pot and voila. Big mistake.<eos> Yes, possibly.<eos> But it still doesn't explain how an excess of the same poison ended up in Francis's system.<eos> Er, I don't suppose you came across his journal lying about in the woods, did you?<eos> ~ Er, no, Chief.<eos> ~ I'm convinced it's significant.<eos> I, erm, spoke to Ryan about his father's Jeep - he's no idea where it is.
Then, when she died, I decided not to go back.<eos> Hmm, right, well, then how come you spent a number of hours watching the group from the woods, on the day of the re-enactment?<eos> You go to the camp, acquire some water hemlock and when the Society members aren't looking, slip it into the stew and leave unnoticed.<eos> You think I killed Francis?<eos> That's preposterous.<eos> We can prove you were at the woods.<eos> But why?<eos> Revenge?<eos> Ah, the journal at last.<eos> It belonged to Francis.
Uh, of course.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll brew you that tea and then we'll get--<eos> - Coffee.<eos> - Sir?<eos> We're going to resolve this matter tonight.<eos> We?<eos> William, do you know what a moral conflict is?<eos> No, sir.<eos> It occurs when one's most deeply held convictions do not match one's actions.
Yo, thank you, Ricky.<eos> Thank you, man.<eos> You a fucking lifesaver, man.<eos> We're teammates now, brothers-in-arms. You'd do the same for me.<eos> Yeah, man. I'm sorry about the car.<eos> Listen, that was all me, man. The other fellas had nothing to do with it.<eos> - Yeah, I had a feeling.<eos> - But we cool on the number.<eos> Shit, 18 all yours, baby.<eos> It look good on you.
~ See. ~ .. bad for your chap.<eos> ~ My what?<eos> ~ Your chap.<eos> Uh, honestly, listen to this.<eos> "Cyclists aged over 40 are considered "at greater risk of erectile dysfunction."<eos> Yes, thank you, Dr Clarkson.<eos> That's fascinating.<eos> What about The Stig?<eos> Oh, he's just on public transport, as before, yeah.<eos> ~ Well, now, you see, last time, as you know, I used a speedboat to go across London, but at the end, it couldn't go on land, so I had to run, which cost me the race.
If slithering about is your thing, you can have fun in the Huracan...<eos> Ye gods!<eos> ..but you need an enormous pair of gentleman balloons...<eos> .. and your own personal airfield to play on.<eos> And, for me, this is where the problems begin.<eos> This Huracan has been designed, on the road, to feel tame and user friendly.<eos> You don't get that special Lamborghini mentalist feeling, unless you are here, with an entire airfield under your wheels.<eos> And that's a bit of a heartbreaker, actually.<eos> And while we're on it, there's another issue.<eos> And it's a big thing.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> We were just goofing off.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Go home.<eos> This is where I live.<eos> Then go someplace I can't see you for a long time, okay?<eos> You know, we really work well together.<eos> Maybe we should start another project.<eos> Maybe I could even fund it.<eos> At least till it gets off the ground.
(laughs, sighs) It's gonna put a serious hitch in these little hanky-panks.<eos> I'll just stop by the house.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Well, what's this about, then?<eos> This... is why I married you in the first place.<eos> The man in 25B.<eos> Going dark on me?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Well, I paid for that house.<eos> And now it's mine.
Not a penny.<eos> Pass the red?<eos> ♪ And I feel nothing... ♪ We need you out here.<eos> - Huh? - Like right now.<eos> - Damn it!<eos> - It's a computer game, okay?<eos> Calm down. I'm sure it's nothing.<eos> Let me just check the root file.<eos> - (speaks Russian) - Bad software hit our network.<eos> - It's overwriting our data.
- No!<eos> - ...is vulnerable.<eos> We have users online.<eos> We're not... we're staying up.<eos> - It's starting on "Parallax."<eos> - Christ, this thing is fast.<eos> - There goes chapter two.<eos> - Can somebody call Donna?<eos> Yo-Yo: We couldn't find her number.<eos> - What? - It's on a Post-it somewhere.
All right.<eos> So, I'm gonna ask you again, what is going on?<eos> Look, I can't tell you, all right?<eos> I have to speak to Avery.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> It was a match.<eos> The print lifted from that hourglass we collected at Dr. Chan's office.<eos> Did you get a name in AFIS?<eos> Actually, was an FBI database, a reference print.<eos> It was mine.
I know you don't want to hurt me.<eos> No, but I have to.<eos> Come on.<eos> Tell them I'm armed and dangerous.<eos> Say it just like that.<eos> Armed and dangerous.<eos> All right, nut job.<eos> Hey. What'd he do?<eos> He came at me with a knife.<eos> - It's right there.
And you?<eos> Oh, getting by.<eos> I hope you don't mind my asking, but...<eos> A fire?<eos> I was trapped in one at my old school.<eos> I don't remember much about it.<eos> Lucky to be alive, they tell me.<eos> Was it the school fire at August Ele--<eos> Elementary on 38th, about... 8 or 9 years ago?<eos> Yeah, it was.
What's up, Tommy?<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> (Tommy) Why are you helping him?<eos> Hmm?<eos> The van.<eos> It was registered to the community center.<eos> You gave it to Simon Moran.<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I just noticed it was missing this morning.
You're serious?<eos> Man, I...<eos> I just thought, you know, that was pillow talk.<eos> Well, this used to be an old coal mine before we repurposed it.<eos> And old mines means old ordnance.<eos> Old ordnance is dangerous.<eos> And by ordnance, you mean...<eos> Dynamite, TNT, mercury fulminate.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, it's unstable as hell.
What's the alternative?<eos> We just leave her here?<eos> Life support's gonna fail in less than six hours.<eos> Yeah well it's a merciful end, compared to that one.<eos> We're not leaving anyone behind.<eos> Well that's not up to you.<eos> May I offer a suggestion?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> The ship's infirmary is equipped with an isolation chamber.<eos> It would be more than adequate for quarantine purposes.
There is no mistake.<eos> Look, if it was me, I would want to go while I still had my wits about me, and in control.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Alright guys, I should be right outside your position.<eos> I can see a small hull breach.<eos> Yeah, that was us.<eos> We had a little accident.<eos> We sealed it off though.<eos> Alright, I can see another airlock, looks like it's intact.<eos> It's two levels down and about 100 meters aft.
- Last season on Gotham...<eos> - It's in here.
This is your report from the bridge.<eos> Ship's engines are operating within acceptable parameters.<eos> At current rate of travel, we should be arriving in approximately 11 hours and 23 minutes.<eos> I've programmed an eight a.m. wake-up call for the crew to ensure you'll all be ready by the time we dock at the station.<eos> Tomorrow's breakfast will be comprised of hydrated protein packets, bacon and egg flavor, as well as orange juice.<eos> Hey!<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight!<eos> I'm looking for a ship called The Raza.<eos> I hear it may've come through here a while back.
No, you weren't part of this.<eos> Get back over to the loser side, loser.<eos> All right. Worth a shot.<eos> So how'd you pull it off?<eos> Well, it all started when I went to tell Jake how badly he hurt my feelings, and he yelled at my breasts.<eos> Oh, boy, I am not going to come off well in this story.<eos> Nope.<eos> Remember when you set off the witch?<eos> You made Captain Holt flinch, which was weird, since his door was closed, but not weird, since he actually heard it over a bug he planted at your desk.<eos> It was in an old muffin that you never threw in the trash.
Mm. So it's kind of your fault too.<eos> Pass the blame.<eos> The buffoonery is endless.<eos> You're gonna pay for what you've done.<eos> And it won't be cheap.<eos> They'll have to custom-mix the color because they no longer make raspberry sherbet.<eos> They're all so beautiful.<eos> And they're all about to be tested... bouncy-styles.<eos> ♪ To the wall ♪ I love this mattress.<eos> And it loves having you in it.
But he's about to learn himself a lesson.<eos> Right about... Nah...<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Ow.<eos> Timed it perfectly.<eos> What?<eos> What did you do to my cupcake?<eos> This is yours?<eos> Why on Earth is your cupcake on my chair?<eos> Because it's very special to me, so I can put it wherever I want.
Somethin' big.<eos> - Quick, in here, my darling.<eos> - A moment alone at last.<eos> You can drop the act, Trigger.<eos> They're seeing activity on the machine.<eos> - It's go time. - Roger that.<eos> - Where's my phone?<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> It was in your purse.
THE PEARL BUTTON<eos> "we are all streams from one water"<eos> This block of quartz was found in the Atacama desert, in Chile.<eos> It is 3,000 years old and contains a drop of water.
Previously on Defiance...<eos> I made a deal with the devil to save my father.<eos> This devil was a machine, a ship bent on destroying the world.<eos> It had big plans for me.<eos> It made me destroy New York City and hurt the people I love.
I have a sedative. No friggin' way!<eos> Sorry, Doc.<eos> It's necessary.<eos> Is 20 cc's enough to numb the pain?<eos> Screw you!<eos> Now, this is gonna go a lot quicker if you don't struggle.<eos> How is she? Angry.<eos> And drugged.<eos> Protoform is infinitely mutable.<eos> It has many applications that are beneficial to Omec physiology.
What are you drunk? Is he here, or is he not here?<eos> He's using Transfer Transit.<eos> What's Transfer Transit? It's state-of-the-art travel tech.<eos> You get into a "transfer pod" and input a destination.<eos> The pod sequences your DNA and maps your brain.<eos> Then, that information gets sent via subspace...<eos> Anywhere across the galaxy where there's a receiver pod... Where they create a clone of you, complete with your memories and personality.<eos> It's like flesh and blood 3D-printing.<eos> But the clone has a short life span-- a few days, maybe.<eos> It has to return to its transfer pod before that time so all the new memories and experiences can be sent back to you before you wake up.
Maybe next time we should implement some sort of buddy system.<eos> It wasn't an oversight.<eos> I remember him coming back from the station.<eos> So do I.<eos> He was here.<eos> Well he's not anymore unless he's hiding somewhere.<eos> Why would he be hiding?<eos> Well sometimes I hide out in the vents when I need to be alone to think.<eos> I'm tracking the location of his comm.<eos> It's here.
No, not like me.<eos> You have a heart, lungs, kidneys, fluids.<eos> But your constituent parts were manufactured, to exact specifications, and then assembled.<eos> You also have a network of corrector nanites moving throughout your body, even more advanced than my own.<eos> They're designed to migrate quickly to any area of need.<eos> Like when I was bitten. It killed the virus.<eos> Correct.<eos> And healed the wound itself.<eos> I believe that when you were exposed to the cold of space, the nanites migrated to your skin, joined together and formed a protective shield.<eos> It couldn't have been more than a few microns thick, but it kept you alive.
You saw the scans.<eos> Yeah, and they said you're flesh and blood...<eos> Artificially constructed.<eos> Like one of those transfer transit clones.<eos> Those only last a few days, they're not sustainable organisms.<eos> And they don't have minds of their own.<eos> Do I?<eos> I mean, I have thoughts, and emotions... Anger, sadness, happiness...<eos> But I'm starting to wonder, how real are they?<eos> Having been on the receiving end of that anger, I can confirm it's pretty real.
Like hell.<eos> I will not hurt her, but I have no problem hurting either of you...<eos> Or your friends back on the shuttle.<eos> Your progress was monitored from ship to surface.<eos> We've been expecting you.<eos> Tabor set us up.<eos> That little prick.<eos> Now, if you will kindly lay down your weapons, we have much to discuss.<eos> Anger is counter-productive.<eos> It's a natural response, but after a certain point, it becomes toxic.
See, when you're Coney, you get certain privileges.<eos> When you put on a costume, you can get away with anything.<eos> Forget dental school.<eos> Aaron Cohen is never taking off this costume.<eos> I'm riding the Coney train straight to a career as a professional mascot.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> No!<eos> Don't!<eos> This closet is the most precious thing in my life.<eos> It's like a second vagina to me.
You have no proof of that.<eos> I will go get more soap.<eos> You should probably bring a flashlight.<eos> - What the hell, plebe? !<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Only the president has the key, and only she can get inside.<eos> Don't you wonder what's in there?<eos> Get upstairs.<eos> I mean, a secret hidden door that only one person has the key to?<eos> People have been whispering about that house for years, that it's haunted, that something really bad happened.
Chanel said you were a crazy stalker, and you have the outfit.<eos> I thought you were the one person in this school who knew I was a good guy, Grace.<eos> That's what that house does to people.<eos> Okay, this isn't about me thinking you're boyfriend material.<eos> But I am boyfriend material.<eos> How old are you?<eos> 19.<eos> I'll be 20 next month.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's exactly how old the baby would be if it grew up.
- That is stupidest thing I've ever heard.<eos> - Wait, wait. Zayday's grandmother.<eos> Have you... have you tried calling her?<eos> No, but maybe she knows something.<eos> Last week Zayday called her from my phone because her phone died.<eos> Hold on!<eos> That's it!<eos> "Find My Device." It's an app.<eos> Every smartphone has a GPS in it.<eos> Even if it's dead, it can still tell us where it is.
My dad is super gross rich, Chad.<eos> I know.<eos> That's my favorite thing about you, baby.<eos> Look, Chanel, before I come and save you and whatnot,<eos> I got to get some things off my chest.<eos> - A, I had sex with the dean.<eos> - What?<eos> Look, I'm prepared to say I'm sorry I did that.<eos> What I'm not prepared to do is say the sex was bad.<eos> Because it was not.
You're so hot you give my bone a bone.<eos> Thank you for that compliment, Chad.<eos> Whew!<eos> Chanel? You know how you've been talking about taking our relationship to the next level?<eos> Whew! Oh, my God, this is happening!<eos> This is really happening!<eos> Chanel Oberlin, will you... accept this silver turkey wishbone necklace and accompany me to the Hamptons to spend Thanksgiving at the Radwell Family Compound?<eos> You're gonna meet my mom, my dad, my brothers Thad and Brad.<eos> My house...<eos> Awesome! It's on an 50,000-acre cranberry orchard that my great-great-great-great grandfather Prentice Radwell bought off the Shinnecock Indians for six glass beads.
I just want to know why it isn't me you're taking home for Thanksgiving in the Hamptons.<eos> First things first.<eos> It's Hester, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hester.<eos> What is going on with the neckbrace?<eos> My spinal column was collapsing, so I decided to bedazzle my neckbrace and put it back on.<eos> Honestly, you're the first person to even notice that I'm wearing it again.<eos> That's how seamlessly it goes with my designer wardrobe.
What?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> Your commitment to revenge is... clearly greater than your brother's was.<eos> Should we get some room service?<eos> I have to say, Chanel, I am delighted and shocked that you're letting me keep whatever clothes I want...<eos> It's really big of you, considering the whole "I'm pregnant with your boyfriend's baby" thing.<eos> Well, honestly, the more I thought about it, I just realized that I love Chad so much, and part of loving someone is loving every choice they make, regardless of how selfish and destructive it is, you know?
Uh, she is my-my sober coach.<eos> What?<eos> Chad, I didn't know you had a drinking problem.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> That is how insidious alcoholism is, Dad.<eos> That's true.<eos> Let me help you put this on your lap.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> How are you alive?<eos> Good thing I was wearing this neck brace when you pushed me down the stairs, because it saved my life.
(Jakes) Sorry, I'm having trouble here.<eos> What's... what's Logan's play?<eos> The Sarkissians are the upper echelon of international arms dealing.<eos> No one has ever gotten under with them, so...<eos> Logan thinks I'm his ticket to the top of the world.<eos> Jesus Christ, Paul.<eos> Why are you telling us?<eos> Because that's what you're here for.<eos> Graceland doesn't exist just because there were a few agents who wanted an ocean view, you know?<eos> I mean, the house, it's... It's pretty dope, right?
Boss!<eos> - Do you want the bad news?<eos> - Or?<eos> - The good news?<eos> - There is no good news.<eos> He wants some good news.<eos> Make it happen. Yeah, well, this is serious, cos the water purifier's about to explode.<eos> Make him feel good, you bastard!<eos> Oooh! There's a problem with the water purifier.<eos> It's gonna explode and many mother-funkies gonna die.
With no dramatic turns.<eos> -Man, this is "El tenorio".<eos> He seduces a nun and then meets a ghost.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> -Yes, but this is film and you can't hear it like in a theater.<eos> I need expression with gestures and I don't see any dramatic frisson anywhere. that I need to control my images.<eos> What a sin to be so full of oneself.<eos> Pepín.<eos> Why aren't you wearing the Commander's costume?<eos> I didn't like how it fit me.
Look what is wired into the side of the building on the third floor-- cables for ambient light sensors.<eos> They got the whole top level lasered off.<eos> So, if they're all in their apartment, they can tell if someone steps on the floor.<eos> We can't even get to the stairwells.<eos> This configuration most likely leads to a central hallway, and central hallways have guards.<eos> We walk around the wrong corner, we're dead, and so is Zoe.<eos> If we can't see around the corners, we'll see through the walls.<eos> Sorry, Sylvester.<eos> My souvenir.<eos> Your souvenir... contains a light-receiving diode, so when it's nighttime, it doesn't chime and wake everyone up.

One!<eos> Everyone okay?<eos> All right, we gotta hurry.<eos> Sylvester ever get set up?<eos> Just did it-- I'm on my way to the car!<eos> Okay.<eos> You messed with the wrong group of people, my friends.<eos> Before you do anything rash, you should know...<eos> You recognize that gun?<eos> The motion sensor is calibrated to not shoot anything before the door, but it will take out anything that moves on the other side of it.
I saw your play, "Las ferias de Madrid".<eos> Ah, did you like it?<eos> In the Villa you're considered the most promising author of the moment.<eos> Wow.<eos> And did your husband also enjoy my play?<eos> No, I don't really like theater...<eos> I don't go much.<eos> You don't know what you're missing.<eos> Theater is... the real reflection of the world.<eos> It turns every man's dreams into reality, whether rich or poor.
To which year have they traveled?<eos> Is that all you want to know?<eos> Whichever year they've gone to<eos> Salvador is not going to let you participate in the mission.<eos> Do you know how much a drawing with my signature is worth?<eos> Are you bribing me?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Millions, it's millions, Angustias.<eos> No.<eos> A portrait, I could make it look like a classic.
A pass?<eos> These days prisoners enjoy such freedoms?<eos> Only those that steal a lot.<eos> A lot or a little, how is it possible he can time travel?<eos> That's what we've been investigating since we heard the news.<eos> We've recovered the data from the phone's SIM card and this phone holds a copy.<eos> Through that we know who Díaz Bueno called the week before he disappeared.<eos> He called his lawyer, his mother, his girlfriend... and an unidentified number 20 times.<eos> What do you mean unidentified? It has to be registered to someone, even if it's prepaid.<eos> It belongs to one Enrique Gil de la Riva 20 years deceased who never recharges it in the same place.
Priority one.<eos> Just what I need.<eos> We're alone.<eos> The door has disappeared from the Ministry.<eos> But Ernesto was coming through there.<eos> They haven't heard from him.<eos> Hey, Do you..?<eos> Do you smell smoke?<eos> Yes, you're right.<eos> And it's coming from there.
But before that he did so much for you.<eos> (SALVADOR) To the Ministry and to the Kingdom of Asturias<eos> And to us.<eos> How delicious.<eos> The best cider I've tasted.<eos> It's from the 8th century, without coloring or preservatives.<eos> A present from Don Pelayo.<eos> The least he could do.<eos> We saved his life.<eos> Yes it is good.
I... I just wanted to try something new...<eos> I just... with my life.<eos> You know, try something different.<eos> You did it to get close to Stevie, didn't you?<eos> What?<eos> That necklace, I've seen it before.<eos> 'Grand Central Beer?<eos> I'm no sell-out, especially not that stuff.<eos> 'It's crap! '<eos> It belonged to Stevie, didn't it?
But he was so passionate.<eos> He said bitcoin was the currency of the future.<eos> Ben was taking over the family business and I promised I would trust his judgment.<eos> But now... my son was killed over... over this... this imaginary currency?<eos> Do you know how many bitcoins you had?<eos> Almost half a million dollars' worth.<eos> Most of our retirement.<eos> In order to access and steal your bitcoin, the thief would have needed the passkey to your account.<eos> And it was stored on the computer in the vault.<eos> Who else knew it was there?
It's complicated.<eos> Well, Sifter and I spoke to the judge.<eos> She agreed to lift your probation.<eos> Wow, that's-that's crazy.<eos> I didn't, I didn't even know he liked me.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.<eos> We all set?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We embedded a decoy passkey on the computer in the home, one infected with our own malicious code.<eos> So when the bounty hunters try to use that passkey, it'll infect their computer and we'll have complete control over it.
That's not the guy.<eos> We're following the wrong lead.<eos> You ever hear of the Order of Moriah?<eos> It's a secret society.<eos> The symbol was in Emma's journal.<eos> Also showed up in a missing person's file from Jerusalem.<eos> American kid, 21 years old.<eos> Gregory Donaldson.<eos> He carved the symbol on his chest.<eos> I don't know what it is, or where it opens, but I know Greg wouldn't have wanted them to have it.
Cyril, try that.<eos> I am, if you'd shut up.<eos> Oh, gross!<eos> This phone is all sticky.<eos> Yeah, mine at home gets bad sticky.<eos> Ew.<eos> Of course it does.<eos> And since when are you elevator boss?<eos> Birth? And...<eos> It's dead.
Cyril, shut up.<eos> You shut up!<eos> Krieger, would that work?<eos> Huh.<eos> Maybe?<eos> Maybe?<eos> What do you mean, maybe?<eos> Look, first of all, there's no giant spring at the bottom.<eos> It's a hydraulic buffer, but you don't want to be in the elevator<eos> When it slams into it.
It's in a time-lock safe.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because cheryl.<eos> [farooq] I'm calling for backup.<eos> [speaking urdu] What'd he say?<eos> Well, my urdu isn't as strong as I thought.<eos> [speaking urdu] Meh. But I'm gonna assume he just called for backup.<eos> So we gotta get to the armory.<eos> It's empty.

Someone somewhere buys, let's say, a Jet Ski on credit.<eos> Then she loses her job and she stops paying.<eos> Another person dislikes the curvature of his buttocks, so he splurges on a set of implants.<eos> Another soul eyes an Italian supercar and thinks, "Why not me?"<eos> People buy things they can't afford.<eos> I'm aware of the concept.<eos> Many, many people.<eos> Much of it is frivolous, some of it is not.<eos> But every such purchase flows into a massive ocean of consumer debt.<eos> In this country alone, it adds up to $2.4 trillion, most of it owed to credit card companies.
My first partner was involved in a shooting eight weeks into the job.<eos> I let him walk around with PTSD for the next six months.<eos> I offered to help, too, but we didn't get anywhere until I insisted.<eos> You find something?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's a receipt.<eos> Or at least, it was.<eos> Modern receipts are printed often with thermal ink.<eos> It helps the text appear sharp and clean.<eos> Trouble is, it fades rather quickly.
I've never done that part before.<eos> So, um, you were really serious about that?<eos> It's time.<eos> Make the cut.<eos> - But I don't know... I've never...<eos> - Make the cut.<eos> And then you start.<eos> That is the most daunting step... pushing a blade into that first squishy blob of flesh...<eos> Because the first cut is what sets the tone.<eos> It determines every single move from that point on.
We can overhand shuffle, and we can riffle shuffle...<eos> But, you know, there is no escape from the angry... - queen.<eos> - What?<eos> Phil.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Making the best of a bad situation?<eos> Why is that woman rubbing your shoulders?<eos> Oh, uh, Jillian is a masseuse, and this, of course, is Edward Legrand.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> Now, if you could just give me my ace of spades back-- it's in your pocket.
Yes, thank you.<eos> Uh, Lily, she made me her famous chocolate-chip scrambled eggs...<eos> - Ooh.<eos> - ...which she then watched me eat.<eos> - Ooh.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You got my present, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> Darn it.<eos> They promised it would be there on time. _
Followers of Jesus.<eos> To prison!<eos> To prison!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I am a Roman.<eos> You dare to touch me?<eos> You're right about this place.<eos> It does have a kind of energy.<eos> And a spirit, too.<eos> It gets inside, changes you in some way.
But he has left a present for Jerusalem.<eos> In fact, it is specifically for the high priest.<eos> A statue of his likeness.<eos> Which he commands to be placed in the temple itself.<eos> As a reminder, if you wish, of his divinity and his power.<eos> A graven image would defile the temple and break one of our most sacred commandments.<eos> He...<eos> He cannot do this.<eos> And yet he does.<eos> The book of Daniel foretells a moment such as this, and it promises death and destruction.
In his humiliation, he was deprived of justice.<eos> Who shall speak of his descendents?<eos> "For his life was taken from the earth."<eos> You look to have fallen on hard times, friend.<eos> Indeed.<eos> And I have fallen hard.<eos> If you need help, I've repaired a few wheels in my time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Please.<eos> The passage you were reading just now from Isaiah does it bring you comfort?
Maya said take them out, not... this.<eos> Gustavo's gonna want proof.<eos> We're gonna need their heads as bounty.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> You go clean up.<eos> What would Liv say if she saw you right now?<eos> Animal.<eos> Are you seeing this?<eos> Execute a verification scan of their public key, make sure they're legit.<eos> Oh, it's legit.
I told her everything was gonna be all right.<eos> I promised her.<eos> I'm sorry, babe.<eos> Have you heard from detective Neely?<eos> She said that search teams didn't find anything in the woods.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's because Cole knew he couldn't leave her out there, not once I was onto him, so he put her back in the car and dumped it and the body someplace else.<eos> Westchester has got a bolo out on Eva's car, and they've flagged her credit cards.<eos> Have they pinged her cellphone?<eos> They tried, but it's either off or dead.
Louise, I'm beginning to think you might not care about Jimmy Jr. winning this election.<eos> You're so wrong, Tina.<eos> I definitely don't care.<eos> Well, he's going to win.<eos> Henry Haber is the only other candidate, and his campaign slogan is "chess we can."<eos> Which game is chess again?<eos> The one with the checkers?<eos> Hi, Jimmy Jr., Zeke.<eos> Why is my campaign poster in the trash?<eos> Because it won't fit in the toilet.
I think we got enough onions, Bob.<eos> Do I tell you or that car payment you're holding?<eos> You can tell us both. (Sighs)<eos> It's a McLecklin, my hammer.<eos> You know that brand, Bob?<eos> McLecklin?<eos> I don't know hammer brands, Teddy.<eos> They're the best... they're like the Meryl Streep of hammers.<eos> Ah, look at that slice.<eos> Uh, I'm not crying because of the onions, I'm crying because it's beautiful.
- I assure you they were not. - ...then China, in turn, might begin to feel that the United States' debt is a less than reliable investment for our surplus.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Good day, Ms. Tolliver.<eos> Good day, sir.<eos> - Oy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> MIKE: Wait till you see how inspired the lowly grunts are by their unsinkable leader.<eos> Bounces back from a heart attack the same day.<eos> Imaginary heart attack. Huzzah, huzzah.<eos> It's better than a real one, believe you me.
Yeah, but Susie, we haven't even had regular sex yet.<eos> Are you not attracted to me?<eos> Do you not think I'm beautiful?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Oh... child.<eos> You're as beautiful as an English rose at sunrise.<eos> I just want our first time to be perfect, that's all.<eos> With a waxing orange crescent harvest moon.<eos> Can you picture it?<eos> It's hangin' so low, it's almost like a dew drop.
I've seen them kiss.<eos> Brothers may kiss their sis...<eos> His tongue in her mouth.<eos> You want me to record that?<eos> If you're worried you won't remember it.<eos> Why would she do such a thing?<eos> You know why. The better to rule.<eos> Suppose she gets a boy and it has Weston's long face?<eos> Or looks like Will Brereton?<eos> But they can't call it a bastard if it looks like a Boleyn.
She find out you had a girlfriend?<eos> Honest to God, I never cheated on...<eos> Never cheated on her until you found out she was cheating on you, right?<eos> I know about that, too.<eos> What do you know?<eos> We were 18 years old when we first met.<eos> High school sweethearts.<eos> So what happened?<eos> What happens when you stop paying attention to your marriage?<eos> It starts to fall apart.
A bartender at the local strip club.<eos> We have a source down there.<eos> Hotch, hey, the ransom changed.<eos> It used to just be two million.<eos> All right, Reid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ok, if a call comes in, one of us is gonna answer.<eos> We may ask you to speak, but what's most important is you'll have to stay calm.<eos> I followed up with some oil execs.<eos> It turns out those with stakes in Russian companies would benefit from a fracking ban because it would drive Russian oil prices back up.
You killed Bucephalus?<eos> Mmm. And pinned the blame on Caleb Brewster's uncle.<eos> As I did with Benjamin Tallmadge's father for the shooting of the magistrate.<eos> You, in your pompous need to play the stern father to the Crown's wayward children, swallowed all of it.<eos> Like a French whore swallows a man right down to his root.<eos> I don't have to sink to your level to beat you, John.<eos> I just have to wait.<eos> For someone to ride to the rescue? For you to destroy yourself, just like you did in the rebel siege.<eos> Despite your pretense of control, you can only contain your inner beast for so long.<eos> And the next time it lashes out, I will be ready with all the excuse I need to put you down like the mad dog that you are.
What do you mean?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Huh?<eos> Why did you change sides?<eos> I haven't changed sides, Abe.<eos> I don't believe in your cause, I believe in you.<eos> And I'm done trying to change you.<eos> Though I do think I can help you be a little less sloppy.<eos> Now, your father keeps a pistol in the house.<eos> I know where it is.
Cow!<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello, good evening, and welcome.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Now, this is a mobile telephone.<eos> It's fully functional and what I'm going to do... is throw it in that lavatory.<eos> I know that's the first time you've ever seen a programme start that way, but bear with me, because if we now look...<eos> Yeah, it's only been in the water for a few seconds, but it's ruined for ever.<eos> If you wanted to communicate with somebody, you'd be better off using a Brussels sprout.<eos> Of course, because if you expose your phone to any form of moisture or heat or dust or vibration, it will break.
I'm ready to go.<eos> 'And, after about half an hour, so was Jeremy.'<eos> OK, we're good to go, we're good to go.<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Oh, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone.<eos> BMW scrabbling about for traction all over the shop.<eos> Should prove the point.<eos> Wow!<eos> This launch control doesn't work.<eos> It does about five feet and it goes, "Oh, I can't be bothered."
That would have been another good one.<eos> That's very tidy through there.<eos> And - oh, yeah, that's very well done in that weather.<eos> Come on - oh, you're in fourth, ya prat.<eos> ~ "Prat" gives it away.<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> No American's going to say prat - or Canadian.<eos> Tidy again.<eos> Hit the brake like you hate it.<eos> Yes, look at the tech line there, it does handle very well, that.
And they're ready, steady, and... across the line.<eos> Gordon Bennett, he was...<eos> Oof.<eos> As Big Stig's dust settled, the three of us made our way to the bottom of the mine.<eos> ~ I'll win this.<eos> ~ I seriously doubt that.<eos> ~ Well, I will or he will cos we've got four-wheel drive.<eos> ~ It's true.<eos> Four-wheel drive is useful on a tractor but on a normal road car<eos> ~ it's pointless.
Hey!<eos> How far you willing to go to see how legit I am?<eos> Let's get him out.<eos> Clear.<eos> There's no way they could've got out of here without us seeing them.<eos> Lasalle.<eos> Crawl space.<eos> Watch was his lifeline.<eos> We followed the tunnel.<eos> It dumps out at a gravel road about an eighth of a mile from the bar.
Our New America will return to the values of the Original America, and will protect, first, the Original Americans.<eos> Tell me you need some help, 'cause that tire tread that Brody and Lasalle sent me is about as useful as a kangaroo on a pogo stick.<eos> That made more sense on the drive over.<eos> Not much better here.<eos> Father videos?<eos> Man, I can't listen to his ass anymore.<eos> Hey, come see if you grok what I been going batty over.<eos> Did you just use the word "grok"?<eos> Well, there's a light.<eos> Yeah, but where's it coming from?
You're an adult.<eos> We can't interfere with who you decide to date.<eos> Believe me, I learned my lesson there.<eos> So... don't worry about it, okay?<eos> We got enough going on today.<eos> I'm really glad that you feel that way.<eos> Um, I really need your help, actually.<eos> I have heroin in my pocket.<eos> You have what?<eos> It fell out of the lining of Harrison's jacket.
But if people are willing to believe this crap, do you really think they can engage in a rational debate?<eos> They can't.<eos> So we fight fire with fire.<eos> So we are just digging up dirt, like Tabloid X and sleaze?<eos> Celine, in the real world, this is always about money or sex.<eos> And when it comes to the devout, 99% of the time, it's about sex.<eos> It's a fact.<eos> No, this is nonsense.<eos> Sex is a natural urge.<eos> And you put a lid on that, it seeps out the sides, in unexpected and sometimes spectacular ways.
He works in a bank.<eos> Ah, that's nice.<eos> And, er, who with this going into his bank?<eos> Your friend, Sister Sophia.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Sophia, your friend that died.<eos> She says she's happy and she's getting a lot of knitting done.<eos> But... How do you know this?<eos> Ever since waking up, I hear this voice.<eos> It says I have to give you a message.

How do you know this?<eos> Ever since waking up, I hear this voice.<eos> It says I have to give you a message.<eos> One day soon you are going to see four horses - a white, a black, a red and a pale.<eos> It says when you see them, don't panic.
We've been back-channeling through the Swiss and Czech embassies in Tehran, but so far nothing.<eos> I have one of Secretary McCord's detail on a video feed...<eos> - John Kendall.<eos> - Put it up, Major.<eos> JACKSON: Mr. Kendall, do you have the secretary?<eos> Negative, sir.<eos> The detail fragmented under the attack.<eos> Fred Cole was killed.<eos> I was forced to take cover.<eos> By the time I was able to get back to the house, it was on fire.
She's dying.<eos> I want to arrange a trip for Elizabeth to see her mother one last time.<eos> We think you should go with me.<eos> It would be the only chance you'll have to meet your grandmother.<eos> I wish it were possible, but we both know that it isn't.<eos> Have a fun time missing a whole week of school without me.<eos> I'm gonna get you, like, the best present.<eos> How about a trip to Europe?<eos> That's-- that's a good present.<eos> Well, I'm sure next time mom and dad have business out of the country and they get a free extra ticket, it'll go to you.
People won't come out if I'm losing, but they'll come out if parking meters are losing?<eos> Yes, because it costs them money.<eos> Didn't Daley sell Chicago's soul to the parking meter gods?<eos> Yes, for a billion dollars in return.<eos> God, there is something truly sad about...<eos> Die, scumbag!<eos> Not if we use it.<eos> We just need you to get Peter on board to do this robocall?<eos> Right now, the initiative is winning by six points.<eos> We just need Peter to convince people that it's losing by six.
Only thing missing is a piece of chocolate and a ghost story.<eos> My partner and I just busted a crack house, and it's not as scary as this.<eos> Look, you got nothing to worry about.<eos> Unless they find something.<eos> They caught mine pretty early.<eos> Now I'm five years clean.<eos> Ah, that's great.<eos> WOMAN 1: But you got to be diligent.<eos> You know, early detection is the key... that's why I come every year.<eos> Thing about cancer, can't just ignore it and wish for it to go away.
♪ Stadium taco. ♪<eos> Thank you guys for being a bright spot on my sad day.<eos> Aah! - Shucks!<eos> - Sorry!<eos> I thought I saw Pete's ghost!<eos> It was a paint can.<eos> Are you sure about...?<eos> Ugh! We gotta find this phone.<eos> And get the hell out of here.<eos> Okay, it's ringing.
I must be.<eos> - Shall we get started?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> According to our records,<eos> Carter's missed nine days of school this month, ten last month.<eos> - Ten days?<eos> - We had no idea.<eos> On top of that, her GPA has been sliding each quarter.<eos> - It's now a 2.4.
Sure.<eos> When did you start drinking smoothies?<eos> Um... hold on, let me get closer.<eos> I wasn't kidding there when I told you I was getting back into shape.<eos> You know, 1985's my year, man.<eos> I'm eating better, I'm exercising.<eos> You know, I haven't jogged regularly since, I mean, I don't even know.<eos> Adidas came out with that track suit.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It's already paying off, too.
You know how a computer is this big.<eos> What if a computer was... this big?<eos> The size of a man's hand.<eos> And had a camera in it, and you can take self pictures, and it also had a phone.
Tommy?<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> One of your runaway kids, destined to run no more.<eos> It's Cameron's.<eos> So, I guess we get a giant can opener and start checking trunks.<eos> Or maybe not.<eos> If you're gonna kill Cameron and leave him in the trunk of a car to be demolished, and see he has a phone, you don't leave it here and on.<eos> You'd know we'd find him.<eos> Maybe they didn't know he had the phone.<eos> Then how does it get inside the tire?
What kind of side effects this time?<eos> This isn't about changing her.<eos> This is so that she can live a normal...<eos> If that's what you want... life.<eos> We've been through the book that you used.<eos> There's nothing about what you're saying.<eos> It's not in the book, specifically.<eos> My mother's aunt told me about this when my mother was going through a very tough time.<eos> She didn't end up doing it, but there is a way.<eos> It's not easy, and there is one ingredient that's almost impossible to get.
That's how that happens.<eos> So how do we get it out of him?<eos> You can't unless you open the portal again.<eos> Then how do we do that?<eos> You have to kill him.<eos> If we kill him, he's kind of dead, isn't he?<eos> We were thinking maybe there's a way to do this, like the Dead Faint, the same one we used on Monroe when they hired Angelina to kill him.<eos> The only way to prove she had done it was to show them his dead body.<eos> The tetrodotoxin.<eos> It slows down bodily functions, but it's very dangerous.

I made the right choice.<eos> I'm just so lucky to have you as my wife.<eos> I have something for you, too.<eos> For me?<eos> Well, what are you doing with my gambling sobriety chip?<eos> I found it in the laundry.<eos> I must have left it in my pocket.<eos> It's not like you, Booth.<eos> You always know where your chip is.<eos> Well, you know what, I know where it is now because of you.
If there's a witness out there, we'll find them.<eos> How about video?<eos> The immediate area where you found her car didn't have any street-cam or security coverage.<eos> Making it the perfect place for an abduction.<eos> I have teams from four precincts pulling all video in a 10-block radius from where Beckett was taken.<eos> It's a long shot, but...<eos> What about Amy Barrett... the phone call she made to Beckett?<eos> Can we trace that?<eos> We did... to a cellphone.<eos> It's no longer active.
Number one, that's adorable.<eos> And number two, Gibbs would never bail on a case, much less a Sergei case; and much, much less at my suggestion.<eos> Unless he had a plan.<eos> Special Agent McGee.<eos> Oh, great, great.<eos> Thanks for letting us know.<eos> We'll be right there.<eos> Hospital.<eos> Both victims are awake and well enough to be interviewed.<eos> Hey. Gibbs's plan, McGee-- what do you think it is?
Well... it ain't French, but, uh...<eos> I got a little something for ya.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Come here.<eos> Look at that shit.<eos> Like that's... fucked up shit. Oh yeah.<eos> It's inked in blood.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Try this piece of poetry.<eos> It'll blow your mind.
No, no one is saying that.<eos> You need to act as if everything's perfectly normal.<eos> But it's not.<eos> - Paige. - I didn't tell him.<eos> Can I get by?<eos> You have to go to Martha's tonight, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I keep thinking I wanna paint -- blue or something bolder.<eos> But then you have to live with it.<eos> And the smell -- it lingers, you know.
Here's a better picture of that girl, Randolph.<eos> Now do you recognize her?<eos> I told you before, no.<eos> Was she like your wife?<eos> Did she expect a free ride?<eos> - Vic?<eos> - [Vic] Yeah?<eos> Call the bus company, uh, find out where that bus stopped, see if there's anywhere that, uh, Delia could have gotten on.<eos> Bus 85678, originated in Green Bay.<eos> Before it picked up them oilmen in Oden, it passed through Minneapolis, Sioux Falls, and Sturgis, whereupon some church people got on board, coming on down here to gamble for Jesus.
Take off that bandage, Sam.<eos> No.<eos> You said you would leave if I took my shirt off.<eos> I did.<eos> Now it's time to leave.<eos> And we will, but you're leaving with me.<eos> I haven't done anything but drive to the Super 8 in Billings... and help my sister.<eos> I hope that's true, Sam.<eos> So, I tracked that blood trail almost a half mile.<eos> Then it stopped by a dirt road.
Are you gonna tell us any information, Dr. Hodgins, or merely adjectives?<eos> Oh, this webbing is from a Loxosceles reclusa, otherwise known<eos> Right. Yeah, I'm not a big fan of spiders, so, why don't we just, you know, wrap that up there so we can get out of here?<eos> Awesome part is, based on the eggs and the webbing, the victim died about seven days ago.<eos> - And the frightening part?<eos> - Well, they can be quite deadly.<eos> I've seen a brown recluse bite which caused necrosis down to the bone.<eos> Who cares about that?<eos> Just put the spider in the container, seal it up so we don't get neocro, whatever, all over us.<eos> Necrosis, and it wouldn't be on us, it would be in us because, it's...
Uh, I-I didn't feel he was dangerous at that point.<eos> See, ma'am, I-it's my job to interact with the people in this neighborhood.<eos> I-I like to think I'm pretty good at it.<eos> So I just asked the kid if I could see the box.<eos> Next thing I know, he's he's charging at me, he's... he's reaching in his coat pocket for a knife.<eos> And you saw the knife.<eos> And you fired because you thought your life was in danger.<eos> That is the only reason I would ever discharge my weapon.<eos> So, what happened to the knife?<eos> Where is it now?
- No, I agree.<eos> There is absolutely nothing funny about it.<eos> Mom, this is so unfair, okay?<eos> You don't even know the whole story.<eos> Taylor.<eos> - What story?<eos> - There's no story.<eos> She just feels bad for me, and thank you, Taylor, I really appreciate it.<eos> Okay, well, apparently, I have to go back to the grocery store.<eos> You know where it is?
I'm on it, Jay.<eos> Denny, they spotted that black van half a block from the Omni Hotel.<eos> Stand by.<eos> Coming up on it now.<eos> Got it.<eos> Open up.<eos> Jay. The van is empty, brother.<eos> It's a decoy.<eos> Carrie, Al, Denny secured the van.<eos> It's empty.
Words with friends was really draining my battery.<eos> Theo, I should get back.<eos> Uh-oh, did I do something wrong?<eos> Do you not like what I did for you?<eos> No, it's lovely.<eos> Then why do you keep running back out there When you could be here, in this moment, with me?<eos> Because we only exist here, in five minute increments So people don't get suspicious.<eos> - Lauren...<eos> - no.<eos> Out there, in the real prom, I had the perfect dance, And it meant nothing because it wasn't with you.
Pull me to my knees.<eos> Okay, now what?<eos> We take a break.<eos> This is crazy!<eos> Why don't I call a doctor?<eos> - No!<eos> - Why not?<eos> I didn't sign up for ObamaCare, okay?<eos> I forgot.<eos> Now lift my ass so it's parallel to the bed.
Here!<eos> Present!<eos> Hey, where's Lana?<eos> What the--<eos> Well, she's not in here, which is where you also shouldn't be!<eos> What? What?<eos> Why aren't you in position?<eos> Because, Slater, there's a-- a problem with your tranquilizer gun.<eos> What problem?<eos> It goes off for, like, no reason.
All right, you guys have ten minutes.<eos> Oh, no, I've got to call my bookie.<eos> You guys have 20 minutes!<eos> Just see what I'm working with here.<eos> Oh, yes, yes.<eos> Structure's good.<eos> Okay.<eos> Photoshop will take care of that little scar on the earlobe.<eos> How can you see that?<eos> It's so tiny.
- No.<eos> - No?<eos> We create a fully interactive experience.<eos> They make a pretty good version of hangman.<eos> - (chuckles) - We're not doing the same thing as Playnet.<eos> We don't want to do the same thing as Playnet.<eos> We're doing something much, much better with half the resources.<eos> - And how do you pull that off?<eos> - Our code's better.<eos> It's more efficient and creative.
~ I know all those shows, man!<eos> ~ You don't!<eos> And you won't because...<eos> ~ I got the DVDs and everything!<eos> It's just unbelievable, I'm afraid.<eos> I know all about this, the Coronation Street and Neighbours and all those.<eos> EastEnders, yeah.<eos> ~ Now, em, you are over here, obviously, to promote a film. ~ Yes.<eos> It's called Focus, but it isn't about the small Ford hatchback, which will have disappointed some people in here.<eos> It's...
And, in 1947, here at Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey, it was the same story for the Land Rover.<eos> The sketch was done by a chap called Maurice Wilks who was the Technical Director for Rover cars.<eos> At the time, he used an old Bren gun carrier to get around on his farm until, one day, he swapped it for his neighbour's old Willys Jeep and soon thought, "Hang on.<eos> So, he sketched out his creation in the sand and a first prototype was quickly built over the following few months.<eos> Sadly, though, there was a bit of an issue.<eos> You see, Maurice thought putting the steering wheel in the middle would mean they could sell it to right- and left-hand drive countries, without having to re-engineer it.<eos> But then they realised that, amongst other things, that was going to make hand signals rather tricky.<eos> So, it was back to the drawing board.<eos> And, a mere ten months after that shaky start, the first Land Rover was born.<eos> It came in this green because the only paint Land Rover could lay their hands on was surplus army leftovers they used for Spitfires.
And the machine of choice for Ranulph Fiennes on his epic trans-global expedition.<eos> In fact, at one time, the first car ever seen by 60% of the developing world was a Land Rover.<eos> And, on top of that, it's been in production for 67 years.<eos> 67 years.<eos> Production run alone makes this thing one of the greats.<eos> Look at the other icons - Beetle, I'd say 57 years.<eos> 2CV, that was a real fly-by-night - 42 years.<eos> So great is my love for this machine that when, 13 years ago, we ran a Top Gear competition asking viewers to vote for the greatest car of all time,<eos> And the public clearly agreed.<eos> Because it won.
He's one of those types who spends a long and lonely life looking for themselves and end up in the middle of the Caribbean adorned in a ghastly, flowery shirt.<eos> Hey, I wasn't talking about you, you know, Chief.<eos> Ah!<eos> It's easier to get into Fort Knox than this.<eos> Right!<eos> Not much of a bleed, I must say.<eos> Murder weapon?<eos> Not at the scene.<eos> But Williams owns a gun, which he keeps locked in a chest.<eos> And it went missing last night.
Did nobody else here have a mobile phone?<eos> No.<eos> We had to leave them at Gatwick.<eos> In left luggage.<eos> Annette wanted us totally focused on the job in hand, no distractions.<eos> The only reason I was allowed a laptop was to take notes, as it were.<eos> It's nothing she wouldn't have expected of herself.<eos> She was like that, all or nothing...<eos> Yes, it's interesting you say that, Mr Claydon, because, um... Miss Burgess did in fact keep her mobile phone, didn't she?<eos> You said it was missing.
I swear to sweet Jesus...<eos> Okay, Julia Childish.<eos> I'll get a sitter for A.J. So, what time is dinner?<eos> And can I bring anything? Let's say sevenish, and yes, you can bring 100 copies of this.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Come on!<eos> Sorry, I had to get stakeout supplies, and--<eos> What happened to your van?<eos> We can't stake out Archer's apartment in the rush van, it's way too iconic.
Probably something about paris.<eos> Miniaturization in five minutes.<eos> [dr. Sklodowska] roger that, mission control.<eos> Navigation systems are online.<eos> We are ready for miniaturization process.<eos> [slater] copy that, navigation.<eos> Bridge is online and we are ready<eos> For miniaturization process, over.<eos> Said your dick.<eos> That would mean it's too big, dummy,
- Amy, it's not a rash. - Can we focus on what's important here?<eos> College. Our dream of going to CU together is never gonna come true unless we do something this summer that they find... "impressive."<eos> The big question is... what?<eos> Why don't we just ask her?<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> Can I tell you a little bit about us?<eos> No need, no need... we both knew we wanted to go to Clement ever since we were old enough to know what college was.<eos> Not too big, not too small.<eos> World-class media documentary program...<eos> And it looks just like that school from Greek, and I love that show.
That is the second-nicest thing anyone's ever said to me!<eos> The road is long, and trust me, it can be really hard.<eos> So whatever you do, you hold on to that foolishly hopeful smile.<eos> And... your funny friend.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh, everyone, tonight we are witness to the amazing work of Nola Anderz.<eos> Why don't we all just stand here quietly for a moment and let Nola's pictures speak.<eos> That's my phone.<eos> Where is it?
I seek the materiality of the soul...<eos> Its embodiment, and, likewise, the soul that lives in all things.<eos> If we can understand the physical seat of the soul, and we understand the spiritual nature of all things, then we might learn to do so much.<eos> You sound like a witch.<eos> Well, perhaps so.<eos> Perhaps, in their own misbegotten way, witches are scientists.<eos> Well, then Hathorne would be right, and scientists are also witches.<eos> But I do not seek to hurt anyone.<eos> I am searching for the very organ that proves God's existence within us.<eos> And where is it?
- Seriously, really, I mean, the most pointless of all shapeshifters.<eos> The one commonality is that they all feed on lies and the chaos wrought by lies.<eos> The more lies, the more chaos they can create.<eos> So, why hang around this small town?<eos> Why not head for...<eos> Washington, D.C., home of lies?<eos> Well, shapeshifters require an enormous amount of sustenance to survive.<eos> We can assume since we're just hearing about this one now that this beast has only recently arrived.<eos> Perhaps it has not had enough time to feed to leave the area yet.<eos> And you must stop it before it's able to grow in power.
Why hasn't that storm stopped now that its fairy engine is gone?<eos> Because a storm of that magnitude is self-sustaining.<eos> Ariel brought it to New York, controlled it, but it's actually far more dangerous with him gone.<eos> Him gone?<eos> Her gone?<eos> Ariel's been presented both male and female.<eos> I...<eos> Focusing, focusing.<eos> It takes in hot air and distributes cold air, like it's breathing.<eos> And it will dissipate, but when it does, it's gonna spin off tornados just to get rid of the kinetic energy.
Yeah, I think he is calling.<eos> Flynn.<eos> Flynn?<eos> Flynn?<eos> Flynn, it's Eve.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Flynn, if you can hear me and you're not alone, make a noise.<eos> Make any noise.<eos> The pendant's active.<eos> It should be able to...
Both your world and mine, there are those of us who run and those who build.<eos> You and I?<eos> We're planners.<eos> Strategists.<eos> We're builders, in for the long haul.<eos> What type is your Mr. Carsen, pray tell?<eos> This is it!<eos> It should be here.<eos> The temple should be right here.<eos> Where is it?
We're planners.<eos> Strategists.<eos> We're builders, in for the long haul.<eos> What type is your Mr. Carsen, pray tell?<eos> This is it!<eos> It should be here.<eos> The temple should be right here.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Yeah, I'm... starting to think that maybe walking through the Pennsylvania woods... not the best way to find an ancient Sumerian temple.<eos> Why isn't it here?

Okay, so, how do we summon a monster that feeds on ego?<eos> What?<eos> If I am going to be bait, why are we in a golf cart and not, say, a Ferrari?<eos> Because we got to get close, all right?<eos> Baird, you in place?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait for my word.<eos> Okay. That's the last one.<eos> By placing these in a circle, I've created a magnetic field at the weakest point of the dimensional barrier.<eos> Stone will use the spectrometer to get the energy signature from the monster when it appears, and I'll use that to dial into the right dimension.
You saw it, Sam!<eos> My team shows up wherever magic is happening.<eos> You saw it. Oh, come on.<eos> If that were true, people would know.<eos> People do know.<eos> We know. It's like when we used to hunt WMDs, Sam.<eos> You have to secure the threat.<eos> If Brandy was killed because she uncovered some magical threat, then the town of Hawthorne is facing something akin to a loose nuke.<eos> The glyph doesn't mean "the devil."<eos> It means "a devil" or "demon." Catch.
Contract magic works by coincidence... taking what's already present and using it against you.<eos> Gas mains are gonna blow.<eos> The gas line construction's part of Keating's campaign.<eos> Yeah, and it runs right under Town Square.<eos> Bypass junction should be down here.<eos> We'll divert the gas to another line, away from Town Square.<eos> Well, hang on.<eos> Uh, Cassandra, you said that the bad magic works by taking what's around and using it against you.<eos> So if the Contract knows we're trying to stop it...<eos> It's gonna use the gas.
I haven't got in the club, man.<eos> Well, Cassandra figured out who the next victim might be.<eos> - Did they get a name?<eos> - No, but I cross-referenced her image on social media because everybody wants to be noticed.<eos> I got into her feed.<eos> She just dropped a pic 10 minutes ago.<eos> - "Grabbing snacks after Club E with Bae."<eos> - Wait.<eos> I know this restaurant.<eos> It's right down the block.
You wanna see the rage people?<eos> Yeah, man!<eos> The what now?<eos> Uhh!<eos> Rage people.<eos> It's a survival horror game.<eos> Is it... is it more of a sandbox or is it a railroad?<eos> Okay, I'm not buying a computer overload traps us in a video game.<eos> A magical quantum computer.<eos> They were running the system, encountered some corrupted code, and then it fritzed.
You know what?<eos> He deserves it.<eos> - You're still mad that he's dating your doctor? - Yes.<eos> They're on date three, so it's only a matter of time before they break up, she'll be furious with me,<eos> - and just when I need her at the top of her game.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> Oh, I think I'm coming down with something.<eos> I was scrubbing the kitchen sink all afternoon, and now my fingers are numb.<eos> Were you using that illegal Chinese cleaning powder again?<eos> It's not illegal in China.

I'm starting to get concerned.<eos> Well, I'm off the clock.<eos> I'll be interested again on Monday.<eos> - Dani, this is Sharon.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I see you finished the chair.<eos> - Took you long enough.<eos> - Yeah, you should try it out.<eos> It's adjustable.
You are wasting your summer.<eos> How did you stop worrying about polio?<eos> I learned about dinosaurs and started worrying about them.<eos> But dinosaurs have been gone since...<eos> I was a kid.<eos> No... no, you're right, I-I wish I could stop this obsession.<eos> You know, we're all gonna die at some point, right?<eos> It's like the poet says,<eos> "Do not send to know for whom the bell tolls.<eos> It tolls for thee."
Lieutenant Burns.<eos> What's the combination on your gun case?<eos> 12-bar blues chord progression.<eos> One, four, five, one.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's not in the case.<eos> Does Leo have an alibi?<eos> Not a good one.<eos> Says he was home, alone.<eos> Until you asked me for my gun, I didn't even know it was missing.
No sign of a struggle, huh?<eos> No defensive wounds.<eos> They're bagging his hands to test his fingernails for DNA, but so far it looks like he was taken by surprise.<eos> Or killed by someone who knew him.<eos> So what do we know about Warner?<eos> Well, the guy didn't become the most successful architect since Frank Gehry without pissing off a few people and came from humble beginnings.<eos> Started his business in '86.<eos> Got his big break with the Renstein house over in Oyster Bay.<eos> I took a tour of that house.<eos> It's amazing.
And installed something.<eos> I built a narrow AI, one that could provide a backdoor into our enemy itself, transmitting data from the inside.<eos> You used her algorithm as a Trojan Horse, hoping it would eventually be installed in Samaritan.<eos> Ms. Groves, I was right.<eos> It will be installed mere days from now.<eos> I've left the Trojan Horse dormant to avoid discovery.<eos> This activates it.<eos> I just need to get it close to her laptop, which I'll do tonight at dinner.<eos> Harold...<eos> It can only transmit a tiny amount of data.
The concept I came up with<eos> - is so much better than theirs.<eos> - We're scrapping it.<eos> What?<eos> I worked for two months on that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We gotta go with what's proven.<eos> We're remaking my old commercial.<eos> 30 years ago, my dad was in a local ad for Pritchett's Closets, and he has always been really proud of the slogan he came up with.<eos> I've never understood what it means.
Forstman used somebody he cared about.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> I never even thought about that.<eos> Who do you think it was?<eos> I don't know, but I have a pretty good guess.<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> I think this place is a dump, and I'm busy, so why don't you tell me why we're here?<eos> I want to open a restaurant here.<eos> Marcus, there's already a restaurant here.<eos> And it isn't working.
And then she fell off the map.<eos> Uh, Agent Richards, not... my...<eos> No, no, I-I got it.<eos> Cool.<eos> Now, I did manage to find her car.<eos> It's been parked on Jefferson for the last three hours at a one-hour parking meter.<eos> Let me guess-- you have a friend at the DMV, and it's a she.<eos> The point is that Agent Richards got a parking infringement 15 minutes after she left her office.<eos> I also managed to find her cell.<eos> It's off and the GPS says it's inside the car.
Yeah.<eos> Reservation was under the wrong name.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Really?<eos> Meet me in room 308 in 10 minutes.<eos> I can't.<eos> Next time.<eos> "I pushed f3."<eos> The machine was messed up.<eos> It gave me a payday.
Yeah, but it's elevated.<eos> And then some.<eos> We should hang back.<eos> Draw them out.<eos> It's Martine.<eos> Sorry, John.<eos> Places to be, people to kill.<eos> Damn it, Root.<eos> That was the work of an Artificial Intelligence!<eos> What does it do?
We should hang back.<eos> Draw them out.<eos> It's Martine.<eos> Sorry, John.<eos> Places to be, people to kill.<eos> Damn it, Root.<eos> That was the work of an Artificial Intelligence!<eos> What does it do?<eos> Who built it?<eos> What is-- Does it see the future?
Draw them out.<eos> It's Martine.<eos> Sorry, John.<eos> Places to be, people to kill.<eos> Damn it, Root.<eos> That was the work of an Artificial Intelligence!<eos> What does it do?<eos> Who built it?<eos> What is-- Does it see the future?<eos> Does it-- How does it function?
Listen, yeah, about that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I model for art students.<eos> So I'm kind of used to being stared at.<eos> Oh... so why are you here?<eos> To thank you.<eos> For watching you?<eos> For sending over all those groceries.<eos> When they first got delivered, I couldn't figure out who sent them, and then I realized that you could see into my fridge and you saw it was empty.
[ Device beeps ] Oh, god, now there's three of them.<eos> We're outnumbered.<eos> Get in the cupboards. Wait, don't -- don't do that.<eos> They'll know. Wait, wait. Think about getting in the cupboards, but don't really.<eos> Is this what you want, you sick fuck?<eos> ! You want to see children die?<eos> ! You son of a bitch. You don't stop living until I say so!<eos> - Michael.<eos> - Who's this now? - My lawyer.<eos> I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies.
We meet for lunch, we power-walk in the park, we take turns cooking dinner.<eos> We go way back.<eos> I know Lois like I know me, and I haven't heard a word from her in three weeks.<eos> I went to the police, and they said, "maybe she went on vacation."<eos> Lo and I go on vacation in August.<eos> I told the police that.<eos> Then they said maybe she needed some time alone.<eos> Look.<eos> This is her wallet.<eos> It was right there on the kitchen counter.
You could use something good right now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to end up a soulless monster like that Leo Bergen.<eos> You can't change my mind.<eos> You want to bow out, bow out.<eos> But do it because you truly believe you're not the right person for this job, not because you're afraid of failing at it.<eos> - Well, who says I'm...<eos> - It's okay to be afraid.<eos> Sometimes, fear keeps us safe.<eos> Sometimes, it holds us back.
- Is this enough?<eos> - Just.<eos> Ahh!<eos> Thank you, doctor.<eos> I'm feeling better already.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> The only other treatment is to freeze the worm to death by lowering the body temperature with an ice bath.<eos> I feel it inside of me.<eos> No.<eos> I think it's inside of me.
I still can't believe Kylie flaked on me.<eos> I thought she really liked me.<eos> I guess not.<eos> Time for more pills, baby.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm already so loopy.<eos> We have to get ahead of the pain.<eos> Maybe she texted me.<eos> Have you seen my phone?<eos> Is it over there?
- No.<eos> How did you feel about Josh?<eos> I told him the truth. I love Spencer.<eos> If you were at the flat with Spencer last night, why was Josh here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I told him I'd swapped shifts.<eos> Maybe he just forgot.<eos> That black saloon. Did you see it?<eos> What about it?<eos> I think it followed us here.
You look like you you're spit-washing - car windows on Delancey Street.<eos> - Hey. That's all right. All right.<eos> One of these days, I'm gonna take you over to Brooks Brothers, doll you up right.<eos> My treat.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Huh?<eos> Okay? Hey, Terry.<eos> - What do you say, boys?<eos> - Terry, let me ask you something.<eos> This suit... It's fine, right?
Well, I guess that makes this guy Duffman.<eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh, do I get the confetti? !<eos> One confettus.<eos> I mean, oh, yeah!<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> That's how we'll tell the trades you got the job.<eos> Seems awfully overproduced.<eos> Just take the oath.<eos> Night gathers, and now my Duff watch begins.<eos> It shall not end until my death.
The marshals and agents will try and follow us,<eos> - but it will take them hours...<eos> - Let's go.<eos> ...to cover the ground we can travel in 10 minutes.<eos> That way.<eos> And 10 minutes away, on another fire road, we'll have a different car waiting for us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, give me the gun.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not loaded, is it?
- Sir?<eos> - No, please don't do that.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> I just need to ring these up.<eos> This might sting.<eos> If only we had some heroin to shoot you up with like you used on your victims.<eos> A lot less messy than bullets, isn't it?<eos> The heroin wasn't for my convenience.<eos> It was to give those poor souls a few moments of peace at the end of their tragic lives.
Punctuality is the great thief of time.<eos> Oscar Wilde said that.<eos> Waste your time, not mine.<eos> Jackson Gibbs said that.<eos> Ah. I liked him a lot better.<eos> Think maybe it's time to upgrade to a smartphone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> I just did.<eos> Turns out, it's not smart enough. Ah.
So, once you've downloaded all the schematics for the gun, how difficult is it to print one?<eos> Load a spool of plastic into a 3-D printer, - push "print."<eos> - That's it?<eos> - Yes, that's it.<eos> - Well, dear God, that's appalling.<eos> I mean, how long does it take to print?<eos> A gun, Your Honor?<eos> Approximately four hours.<eos> So, on January the 17...<eos> And this gun, it fires actual bullets?
- That's it?<eos> - Yes, that's it.<eos> - Well, dear God, that's appalling.<eos> I mean, how long does it take to print?<eos> A gun, Your Honor?<eos> Approximately four hours.<eos> So, on January the 17...<eos> And this gun, it fires actual bullets?<eos> - Yes, Your Honor.<eos> - And it's plastic, so you could get it through a, uh, metal detector.
So this gun should match the gun that injured my client? Yes.<eos> It was also printed on Pope's printer.<eos> - You want to do the honors? - Mm.<eos> Just enough to pull the trigger.<eos> Ready?<eos> Kurt, is that good?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I believe that we're getting catastrophic failure from these guns because the 3-D printer was false feeding.<eos> - False feeding? - Yeah.<eos> I noticed that the printer was stuttering sometimes, when it was pulling the plastic filament off the spool.
Can you, can you hand me my phone?<eos> You mean... this phone here?<eos> Yeah, you know, don't kid around.<eos> Just hand me the phone.<eos> No.<eos> I think it looks good right...<eos> There.<eos> - Alicia...<eos> - Good seeing you, Mr. Canning.<eos> Oh, now it's ringing!
I never got his name.<eos> I don't have a telephone number, credit card, anything like that.<eos> Our deal was cash, like you said.<eos> He was a little older than me, tall white guy.<eos> Came in off the street, made me an offer, just like that.<eos> Was it his van?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He wanted me to deliver the stuff, but I was worried it was a setup, so I told him he had to pick up the canisters himself.<eos> But he'd already given me the address.<eos> I've got it written down in the office somewhere.
Oh!<eos> You so remind me of him.<eos> This is perhaps silly, but would you do me the favor of having lunch with a lonely old woman?<eos> Um...<eos> Sorry, I've got a full day planned for us -- a taping of a proactiv commercial, then we're off to the ranch from "The Biggest Loser."<eos> I paid extra for a tour of their massive sweat-drainage system.<eos> See you at the hotel.<eos> Ohh!<eos> Oh, God, my pelvis!<eos> It's in pieces.
Aah!<eos> Well, hello.<eos> Oh.<eos> Right. It's just a doll.<eos> You're right, she is a doll -- a real angel.<eos> She is beauty, uh, uh, full.<eos> Uh, I-I-I-I feel tongue-tied and a little headache-y.<eos> That's infatuation, son.<eos> Also, we're on a big magnet right now.<eos> It's affecting your speech centers.
I can't. What if he...<eos> I... (Katya) you can, Elizabeth.<eos> Just stick to the script, and everything will be fine.<eos> Hi, I was calling about dinner.<eos> I'm feeling really nauseous, So I was wondering if we could just stay home.<eos> Pobrecita. It's probably the baby.<eos> Definitely the baby, yep.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll make soup.<eos> It'll settle your stomach.
Yeah, I'm gonna write, "Yeah."<eos> You're happy about this?<eos> Damn it, no, it doesn't feel right.<eos> Yeah, just hold it down, hold it down.<eos> Okay, you guys know the drill.<eos> We split up into teams, and we hunt this spider.<eos> - Why can't we just call an exterminator?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They've all blocked Schmidt's calls since the dandelion incident.<eos> It moved like a spider, Nick!
Okay?<eos> Something's wrong with my Sauce.<eos> My Sauce!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - You...?<eos> - I...<eos> With him?<eos> Winston.<eos> Wh-Where'd it go?
Why do you have to stomp on our buildings?<eos> This land is 98% rural.<eos> So much farmland you can walk on without hurting your feet.<eos> Right, right.<eos> The city's the only place you can get tuna rolls at 5:00 in the morning.<eos> Because you do have fishy breath.<eos> I'm just telling you.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> So, the key to this movie is it's so cheap it's funny.<eos> Then just think how popular it would be if we spent a fortune remaking it.
I'm married, you see.<eos> My husband doesn't even know that I'm expecting...<eos> Mrs. Johnson, you don't need to explain anything to me.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> So, how far along are you?<eos> Three weeks.<eos> Please.<eos> Just through there.<eos> Doctor, there must be something wrong with this thermometer.<eos> It says her body temperature is 75 degrees.
She'd be dead.<eos> All right, my dear, I want you to breathe in and count backwards.<eos> There you are.<eos> Very good.<eos> There you are.<eos> Get me the big knife.<eos> Ready the pan.<eos> Closing her up.<eos> Nurse, dispose of that.<eos> I think it's still alive.
- Hey, what's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I just hate this dress.<eos> I know, but we're almost done.<eos> I just don't even want to go back out there.<eos> No, please tell me you're not serious.<eos> Okay, you seem mad at me for what happened earlier.<eos> I'm not.<eos> It's just this stupid collar is way too high!<eos> And it just needs to be lower.
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> It wasn't a werewolf.<eos> Kanima.<eos> You're not dreaming, Tracy.<eos> You going to do a magic trick?<eos> No, but you are.<eos> I only know one trick and it's with a playing card.<eos> Well, this one involves a lighter and your hand.<eos> This is sounding less like a magic trick and more like assault.<eos> It's a little dangerous, yes.
And yourself?<eos> My objections are scientific not religious.<eos> But why your interest?<eos> Can you tell me more?<eos> I am afraid not but my thanks, all the same.<eos> And for what you tried to do for the girl.<eos> Well, then, perhaps you'll allow me to examine your hand.<eos> How long have you been taking mercury?<eos> Almost a week now.<eos> It brings hallucinations, as you know.
Yeah.<eos> I need you to re-caulk my tub.<eos> You mean like a handyman kind of thing?<eos> Yeah, yeah, that's it.<eos> Um, sort of an emergency.<eos> I heard about it on the news.<eos> There's a recall on the caulk I used.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> No. No.<eos> It causes athlete's foot.
Because Al-Zalim has a server farm in Senegal.<eos> It's, like, crazy protected.<eos> I mean, it is unbreak-in-able.<eos> Yeah, but you broke in, didn't you?<eos> I did.<eos> Only for, like, nine seconds, but I got the specs for the bug and its intended location-- the south side of the ambassador's office.<eos> And guess what was hanging on that wall?<eos> Bug is in the painting?<eos> All the more reason to steal it.<eos> Now, the most logical place to hide the bug would be in this frame, but there's no evidence that it was ever here, so it must be in some other part of the painting.
!<eos> That's it?<eos> !<eos> But we got to find them.<eos> Shouldn't McGee be pinging something?<eos> Can't.<eos> Your father left his cell phone at home, and Gloria turned hers off when she got to your place.<eos> Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.<eos> I pulled a fingerprint off Gloria Hernandez's wine glass.<eos> It matches the one from the murder weapon.
He's saying... "The chamber will open tonight."<eos> Clara, now the ghosts are out, go to the Faraday Cage.<eos> They won't be able to get you in there.<eos> Oh, there's a problem.<eos> Problem?<eos> What problem?<eos> Because everything else is going so smoothly...<eos> The phone signal won't get through.<eos> What you'll have to do...<eos> Clara, put the phone outside, and you can watch it through the little round porthole, and when you see it ringing, if it's safe to do so, go out and answer it.
The last team will be the Belcher kids.<eos> There are three of you, but I don't really see that as an advantage.<eos> Don't underestimate us.<eos> Our family's motto is,<eos> "Maybe we'll get lucky this time." I thought it was,<eos> "Stop touching that!<eos> You're getting it all greasy!"<eos> LINDA: How's the burger, Sally?<eos> You like it?<eos> It's fine.
How sure are we that this is peanut butter?<eos> 'Cause it's starting to burn.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Go on with what you were saying.<eos> Tammy, these bracelets are what got us in here.<eos> Let's use them to get us out of here.<eos> I'm throwing mine away.<eos> Thanks, T.<eos> Tammy, now you throw away your bracelet.<eos> We need it to hold up the other arm.
Look how great the sign turned out.<eos> We are now officially the "me sing?<eos> I could never.<eos> Ok!" Karaoke bar.<eos> Yay.<eos> Okay, enough.<eos> What's with all the fake yays?<eos> It's like sex with my first boyfriend.<eos> I'm just concerned.<eos> Either the bar fails and you're sad, or it succeeds, and then you own a karaoke bar.
He needs water.<eos> My heart?<eos> Yeah, good thing he doesn't know you don't have one.<eos> Well, who needs a heart... when you got a brain?<eos> Here goes.<eos> "Ground control to Major Tom."<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No signal, radio or otherwise, can get in and out of the dome.<eos> Exactly, that's why I'm jacking up the transmitter's signal.<eos> When it can't get outside the dome, it'll start bouncing off the walls, back and forth, uh, building in strength, kind of like an A.M. Radio signal, bouncing off the ionosphere when it cools down at night.

And what will happen to them?<eos> Once we've added to our numbers, we'll come back for those we have to leave behind.<eos> But for now, it's time to begin.<eos> Will it work?<eos> Whatever you're gonna do with the amethysts, the microphones are picking up the sound.<eos> I'm using shortwave to send the signals back to the radio station.<eos> Yeah, in other words, we're out of here.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Well, we have to go back to make sure the transmitter doesn't overheat.<eos> Yeah, 'cause if it crashes, we're all as good as dead, so move.
F-R-A-N-K G-O-D-W-I-N.<eos> Thanks.<eos> OK.<eos> See you.<eos> Aiden...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But, um...<eos> - I've lost my phone.<eos> - You had it on the bus.<eos> It must have, um... fell out.
You shouldn't have, people will talk.<eos> I don't know about you but if there's an emergency, I'm not removing my high heels.<eos> Sir, can I have a word?<eos> The computer has flagged that you're travelling without any luggage at all.<eos> I am required to ask if there's a reason for this.<eos> Good work.<eos> Question asked, job done.<eos> Now, can I get a little packet of complimentary nuts ~ and a mojito on the side, please?<eos> ~ Sir, can I see your passport?<eos> Probably not, it's in my pocket.
~ Look...<eos> I'll help you out in the empty pocket department.<eos> I've got you a job.<eos> You're the best.<eos> No, wait, I forgot about me.<eos> You're the second best.<eos> Do you want the job or don't ya?<eos> All you got to do is deliver an antique.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> Who's it for, anyway?
Because that beautiful... .. lumpy... stinking man in there gave everything he had to charity... including his bar.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm... a bit emotional.<eos> I do know that his last wish was that we all join together and sing the song that he thought best summed him up.<eos> HE SINGS: Come on, Eileen!<eos> Everybody!<eos> Hello, lady.<eos> Fancy meeting you here.<eos> Well, if it isn't the incredible vanishing man(! )<eos> You seem to have lost the accent.<eos> It must've fallen out my pocket when I jumped off that ferry.
Of that two bit copycat lookie-likey?<eos> ~ HE SCOFFS ~ He's lying through his teeth.<eos> ~ Good one, Zorro. ~<eos> - What?<eos> If you're not the Killer Queen, who is?<eos> I cannot tell you, for the sake of my career.<eos> Well, I wouldn't worry about that.<eos> Gracias, amigo.<eos> Good luck with your next release.<eos> It's going to be in 15 years, with good behaviour.
35 gears, Tiffany crystal bell.<eos> And the latest anti-theft device.<eos> You're not Lisa Simpson.<eos> Okay, what's the story?<eos> This we show up for.<eos> Harper, this bike is wonderful.<eos> Too wonderful.<eos> It just wouldn't be right for me to accept it.<eos> You'd rather have your crappy bike?<eos> Look, Harper, this may be crappy, but it's my bike.
Richie "the Pitbull" Falco.<eos> Come on, man. You've seen the ads.<eos> A guy's head on a dog's body.<eos> "You been in an accident?<eos> Take the law by the tail."<eos> "And get a bite at the settlement you deserve."<eos> "I'll make the law"... Your bitch!<eos> "El Pitbull tambien habla espanol."<eos> Why am I the only one who's never seen this commercial?<eos> Because it comes on late at night, and when you're not moonlighting, your honey-milk-sipping ass is in bed by 10:00.
I got a flask of slam in the back of the truck.<eos> You guys okay?<eos> These woods are dangerous. Come on.<eos> We'll take your roller to my cabin.<eos> Come with me if you wanna live.<eos> Just making sure you made it up there okay.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did you make sure the transmitter was well hidden?<eos> Naturally.<eos> Now remember, it needs to be unimpeded from the north.
Tell me about the lawkeeper.<eos> His name's Joshua Nolan.<eos> Joshua Nolan?<eos> The Butcher of Yosemite?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah!<eos> He's the scariest killer on the face of this Earth and he's gonna rip your jekking throat out when he gets here!<eos> I was in Yosemite.<eos> There was a lovely waterfall.<eos> It ran red with Votan blood for days after Joshua Nolan massacred my comrades.
The footsteps aren't loud, which means they're using the balls of their feet rather than their heels, which occurs on descending.<eos> Wow. That's very impressive.<eos> I used to work surveillance.<eos> Domestic surveillance?<eos> I was just starting to like you.<eos> Hey, whatever it takes to keep you safe.<eos> So what's three stories up at that location?<eos> Uh, it's a center for plastic surgery.<eos> Or it used to be.<eos> It looks like it's closed now.
We'll find her.<eos> We can't go without her, can we, Harv?<eos> You're being a nob.<eos> We can, boss.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> We can.<eos> - Are you taking the piss?<eos> - Come on.<eos> I had my mix in here.<eos> Where is it?
Fancy a bit of chippie to be honest.<eos> I can't believe that bloke in the middle of the road wouldn't move.<eos> - I know!<eos> - All right?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hello, darling.<eos> - Hi, love. - How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> How was your day?<eos> - It was lovely.
Yeah, good, yeah.<eos> How is college?<eos> It is good.<eos> Really enjoying it.<eos> I didn't think I would be.<eos> But I'm really getting into it.<eos> Me and Mr Sander have got you a little gift.<eos> It's an early Christmas gift.<eos> And, uh, yeah, anyway, open it.<eos> It's not a new one, mind, but it's as good as.

I bet it cost a bomb!
I'm not really Steven's girlfriend.<eos> I'm a federal agent investigating ASA.<eos> We're going to have to take you in.<eos> Decker, King, take turns watching the front.<eos> I'll go first.<eos> Take this spool, run it to the outside, see if we get a signal.<eos> I'll go with him.<eos> Give me the gun, Walinski.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause it's mine.
I need the laundry started.<eos> The workmen have finally... [ Turns off TV ] Left for the day, and I have my hands full with dinner.<eos> And please, none of your Betty Friedan stuff.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> Look, I always get stuck with the hard chores just 'cause I'm the girl.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, tough luck.<eos> [ Boy chuckles ]<eos> Man: The house is great, Ted.<eos> It's a bit of a fixer, but it's a real beaut.
We gotta track him down before he bails.<eos> Great. Well, according to county records, Holloway owns a farmhouse about 30 or 40 miles from here, so I, uh, cross-referenced it with Amelia's credit card receipts.<eos> The house is about right there, and she's been hitting up Biggersons and Gas n' Sips all around the area.<eos> Probably staking the place out.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Well, what are we waiting for?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Claire, you are not going out there.<eos> She's my mother.<eos> That house could be empty and it could be a trap.
Sweetheart, she didn't make it.<eos> Where's Roxy?<eos> Try not to talk.<eos> Try not to talk.<eos> Scott.<eos> Scott, you need to breathe.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott, look at me.<eos> I need to know where your inhaler is.<eos> Is it in your locker?
You mean another murder.<eos> Somebody get these cuffs off of her.<eos> If she was actually involved, it was self-defense.<eos> That's correct, Sheriff.<eos> Dad...<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> The sword is mine.<eos> Really?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's mine.
- Take him down the Feathers?<eos> - Not the Feathers.<eos> - They still have pole dancers?<eos> - They're mainly Bulgarian now.<eos> - Brilliant.<eos> - I meant a nice chat over a pint somewhere quiet.<eos> Not with naked women showing you their insides.<eos> You don't want a heart attack on your conscience, do you?<eos> It's a misconception that plastic doesn't degrade.<eos> It does, but not through bacteria. Through light.
It's turning.<eos> It's stopped.<eos> - In a parking lot by the concert house.<eos> - Do you have an exact location?<eos> It's completely stopped there.<eos> There's a yellow car.<eos> John, can you check registration number UUF 294?<eos> It belongs to Kjell SÃ♪der.<eos> It's empty.<eos> - Where is it?
Get out of here!<eos> Before you set off the alarm!<eos> In the research center, we have equipment which could...<eos> Could significantly improve Liam's chances of recovery.<eos> Equipment?<eos> Hyperbaric oxygen treatment can increase the viability of reversibly damaged cells by preventing hypoxia and reducing edema.<eos> Okay. If that's what he needs, yes.<eos> It's a research center.<eos> It isn't set up to treat patients.<eos> It's experimental, and there are risks.
Charlie Stoddart died on the operating table five minutes ago.<eos> I was hoping that we'd meet your husband before we left tomorrow.<eos> Is that going to be a possibility?<eos> No, I'm sorry, Eric's indisposed.<eos> Nothing too serious, I hope.<eos> No, he stood in a bear trap, but he'll be fine.<eos> What?<eos> The pulse.<eos> Yes?<eos> It's right here.
Wait, why does the drug addict get to pick?<eos> Because when one of us stumbles, we surround them with love.<eos> Oh.<eos> Why don't you make yourself useful and take care of some of your mom's chores.<eos> Maybe I don't want to be useful.<eos> It's okay.<eos> She doesn't have to.<eos> Damn right, I don't have to.<eos> The to-do list is on the fridge.<eos> I know where it is!
We're not out of the woods yet.<eos> I still got to zip. Ooh, ooh!<eos> Lay on the bed.<eos> I'll grab some pliers.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yeah!<eos> (imitating Rocky): Ain't gonna be no rematch.<eos> Ain't gonna be no rematch!<eos> Oh. I bought these a decade ago after a both-ends stomach flu.<eos> It nearly killed me, but I never looked better.
Appreciate it.<eos> Hey, Chief needs to see you both in his office.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Close the door.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Officers Burgess and Roman want to ask you a few questions about the Canaryville fire this morning.<eos> Your company was first on the scene, right?<eos> That's correct.<eos> Any first impressions on how the fire started?<eos> Best we can tell, it started upstairs in the bedroom.
I mean, this is what you wanted.<eos> Um... Right?<eos> Yeah, I mean, of course.<eos> I'd just been building it up to...<eos> I mean, he said he wanted me to be happy and that we both shouldn't have to try so hard, and then he said something about meat loaf and prime rib and...<eos> Where's the wine?<eos> Yup. Coming right up, girl.<eos> A restaurant?<eos> In North Carolina?<eos> It's ours.
Yes, Father.<eos> The key didn't belong to us, so naturally my father handed it in to the police.<eos> The following evening I returned home from work,<eos> I was training to be a solicitor at that time, and to find someone waiting for me.<eos> George.<eos> Sergeant Upton's here to see you.<eos> Sergeant Upton?<eos> For me?<eos> So you are the young fella that found the key.<eos> Yes. It was on the doorstep.

It was on the doorstep.<eos> ~ Now why would you be wondering about a reward, you of all people?<eos> Have you found out where it's from?
Come on, I'll tell Anderson to buy that shit out.<eos> Well, let's just say my feelings are still fucking hurt.<eos> I suffered deep emotional trauma due to my wrongful termination.<eos> Mmm. And plus I stopped drinking for nearly 36 hours, man.<eos> - I don't like it.<eos> - No, you shouldn't. I don't blame you.<eos> But would a 39-foot speedboat make you feel any better?<eos> He gave you a fucking speedboat?<eos> He gave us a fucking speedboat.<eos> And it's all yours if you want it.
"Paul Jenks is not what he seems."<eos> "The man is using you."<eos> "Both of you need to back off now." What...?<eos> There's your connection between Freddy Barlow and Baitfish.<eos> Who sent the e-mails?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Technically, a cloned phone.<eos> They're using the account information of a bank teller in Duluth who's paying way too much for her data plan, I might add... However...<eos> However, the cloned phone is here in beautiful Louisiana.<eos> It resides currently at the Federal Penitentiary at Slidell.
What am I looking at?<eos> The breakdown of the various chemicals inside Freddy Barlow's throat and lungs.<eos> Not just Oxy?<eos> No.<eos> So much more.<eos> This compound is a mixture of Oxy and-and seven other distinct elements.<eos> Makes it as unique a formula as a soft drink or a special sauce.<eos> I pulled data from area hospitals, police districts and the DEA-- drug overdoses, seizures-- and I mapped every single occurrence of this particular compound in the city.<eos> This drug isn't just being dealt in the Fourth Street Clinic.<eos> It's everywhere.
- So you went back.<eos> - Yes, and Archie was gone.<eos> I was relieved.<eos> And then I saw the blood.<eos> And then I saw the gun.<eos> Ah, the gun!<eos> I didn't want to leave her without any kind of protection.<eos> I... I kept it at the back of the kitchen drawer.<eos> But that's not where you found it.<eos> It was on the table.
Sherbourne Street.<eos> And what of his appearance?<eos> How was he dressed?<eos> Regular like.<eos> Working clothes.<eos> Mrs. Pearson, I am going to need to see that money and the envelope it came in.<eos> Didn't come in an envelope.<eos> It was a bag.<eos> A brown bag.<eos> - Where is it?
- Hi. I got some Georgio's reheating in the oven.<eos> Oh, you are my hero.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I mean, who says that men can't cook?<eos> I think Georgio's does.<eos> - That's a fair point. - Mm-hmm.<eos> So how was your test?<eos> Mmm...<eos> Whoa, it was that bad? You studied like crazy.<eos> No, it's not that it was that bad.
He cares about you.<eos> He was willing to do "gay for pay."<eos> Did I hear Nash is going "gay for pay"?<eos> 'Cause I've got $4 burning a hole in my pocket.<eos> Oh, a customer.<eos> Hi, welcome to The High.<eos> Here for dessert?<eos> Oh, thanks but I haven't had cake since my Sweet 16, and even then, I made myself throw it up.<eos> I'm meeting someone here and my phone's about to die.<eos> And if it dies, I will too.
Who's up for charades?<eos> Mellie's sister is in town.<eos> Wait, Harmony's in town.<eos> You need to keep her away from the press.<eos> Okay.<eos> You will keep her away from the press, but she will bring ruin anyway!<eos> We're on the edge of a great storm here.<eos> There's a strange wind.<eos> It's too warm.<eos> You know it's coming.
What I had to.<eos> You're gonna win this race, Mel.<eos> And I'm gonna be right by your side when you do.<eos> We got the ballistics report back.<eos> And?<eos> And the gun we found at Lisa Hoffman's house matches the weapon that shot her husband 15 years ago.<eos> Dad, this is great news.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.<eos> My people found the gun in a file box in Lisa Hoffman's basement.<eos> If she hid it there after shooting her husband, it had been sitting in that basement for 15 years.
- You sure do love a problem.<eos> - I don't know what you're...<eos> You're so vain.<eos> It's always about you, isn't it?<eos> The problems you create so that you can solve them.<eos> The power you have to wield so that you can feel important.<eos> Did your father and I not tell you you were special enough when you were little?<eos> Did we not give you enough hugs?<eos> Aww, baby.<eos> This uppity fantasy world you've decided to be a part of... it's not real, boo.
No, that's impossible.<eos> It's a hidden jpeg.<eos> It shouldn't even be here.<eos> Why is it empty?<eos> I have no idea, but I do know this.<eos> Nothing worse than cold mu shu.<eos> Hey.<eos> It wasn't there... the file.<eos> I opened the jpeg.<eos> It was empty.
Thanks.<eos> - Just trying to help.<eos> Look, I just... I don't know what choice we have.<eos> You could fake UNIX.<eos> Make it look like Mutiny is running on the ATT, get your better rate locked in now, actually go multiplatform at your leisure.<eos> I talked to him this morning and he knows the script, sure, but his actual tech knowledge is really limited.<eos> If you get him in here tomorrow morning and you sit him down at a demo, and if it looked real enough...<eos> No, the boot and interface screens for the 64 and the ATT are completely different.<eos> Yeah, but we can paint the screens however we want.<eos> I mean, write a Commodore program that makes it look just like the ATT.
I will not lie.<eos> Others have urged me to do just that.<eos> And I am fully prepared to cut your candle short.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Merely to help you be you.<eos> I know you find it hard to believe, but I hold no malice against you.<eos> And yet you would kill me 100 ways.<eos> As I would a savage untrained dog.<eos> But first, I might try to train it.<eos> And if that dog would accept the muzzle, then I might find that it no longer posed a threat to every innocent that passed by, may even become a... trusted companion.
The pox spreads like fire, and now there are reports of an outbreak in Andover.<eos> I must know if it is the same pox, but your militia will not let me leave Salem to investigate.<eos> You dare to walk into my house in the dead of night uninvited.<eos> My husband will have your neck.<eos> I am a doctor. I have seen your husband.<eos> That's hardly a credible threat.<eos> The people of Andover are not my concern or yours.<eos> The citizens of Salem are under quarantine, one you yourself supported.<eos> That edict was for others.<eos> I did not intend it to apply to me.
Funny you should ask.<eos> Mrs Bowyer.<eos> Good morning, gentlemen.<eos> Sir William has asked me to conduct this morning's lecture on the peripheral nervous system.<eos> Today, we have a rare opportunity of a junior subject, freshly deceased.<eos> I will therefore be taking this opportunity to conduct a display on the subject of bioelectricity, pioneering work of the Italian physician Luigi Galvani with whom you are all undoubtedly familiar.<eos> I will now make an incision in the subject's right arm.<eos> Allowing exposure of the right ulnea nerve just between the lower triceps and the bicep.<eos> Galvani's thesis was that electrical impulses are carried along the nerves by an independent system of fluids, invisible to the human eye.<eos> That this process can be seen to function in conjunction with artificially induced energy in the absence of other animate processes seems to suggest that it lies at the very foundation of what we now understand to be multi-cellular organic life.
Oh... right.<eos> It was great.<eos> Well, I... I can see you're busy.<eos> Um... see you back at the house.<eos> Okay.<eos> Try this, for your hip and back.<eos> By the way, have you... Have you seen Grey house?<eos> I heard it was abandoned and boarded up.<eos> Oh no.<eos> No, it's very much alive.
Mom, you just don't get it.<eos> It's been a long time since you were in high school.<eos> True, true.<eos> But with age comes wisdom.<eos> For you.<eos> A compass?<eos> That was Dad's.<eos> - From when he was a Scout.<eos> I just happened to find it in some boxes at the store today.<eos> Or maybe it found me.

So I will admit to being completely in the dark, but is something wrong with our kids?<eos> Seems to be more than the normal amount of animosity between them.<eos> I never know what's happening with Nick until the principal calls.<eos> You OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Growing pains.<eos> Oh. Grace?<eos> - Yeah, for both of us, I think.<eos> Well, if it's any consolation, I don't think Grace's growing pains mean that you'll be hearing from the principal any time soon.<eos> Teenagers. - Yeah. I knew this day was coming, but now that it's here...
And the cargo?<eos> Coffeemakers.<eos> So your men shoot at us to keep us from intercepting coffeemakers?<eos> They were stolen.<eos> He didn't want to go to jail.<eos> You're the leader of the resistance for east New York, Mr. Warren.<eos> We've known it for a month now, ever since we intercepted one of these.<eos> This is the symbol of your movement, is it not?<eos> We know where that truck was headed.<eos> And what it was carrying.
- Not nothing.<eos> - She died doing the right thing.<eos> - The right thing?<eos> You got to be fucking kidding.<eos> What do I do when I get there?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Uh, you wait.<eos> - I wait?<eos> - They will come to you if it is safe.<eos> This film, what does it mean?
- No, Obergruppenfuhrer.<eos> - Good.<eos> Then do as you're told.<eos> - You're smiling, Erich.<eos> - You already know the answers to any of questions that he would ask this man.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - So the subject will die<eos> - in captivity. - Indeed.<eos> His friends in the resistance will see his disfigured body, and they will conclude that he was only so badly beaten because he refused to talk.<eos> They will conclude that we don't know that truck is headed to Canon City, or what it is carrying.
Is this a joke?<eos> So what are we gonna do now?<eos> I'm getting so tired of this...<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> I just can't take this anymore.<eos> We walked into the white light... and we just kept going.<eos> And the dome was gone.<eos> And we were free.<eos> The outside world, somehow it seemed more... more beautiful, you know, more vibrant.
Yes.<eos> For the egg.<eos> Where is it?<eos> You need me.<eos> If I die, you got no one to tell you where the egg is.<eos> Let him go.<eos> He can't get far.<eos> People eating cattle feed?<eos> I didn't think that was possible.<eos> The feed had to be pulverized and fermented and it tastes disgusting, but it's digestible.
I've just been walking in circles trying to...<eos> figure this whole thing out.<eos> Did you?<eos> Ever since we woke up, I haven't been able to shake the feeling I'm pregnant.<eos> I know how weird that sounds.<eos> What we had... that felt just as real to me as it did to you.<eos> I mean, the baby, us.<eos> Did you take the test?<eos> I haven't looked at it yet.<eos> Where is it?
- How are we getting it here?<eos> - It's on wheels.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can help.<eos> I'm glad you offered, but it's mother-daughter time.<eos> Junior will be in with you in a minute.<eos> No, no, he's the one that locked us up in here all night.<eos> Mom.<eos> Did you know that Joe and I were in this room all night?<eos> The accident you caused didn't just affect Hunter, it affected our town, our kinship.
I know.<eos> I've been through it before.<eos> That's a long shot that it's still standing, but for anyone that's alive out there, it's the only shot that they have.<eos> That might not be a good idea.<eos> - Eva, where's the key?<eos> - What key?<eos> The key for the hatch.<eos> I thought you had it.<eos> - No, I stuck it right here.<eos> - Did it fall?
No.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> I can help you.<eos> There's a way in!<eos> There's a way in here!<eos> Dale, you can't help them.<eos> The world outside...<eos> it's the past.
It's for your own good.<eos> Nice work, Dexter.<eos> Help me get him back to the cabin.<eos> Oh, no. It's begun.<eos> The dome's surface is calcifying.<eos> Soon every living thing won't be able to breathe unless I can bring down the dome with Joe's help.<eos> I don't understand. How is what's happening to the dome making you weaker?<eos> Because I'm connected to it.<eos> And with the egg destroyed and one remaining amethyst, the dome has no power source.<eos> It's shutting down.
I don't know, what Julia said before, that you saved her.<eos> What happened out there?<eos> Nothing, I'm fine.<eos> Hey, there you are.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Okay, so you know the whistling the town's been doing?<eos> The amethyst responds to it.<eos> - That's great, Joe.<eos> - The strange thing is:<eos> it only actually responds when you're whistling to it.
The amethyst responds to it.<eos> - That's great, Joe.<eos> - The strange thing is:<eos> it only actually responds when you're whistling to it.<eos> Look, look.<eos> Okay, it lights up, yeah?<eos> Okay, now watch.<eos> It doesn't respond to a recording.<eos> - Okay, that's-that's fascinating.<eos> - But how does it know that?
We just need a fresh sample of the most recent viral strain.<eos> There's some more lab equipment outside.<eos> Can you go bring it in, please?<eos> Dr. Bloom's enthusiasm is misplaced, s I think you know.<eos> Synthesizing a new formula will take months.<eos> And by that time, the virus will have mutated again.<eos> Aluminum phosphide?<eos> It's a grain fumigant.<eos> I brought it in with us to help preserve the cattle feed.<eos> Conveniently, it's extremely toxic.
_<eos> What is that?<eos> I don't know, but it's Victoria's handwriting.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> And the landscape of the Hamptons will never be the same.<eos> That was always our goal.<eos> How can you not be a little upset by this?<eos> This is your home.<eos> This house belonged to Emily Thorne, not Amanda Clarke.<eos> And it was never a home. It was part of a plan.
Wilson, I need a little help here.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Derek!<eos> Grey.<eos> Grey, need a hand.<eos> I flew a plane.<eos> I had the controls in my hands.<eos> I don't know how to fly a plane, and I flew a freaking plane!<eos> We were in a plane, and it crashed.
The Bridge is over. (scats, laughs)<eos> Yeah, you see, we bringing that real hip-hop back.<eos> See, that's what the Lyon Dynasty's all about.<eos> I don't know what to tell you guys.<eos> No, no, no, listen. We already spoke about it!<eos> MALA:<eos> You can't just take my solo without talking to me.<eos> Who said they're your solos?<eos> Ugh, I'm so sick of your mouth, girl! VALENTINA:<eos> You couldn't find a C major if it was right in between your legs, which it ain't. CARMEN:
Previously on Allegiance...<eos> Somehow we need to alert the task force that the operative in charge of Black Dagger is on his way here.<eos> We plant a letter for the task force to find.<eos> Nothing.<eos> It wasn't there, the file.<eos> I opened the JPEG.<eos> It was empty.
Why?<eos> They think Alex did something... something bad.<eos> S-something bad?<eos> They think Alex killed someone.<eos> But... but he didn't.<eos> He was framed.<eos> Sarah, wait.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> We always knew this day would come.<eos> Yeah, well, now it's here.
Standard gas facility.<eos> (Sam) we have found a loft space Leased under one of his aliases, John Phillips, And we are gonna hit it now.<eos> [device beeping] [explosion booms] The Rezident?<eos> I shoot him and take his place.<eos> Help me, and you're my new number two.<eos> I think you'd be safer going back home.<eos> Sam agreed to put an FBI detail on the house.<eos> (Alex) the SVR would never try anything in front of the FBI.<eos> Sarah would be safe there.<eos> (Sarah) [sighs] where is it?
There hasn't been a single nuclear plant built since then.<eos> If thousands die, the outcry would be deafening.<eos> The public would insist on a ban On processing plants or pipelines in populated areas.<eos> Not to mention fracking altogether.<eos> Our energy boom collapses overnight.<eos> Russia is restored as the premier energy provider In all of Europe and western Asia.<eos> The energy prices in the U.S. would quadruple.<eos> And he'll only have to level one town to do it.<eos> And possibly set the entire Marcellus shale formation On fire.<eos> It would burn for a decade,
Do you see Mr. Scratch?<eos> You can talk now.<eos> I want to know what--<eos> I want to know what you're feeling.<eos> That's my team.<eos> They know I'm here.<eos> They're gonna come looking for me, and if you harm me--<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your phone isn't ringing.<eos> It was ringing.
They already had their birthday dinner.<eos> Four dishes, four sets of silverware... Frank, Donna,<eos> Clara and Jenna.<eos> But five wineglasses. You're right.<eos> So who joined them for a drink?<eos> Guess the killer wanted the victims to go through a make-believe dinner again before he shot them.<eos> I don't think so. Look.<eos> The splatter... it's on the tablecloth but not the plates...<eos> he shot them first - and then set the table.<eos> - The ritual wasn't for the victims, it was for the unsub's own gratification.
Almost like you were expecting some sudden change of fortune.<eos> It checks out.<eos> Frank brought his Jaguar in February to the body shop to repair a shoe-sized dent on the driver's door.<eos> So, Ezra does have a history of violent behavior towards Frank Kingman.<eos> That along with being odd man out in a love triangle.<eos> My gut hasn't gotten any more reliable since my third divorce.<eos> - Thank you, Penelope.<eos> I heard you were hungry, so I thought I might bring you a little surprise.<eos> What is in this?<eos> It's a croissant, and it's still warm!
I knew that I would go back to jail, s-so I paid.<eos> Everything was quiet for a while.<eos> Then, a few days ago, I get a new text.<eos> A picture of that poor man, Barrow, with a bunch of instructions.<eos> They were telling me where he would be, when he would be there.<eos> That I had to use a cab.<eos> The cops who came to my house, they have my phone.<eos> Look at it, please.<eos> It's all there. You'll see.<eos> I'll have the phone brought up, but that guy seems pretty confident it's gonna back his story.
Do you have eyes on the target?<eos> I got him.<eos> You never should have come back for more.<eos> She's not strong enough.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she's just a girl?<eos> It's exactly what we were counting on.<eos> I analyzed the metal on the ax.<eos> It's powered by a self-generating atomic charge reaching temperatures up to 2500 degrees.<eos> - How does that help? - If it gets any hotter than that it's gonna explode.
How do you know him?<eos> From church.<eos> He does odd jobs for me.<eos> I'm helping him get back on his feet.<eos> That's nice of you.<eos> So?<eos> Does it work for you?<eos> Yeah, it's perfect.<eos> Welcome to your new home.<eos> May it always be a shelter from the storm.
- No, no, no.<eos> - Good.<eos> No one from inside the lab leaked the algorithm.<eos> We've checked and rechecked everyone who works here even people without high-level clearance.<eos> Ayo's apartment was tented for termites.<eos> She was at a friend's house that morning.<eos> And Bob the test tube guy? He was working out with his trainer.<eos> Dude, I don't get it.<eos> The algorithm only exists in hard copy, only in here.<eos> It didn't just walk out by itself.
Man, how did I ever make it in switzerland without you?<eos> You didn't.<eos> You burned down a restaurant.<eos> Oh, my god. Gabi, this looks amazing.<eos> Well, your place is amazing.<eos> I especially love the piano.<eos> -is it a grand?<eos> -oh, it cost way more than that.<eos> Listen, Kal, I just want you to know That tonight's dinner with Josh is going to be completely professional.<eos> -why wouldn't it be?
Harold?<eos> - Harold Admin?<eos> - That would be me.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Thought I was gonna have to take these back to the truck.<eos> Sign.<eos> 15 laptops, huh?<eos> Startup?<eos> Trying to avoid a shutdown, actually.<eos> Let's get the ice in before it melts.
Let me get this straight, Finch.<eos> The Machine is using the power grid as a giant brain?<eos> Essentially.<eos> There's a tremendous amount of unused space in copper power lines.<eos> The boxes on the lines allow the Machine's digital signals to travel in that space.<eos> A highly complex computational system hiding in plain sight.<eos> And now that system is being flooded with energy.<eos> Driving the Machine across the country to this last corner of the grid around New York.<eos> Samaritan's trying to flatline the Machine.<eos> And we need to save Her. Before it finishes the job.
No explosives of any kind.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where's the bomb, Greer?<eos> Do you really think Samaritan would use such crude tactics?<eos> You don't take over the world with gaudy displays of violence.<eos> Real control is surgical.<eos> Invisible.<eos> It interferes only when necessary.
You must be thirsty after that long drive.<eos> Have they still got those roadworks up at Long Croft?<eos> No, they've moved onto Ash Lane now.<eos> There's temporary traffic lights, but unless you're doing the school run, it's not too bad.<eos> Mm. So did you forgo the pleasures of the A352?<eos> Yes, I tend to take that cut-through on Meadowbank now.<eos> ~ It's always quieter.<eos> ~ Ah, good. Good.<eos> So, about this cake...<eos> If you could give me a hand, it is quite heavy.
All right, we should do a global search for the symbol on the bracelet.<eos> Why did you pull your passport out anyway, Angela?<eos> We haven't traveled anywhere together for years.<eos> Well, 'cause I had to get it renewed.<eos> In case we ever actually do want to go to Paris.<eos> Paris.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Paris.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Uh, looks like it's the ancient Sanskrit symbol, meaning "warrior."
Isn't it amazing?<eos> And we haven't had a honeymoon!<eos> We will go to Florence and we will tourist the shit out of that place!<eos> You don't have to say "shit".<eos> But try to convey my passion.<eos> Always wanted to visit a convent.<eos> This is exactly as I hoped it would be!<eos> Party on!<eos> A little more on my forehead.<eos> It looks shiny.
I have come to value the concord I found with my fellow detainees.<eos> You want to stay with your new pals?<eos> Good God, no.<eos> Told you!<eos> I can't miss.<eos> - Oh, dude, that was me.<eos> - Oh, the hell it was.<eos> God, why do you got to be like that?<eos> Why does it always got to be you?<eos> Well, because you couldn't hit an elephant if it was hugging you.
Cinnabar used to be used as a pigment in supernatural artifacts.<eos> The hides of certain demons are believed to contain high levels of it.<eos> Demons including Yao-guai.<eos> A creature dating back to the Tang dynasty.<eos> Here: "Known as battlefield demons.<eos> "Drawn to the frenzy and energy<eos> "of armed conflict.<eos> "Most notably, they have the power to paralyze their victims with fear."<eos> Battlefield demon?<eos> What's it doing in Sleepy Hollow?

- I'm coming in.<eos> - You.<eos> You were the one there with me, with that thing?<eos> - Yes, I was.<eos> - Then you know I didn't kill that guy!<eos> And I'll tell everyone about it once you let these people go.<eos> You don't give a damn about the truth!<eos> All right, all right, Lorenzo... yes...<eos> I saw the monster.<eos> And it's a nasty one.
Everything okay?<eos> Where the fuck is my piano?<eos> It's been three days.<eos> The press is starting to sniff.<eos> Fine, we'll make a "no stone unturned" statement.<eos> We have any bones we can throw out there?<eos> The last time anybody saw Shane, he was picking up his uniform from a dry cleaners.<eos> We have surveillance footage of the parking lot.<eos> We got footage of a truck that's there at the same time, same place.<eos> It belongs to our suspect, Keith Dennison.
♪ Is waiting for me<eos> ♪ Now I see ♪<eos> Can't find her cap.<eos> Laura, I need to go now!<eos> Laura!<eos> - Sorry, Jack.<eos> Every morning.<eos> You didn't mind dropping by for a look at the cottage?<eos> Renewed my conviction it's the right decision.<eos> I know it's small.
A PJ original.<eos> "Dear Jocelyn,<eos> What a man can be, he must be, she said.<eos> Though not out loud.<eos> What a man must not be, he cannot be, he said, with a pop.<eos> Can I make you love me again?<eos> In a letter, for losing?<eos> If the letter is the last thing left of me, will it sit on your shelf, with my ashes, gathering dust to dust?<eos> Look, look, you were right.<eos> That gun, it is going to protect you.

Now I know how bad it is.<eos> And I'm telling you something that might help you with the preacher.<eos> I can't quite believe this is really happening.<eos> You earned it.<eos> Not just me.<eos> This has changed quite a bit.<eos> Mrs. Harris, welcome back to Hand of God.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Getting much use out of my piano?<eos> It has been a wonderful addition to our worship services.
We obviously had a situation, but we have it under control.<eos> I'm telling you, this is some kind of mistake.<eos> That gun is not mine.<eos> What was your plan, Marilyn?<eos> Take hostages, try to bring down the plane?<eos> Bring down the plane?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about the suit you lost against Oceanic, and the threatening texts you sent from this phone.<eos> That is not my phone.<eos> It was in your purse, paid for with your credit card.
Shaken, but not stirred.<eos> A 4.0 temblor off the Malibu coast,<eos> Or what Los Angeles residents call Wednesday.<eos> Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Ron Jantz,<eos> And this is a 10 Action News special report.<eos> Residents in Malibu and parts of Pacific Palisades today Are reporting moderate damage and no injuries after what...<eos> [Sirens blaring] A hundred years old?<eos> I thought this place was new. How can that be safe?<eos> Sir, I assure you, The hotel has been retrofitted for earthquakes.<eos> I know it looks threadbare right now, But we do plan to refurbish next year.
Um, she has epilepsy.<eos> This doesn't happen unless she forgets to take her meds.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I ruined your cake.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> It's...<eos> I burned it anyway.<eos> The pie!<eos> They brought us a pie.<eos> It's on the kitchen counter.
But the technology exists.<eos> It's existed since Roswell. And it's been in use, being used on humans in human testing, the taking of men, women and children that's misreported as alien abductions.<eos> - So you believe you have the how.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I think I know the why.<eos> The why is more complicated than you may ever know, Mr. Mulder.<eos> 60 years ago, we were warned about the military industrial complex gathering too much power.<eos> This is old news.<eos> The countdown has begun.<eos> It began in 2012, but no one knew.
No one knows yet exactly what we're dealing with, Sarge.<eos> No lie, lady. That suit makes me nervous.<eos> Diane Claman.<eos> I'm glad you're here, Diane.<eos> Well, I mean...<eos> Just show me where he did it.<eos> (Otis) Excuse me.<eos> What is it?<eos> [whispering] Electrical fire might be spreading.<eos> It's up above the sprinklers.
I'm Laurie.<eos> Would you like to join us?<eos> Resurrection?<eos> That's the claim from Australia as witnesses describe a man previously believed dead emerging from a cave in Wanneroo outside the city of Perth.<eos> Walked out covered in mozzie bites, saying he'd just been in a hotel.<eos> The man, identified as David Burton...<eos> I made you a grilled cheese.<eos> Jill texted you.<eos> You went through my phone?<eos> It was lying right there and it buzzed, and I couldn't help it.
- The door's padlocked.<eos> They threw us out.<eos> They put all the stuff in the hallway.<eos> - No.<eos> - Where am I gonna stay?<eos> It's okay.<eos> We can meet at our apartment.<eos> We'll figure this out, okay?<eos> - Has anybody seen my laptop?<eos> - Are you sure it was in there, Mom?
My book was on it and I don't have a backup.<eos> You didn't email it to yourself?<eos> That motherfucker took it.<eos> I know I'm behind, but I can get you that money.<eos> I just need to move some things around.<eos> Okay, so as soon as you do, you can get your space back.<eos> - I need my laptop.<eos> - Your what?<eos> My laptop.<eos> It was in the office.
Mom!<eos> Mom!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Hey! Who the fuck are you?<eos> What did you do in my house? Hey!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Is your mattress soft?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Susan is used to sleeping on the floor and then a cot, so comfort takes some getting used to.<eos> Oh. It's one of those foam memory ones, you know, that adapts to your contours.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Getting warmer.<eos> Oh, yeah. Warmer.<eos> You're getting real hot now, Kevin.<eos> Oh, you're on goddamn fire.<eos> You still here, man?<eos> Yeah, I just...<eos> I lost my phone when I was out here earlier today.<eos> Find it?<eos> Yeah, I did. It's bricked, so...
Generous people don't describe themselves as generous.<eos> So no?<eos> No.<eos> To your knowledge, did the missing person consume one or more alcoholic beverages per day?<eos> No.<eos> Do you consume one or more alcoholic beverages per day?<eos> No.<eos> Did the missing person use aluminum-based antiperspirant?<eos> She uses secret.<eos> It's aluminum-based.
God damn it!<eos> Just shut up!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Why do you keep following me?<eos> If you want me to do something, just fucking say it.<eos> I'm glad you finally asked, Kevin.<eos> There is something you need to do.<eos> In Cairo, Egypt, there is an ancient artifact.<eos> It's in a museum now.
What you are seeing is not real.<eos> I know your dad struggled with this as well.<eos> And there is research indicating that there is a genetic link...<eos> She's there.<eos> She's right there.<eos> She's real.<eos> - You believe that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Can I tell you about belief, Kevin?<eos> When the mind is in emotional distress, it will grasp at any construct that makes it feel better.
That should do it.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's poison.<eos> It's gonna stop your heart.<eos> You said temporarily.<eos> That I did.<eos> That I did.<eos> This... epinephrine.<eos> That poison's gonna work like a heroin overdose.<eos> It's gonna shut you down.
And I'm thinking to myself,<eos> "Shit, now I'm gonna have to kiss that thing because that's what one must endure if you want to get elected."<eos> So I pucker up and you know what that young man does?<eos> He hands me the baby and he just walks away.<eos> He gave me his child and he disappeared.<eos> Police couldn't find him.<eos> No wife or mother stepped forward to claim it.<eos> And that baby is now in an orphanage and it's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna grow up and it's gonna have difficulty attaching to people and it's gonna have difficulty giving and accepting love.
25 years ago, God disappeared.<eos> The archangel Gabriel decided he must destroy mankind to bring God back, but the archangel Michael stood against his brother and fought on the side of humanity.<eos> The war continues.<eos> The Prophet built the fire that protects us.<eos> It cannot go out.
He ain't breaking any laws.<eos> Man, he ain't threatening nobody.<eos> Oh, call your little buddy, yeah.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here.<eos> Oh, can't do hot now.<eos> I'll make gazpacho next time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's gonna end up in the bucket.
Your mom's right.<eos> If we wouldn't have looked at it when he was here,<eos> - we shouldn't do it now.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> You want us to go into your room and start going through your stuff?<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Hey! Just in time.<eos> The computer's decoded a whole new flood of images.<eos> It's learning at an exponential rate.
- Thanks.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Remember last night when you were all,<eos> "Let's make out," and stuff and I was like, - "No, I'm super gay."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> (male voice) We should get going, Alexa.<eos> I'm kind of on a date... with that guy Dave I told you about.<eos> Oh.<eos> I could reschedule.<eos> Alexa deserved a shot at love and it wasn't going to come from a one night stand with me.
Prince Liam!<eos> Your Highness!<eos> - Over here!<eos> - Bill.<eos> Oliver.<eos> Will the King call for abolition?<eos> Is there a connection?<eos> Sam, you know you published those pictures out of context, so does he.<eos> What do you say about referendum rumors?<eos> Will it happen?
- I need you to get me something.'<eos> - Under my vanity?<eos> In my room?<eos> Yeah. Where you kept your drugs for weeks.<eos> Yes, thank you, but it's my room and they're my drugs.<eos> Just hold on.<eos> - A gun.<eos> - 'Yeah.<eos> Be careful.<eos> The safety's on, but it's loaded.'
But... we can be happy here, too.<eos> You're not staying?<eos> We have our own destiny, Ophelia.<eos> No matter what we tell ourselves.<eos> But you're not the heir to the throne anymore.<eos> What happened on that phone call?<eos> What changed everything?<eos> This pendant.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> I don't know how it got here or what it means.
Would you care to carve, Doctor?<eos> Is that the role you wish for me... The Fiddler at Rome's pyre?<eos> I heard you were a true physician, but you are rude as a barber surgeon.<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> I must have misplaced them.<eos> Perhaps in the same dark cabinet where you keep your morals.<eos> I think we can all agree what a terrible thing it is that people are dying of plague while we feast off this fine China.<eos> Terrible.<eos> But no more terrible than life itself.<eos> The world is as it is.
I'd love a word with you.<eos> I'm KC Moss.<eos> I would love a quick interview with you.<eos> I'm from NYPD.org.<eos> Seems like we have jurisdictional issue here.<eos> So why don't you have your people call my people and then my people will lock you up for impeding a murder investigation.<eos> Well, just call me when you need my help.<eos> How was the movie?<eos> No explosions, no car crashes, not a movie.<eos> Yeah, but it did give us a possible suspect, Oliver Rivera,
Alibi checks out for both the councilperson and the web-sleuth.<eos> We are back to square one.<eos> Maybe square two.<eos> This is an email that Thomas sent to KC the night before he was killed.<eos> "Screening starts at 6:00 sharp,<eos> "and by 7:31 everyone will know who killed Raquel."<eos> Boom!<eos> I'm assuming this is important information because you said, "Boom".<eos> The film that I've watched three times in the last day and a half isn't an hour and 31 minutes.<eos> Look, it's only an hour and 29 minutes.
I can't get past this.<eos> It's like a trap.<eos> Like the world won't see the... me... the real me.<eos> Oh, no, I see you.<eos> You're a force of nature.<eos> You're gonna change the world.<eos> I have ideas.<eos> Online could be more.<eos> It could be more than just inside bullshit for anointed coder shitheads.<eos> It could be universal.

Welcome to the printing press, the newspaper, and telephone of tomorrow.<eos> With just a few keystrokes on a PC, talk to loved ones across the country.<eos> Share a stock tip, a story, tell a joke.<eos> Or, better yet, find new friends.<eos> People who share your interests... music, politics, movies, sports.<eos> It's a never-ending conversation on tap 24/7.<eos> No boundaries, no borders.<eos> It's a pathway to a new world.<eos> The key, of course, is the unique interface.<eos> It makes participation not just fun, not just exciting, but addictive.
For eternity, I hope.<eos> Oh, on and on you both went about your great strength, so superior to a higher angel.<eos> I thought we'd never hear the end of it.<eos> Now let's see how powerful archangels really are.<eos> We won't disappoint.<eos> Love that attitude.<eos> But eternity won't be enough.<eos> Your device is broken.<eos> I don't feel a thing.<eos> It's worthless.
You are looking the worse for wear, Gabriel.<eos> You did this.<eos> Well, the drugs helped, and the power of suggestion, but uh-huh, it was me.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself?<eos> Mmm, carpe diem has always been my motto.<eos> But you also proved the point of our little adventure.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't hazard a guess.<eos> Well, while your body may be strong, your mind is malleable.<eos> It can't take the same rigors as your physical form.
I know because He revealed Himself to me.<eos> Edward?<eos> Edward.<eos> I was at my lowest point, blinded by the sun, skin peeling off my back.<eos> I was approached by six horsemen.<eos> They were thieves.<eos> They wanted my canteen and a few strips of dried meat I had.<eos> And there was nothing I could do to stop them.<eos> But then as the first attacker came at me, this blinding flash of light filled the sky.<eos> It was so bright it turned night into day.
It's going much slower than I would like.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you were mister athlete.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm good at sports, but skiing is not a sport.<eos> It's not?<eos> No, it's an activity. There's no ball.<eos> Sport has to have hand-eye coordination, not hand-foot coordination.<eos> So, what about soccer?<eos> Soccer is technically a sport, but it's way below all the other handsy sports.
Well, you refused to meet her parents.<eos> Things have... changed.<eos> Have they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She and I are in a really good place.<eos> Yeah, we're in the wrong place.<eos> Gear up.<eos> Got a dead marine.<eos> Looks like the bike was headed south, lost control, crossed the center line, went over the shoulder right here at a high speed.<eos> Can tell from where it first landed.
What makes you think you're the hero?<eos> Hey.<eos> Whatcha doing?<eos> Pimpin' my ride.<eos> You drop Roscoe off?<eos> Yep.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> He was happy, I cried, stupid Candace hugged me, and on the way to my car, I accidentally knocked over her mailbox.<eos> Really?<eos> It was a tiny replica of her actual house; it needed to be done.
Talk to me.<eos> How did you get hurt?<eos> Were you in an accident?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know what?<eos> If it happened on purpose.<eos> I-I turned onto that street behind the school and I felt like I was being followed.<eos> By who?<eos> There was this dark car, it was going real slow.
So this scar is a constant reminder of how fragile life is.<eos> And how fragile my parents thought I was.<eos> Well, I think that you have proven them wrong several times over.<eos> Dr. Barmal killed herself to stop the virus spreading, right?<eos> She assumed the virus would die with her.<eos> Yeah, and it did.<eos> She wasn't contagious when she got here.<eos> The lab sensors would have detected that.<eos> Something we did activated the virus.<eos> It went live when she was in the corpse cassette.
Well, there's a rumour that the WI want to commandeer the cricket pitch for flowers.<eos> Flowers?<eos> - Mm.<eos> To bring some cheer to the village in the dark days ahead.<eos> Over our dead body.<eos> Well, nothing to do with me, of course.<eos> I'm no longer a member.<eos> Good day, gentlemen.<eos> - Good day.<eos> Of course, if a caller identifies your voice - as they often do with mine because it's quite distinctive - and they use your name, then it's fine to use theirs back.
Previously on Chasing Life...<eos> -Who is this?<eos> -That girl is our half-sister.<eos> Natalie Ortiz.<eos> We've got nothing in common except the fact that we share a dad.<eos> Since your cancer has returned this aggressively and this quickly, It's much more serious.
This is a customized virus, synthesized with the sole intent of killing one specific individual.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> He's created a supercharged rotavirus.<eos> These are very common.<eos> By the age of 5, most of us have been infected multiple times.<eos> And with each infection, we build up an immunity.<eos> So it's harmless to most people.<eos> All people. Precisely.<eos> But this rotavirus has been customized, keyed to infect one individual with a unique genetic sequence, and to devastating effect.<eos> According to the animal trials logged in these notes, it attacks the central nervous system within minutes of exposure.
If I could figure out the profile it was engineered to destroy-- You could run the profile through the DNA database.<eos> If you get a match, that's Karakurt's target.<eos> Except it won't work-- not in time, at least.<eos> I need hours-- days, maybe-- and the memorial will be over long before we can ID the target sequence.<eos> Whatever his plan, we have to assume<eos> Karakurt's already infected himself with the contagion and is a live carrier.<eos> Civilian and military security assets have been marshalled for the service.<eos> However, the assassin in this case is not armed with something that we can flag with a metal detector.<eos> The virus is transmitted through touch.<eos> It penetrates the skin.
Hey, Keen!<eos> Keen!<eos> 67 guests have been cleared to attend.<eos> There's Defense, Homeland,<eos> CIA, the Bureau on this list.<eos> It's gonna be hard to narrow it down.<eos> Yeah, so much for the good old days where you could just look for the glint of a sniper-rifle scope in a nearby window.<eos> What does it do, this virus, to the body?<eos> The CDC's still breaking it down.<eos> But they're saying it attacks the central nervous system.
People will go on believing I'm a terrorist.<eos> Check the surveillance feeds from the hotel where Connolly was shot.<eos> We already have.<eos> Check again.<eos> I want to know exactly what role Cooper played.<eos> DCFD is responding to a vehicle fire in Columbia Heights.<eos> It looks like the transport vehicle used by Mr. Reddington's people.<eos> Any signs of Keen or Reddington?<eos> Nope.<eos> We'll try and recover the VIN numbers on the transport and any vehicles it may have been carrying, but right now, the fire's too hot, so it looks like they got away.
Berkeley said there was a backup GPS system on some ship.<eos> There's a laptop pinging its location.<eos> Where?<eos> His sister's house.<eos> If Arkady has that laptop, he knows where the tanker is.<eos> I'll call Callen and Sam.<eos> Oh, uh... good luck on the inside.<eos> Don't drop that soap!<eos> What if Elia didn't give up the laptop and Arkady couldn't find it before he had to bug off?<eos> It could still be at the house.
Eh, anything but.<eos> The buyers' terminals aren't networked.<eos> Data's sent via sat phone interface.<eos> And for the virus to work, it's got to be placed at all five buyers' terminals using these...<eos> And each one of those five terminals will be in a separate room of the hotel.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Wow.<eos> Cakewalk.<eos> Oh, it gets better.<eos> In order for the virus to give us the physical location of the sellers, it must crash the auction.
Maybe those images that you saw in your dream are not really your memories.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> They're memories.<eos> They're memories.<eos> And you said follow them wherever they go, and this is where they go...<eos> Thailand. This is all about Thailand.<eos> Okay, well, why don't we take a step back from Thailand.<eos> Why don't we take a look at some of the other images, like the... the trophy.<eos> Eh, the trophy's irrelevant.<eos> Well, it was in your dream for a reason.

What were you doing when this buzzing first started?<eos> I was writing.<eos> Or, rather, procrastinating.<eos> I was stuck on a scene, so I was just people-watching.<eos> Anyone you knew?<eos> Or recognized?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That ringing... it started when I looked up at the TV.
Whale shown receives a harpoon.<eos> I will not tell you again.<eos> - we have a problem? - a police officer.<eos> Name, Mathis.<eos> A lone wolf.<eos> It does not get along with others.<eos> What is all this?<eos> Mathis has peeked around.<eos> He asked the right questions.<eos> - Apparently it is persistent.
They're not figs...<eos> Now go back and get them.<eos> But they're on the other side of the market.<eos> You should have thought of that before.<eos> Go.<eos> We'll be in the café across the street.<eos> Okay, I'll go.<eos> I worry about my sister sometimes.<eos> Check out hashtag "IhabRocks."<eos> It's trending like crazy.
- 9:00 a.m.<eos> - We better get the hell down there.<eos> Six twenty-five is O'Banion.<eos> It's empty.<eos> Excuse me, they moved the O'Banion trial?<eos> It was on recess this morning.<eos> The judge had a conference or something.<eos> It's in session after lunch.<eos> Was the recess a last-minute thing?<eos> No, it was on the books.
[Footsteps approaching]<eos> Mr. President?<eos> Speak.<eos> I assume you heard what happened with Olivia in that diner and that you saw those photos?<eos> The world saw those photos.<eos> So then you know who she's with.<eos> What's your point?<eos> My point is that Olivia's doing what Olivia always does, sir.<eos> She's trying to stay out of the storm.<eos> It hasn't even really begun yet.
That's how he knows it's working.<eos> So...<eos> Thank you for taking him.<eos> Of course.<eos> It's why I stayed.<eos> Where are we?<eos> We rejected my offer to go after Mason Treadwell, or to send you.<eos> I am not putting anyone else on his radar.<eos> But you found the trailer park?<eos> Yeah, it's in Stony Brook.
I need you to keep up the charade.<eos> For me.<eos> Of course.<eos> Mama.<eos> Oh.<eos> Now I've been looking into Margaux's finances, and she recently wired a lot of money into someone's encrypted account in the Caymans.<eos> Maybe that's for Victoria.<eos> It could lead us right to her.<eos> I thought the same thing, but the account's been open for years, receiving large sums from all over the globe.<eos> I think I may have figured out who it belongs to.
A receipt from the Clyde Hotel.<eos> Some sort of complicated math equation on a cocktail napkin?<eos> It could be calculus or something.<eos> No, it's trigonometry.<eos> See the coefficient symbol? Yeah.<eos> I-I knew that.<eos> Uh, and a... a type of funny matchbook cover.<eos> - Mm. - And a key with a number on it maybe to a safe deposit box or a locker.<eos> Or... the key to the city.<eos> I mean, I know it's kinda small for that, but what if the mayor is super-tiny? Mm.
Do it soon.<eos> I got the Chief of D's breathing down my neck, governor's office in Jersey is taking a lot of heat over this, and they're in a sharing mood.<eos> It's an election year.<eos> It's hard to run a tough-on-crime platform with this mess in the news.<eos> What if that was the point?<eos> Create a news story tailor-made to embarrass the governor, and then influence the upcoming election.<eos> You think this could be all politics?<eos> Do any of us doubt that a political operative would stoop to such measures?<eos> Governorship of New Jersey is a lucrative position to control.<eos> It's worth billions each year in contracts to one's cronies.
Afraid of hackers.<eos> They use data centers now.<eos> Data centers?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's like warehouses, stuck in the middle of nowhere, filled with computers.<eos> And you know where SOC's data center is?<eos> For the right price, I do. Gonna cost you five large.<eos> Plus I'm gonna need to find someone with credentials to get me inside.<eos> When I was working on SOC's last merger, I was given a secure passcode.<eos> It's still active.
But I intend to find out.<eos> Frank, you in there?<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Fuck!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Even if you broke the chains, how do you think you're going to get out of here?<eos> Was it worth it?<eos> All so you could pass on that stupid film of yours.<eos> That film can change the world.<eos> Yeah, it certainly changed mine.
Underground, but her leg's pinned.<eos> I couldn't free her. She's using her trouble to power a light to keep the darkness off.<eos> We just came this close to a riot.<eos> Why do you want people thinking Kira's dead?<eos> 'Cause we found William's aether.<eos> What?<eos> Haven's on the edge of chaos, and you want to throw in the supernatural equivalent of plutonium?<eos> If people knew that Kira was alive, they'd go after her.<eos> We'd never be able to keep the aether a secret.<eos> They would scramble for it hoping that it would be a cure.
Can you make me, uh... an omelet?<eos> - Sure.<eos> What do you want in it?<eos> - Everything.<eos> Take your time.<eos> All right.<eos> Calm down.<eos> You're prepared for this.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Come on, where is it?
Alexa... you're gorgeous.<eos> And if I wasn't gay, I would rip that dress off your body and lick every...<eos> But I'm gay... super gay.<eos> And even though you're an amazing woman, I'm... I'm just not attracted to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll get you that pen.<eos> By the way, I found your passport.<eos> You did?<eos> Yeah, it was in the book jacket.
- There's a hierarchy.<eos> - I know that, Patrick.<eos> Besides, she's been booking solid O.R. days all month.<eos> You're two days back from mat leave.<eos> You ask me...<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - But I'm gonna tell you anyway, Alex.<eos> You should apologize.<eos> The peroneal nerve suffered too much damage.<eos> After six months, we need to accept the fact that it's not going to recover.
- Okay, honey, I need...<eos> - Honey.<eos> - What?<eos> - The guy is here.<eos> Yeah. Hey, how is it going?<eos> I need my conditioner.<eos> - Okay, I will bring it to you.<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's the blue one in the...
Grab him now.<eos> I think one of us is going to die.<eos> I've been stabbed.<eos> I need your help.<eos> I am at a loss for words.<eos> I know how much you and your wife hate me.<eos> Believe me, the feeling's more than mutual.<eos> But despite it all, I really did think you loved our town.<eos> Maybe even as much as I do.<eos> I truly believed that, when faced with a common enemy, an enemy that wants to destroy our town and everything it stands for, that you would stand with us.
You think I want to be asking you to do this?<eos> I know you don't want to fight. Then stop trying to make me.<eos> You don't join the militia, I can't defend the town.<eos> They're going to coming here, they're going to drag every human being they can find into Darby Square, line them up, and shoot them in the head ten at a time.<eos> This is how we stop them.<eos> Why?<eos> Huh? Why does everyone hurt each other?<eos> Why is our world like this?<eos> I don't know, kid.<eos> This is how it is.
- I... can save their lives.<eos> That's really sweet of you.<eos> But you can't save them.<eos> See, there's a big rock coming and there's nothing any of us can do about it.<eos> I know.<eos> Now, be a good boy and stop patronising me.<eos> Here.<eos> You've got a bunker?<eos> Only nutters have bunkers.<eos> And it's in Slough?
How many times you want to circle this drain?<eos> - I just want to finish this book and be done with it. - Oh.<eos> That reminds me, I need to take another look at that barn fire in chapter five.<eos> It seems a little obvious.<eos> Maybe we should get that out of there.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I mean, that scene affects everyone's lives.<eos> We'd have to rewrite half the book.<eos> Well, look who's afraid of doing a little work.<eos> All I do is work while you balance your checkbook, or change your sweater, or have an anxiety attack because you found some old key and you don't know what lock it goes to.
He's come to us for help, Daniel.<eos> Please.<eos> There is a spare room in the tower.<eos> Thank you, dear brother.<eos> I'll settle her in.<eos> Flora?<eos> - Child's yours, I take it?<eos> - Would it matter?<eos> I noticed your condition when we met.<eos> It's hereditary.
They all stopped at 3:13.<eos> Oh, wait, they all moved.<eos> I think I figured it out.<eos> Look at this: They all say Goodwin.<eos> Larry Goodwin!<eos> Larry's rollin' in clock money!<eos> So that's how you afford a beach house.<eos> We've been going about it all wrong.<eos> Did you see that drawer open all by itself?<eos> It just popped open.
Yeah.<eos> Let's go inside.<eos> We're not inside?<eos> LINDA: So listen, honey, next time you're in town, you and, uh, Teddy come by, have dinner at the restaurant, on us.<eos> What?<eos> (laughs) Well, I'd like that very much.<eos> What kind of restaurant is it?<eos> Slop shop.<eos> Butt hut.<eos> It's nice.
Not lost.<eos> Just looking... Okay.<eos> Wait, what-what does that mean?<eos> You kind of trailed off there.<eos> I have, uh, said too much.<eos> So, do you know a good place to eat?<eos> Yes! Uh, we have a restaurant.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> It's not good!<eos> It's really good.
Just looking... Okay.<eos> Wait, what-what does that mean?<eos> You kind of trailed off there.<eos> I have, uh, said too much.<eos> So, do you know a good place to eat?<eos> Yes! Uh, we have a restaurant.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> It's not good!<eos> It's really good.<eos> It's not good enough for Koji, Dad!

Uh, we have a restaurant.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> It's not good!<eos> It's really good.<eos> It's not good enough for Koji, Dad!<eos> Is it good or not good?
Tonight? I can make tonight work.<eos> I will do all the shopping and cooking, so you won't even have to lift a finger.<eos> Okay, let me know what she says.<eos> I am so excited.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are the best friend in the world.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> Sorry, mama asked if her phone was in here.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's over on the bedside table.
Cross traffic coming up. It's very close.<eos> It's losing control here. It's going the wrong side.<eos> Here comes a school bus.<eos> The school bus saw him coming, it stopped.
With me, lieutenant...<eos> Sergeant Shane Mills, Long Beach P.D.<eos> Followed him all the way from 7th and Pacific.<eos> Once the pursuit concluded, my guys immediately locked down the perimeter. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> But what started said pursuit?<eos> Driver was talking on his cellphone.<eos> I signaled for a stop.<eos> He did not comply.<eos> The cellphone that you said you saw this guy talking on... Did you find it anywhere?<eos> No, but it was real.
Catch anything yet?<eos> Longshoremen unloaded our shipping container about an hour ago, dropped it in stack 14.<eos> Got it.<eos> The BIC code on that container, it's just some unaffiliated holding company.<eos> There's no address on record.<eos> Oh, look at that, looks like our boy VinXXX is keeping the same hours as you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> What, that's not your guy?<eos> I mean, it's a guy, but that's a kid.
Yes, it's like a scavenger hunt...<eos> For science.<eos> Can you give us a moment?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just wanted to see you.<eos> Well, now you have.<eos> You testing for calcium?<eos> And iodine and rhodium.<eos> What about strontium?<eos> It's just a hunch, but it could be nuclear by-product.
- You think that... you think I'm condescending?<eos> Those notes are not about you.<eos> Oh, well, I guess that there's another Soviet spy on the Hill.<eos> No.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> No.<eos> I came to you.<eos> I gave you everything.<eos> You said I was the linchpin.<eos> Who is it?
Something where we can all be together in the end.<eos> You're here now and it's a start.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Now, the war is winding down, okay?<eos> And you and I both know the problem with the Jews.<eos> We've never defended ourselves.<eos> We need weapons.<eos> Now, I know it's a harsh truth, Abby, and I don't know beans about Charlie's hush-hush project.<eos> But I'm a betting man.<eos> And I bet that it's a weapon.
I just don't believe it, you know?<eos> That accidents just happen?<eos> Do you know what she said to me that day?<eos> Jeannie?<eos> Whatever you're gonna say...<eos> Whether it's to make me feel better or just to spin some Crosley malarkey...<eos> Skip it.<eos> She said she didn't know what we were doing in the tech area, but she knew that it might change the world.<eos> And Jeannie said if the world had to change, then you were the kind of man to keep us all honest,<eos> make sure it would change for the better.
'Sorry.<eos> Looks like you were right.'<eos> You want to know who it is?<eos> What?<eos> I can find out.<eos> You go inside, love.<eos> I...<eos> I just need to speak to my friend.<eos> And don't forget the cake.<eos> It's on the table.
These are just your current account.<eos> Presumably, there are other savings, investments?<eos> He handles the money, always has done.<eos> Why?<eos> He said he was better at it.<eos> So, you don't know your financial situation at all?<eos> No, I suppose...<eos> This project, what's it called?<eos> Academy Green.<eos> And will it pay off?
Really?<eos> Feral.<eos> You don't see that?<eos> How is Simon?<eos> You see him more than I do some weeks.<eos> Tell me how he's getting on at work.<eos> Hmm...<eos> Simon's ambitious, as you know.<eos> This project's a big step for him.<eos> Will it make money?
Yeah, was he having trouble with any of his employees there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe. Uh...<eos> Eh, Sid called me last night.<eos> It was odd.<eos> Uh, he said he was going to be working late.<eos> - And that's unusual?<eos> - No. He was a workaholic.<eos> The odd part was his tone.<eos> It was anxious.
- Let's go.<eos> So, how old are you guys, then?<eos> 17, 24.<eos> - So you're quite young.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm a bit surprised at your age that you're so sure about how you feel in terms of nationalism, et cetera.<eos> - I mean... - Mm-hm.<eos> Is that common for people of your age?<eos> Were you, at 17, just as confident about your views?<eos> For Alexei and Lisa, nationalism is not just a mind-set, it's a way of life - including what they wear.
It worked.<eos> Today, I would like to talk to you about alternate paths to success.<eos> Down, boy.<eos> I wish it wasn't hard... but it is.<eos> (Chuckles) Sex.<eos> Success.<eos> Well, it's hard.<eos> It is really hard.<eos> We each have our own path.<eos> Is it straight?
I think I'm gonna get a wooden owl for the terrace...<eos> Scare the birds away.<eos> I like the birds.<eos> They clean up the crumbs so I don't have to.<eos> Aha! Caught-cha!<eos> I know what you're talking about!<eos> I sincerely doubt that.<eos> You're talking about my bachelor party.<eos> You guys are so secretive!<eos> If I didn't tell you months ago the exact date to throw it, I'd have no idea it was even happening.

May we all embrace the happiness and the warmth of... hands off the ham!<eos> We're waiting for Yolanda's sister.<eos> As usual, JoJo has to make a big entrance.<eos> If she looks like you, her entrance would have to be huge.<eos> (Glass dings)<eos> While we wait, I'd like to say thank you to Gabi for making a fantastic dinner, and thank you to all of you guys for helping me celebrate early. Before I leave for my annual ski trip with Crazy Pete.<eos> You know, (Chuckles) I'm actually the one that gave Crazy Pete his nickname.<eos> Funny story... (Thinking) Ugh!<eos> I can't believe Alan went on a Hanukkah cruise with his parents without me.<eos> (Gasps) What if it goes down?
Okay, how do I look?<eos> - Amazing. - (Giggles)<eos> I didn't hear you say thin.<eos> And you never will.<eos> Pfft.<eos> (Sighs) Okay.<eos> Merry Christmas, JoJo.<eos> Merry Christmas, YoYo.<eos> How was your flight?<eos> Oh, first class isn't what it used to be, but... oh, you'll have to take my word for that.
Whoa, whoa, slow down.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Um, I'm at his place.<eos> one of the girls from the club, she's here.<eos> She's been shot.<eos> She's dead, and I don't know where Casey is.<eos> Okay, we got a pinging order on his phone.<eos> Hang tight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, where is it?
Come on, Alicia. We can do this.<eos> Just one more nice, strong push, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I got him.<eos> Wait, why isn't he making any noise?<eos> Come on, breathe.<eos> Breathe...<eos> Breathe for us...<eos> I got a pulse.<eos> It's bradycardic but it's there.
Yeah, I'm getting to the bottom of it now.<eos> What's the problem here?<eos> It's a drug den.<eos> We want it gone.<eos> The city won't do anything about it,<eos> - so just let it burn.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Open up this street.<eos> Fire's at an alleged crack den.<eos> Residents want it to burn down.
It's a local paper, about a year ago.<eos> (Ruzek) That's Evan serving as a pallbearer for the funeral of an eight-year-old girl, his niece.<eos> She died of lymphoma.<eos> Read the next part.<eos> It what this is all about.<eos> (Ruzek) Yeah.<eos> Mouse, patch me in to Voight.<eos> You've seen the hostages.<eos> About that bus?<eos> - It's on its way.
You don't think Scott's capable of that?<eos> I want him to be.<eos> Then tell him.<eos> Keep telling him.<eos> If not, someone else will start whispering in his ear.<eos> Youwent on your own journey, across an ocean of sand, with your substitute father and your sister.<eos> I didn't know what you were capable of, what you could become.<eos> Go.<eos> Go find a new ocean to cross.<eos> It might bend you and it may break you, but you will learn what you need to know.
- Richard, don't try to save me.<eos> Remember the plan.<eos> Follow the flesh.<eos> Find Malvado's hideout.<eos> Tell me where.<eos> What the hell you doin'?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Skippy. Wake up.<eos> Where'd you send that truck?<eos> Where's it going?
They're booting the network back up.<eos> Now, you're downloading the logs, right--<eos> - Stop.<eos> Tell him to stop.<eos> - What?<eos> Don't start the boot sequence. You guys missed one.<eos> There's an infected server up and running.<eos> What's the ETA before it hits this server?<eos> The backup server up and running?<eos> It's ready, but it's not configured for auto switch.
You don't know, it's just a theory.<eos> Yes it's just a theory, but how's that hope phase now?<eos> Worse than ever.<eos> Then we've got a game.<eos> Hello, if you're watching this,<eos> I have been captured and interrogated<eos> During the interrogation, I've revealed to you the existence of the Osgood box.<eos> I've re vealed its location and the combination to open this safe.<eos> - And guess what? - I lied.<eos> The Osgood box exists, but it's not here, so stop looking.
The Osgood box can start the war.<eos> The Osgood box can wipe out all humankind.<eos> But there's a reason it's called the Osgood box.<eos> Haven't you guessed?<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello.<eos> Dr John Disco.<eos> It was my plane.<eos> I had a big plane for purposes of poncing about.<eos> It went off with a massive bang about half a mile that way.
Where is the box?<eos> We're gonna need some wheels.<eos> The van.<eos> Okay, non-verbal communication.<eos> I assume that you never bothered to learn Morse code.<eos> Specs, setting 137.<eos> Tell me!<eos> Okay, we'll have to try something else.<eos> Twenty questions. Where's your pod?<eos> Is it in a tunnel?
- Well, why not, Steve?<eos> ! Why not?<eos> !<eos> Klaus wants a teenage boy to take care of him?<eos> I guess you can take the brain out of a German, but you can't take the German out of a brain.<eos> Ooh, Jeff.<eos> Burning Klaus.<eos> I hope you like your fish blackened.<eos> I told you space changed me.<eos> It opened my eyes.
Well... you threw a very nice party.<eos> Good job.<eos> I saw you talking to Robert. Yeah.<eos> Apparently it's my fault that he and Jill separated because... I threatened to tell her about the affair.<eos> - Don't look at me like that.<eos> - Like what?<eos> I know that you think what I did was wrong.<eos> You can add that to your hate list.<eos> Honey, I really wish you would stop calling it a hate list.<eos> - That's what it feels like.
I went back and checked out that Arsenal-Chelsea match.<eos> Right about the time Mr. Gale was murdered, an Arsenal player headed in a goal.<eos> Which one was he?<eos> Which guy?<eos> This what you were looking for, Detective?<eos> Thanks, Eric.<eos> It is, indeed.<eos> Right here, we have a boot print left in Wendell's blood.<eos> What do you know?<eos> It's a match.
I am placing Twizz into protective custody before transferring him to the Witness Protection Program.<eos> But he hasn't confessed anything.<eos> Doesn't matter what Twizz said...<eos> Only what his gang thinks he said.<eos> Oh, if the Monsters find out we put Twizz in protective custody...<eos> Get a warrant.<eos> I want to do a very public search of his house.<eos> A moving truck might help sell it.<eos> Ooh, that's a good idea.<eos> And before I take that cellphone and figure out who it belongs to, let's find Big Hazard, bring him in here, and see if we can mislead him into telling us the truth.
- That won't help, Tia.<eos> No, I looked it up.<eos> It's bad for the baby.<eos> If you take your medication and get well, you're showing that you can be responsible for yourself and for a child.<eos> If you don't, you won't see the world straight.<eos> Well, that can be overrated!<eos> Right, Tia?<eos> But if you don't, they will think that you're more of a threat to the baby than you actually are.<eos> And you will love that baby... won't you?<eos> They said it was a good size, on my last scan.
Now, I've learned it was buried in the Yucatan after being dragged around the earth for a few hundred years.<eos> And originally found with it, were artifacts...<eos> Mostly worthless, except one...<eos> A scroll casing, over 1,000 years old.<eos> The casing holds a parchment which reportedly describes exactly what this monolith is, which is what I want to know.<eos> And I tracked the scroll casing...<eos> not easy...<eos> Through history, to Mosul's Central Museum in Iraq.<eos> But it was taken by your extremist buddies when they ransacked the place this year.<eos> Now, I'm 90% sure it's in this room.
Where are you hiding them?<eos> You finish your rounds, Lincoln?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Patient in 305's a little bit of a talker, I hear.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I said to leave me alone.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.<eos> We need your help.<eos> I told you, I don't know anything about that damn rock.<eos> I'm sorry, what happened to your friend, but all I heard was that it's lethal.
Madam President, joint chiefs of staff,<eos> Prime Minister Cho, it's truly an honor to be here in the Oval Office, though I wish it were under better circumstances.<eos> I just came back from a meeting with the world's top scientists.<eos> They're all dead.<eos> The virus, it got them all.

Can we order the chicken with broccoli, please?<eos> Sorry this man is ordering chicken with broccoli.<eos> Please bring the good dishes you only serve to Chinese people.<eos> Of course.<eos> I can't believe they think that's what we eat in Taiwan.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> What is this super special spicy Szechuan chicken?<eos> Ramesh, why are you looking at that?<eos> You don't even eat spicy food.<eos> It is super special.
Antibodies are stable.<eos> Madam President, we have a cure.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> You did it, Doctor.<eos> It was a team effort, Terry.<eos> What the fuck is happening?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> The virus is mutating!<eos> - How did it adapt so quickly?
It'll now be a wholly owned subsidiary of Briggs Oil.<eos> I think that makes me your boss.<eos> I like the way you think.<eos> We may have to upgrade that jacket.<eos> Belongs to a wildcatter who got margin called.<eos> If he doesn't come up with a quarter million by noon tomorrow, bank takes over his rig.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Well, that's the Bakken.<eos> One man's crisis is another woman's opportunity.<eos> How much is it worth?
This proposal is non-negotiable.<eos> The people are realizing they don't have freedom of choice so long as you exist.<eos> The people are waking up, no longer accepting your economic slavery.<eos> Meet these demands, or we will kill you.<eos> Consider yourself warned.<eos> Play it again.<eos> Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.<eos> Yo, please buy my CD.<eos> Only cost you 20 likes.<eos> Yo, it'll give you the feels, y'all, I swear. The CD's free. All's I ask is you Tweet.
I'm so tired.<eos> If you sleep, you'll never wake up.<eos> You must stay in this world a little longer.<eos> But to what end?<eos> All is lost, Mary.<eos> You...<eos> Me him.<eos> Where is he?<eos> John, where is our son?<eos> It's, uh... Witch.
Yeah, well, it's joe daddy's.<eos> It's, uh, you know, he's letting me borrow it.<eos> Man, that's cool.<eos> You're pretty sweaty.<eos> We should put on new shirts.<eos> Yeah, let's get inside.<eos> Did you walk all the way here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh. Where's the couch?<eos> It's...

Two.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> You want 100K and a pound of methamphetamine.<eos> Two pounds.<eos> And for this, I get my guys and the container?<eos> That's the deal.<eos> All right.<eos> Where do I bring it?<eos> Just put the phone down, all right?<eos> It's not yours.
- It's okay, man.<eos> - No.<eos> I thought I knew what I was doing here.<eos> But nothing's what it seems.<eos> No one's who they say they are.<eos> You want the crate?<eos> You want the phone?<eos> - You take it.<eos> - No, no, that's...<eos> - No. - It's yours, man.
Definitely.<eos> You told me that Emmett and Skye weren't dating.<eos> How could you lie to me?<eos> How could you protect him like that?<eos> Oh, so I could instead find out from him in the middle of my spring break in Mexico?<eos> I thought I was over this, but... seeing him for the first time and then hearing that... it's like a trolley pole stabbing me in the stomach.<eos> It happened to Frida when she was 18.<eos> It was a trolley accident.<eos> The pole stabbed her in the gut.<eos> It went in one side and out the other.
"Hi. I'm Ramón."<eos> So you went deaf from malaria?<eos> "Yeah, when I was a boy."<eos> I got meningitis at three.<eos> I see you already have hearing aids.<eos> "Yeah, but I got it a long time ago.<eos> Need a stronger one."<eos> Okay. What level are those?<eos> "Four."<eos> I'm trying to pick up Mexican sign language, but it's so different from ASL.
What the hell was she up to?<eos> And who was he so frightened of?<eos> Oh, Ira said you had a new lead, the pay-as-you-go.<eos> It got up and went.<eos> And now he gives me jokes.<eos> River...<eos> Come to me first, OK?<eos> Boss is on the prowl.<eos> Oh, Stevie's laptop.<eos> It's on your desk.
'It's all the days they stay dead.'<eos> 57 minutes.<eos> This is how my world works, Clara.<eos> I tick off the seconds as they pass.<eos> My life is a countdown.<eos> If I draw the creature to one extreme of the castle, and I run to the other extreme, I can earn myself a maximum of 82 minutes.<eos> 82 minutes to eat, sleep and work.<eos> My work is finding Room 12.<eos> The castle wants me to.<eos> It's luring me.
Isn't this... going a little far?<eos> Oh, I've barely started.<eos> Tell the High Council they're on the next shuttle.<eos> I thought I'd find you down here.<eos> Old times.<eos> You're a long way from Karn.<eos> At the end of everything, one must expect the company of immortals.<eos> Do you know what they did to me?<eos> A confession dial is a ritual act of purification.<eos> It allows a dying Time Lord to face his demons and make his peace, before his mind is uploaded to the Matrix.
- At speed.<eos> Do you recognise it?<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes.<eos> - The Halassi Androvar.<eos> - The very same.<eos> Hydroflax was leading the raid on the Halassi vaults.<eos> In the ensuing firefight, the whole thing blew up in his face, with the result that he now has the most valuable diamond in the universe lodged three inches inside his enormous head.<eos> So... .. can you remove it?<eos> It's very small, it might be difficult to manoeuvre it.
And that's why they call it a penal colony.<eos> Look what came in the mail.<eos> Our tickets to the Moscow Ballet.<eos> You're going to the ballet?<eos> I guess you really do love my mom.<eos> In many cultures, dance is used to celebrate valor and conquest.<eos> I'm pretty sure the ballet is used to celebrate tights and the slow passage of time.<eos> You sound just like your father.<eos> The Moscow Ballet is magical.<eos> It's powerful, yet fluid, and they're doing "Giselle."
I thought, maybe...<eos> - These are for Thursday night.<eos> - I know.<eos> Ma, Thursday night is the opening night of Taste of Portland.<eos> Really?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I did tell you.<eos> Clearly you didn't write it down.<eos> What happened to the date book I bought you?<eos> Oh, it's here.
You're having sex with his mom.<eos> But since she's into his friends, maybe later I'll give her a shot of my other, uh, signature drink. Ugh!<eos> Wh... did you just slap me?<eos> Yeah, I think I did.<eos> What was that?<eos> What is going on here?<eos> What's going on is you recast me.<eos> He was supposed to be the understudy, and now he's the underbuddy.<eos> You let him wear my fluffy robe.<eos> - It's not that fluffy.
- Take that back.<eos> Jimmy, stop.<eos> You're being ridiculous.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> He's trying to take everything from me, even your mom.<eos> He told me he was gonna give her a shot of his other signature drink.<eos> Timmy...<eos> Please tell me you have another signature drink.<eos> I have another signature drink.<eos> Is it in your pants?

To the agents who want to join the BAU.<eos> We'll use our shorthandedness to our advantage.<eos> C-cool.<eos> The unsub that we're looking for is a contract killer who is doubling back to kill his former customers.<eos> This man is highly skilled and well-trained.<eos> Under no circumstances should he be engaged without back-up.<eos> So is this a case of organized crime tying up loose ends?<eos> Organized crime's got nothing to do with this, at least not in the traditional sense.<eos> In 2013, the Bureau took down the Silk Road network.<eos> Our initial assumption was that it was an encrypted online market for illegal drugs, which it was, but upon further inspection, we were stunned at the breadth of goods and services being traded online.
Not just sand - impossible sand.<eos> The monolith's case is a clean room.<eos> There's nothing in there but that rock.<eos> Not even dust.<eos> Unless you blast it open with a shotgun and contaminate everything.<eos> That's not what this is.<eos> Okay, the sand itself - not unusual.<eos> Mostly silicone-dioxide particles just like on earth.<eos> But you're saying this sand is not from earth?<eos> Sir, carbon dating shows that - It predates the earth by a billion years.
- Oh, good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mack...<eos> Mack, push that lever.<eos> No, the one... the one that's... the one that's down.<eos> The one... the one beside it.<eos> Push it.<eos> Everybody, stay clear!<eos> Fitz, it's working.<eos> It's staying open.
You're really having a hard time with this, huh?<eos> Damn it. Yeah.<eos> Daisy, hey.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm better.<eos> That pulsing sound was killing me.<eos> What pulsing sound?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> It was deafening.
I'm what makes you special.<eos> Blah, blah, blah.<eos> Play's over, Shakespeare.<eos> Amanda, I'm sorry for, what I must do to you.<eos> Promise I'll be a gentleman and respect your modesty, while I cut you into small pieces.<eos> Well, maybe just one last little peek at those...<eos> Shit!<eos> Amanda? !<eos> You know what?<eos> I like the forest in the fog. It kind of glows.
It's just a bunch of old photo albums.<eos> I assume you don't want them.<eos> [Crying] Shut up.<eos> Stop acting like you're the only one who lost her.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> [Sobs] You just take what you want and get out.<eos> Go.<eos> And tell them they better not screw up the spotlight on top.<eos> This phone's broken.<eos> It hasn't rung or gotten a text message all day.

That's my choice.<eos> Being an analyst is... it's way cooler.<eos> I get to sit back, I get to put my feet up, scroll through all the #whitehuskies on Instagram while you have to pick through five years of some crazy dude's garbage.<eos> Oh, look at this one. Isn't this one just adorbs?<eos> By the way, you got a tissue stuck to your arm.<eos> Hopefully, that's not a happy tissue.<eos> You know, I would have thought you'd changed after everything, but... you're still the same.<eos> They shouldn't have let you back in.<eos> Hey, if you want to call the Director and complain, I got his number right here.<eos> It's under "Favorites."
Eh, mahal?<eos> The new agent review board investigates any and every breach of the Nat code of conduct.<eos> It also assesses the fitness of the accused to continue on at Quantico.<eos> Natalie Vasquez, will you please step forward?<eos> Natalie, we have reason to believe that you have been less than candid on your application.<eos> I didn't lie.<eos> How did you get that scar on your neck?<eos> I ask you again, how did you get that scar?<eos> One of the field counselors this morning saw that scar coming off your skin.<eos> It's not real, is it?
You okay?<eos> I will be as long as you stay away from me.<eos> That's both of you.<eos> Upon your arrival at Quantico, I promised myself that I would graduate the best class the Academy has ever seen.<eos> We don't need more agents.<eos> We need better ones.<eos> This test is designed to see not only what you have learned so far, but what you have become.<eos> In front of you is a piece of paper and a pencil.<eos> When I leave this classroom, the exam begins.<eos> When it ends is up to you.
Bye-bye!<eos> Natural birth?<eos> Easy for you to say, Brooke Burke! If I had a birthing canal that straight, basically, having a baby is like taking a big fart.<eos> All right, yeah, sure, that movie was beautiful and well-made, but at the end of the day, what are you gonna remember more:<eos> A great movie, or a good ol' Frisbee made in the U.S. of...<eos> - Chernobyl?<eos> - Okay, just...<eos> Y'all mad. That video was hella compelling.<eos> And everyone knows Brooke Burke doesn't get out of bed for less than $10,000.<eos> Okay, it wasn't compelling and everyone hated it.
I can't just slap you.<eos> You have to say something I find offensive.<eos> Beyonce's really 44!<eos> [gasps] Oh, God!<eos> That did nothing and I've betrayed Beyonce!<eos> - I feel better. - [crying]<eos> ♪ ♪ Mindy?<eos> Sorry.<eos> [gasping] Okay, I have an idea.<eos> I'm just going to raise this baby inside of me, and then it can just see out of my mouth.
Look at him.<eos> He's all that matters.<eos> - I love this guy.<eos> - Hey, did you find my gun?<eos> There's a gun in here?<eos> No.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> [playful music] Found it.<eos> It was in the toilet.
I got you some good candidates right here.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> I really need this whole working-mom thing figured out before Danny gets back.<eos> If he gets back.<eos> I haven't heard from that guy in weeks.<eos> He's coming back!<eos> And I need to find a nanny so good with Leo that I can keep working.<eos> Won't that make Annette mad?<eos> She threw out a teddy bear because she thought it was a rival.
The exchange is off.<eos> Yes, these are Boris' men.<eos> And now, there is another happy midget.<eos> Look at it.<eos> Lady, same same.<eos> - Madam, they are twins.<eos> - The same!<eos> The color, different color.<eos> But it can be painted.<eos> If painted black, it will look just like you.
But tonight I'm dancing.<eos> But tomorrow, business again...<eos> Thank you for the drink, have fun, guys.<eos> Have fun.<eos> - She'll come back, I guess.<eos> - You didn't ask if she had a friend.<eos> When could I have asked?<eos> She took just one sip and left.<eos> This drink is so sour.<eos> It doesn't agree with me, brother.
What are we supposed to do, head-butt the missile?<eos> I had promised my mom, this summer, I was going to take her to the thermal springs in Afyon.<eos> Hold on, don't sink into despair.<eos> What is this?<eos> Really?<eos> Let's see if you'll like it.<eos> One who hasn't seen others' missile, thinks his own is the biggest.<eos> - Do you think it'll work?<eos> - It will, if we dabble with a few parts.<eos> The battery is dead, it's not working.
You guys?<eos> Two lousy tradesmen, one retired soldier, who is also a bad singer, and a skinny little girl?<eos> You put it very nicely, it's a lovely mosaic.<eos> I'm electrified by him.<eos> How about you guys?<eos> Do you know the name of the gnome in your hand, ManÃ§ov?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - It's Dipshit.<eos> I told you there was a crack in the gnome, but you went ahead and wired it with electricity.<eos> And now, it has short-circuited.
There's no point to that.<eos> But I do.<eos> Then you're just as weak as him.<eos> You're not sad?<eos> Why should I be?<eos> It's a beautiful night.<eos> The weather is nice, and I'm enjoying my cigarette.<eos> The bug forces the software to adapt, evolve into something new because of it.<eos> Work around it or work through it.<eos> No matter what, it changes.
Stop speaking.<eos> Just tell me what you need in order for me to fix this, and I'll do it.<eos> We need to break up.<eos> Angela, come on.<eos> What choice did you give me, Ollie?<eos> Look, I know I have a problem.<eos> I'm not denying that.<eos> Well, maybe my problem is I can't be with a guy with your problem.<eos> Where's the CD?<eos> It's in my... in my bag.
The respect of people you know and the people you don't... it's a shitty feeling.<eos> I'll have "the girl" let me out.<eos> Flipper.<eos> Is she microchipped?<eos> Okay, very good.<eos> Housekeeping done. Now onto the real business.<eos> - Has your dog ever eaten trash before?<eos> - No. I mean, not that I remember.<eos> Well, lucky for your bank account, the piece is small enough to pass on its own.<eos> Unfortunately, though, it's large enough to send her puking all over your apartment.
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> Fitz!<eos> You're safe.<eos> That portal won't open again.<eos> But it has to.
So from now on, will you just please stay put?<eos> - That doesn't matter anymore.<eos> - Why?<eos> 'Cause I know how to get us home.<eos> This is where you came in.<eos> This is where I came in.<eos> _ All right, professor, I'm listening.<eos> The Monolith creates a wormhole ... a direct line from its location on Earth to a fixed location here.<eos> You said the portal is moving.<eos> It appears to be moving, but it's the planet that's moving, rotating on its axis.
The planets, the math...<eos> - Scoliosis.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I had scoliosis as a kid.<eos> I had a small surgery to correct it.<eos> I was flat on my back for a few weeks, so to help combat the boredom, every night, my father would wheel my bed out and talk about the stars.<eos> Nice job, dad.<eos> So, this portal ... how do we know it's not just a door that swings one way?<eos> I think it acts more like a valve.<eos> On Earth, it seemed to open randomly, but it only appeared random from our point of view.

Mr. Tagomi, you've met my faithful bodyguard.<eos> They know, don't they?<eos> About what?<eos> That I'm not Baynes.<eos> They took my passport at the Embassy, and they haven't let me out of their sight since.<eos> Where's the microfilm now?<eos> I don't have it, not at hand.<eos> I...swallowed it.<eos> And it's proving difficult to relax.<eos> At least it's safe.
Then, I'll go without you!<eos> God forbid we should ever do anything as a couple!<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I want to make sure Balzathar's glass eye didn't fall into his water bowl again.<eos> Ooh, he just sent me another photo!<eos> What are we looking at?<eos> I'm not sure!<eos> Oh...<eos> All right, I'm leaving for dance class.<eos> I cooked dinner.<eos> It's in the oven.
Stand up straight, Robert.<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> And be more personable today.<eos> I'm trying, dear.<eos> Try harder.<eos> Stuart and Violet, would you like to begin?<eos> You can sit the rest of this out, Vi.<eos> What are you doing, Freddie?<eos> And where did you get that outfit?<eos> It's from when I was in Cats.
Sometimes you sacrifice a player to save the game.<eos> You just remember when I come calling that I chose a side.<eos> This is the place. Matches the Endotex location.<eos> High-voltage, zinc-coated razor wire, iris recognition?<eos> Staggered perimeter patrols.<eos> They don't want any visitors.<eos> - It's got to be a front, don't you think?<eos> - So what now?<eos> Now we use the new dwarf Fitz crafted.<eos> He doesn't think it's ready yet, but that's stupid because it's awesome, so...
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> Why do you want to rebuild the portal, Jemma?<eos> Because I have to get back there.<eos> I've run dozens of simulations, the Monolith was just one option, though.<eos> We're not gonna give up, okay?<eos> What is it?<eos> Some kind of suspension gel?<eos> It keeps them in stasis ...
- Why would I be a suspect?<eos> 'Cause you're with S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Okay. I ...<eos> I'm not sure I'm following.<eos> Lash is in S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> And with your help, I can prove it.<eos> I appreciate you showing me around like this.<eos> We built this module to help those in transition.<eos> It's made out of adaptive material, so it can contain all sorts of powers.<eos> It's also bulletproof, which comes in handy when people like you shoot at people like me.
Because you're not the only reason for us going to Nanda Parbat.<eos> [Sirens]<eos> [Indistinct police radio chatter]<eos> What happened?<eos> The ambulance didn't make it to Starling General.<eos> We tried to get the paramedics on the radio, and then we got a 911 call reporting this.<eos> Machin, he, um...<eos> I don't really know how to describe what he did to them.<eos> I'm not sure what that symbol means.<eos> It means anarchy.
I know it feels creepy, and it looks like something out of a horror show, but after reviewing the last three years of this woman's medical records, I am fairly certain that the cause of death was metastatic breast cancer.<eos> No possibility of murder?<eos> With this kind of decay, it is tough to determine. But I can tell you, she wasn't strangled, beaten, or shot.<eos> That's it?<eos> Sorry.<eos> This is what happens when you put off seeing your pathologist for a few months.<eos> Brad Powell has a younger brother, Ryan, who we're trying to locate.<eos> Recently separated from his wife.<eos> Was not at the temporary address she had for him.<eos> - Does he have a phone? - It's offline.
Waiting to find a missing child must be the hardest thing a family ever faces.<eos> We know how difficult it is to stay hopeful for so long.<eos> That's why you dragged us out of our home?<eos> To sympathize?<eos> I wish it hadn't been necessary to ask you back, but you don't want to be at your house while we're serving a search warrant there.<eos> But what are you searching for?<eos> What could we have in our house that would help you find Kevin?<eos> This is a Fabrique Nationale 5.7.<eos> You have one registered in your name.<eos> We'd like to know where it is.
It was horrible.<eos> Horrible.<eos> - Well, that could be true. - And from then on,<eos> - we had to do things Mike's way. - One problem, though.<eos> It's odd.<eos> It's just odd.<eos> I mean, you say that Mike was calling all the shots.<eos> Did that include the one that ended up in the back of his head?<eos> His house was torn up and tossed when we got there.<eos> He had a stash space, but it was empty.
So you did reactivate it.<eos> Hello, I.T. department that calls me only when there's a problem.<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> - There's an FBI task force here.<eos> An energy pulse was detected inside our facility right before, um... an apparent security leak.<eos> - Have you found the cause?<eos> - Well, ma'am, I think it could be the S.H.I.E.L.D. containment module we brought in.<eos> Dearest, is it possible that your containment module tried to access the ATCU's system?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> It scans any local network it finds.
And with barely any knowledge of diphthongs, sibilants and phonemes.<eos> How come she can read and I can't?<eos> All right, calm down, young man.<eos> Not to worry, you won't need to read.<eos> You see, customers will just point to a picture of the burger that they want you to flip.<eos> Because you're not gonna have anything going.<eos> Very nice painting, Lisa.<eos> We're putting it right over the couch.<eos> I made a drawing, too!<eos> It's on the refrigerator!
And you?<eos> Elisabeth and I knew we would always be together.<eos> We've always been together.<eos> The agreement was that I never would tell something to someone.<eos> That was the condition for this.<eos> So you never told about this for someone?<eos> Nobody knows that I mourn.<eos> I don't know if you can imagine how it feels not to bury the one you love.<eos> The cake smells delicious.<eos> Is it ready yet?
The murders are a sign.<eos> You may be the next victim.<eos> The profiler is appoaching.<eos> We need to push the shipowner harder.<eos> They have closed the traffic on Essingeleden.<eos> An accident, I think we should change our route<eos> Where are we going?<eos> We could have taken Liljeholm Bron or GrÃ♪ndalsbron.<eos> I followed the GPS.<eos> I do not understand why it sent us here.
Get some more while you're out?<eos> I'll see you around.<eos> Whatever it is, you don't need to hide it from me.<eos> It's for your own good, slugger.<eos> The less you know, the less you can be incriminated.<eos> Yeah, well, my fingerprints are all over the shipment, so if you go down, I go down with you.<eos> That's right. We both go down.<eos> How's your nose?<eos> My nose is busted.<eos> How does it look?
- Oh, come on.<eos> What, an ancient alien god?<eos> Are you people hearing the words coming out of your mouths?<eos> - The world's changing.<eos> Deal with it.<eos> - You were there.<eos> - Did you see it?<eos> What's it like?<eos> - I did see it.<eos> But I can't really describe what it looked like.

Dr. Pym?<eos> You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.<eos> Sorry, I just have one question.<eos> Who are you, who is she, what the hell's going on, and can I go back to jail now?<eos> Come with me.<eos> 40 years ago, I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.<eos> Huh?<eos> I learned how to change the distance between atoms.<eos> That's what powers the suit.<eos> That's why it works.
Wonderful.<eos> Mr. Carson introduced me to these fine gentlemen here.<eos> They're representatives of Hydra.<eos> They're not what they were.<eos> They're doing some interesting work.<eos> And I'm enjoying myself.<eos> You tried to hide your technology from me.<eos> And now it's gonna blow up in your face.<eos> Wow.<eos> I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away, but I just figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.
And at some point, you went to pick up a to-go order?<eos> Yeah. At about, uh, 10:20 P.M., Howard called me.<eos> He put the woman who runs the game on the phone.<eos> She asked me to pick up steaks for everyone, including myself. I went to Raleigh's Prime Rib, did that.<eos> Raleigh's Prime Rib. Seven steak dinners to go at nearly 11:00 P.M.<eos> That should be memorable.<eos> So...<eos> Do you see the phone number, Lieutenant?<eos> Who paid for this to-go order?<eos> Well, it was in my name, but the lady put it on her credit card.
- Happy Thanksgiving!<eos> - Here we are. - Oh, God.<eos> You know we wouldn't forget about you, sir.<eos> Mashed potatoes, no gravy, pureed corn, without butter, sir. A little turkey breast, if you're off the vegetarian thing.<eos> - No dressing, but we do have pie. - God, it smells delicious.<eos> You know, they wouldn't let me have breakfast for some reason.<eos> Andy, I'll serve. I'm sure you'd like a bit of everything.<eos> Bring it on.<eos> So, where's this clot?<eos> Oh, uh, well, she said it moved, uh, up... up to here.
She endangered national security.<eos> We acted within the law.<eos> My client acted as a responsible journalist.<eos> The only criminal act here was the one she exposed, which is why the very first judge I called ordered her release.<eos> You and your bosses will hear about this.<eos> So will your client, if she publishes any more documents.<eos> We'll put her on a plane back to the States, and all the expensive lawyers in the world won't stop us.<eos> Come on, let's get out of this shit hole.<eos> This camp, Alladia, is home to 20,000 refugees.<eos> By the end of next week, it will have 30,000,
That is not the dress we picked out.<eos> I thought this was more playful.<eos> It's white!<eos> Oh, it's furthest thing in the world from white.<eos> It looks like you're getting married.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> Really?<eos> I haven't got time for this.<eos> What about the limo?<eos> Is it out front?
Oh, and, uh, you and I both know who that is.<eos> It's all right. You'll get it.<eos> Perhaps it's time for a spot of tea.<eos> Calm nerves lead to clear thoughts.<eos> You're here so I can keep an eye on you, mute handmaiden.<eos> I don't need you rolling your eyes at me.<eos> We need to clear the air.<eos> Fine.<eos> Oh, there you are, my lovely voice.<eos> - It's so... light and feminine.
Something known as the dagger of the dark one.<eos> I've heard tales of it.<eos> Well, I think you're the man to help me find it.<eos> After all, you're the only one who needs it as bad as I.<eos> You're desperate to destroy the power of the Dark One.<eos> Only Merlin can do that.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> No one knows what Merlin really wants, but with that dagger, we wouldn't need Merlin.<eos> I could reforge Excalibur into the sword it once was with the power to destroy the darkness once and for all.
A sweet sound.<eos> A strange sound.<eos> Let's go have a look, shall we?<eos> So that's where it's coming from...<eos> Your dagger.<eos> Since Regina left it in her room, I say, uh, finders keepers.<eos> So she put a spell on it. That's nothing for you.<eos> Shatter it.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's calling to its other half.
It's too late.<eos> I'm so sorry, Killian.<eos> But I did not have a choice.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, there has to be some other explanation.<eos> Are you finding the truth hard to swallow?<eos> Here.<eos> Have a look at the sword.<eos> A glamour spell.<eos> It was there the whole time right under your nose, and you didn't even see it.
You won't find the helm here.<eos> I will if you help me look.<eos> Check that sideboard.<eos> No, you won't find it because it's not here.<eos> I packed that helm in dad's trunk myself when we left to fight the Southern invaders.<eos> You mean he was wearing it when...<eos> When he was killed.<eos> What was the witch on about when she said dad didn't know how to lead?<eos> What do you think the helm's magic did?<eos> Whatever it did, I'm sure Fergus had good reason for needing it.
No more questions about me.<eos> There it is.<eos> Whoa, whoa, easy.<eos> Easy. Easy.<eos> I see you've met me pet.<eos> I'm afraid I won't be as easy to subdue.<eos> We're here for the magic helm, I need it to save my kingdom.<eos> You're not the only one, dear.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't have what you're looking for.<eos> - Where is it?
I'm not going back to your dungeon if that's what you're thinking.<eos> You really think I'd come all the way to this wretched place just to drag you back to Camelot?<eos> We're here for something else, dear...<eos> Your father's helm.<eos> You, the witch...<eos> Why does everybody want that bloody helmet?<eos> It's the only way I'll ever save my kingdom.<eos> So has the witch threatened to turn your people into bears, too?<eos> You don't even know what the helm does, do you?<eos> It has the power to make other men fight your battles, however dangerous they may be.
We need that helm to stop the witch from cursing this land.<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna have to find some other way to do that.<eos> And who will even notice?<eos> These people are practically animals already.<eos> Even if we wanted to give it to you, we can't.<eos> We don't have it.<eos> Perhaps you don't, but we will.<eos> That belonged to my father!<eos> I know.<eos> And with a simple locator spell, it'll lead us to another one of his possessions...
God, I could just kick my stupid self!<eos> Clearly, missing Marvin has a way with the ladies.<eos> Maybe you could help us pin all of this on Marvin.<eos> My hotel handles a lot of sensitive material for celebrities. This is the kind of thing that could get me blackballed from the concierge industry forever. So...<eos> Why did you file a missing-persons report for someone who obviously betrayed your trust? Because I hadn't put it together yet. I'm not a detective, okay?<eos> At that point, I was still worried about Marvin. But a few days later, when cops came to my work talking about the robbery and asking if anyone had access to Jagger's schedule, I realized he had completely screwed me over.<eos> I withdrew my missing-persons report before my bosses found out.<eos> And you haven't seen Marvin since?<eos> Well, I tried calling his stupid cellphone, but the number's been disconnected. I even went down to his stupid restaurant.<eos> Guess what... It's closed. H-hold on.
Previously on "The Fosters"...<eos> I'm always gonna have feelings for you.<eos> But I don't trust you.<eos> Nothing's fine right now including my marriage.<eos> I don't even know what that little kiss was about.<eos> It was nothing.
She helped them build their case.<eos> We need to help her do the right thing.<eos> Is it possible this crooked politician conjured the wraith to conceal his scheme?<eos> Right now, who did doesn't matter.<eos> If the wraith is targeting anyone who knows this secret, she is next.<eos> Next but not last.<eos> You cracked the case, Lieutenant.<eos> And in doing so, you let us in on their secret.<eos> The whispering wraith may threaten Susan James, but now we know the secret.<eos> It will most certainly come for us.
After what you showed me today, try and convince me otherwise.<eos> Like you said, solid first few days on the job.<eos> See where it takes us.<eos> You know, I think after being handcuffed to a tree, I, uh, I deserve some kind of an explanation.<eos> Once you open the door, Joe, this whole world that Abbie and I are a part of, you can't close it so easily.<eos> You know, whatever my father was after, he wasn't afraid to find it.<eos> It was his life's work, Jenny, and he never got to finish it.<eos> Never found what he was looking for.<eos> What kind of a son am I if I don't at least try to pick up where he left off?<eos> So, if the shard meant something to him, it should mean something to us.
Mm. So I have even less dignity in that story. So that's the one we'll accept as true.<eos> "from a hairier part of your body and surgically implant them on your lip." I'm not doing that. But you're the perfect candidate.<eos> Back-stache, belly-stache. Hello?<eos> Butt-stache! Can we just...?<eos> Let Tina have the floor finally? Yes, because I know that even if there's no mustache that night, Mom and Dad would still fall in love because of fate, which is great!<eos> Remember?<eos> ! This is how you throw a shrimp! Ow!<eos> Done. They're in love. Everyone got that?<eos> Everyone clear?<eos> Uh... that doesn't sound right. Yeah, Dad makes a weird noise when he's hurt, and it's not attractive to women or anyone. It scares cats.
Oooh, I'm sorry booboo.<eos> I got carried away.<eos> Don't you worry your pretty little head.<eos> Doc.<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> You got anything?<eos> You're just nervous, papa.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're gonna love that baby no matter what.<eos> Even if it looks like you.
I'd feel a whole lot better if they at least tried to kill us.<eos> Only in a messed up apocalypse was that the right thing to do.<eos> I see something!<eos> That is not a head.<eos> Yeah, but sometimes that happens, right?<eos> Sometimes they get turned around and they come out feet first, right?<eos> Uh yeah, but that's not a foot.<eos> Whoa!<eos> That baby's not waiting to get pushed out.<eos> It's pulling itself out.
You want to reconnect with that deadbeat?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Just don't come crying to me when it turns out he's still a jerk.<eos> It's go time.<eos> Hey. Where's the monster, Greg?<eos> - Show us.<eos> - There!<eos> - Where?<eos> - To the left!<eos> Where is it now?
It was a trap... - built for a very specific threat. - The Draugur.<eos> And since Howe was their commander, anyone that survived would try to rescue - their master's body.<eos> - And, in doing so, would be faced with their only weakness,<eos> Greek fire.<eos> Yeah, Brennan said it was just some kind of napalm.<eos> We'll get our hands on some.<eos> - Why would that pose a threat to the town?<eos> - Because Greek fire is far more sinister than your napalm.<eos> It cannot be extinguished by water or by sand.<eos> Once unleashed, it burns until nothing remains.
- Mm.<eos> Yes.<eos> December 1776, the Colonial troops were camped out in Pennsylvania after a harsh winter.<eos> Ah. "I was summoned by a woman "of exceeding bravery and fortitude.<eos> "A former seamstress who became Washington's most trusted wartime operative."<eos> Betsy Ross.<eos> Your ancestor and my trusted companion knew one another?<eos> No name's given, but it does sound like her.<eos> Well, read on, Lieutenant.<eos> "I entered the camp to find it gripped by a pall of fear and paranoia."
Revere holds the key.<eos> His account of the Eye features a series of seemingly arbitrary numbers in the marginalia.<eos> A Dumas code.<eos> Revere left a final encrypted entry the day following the death of young Jonathan.<eos> The energy of the Eye dispersed, leaving destruction in its wake.<eos> Yet the artifact itself, now freed from its hold on poor Jonathan, remained intact.<eos> Revere then used the staff from whence the Eye had come to draw it out.<eos> Now, Washington decreed the Eye too dangerous.<eos> 'Twas to be hidden, to prevent it - from falling into the wrong hands... - Hold on, hold on.<eos> That staff, it was like an Eye magnet?
- something... something...<eos> - Ya finished?<eos> Okay, first thing we need to do is set up camp for the night.<eos> We need dry wood for fire, we need fresh water, and we need someone on traps.<eos> - Snotlout, what is that?<eos> - It's an "S" for "Snotlout."<eos> I think aesthetically it would look nice flying over.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> It doesn't matter what the outpost looks like.<eos> It needs to be functional and operational.
Okay, I'm gonna stop you there.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Okay, fine, let's just check this out so we could all go back to sleep.<eos> Okay, when this giant beast rips us limb from limb, I will expect a full apology from each and every one of you.<eos> And a handshake.<eos> No, you won't be able to shake hands 'cause your limbs will be gone.<eos> Shh.<eos> Aaah!<eos> No!<eos> It was here, and it was huge.
Right.<eos> When exactly did you start having trouble with it?<eos> A few weeks ago.<eos> We didn't even know it was on the island.<eos> And then suddenly it was everywhere.<eos> First is just went after wild dragons, then it started coming after us.<eos> And how many dragons has it killed?<eos> None yet.<eos> This dragon is more than strong.<eos> It's fast, it's smart and it's elusive.
Yes, it does.<eos> Look at the two of us...<eos> two Viking men on the hunt, scheming to catch a wild beast.<eos> See?<eos> You're cheering up already, right?<eos> Let's not get ahead of ourselves, son.<eos> There!<eos> You see what I mean?<eos> Every time, we just miss it.<eos> Well, we didn't see it fly away, so it has to be on foot.
These footprints are fresh.<eos> We should be right on top of it.<eos> It's like the beast can sense us coming, and then it changes direction.<eos> A truly worthy adversary.<eos> We have got to be getting close.<eos> Ah, I don't think so.<eos> We've been here before.<eos> Look at the broken branches on this side of the trail.<eos> The beast has doubled back on us.<eos> Wait, you think it knows we're hunting it?

And why isn't the Rumblehorn following us?<eos> Because it's following him.<eos> Mr. Boar, come back, please.<eos> I just want to have a friendly chat.<eos> Let's get his attention, bud.<eos> Aha ha!<eos> Stormfly, spine shot!<eos> Hyah!<eos> For as powerful as that dragon is, he doesn't seem to have a real thirst for blood.<eos> Not yet, but it's still going after Gobber.
- Dagur.<eos> - It makes sense.<eos> If Dagur has a dragon and is attacking ships,<eos> - then who's to say we won't be next?<eos> - Hiccup!<eos> You got to see this.<eos> Those are some deep gashes.<eos> Any idea what it could be?<eos> This dragon is extremely powerful.<eos> It has the slashing attack of a Speed Stinger yet from the depth of the strikes it appears to be as strong as a Typhoomerang.
And let the game begin.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Let me see.<eos> I'm thinking you two are muttonheads.<eos> Yes!<eos> I win!<eos> I was actually thinking, if we find the dragon, we find the rider.<eos> And I have a pretty good idea of how we can find the dragon.<eos> Sharp!<eos> Did I say that it's sharp?
Yes!<eos> I win!<eos> I was actually thinking, if we find the dragon, we find the rider.<eos> And I have a pretty good idea of how we can find the dragon.<eos> Sharp!<eos> Did I say that it's sharp?<eos> I know, Bucket.<eos> We've gone over that 20 times.<eos> Well, it's got a very long tail.<eos> And it can tie itself into a knot.
- Yes, but I don't remember much.<eos> It was so long ago.<eos> Just a few pictures in my mind.<eos> I remember my father's hands.<eos> They were rough, like sandstone, but so gentle.<eos> And I remember the smell of his wooden shield.<eos> I don't think I was supposed to play with it, but he let me anyway.<eos> And this.<eos> He gave me this horn.<eos> I don't know if it means something, but whenever I look at it, I think of him.
Subtitles by DramaFever<eos> Ah... good to see you too.<eos> Hand over the key.<eos> Stop playing around.<eos> - What?<eos> - Hand over the key!<eos> What key?<eos> Why, you...<eos> Where is it?
Every breath is an effort for him.<eos> I don't know whether to make him warm or keep him cool.<eos> Well, we will...<eos> We will remain here until he is well.<eos> Father.<eos> Will the child die?<eos> Can you save him?<eos> There is a way.<eos> Though, it is not a good way.<eos> If it is the only way, then you must.
Kicks like a mule, doesn't it?<eos> Here.<eos> This should help.<eos> Plenty more where that came from.<eos> My friends and I could help with your daylight ring situation, as well.<eos> Ok.<eos> Now you have my attention.<eos> Marcel Gerard, you were turned by an original, yet you made yourself in your own image.<eos> You built a vampire community from ash, and this city thrived under your rule.<eos> Let us help you return New Orleans to what it should be with you as its king.
I got some gear in the back, in case shit hits the fan.<eos> But it won't, because we ain't gonna throw it.<eos> - Then when do we attack?<eos> - When the time is right.<eos> And when will that be?<eos> What was that?<eos> Okay, that's one tall glass with ice, two shots of vodka, Tabasco sauce, and one celery stalk.<eos> You're an angel.<eos> I think you're missing a key ingredient there, mister.<eos> It'll come soon enough.
You will all fall... one by friend, one by foe, and one by family.<eos> Klaus: The lady Aurora, she is exquisite.<eos> I'll be in New Orleans shortly.<eos> Don't start the party without me.<eos> Klaus, voice-over: I never meant for you to know me.<eos> I never meant to let you in...<eos> But then I should not have kissed you...<eos> Not the first time...<eos> Certainly not the second...<eos> But there is a light in you so bright, it makes me feel like the man I wish I was...
The next is the wealthy Kamoda.<eos> Let's go .<eos> 8 7 6 5, 4, 3...<eos> What a pity!<eos> You've broken the record, there<eos> It is shielded<eos> No, nothing.<eos> We will remain good friends.<eos> What can we do, Light?<eos> It goes again... Kamoda. You're gonna give me 300,000 yen tomorrow.
- Holy hell. - Sir!<eos> Hold you fire!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government.<eos> Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace.<eos> We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption.<eos> Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs.<eos> What do we do about the space car?<eos> Leave it alone.<eos> I mean, what did it really do, anyways?
What the hell? Jesus!<eos> There's flies in my ice cream.<eos> Presidential decree--<eos> All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs.<eos> - What the [bleep] did you do, Summer? ! - It was your ship!<eos> - Your stupid ship did it!<eos> - Don't blame my ship!<eos> - It melted a child!<eos> - My ship doesn't do anything...<eos> - It killed it itself!
Look at his art, Morty.<eos> I've got an emo streak.<eos> It's part of what makes me so rad.<eos> Why does it say "help me Morty and Summer!"?<eos> Come on, Summer, that's the title of the art.<eos> Why was knight rider called knight rider?<eos> The car's name was kitt.<eos> Nobody rode Michael knight.<eos> I'm tiny Rick!<eos> Grandpa, I think that, when you put your mind into this body's young brain, it did what young brains do...

Now you're getting into it.<eos> Never expected that out of you.<eos> All right, uh, let's go find my ship.<eos> Hey, hey, Morty, Morty.<eos> There it is down there - - My ship.
I'll relieve you after midnight.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Syphilis.<eos> You had this before?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - When?<eos> Um... some years back.<eos> I passed it on.<eos> Not knowingly.<eos> I thought it had gone.
You have a duty to say what you know.<eos> Let the dead bury the dead.<eos> What if they won't stay buried?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Where you once failed, he now succeeds.<eos> The dead live, Mrs. Shelley.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - You must.<eos> This nightmare is your creation.<eos> It's not mine any more.

I told you, when you're married, not before.<eos> With respect, we discussed it last night.<eos> She wants to come back now.<eos> And I've given you my decision.<eos> I'm thinking of you, Nightingale.<eos> And I'm thinking of her, sir.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Her safety, sir.<eos> I'll need that gun, too, sir, if I may.<eos> It's in my name.
Wow.<eos> - What have you got?<eos> Um, we got the tox screen back.<eos> And you are not gonna believe this.<eos> Are you familiar with the PKM-zeta inhibitor commonly known as ZIP?<eos> Doctor, you and I have very different ideas of what "commonly" means.<eos> Zeta Interacting Protein.<eos> It's an experimental drug being tested with PTSD sufferers.<eos> Wreck victims, soldiers who've seen combat...<eos> Used sparingly, it can erase selected memories.
Because I'm a grinder?<eos> Here's the thing, Jack.<eos> When you took on Harvey, You pitted the grinders against the rainmakers, And that was a good move,<eos> But you want to move to the next level? We need to be both grinders and rainmakers.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that we need to revisit The compensation agreement.<eos> No way.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because when we get this business, It will be worth a fortune to us.
Tell me.<eos> Listen, I'm starving.<eos> Can we find a place to eat and talk about it there?<eos> So...<eos> So...<eos> You know I'm bipolar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that I take lithium.<eos> Which is good for me.<eos> It keeps me... safe and sane.
Wait a minute, we just lost two screens-- what's going on?<eos> - GPS is down.<eos> - Audio, too.<eos> She's about to go inside.<eos> We need that audio.<eos> See if you can get the satellite to reboot the transmitter.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's gone dark.<eos> - Because it's not receiving a signal.
And... oh, my God, you downloaded the Dunkin' Donuts app?<eos> And who Shazams the Beatles?<eos> Whatever.<eos> Have fun with your little robot.<eos> But if you ask me, this whole thing is more disturbing than a dump after a beet salad.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Okay, Lois, I dabbed some toothpaste on the inside of my nose, so...<eos> I am willing to take the old "Nestea plunge," if you know what I mean.<eos> I guess what I'm saying is, time to break in the new mattress, eh?<eos> Peter, it's brand-new.
Ok, now I'm worried.<eos> He said he had some big announcement to make.<eos> Oh, my God, wait, where is it?<eos> Why aren't you wearing it?<eos> Wearing what?<eos> What is that you wanted to tell us?<eos> And why are you telling us here?<eos> Remember this office?<eos> Yes. This was Sebastian blood's campaign office.<eos> And now it's mine.
Do you remember Papp Stadium?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I loved the popcorn.<eos> Every time a Sentinels player hit a homer, every single person in that stadium stood and cheered.<eos> Every single one.<eos> United.<eos> And I wanted to run for mayor because I wanted to be the leader of that city.<eos> Wanted?<eos> Thea, I don't know if that city exists anymore.<eos> I think that it might be beyond saving.
Easiest way to get a lot of followers on social media is to own a very successful club.<eos> All I had to do was tell them what I've already known for 3 years.<eos> Oliver Queen is going to save this city.<eos> What's this? This your speech.<eos> You're announcing your candidacy this afternoon, so you better get your suit out of moth balls.<eos> Did you write this?<eos> I wrote it down. Just with what you told me, about this city being united.<eos> United.<eos> That's what this city used to be.<eos> It's what it can be.

You mean about your stupid column?<eos> - Well, maybe.<eos> - So yesterday's news.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Tell me about Denis.<eos> - The guy who drives the bus?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Well, I saw the bus today.<eos> Not where I thought it would be.
The Speed Force doesn't work like that.<eos> It's not something you can create in a lab.<eos> How do you think you became The Flash, Garrick?<eos> By me and a lab.<eos> Science is what did this to you, to Barry, to Zoom, and science is what we need to stop Zoom, and this is our only option.<eos> Find another one.<eos> The Speed Force can't be replicated or enhanced.<eos> It's a living thing.<eos> It's a gift that was given to me.<eos> That drug... you have no idea what it's gonna do.
Every access point is protected by a retinal scanner, and a voice print.<eos> There is no way we're getting in there.<eos> Well, not from the outside, at least.<eos> How's Curtis doing on the resizing device?<eos> He said he could have something functional in an hour.<eos> I don't think we have that kind of time.<eos> He's going to have to assemble it in the field.<eos> Wait, with us?<eos> Are we sure we want to have your assistant in on this?<eos> It's my employee, actually. And I'm not sure our company health plan covers supernatural dismemberment.
Obsessed.<eos> Phesmatos exaud mi, conjug spiritis et corpe.<eos> Phesmatos exaud mi, conjug spiritis et corpe.<eos> Scratch that one off the list.<eos> Hey! You're not the only one banking on this.<eos> It's not for me, Ric.<eos> Why does everything have to be about me today?<eos> Will both of you just shut up?<eos> The stone works.<eos> I think it's creating a bridge between the body and the spirit.
Ric lied to you.<eos> I just kept my mouth shut.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm not gonna be stuck in the middle of this.<eos> No, no.<eos> You sort this out.<eos> I'm gonna go find our bargaining chip.<eos> So the visions, the lost time, the crippling headaches, they don't mean anything, doesn't matter to you?<eos> Oh, of course, they matter, but bringing Jo back matters more.<eos> You don't even know what this stone does, if it will work.
Oh, God, I hate whiners.<eos> Agh...<eos> Uh!<eos> Oh...<eos> Now...<eos> Deep breath.<eos> Ugh!<eos> Leaving so soon?<eos> Oh!<eos> I'm wearing your jacket, though it's a little large on me.
She wanted to make you pay for refusing to help rescue us from the prison world.<eos> Screw Julian.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> Vis porta.<eos> Spelling the door?<eos> Thought you were leading us to a secret passage.<eos> You watch too much "Scooby-Doo."<eos> Maybe he'll tire himself out and we just go out the front door. Or I could just jump out this window while you fend for yourself.<eos> First, give me that stone back.<eos> First, tell me why it's so special.
Julian needs to die today.<eos> Everything has to appear to be normal.<eos> Julian's not an idiot.<eos> If he finds out that Lily turned on him, we're all dead.<eos> So you embed her with a psychopath.<eos> Sounds logical.<eos> Hey, don't look at me; I voted to drive a stake through her heart and get rid of this<eos> Julian mama drama once and for all.<eos> But, hey, complicated plan "A" sounds like a happy compromise.<eos> It's not complicated.
Let me guess.<eos> Hot cocoa and vervain.<eos> Close.<eos> Bourbon.<eos> I'm sorry I was harsh earlier.<eos> I heard you listened to Valerie and that you sided with Lily against Julian.<eos> I mean, you must be attempting to turn over a new leaf, and you clearly don't have anyone else.<eos> Lovely.<eos> A pity friend, just what I always wanted.<eos> College can be lonely and terrible, or it can be fun.
Tell me, are you the one to bring it out of him, the frail, little human that he has manipulated, abused, and compelled to be everything from stenographer to spy?<eos> He doesn't care about you, darling.<eos> You're just a thing that he uses from time to time.<eos> That's all.<eos> You can say whatever you want...<eos> I can't stop you...<eos> But I do find it interesting how angry you are.<eos> I think you're worried.<eos> If there's anything that Klaus likes about me, it's my mind, that I can understand him, and you, you are beautiful, and you are powerful, and you do have a long history together, but you're worried he doesn't love you, that maybe he does see the truth...<eos> That your mind, it's a bit damaged, isn't it?
No, but it's only a matter of time.<eos> With him, there is always a cost.<eos> The toll always comes due.<eos> Anyway... it's not my decision to make, it's ours.<eos> Well, he's your father.<eos> But as you said, we are a team.<eos> You deserve a chance to meet the man, find out if Morland Holmes is someone you want to be indebted to.<eos> I find the Chinese character suspicious, don't you?<eos> Not their national fiber... the marking on this note.<eos> It means "beautiful."
"There will be no end "to the troubles of humanity until philosophers become kings."<eos> Actually, we're not acolytes, we're detectives.<eos> And I'm with Churchill, I'm afraid.<eos> "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others."<eos> We were wondering where you were three nights ago, around 9:00 p.m.<eos> This is about what happened in Gail's lab.<eos> There's evidence that suggests that you wanted to use her algorithm to push your ideas online.<eos> I was here.<eos> I was hosting a seminar on Thomas Carlyle.<eos> It started at 7:00 and ended at 10:00.
I was hosting a seminar on Thomas Carlyle.<eos> It started at 7:00 and ended at 10:00.<eos> There are over a dozen witnesses who will vouch for me.<eos> You know something, Mr. Antonov.<eos> And why would I help a tool of a bloated and dying empire?<eos> Because you don't wish to be doxxed as a public servant?<eos> I mean, what would your followers think if they realized you suckled at government's teat?<eos> Look, you have the wrong idea.<eos> No one would have killed Gail for that algorithm.<eos> It didn't work.
Nice.<eos> Well. Okay.<eos> - Well written, accurate.<eos> Moving, even, in the right hands.<eos> It is in the right hands.<eos> Maybe reads a little bit like a victory lap.<eos> Well...<eos> I'd say you've earned it.<eos> If I did, we all did.<eos> What's insidious about terrorism is... it can get inside our heads, make us change the way we live our lives.
- Yes.<eos> I killed a Gelumcaedus right where you're standing.<eos> And Chavez died right here.<eos> Ground is still wet.<eos> Wait a minute<eos> Are you saying somebody came back here, took all the bodies and cleaned up all the blood?<eos> Somebody went to a lot of trouble to cover this up.<eos> Just like they did with Juliette.<eos> This is Chavez' phone.<eos> It rang right after she died.
Just, uh, open the safe, Jimmy.<eos> Go ahead, Jimmy.<eos> Take as much as you want.<eos> You know, in a year or two, weed's gonna be just like gum, sitting right there at the grocery store at the checkout line.<eos> Transport, distro... it's all gonna be legal.<eos> Business comes and goes.<eos> Why diversification is important.<eos> That's why we need to talk about that China white you bringing in.<eos> Well, I'm getting out of that business.<eos> It's dirty.
I'm not getting old.<eos> Ubba.<eos> I have seen the land outside the city.<eos> I have a plan in mind.<eos> A good plan.<eos> And my son would like to whet his sword with you.<eos> So do we fight?<eos> Storri?<eos> The signs are good.<eos> Only this morning, I saw a raven fly towards the Saxon camp, and it was asking me to follow.
I should really take your balls for this desecration.<eos> - Yes, lor... no, Lord, please.<eos> - I don't care for you, your wife, your children, nor your whore.<eos> Lord, he made me do it with the promise of a coin.<eos> It was false promise, Lord.<eos> I have no coin.<eos> I'll need a fresh horse, food, and drink.<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> Your horse was returned.<eos> It's in the stable.
Bible study every Sunday.<eos> I know my saints.<eos> Believe you me...<eos> I'm gonna be calling on St. Jude to get me out of this mess.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What's he the saint of?<eos> Desperate cases.<eos> Well, he's definitely your guy.<eos> Tell me... how do you account for the cocaine that was found in the vehicle registered to your name?<eos> I don't... know how it could've got there, man... really.
I have so much to live for because of you.<eos> * You're sweeter than the taste * - * of honey * - Don't breathe.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - Don't talk.<eos> * And I'm so glad * - * that you're mine * - Babe.<eos> The police think you're dead.<eos> We need to use that to our advantage.<eos> - * You're sweeter than the chance * - Why... why don't we get out of town?<eos> I have a plan, and it doesn't include running.<eos> It involves you staying very, very still.
Evacuate the garage.<eos> Turn off the ventilators and seal it.<eos> We're clear.<eos> Yeah, Morgan.<eos> Hotch, there's no one in the Van.<eos> It's a mannequin with a yellow shirt.<eos> Copy that.<eos> We need to evacuate the facility.<eos> There's over a thousand people here.<eos> Once sarin vaporizes, it's deadly in the immediate environment, but it's heavier than air, so eventually it sinks.
That's an interesting combination of meds.<eos> Those are typically used to treat a hormone imbalance.<eos> It sounds to me like dana has polycystic ovary syndrome.<eos> It can cause obesity, excess hair growth, acne, and depression.<eos> PCOS is fairly common in teen girls and young women.<eos> It sadly affects one in 10 women of reproductive age.<eos> The good news is it's treatable.<eos> Ok, but it's PCOS. It didn't turn Dana into a killer.<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> I'm just saying it might have contributed to her becoming depressed.
Help!<eos> Okay, listen!<eos> Listen! I'm gonna get help, all right?<eos> Help is on the way.<eos> ESU, airbag and bus needed at 20 Washington Square.<eos> Okay, when I say reach, reach with one hand.<eos> All right?<eos> All right, reach!<eos> You gotta get rid of the bag.<eos> It's too heavy.
God, it's...<eos> It's not that at all, and I'm sorry.<eos> Whatever you wanna do...<eos> I'll be with you every single step of the way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I still wanna go to Italy, you know, weigh my options, and we can just decide when I get back.<eos> I'll be waiting here when you do.<eos> Leave if you don't want to see me pee.<eos> You're leaving tomorrow and you don't know where your passport is?<eos> I'm pretty sure it's at my mom's house.
No, you go first.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause you look a little dirty.<eos> Yeah, well, you look... wow.<eos> Did Kelly throw up on you?<eos> Sort of.<eos> I'll be quick.<eos> That tunnel must be filthy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you find out where it goes?
It worked!<eos> - You're alive!<eos> - Aye. It did.<eos> After spending centuries quelling my bloodlust, you threw me right back into that darkness!<eos> Job well-done, Emma!<eos> Binding you to Excalibur was the only way to save you.<eos> Right, Excalibur.<eos> And where is my shiny new tether?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It disappeared right after you did.
- Roman!<eos> - Keep going.<eos> I only ran 'cause y'all started running.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why'd you shoot?<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> You're gonna need a dentist.<eos> Hey, give me your hands. I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> Where's the gun?<eos> Huh? Where is it?
You ever just get that feeling?<eos> All the time, but then again, I work with this guy, so...<eos> How well do you know Darren Woodhull?<eos> Ah, keeps to himself.<eos> Freak like that... got no right drawing breath.<eos> Think he knows it.<eos> No secrets here in Rogers Park.<eos> Hey, Jay!<eos> Searched the interior.<eos> It's clean enough.
How's he end up in his freezer?<eos> So...<eos> Ray Malone.<eos> Ray, uh...<eos> Ray was the guy with the worst luck in the world.<eos> He had lymphoma, maybe two months to live.<eos> You know, when we grew up, we were tight... me, Richard, and Ray.<eos> Not quite a crew, but, uh... We weren't exactly saints.<eos> One night... this is maybe, uh, 18 years ago... they were hanging out behind Ray's house<eos> checking out Ray's dad's gun, and it went off.
I need you to be my date at a family event.<eos> Roxie said parents love you because you're completely non-threatening and borderline asexual.<eos> Wow. No, I'm not going with you.<eos> How's that for borderline asexual?<eos> -(sighs) How do you open the wine?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> - (Patti yelps) - Roxie: Oh, I got it.<eos> -Did that just spill on my couch?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Don't worry about the couch. It'll dry up long before we do.
The rash actions of Kindzi has made that abundantly clear.<eos> Where exactly is Kindzi?<eos> I do not wish to discuss it.<eos> Tell me this at least...<eos> Am I in any danger?<eos> Kindzi is in no position to hurt you or anyone else.<eos> Irisa? Where's Nolan?<eos> He didn't come home last night. We have a situation.<eos> There is a large island. It is called Australia.<eos> It is remote and uninhabited.
Oh, man.<eos> We've got to go help.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You're awake.<eos> What happened?<eos> Emotions, feelings happened.<eos> And then you slipped and hit your head.<eos> Not your finest hour.<eos> Want to see my finest hour?<eos> It's around here somewhere.
So Crane found old paper, but the ink is fake.<eos> No, the ink is iron gall from iron salts and tannic acids.<eos> Which was the standard in Europe from the fifth to the 19th century.<eos> But the signature is fake?<eos> I compared it pixel by pixel to Washington's signature on the Constitution.<eos> The slant and spacing show that it's a perfect match.<eos> Looks like I owe Mr. Crane an apology.<eos> Not yet. I also examined the handwriting of the officer that Washington was dictating to.<eos> And?<eos> It's an exact match to the notes that Ichabod Crane took when he was deciphering The Book of Shadows, here in the lab.
As it turns out, Howe's skull is the murder weapon.<eos> We found it in the waste from the anatomy lab.<eos> Based on the fractured occipital, it appears the killer held the skull like so.<eos> Our best bet would have been to find trace evidence in General Howe's canine.<eos> However, it was knocked out during the murder and we can't find it.<eos> Because it came loose. He was thrown by a wild stallion he was trying to tame after he took control of the British forces.<eos> Wouldn't a man of his stature have used false teeth?<eos> Iron, or ivory, or animal teeth?<eos> Oh, he tried those. Then he learned the French had developed porcelain teeth.<eos> If Howe's canine was porcelain, it would have shattered on impact, possibly injuring the killer's hand.
Oh, he tried those. Then he learned the French had developed porcelain teeth.<eos> If Howe's canine was porcelain, it would have shattered on impact, possibly injuring the killer's hand.<eos> Mr. Crane brought to my attention that we made a faulty assumption.<eos> We didn't account for the magical powers of the skull?<eos> No, we didn't account for the fact that the missing tooth isn't a tooth.<eos> So, he had a false tooth?<eos> Yes.<eos> Made of porcelain. If the tooth scraped the killer's hand...<eos> There's a significant possibility of recovering epithelial cells.<eos> But if Howe had a porcelain tooth, where is it now?
Made of porcelain. If the tooth scraped the killer's hand...<eos> There's a significant possibility of recovering epithelial cells.<eos> But if Howe had a porcelain tooth, where is it now?<eos> Porcelain.<eos> The coffee cup. I-I have all of these pieces of a broken coffee cup.<eos> The porcelain could have easily gotten mixed in there.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, go over that piece again here.<eos> Its hue doesn't match the others. SAROYAN:<eos> You're right. And it's got a pointed cusp and single root like a canine.<eos> Bet it was nice and shiny, back in the day.
38-year-old male.<eos> Unconscious, labored breathing...<eos> He's uremic.<eos> Kidney failure.<eos> I know this guy.<eos> Let's get him set up for an I-stat.<eos> - We need his electrolyte levels.<eos> - Yes, doctor.<eos> What are we most concerned about in renal failure?<eos> Potassium... if it's too high, it could be toxic for his heart or put him into arrest.
Should be doing better than that.<eos> Maybe it's inaccurate.<eos> She came in with hyperthermia.<eos> Oral thermometer showed her at 108 degrees.<eos> I tried to get a line in to infuse fluids, but she keeps bleeding out at the site.<eos> 10 units of FFP, a 6-pack of platelets, and 10 units of cryoprecipitate.<eos> What's the one organ that cannot survive heat?<eos> Blood.<eos> And what happens to blood protein when it's heated for extended periods?<eos> - It denatures... melts, basically.
You wanna let go of my arm now?<eos> !<eos> That's a bad play, Tash.<eos> One more day, I'll have your money.<eos> You better, 'cause the next time, the conversation ends different.<eos> A breakthrough?<eos> It was a dream.<eos> Your first dream, which you considered significant enough to mention to me.<eos> A sex dream.<eos> So what does it mean?
Figure out that steganography yet?<eos> What?<eos> The black square on your shoulder.<eos> Steganography?<eos> Steganography, of course.<eos> Can you fill the rest of us in?<eos> It's a... a method of concealing messages in innocuous images.<eos> It's used by spy services, terrorists... it dates back to the Ancient Greeks.<eos> So the black isn't just covering the Navy SEAL tattoo underneath.<eos> Oh, well, that's the thing, it's not all black.
I can't!<eos> Do it!<eos> Hey!<eos> You want her?<eos> Come get her!<eos> Shoot the power line.<eos> Anytime, Hank.<eos> I think it worked.<eos> Is it dead?<eos> It's not moving.
Yeah, I filled out his business school applications.<eos> Yep, essays too.<eos> - Wow, awesome joke, Eli.<eos> - He's smart, Mom, he is.<eos> He's just... you know, he's Teddy.<eos> Okay?<eos> And I don't think that we should be getting engaged right now...<eos> Then it happened.<eos> The scales fell from my eyes.<eos> Your brain is a miracle, but it's not efficient.
Seems like voodoo to me.<eos> Well... what's happening?<eos> What is it, Dixie?<eos> The... the cards, they're-they're blurry.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Okay, I-I'm stopping the infusion.<eos> It's getting worse.<eos> - I'll page radiology.<eos> - Is it the polio?<eos> Is it inside her?
So much for getting in front of it.<eos> JACKSON: We've contacted every outlet that got the query.<eos> If they make the purchase, they'll feel the full force of the Executive Branch.<eos> But isn't Harrison enough of a public figure that they can claim fair use?<eos> Not if I have anything to do with it.<eos> Half an hour ago, I thought Maria Ostrov was the only thing that could hijack the news cycle and run down our poll numbers.<eos> You thinking this is another hack, like Air Force One?<eos> This wasn't a hack.<eos> The president's son lost his phone last week, didn't bother to tell anybody.<eos> Didn't it have a-a password or...?
Has he ever bought us a juice?<eos> No, and we bought him a car.<eos> Schiller, dude, give me a life boost.<eos> Schiller, I'll have the life boost as well.<eos> Schiller.<eos> Am I saying that right?<eos> Schiller.<eos> Will you be in class tomorrow?<eos> I'd love to see your flying lotus.<eos> My lotus only has a one-day pass, and it doesn't fly, it takes the bus.
- Hey, hey!<eos> - I wouldn't do that, Kate.<eos> - Scott...<eos> Holy shit, you shot me!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Open up, rinchesito!<eos> It's too late, Carlos.<eos> Your boss already took the key.<eos> It is useless without the map.
Fair to whom?<eos> To... whomever comes next.<eos> This is getting cold. Carter's lunch.<eos> Uh, I will check on those credentials for the train launch.<eos> Agents are positioned around the perimeter.<eos> I have commandeered the security cameras at the station, but there's no sign of Knox.<eos> Sounds like you could use some help.<eos> Are you sure you're up for this?<eos> Somebody's gotta protect that train.<eos> And once it gets moving, even the DEO won't be able to keep up with it.
Kara, you can say no to this.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to show her...<eos> Him, that I can be a team player.<eos> That my cousin and I can be trusted.<eos> Wait, does the robot fight mean that game night is canceled?<eos> No! No!<eos> Game night is the last shred of normalcy that remains in our crime stopping, alien hunting, DEO hacking lives.<eos> Game night survives.<eos> It has to.
How else could they be brother and sister, right?<eos> I mean, how else could you guys be a family?<eos> This all goes back to Posta.<eos> Sí.<eos> I was there.<eos> I saw the killings.<eos> I saw what Silva did to my friends.<eos> But he-he thought I was beautiful, so... he spared my life and... my daughter's life.<eos> That's why the test didn't find a match.<eos> It only compared the DNA to the victims.
Let me rule on the objections.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Mrs. Banner, the doctors here at the defense table said that your daughter was terminal. They were wrong.<eos> A week before they prescribed those suicide drugs,<eos> Duke University announced a new treatment for glioblastoma tumors.<eos> Let me help you with those, Mr. Canning.<eos> And what was that treatment?<eos> The polio virus.<eos> It's introduced into the tumorous brain cells so it won't reproduce in the healthy ones.<eos> It destroys the tumor.
But why that would be of interest to the police, uh...<eos> Must be frustrating when politicians pander to their base by making it difficult to obtain suitable cells.<eos> Enough to purchase excess embryos from Abby.<eos> I have papers to grade.<eos> It is, of course, illegal to obtain embryos without the consent of the potential parent that provided that genetic material.<eos> We can get a warrant.<eos> If the DNA of the cells from your lab match the patients from Abby's clinic, then that's a federal crime.<eos> I'm trying to save lives.<eos> Diabetes is a plague.<eos> It kills over four million people a year.
I had some makeup on before that was surprisingly difficult to wash off.<eos> Been there.<eos> So, you know I'm referring to your beard as Princess Sparkles from now on though, right?<eos> Why would you be referring to my beard?<eos> "You've got some crumbs stuck in Princess Sparkles."<eos> Or, "Princess Sparkles could use a trim."<eos> So, how's work going on the cure?<eos> I can't make any progress without tainted Utopium.<eos> I've run tests on regular Utopium, but, to be honest, I know very little about how the drug works.<eos> I mean, it's relatively new, there aren't studies.
Zac needed me to get his idea out of his head and into virtually every computer processor on the planet.<eos> You hadn't had a big idea in over a decade.<eos> You used him.<eos> Used him?<eos> I helped him.<eos> Zac was lost without me.<eos> He would hyper-focus on one thing and ignore everyone and everything else.<eos> He was constantly losing his keys, his wallet, phone.<eos> You know where his phone is?<eos> No, but it doesn't surprise me that it's missing.
W-wait.<eos> That means I paid for it.<eos> To closing the case.<eos> To generous expense accounts.<eos> So, any progress with Beckett?<eos> You know, at the prison, we, um, sort of had a moment.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think my plan is working.<eos> I mean, it has to, right?
He's still alive?<eos> Not for long.<eos> He's perfect then.<eos> Doctor.<eos> You have your volunteer.<eos> All ready, my queen.<eos> My friends.<eos> We stand on the precipice of a major scientific discovery.<eos> Remember this day.<eos> For it will mark the beginning of a New World Order.
He kidnapped my wife, my baby girl.<eos> It's him.<eos> I'm gonna do you a favor.<eos> Shot them right there in front of me.<eos> Warren.<eos> My savior.<eos> The zombie plague is over.<eos> I have the cure.<eos> Remember this day.<eos> For it will mark the beginning of a Zero World Order.
He wants to carry the torch and continue his work.<eos> "Carry the torch"?<eos> - Richards' words, not mine.<eos> - Yeah, but there's nothing in here about some direct plan to bust Duclair out of jail, is there?<eos> Right, but hold on a second-- we don't have Duclair's letters to Richards going out of Halawa, right?<eos> We only have one side of the conversation.<eos> Right.<eos> So I'm guessing that Duclair was calling the shots on his own escape. I'm with him.<eos> Let's get a warrant for Richards' place, see if we can find those letters.<eos> It's just an office, Danny, it's an office.
What are you talking about?<eos> Take a look.<eos> See?<eos> Different frames.<eos> When the painting was originally stolen, the frame was brass.<eos> This is wood.<eos> Okay, so the pirates changed it.<eos> But why would they go through the trouble?<eos> I think the key to finding this treasure isn't the painting.<eos> It's the frame. Uh-huh.
Morwenna!<eos> Come in here!<eos> Your heartbeat is very irregular.<eos> Last month, the specialist gave my heart an electric shock to fix it.<eos> Well, it didn't.<eos> You had better go back again.<eos> Put some gloves on.<eos> Take your hands out of the way, please.<eos> Morwenna, hold that.<eos> Ah. Is it broken?
_<eos> You really made us work for our paychecks today.<eos> Solomon, you don't have to be afraid any more.<eos> We're NSA.<eos> We are the good guys.<eos> You have heard of prism, haven't you?<eos> We need your help, Solomon.<eos> Our engineers realized you were trying to debug a program, not infect it.<eos> Did you find the virus?<eos> W-Was it still in the directory?
Put your hands up and leave 'em up.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Leave 'em up!<eos> Don't!<eos> Clear!<eos> Detonator secured.<eos> Ammonium Nitrate, Diesel fuel wrapped in Tovex.<eos> Big boom, but it's easy to disarm.<eos> There's a timer.<eos> It's a failsafe.
But in the interest of precision...<eos> I'm an engineer, after all... there's one thing you're wrong about.<eos> Taurus didn't kill Stephen Fisher?<eos> We don't think so.<eos> He took the job.<eos> He planted the chip and the detonator and then he hid a Bluetooth transmitter under a newspaper kiosk on Fulton.<eos> And this somehow adds up to him not doing it?<eos> Fisher's accident happened a mile before he would have driven past the Bluetooth.<eos> - The chip was never triggered.<eos> - So it went off by mistake.
That's you.<eos> See the birthmark?<eos> That virus your lab made, it's a massive breakthrough.<eos> And there's no way you destroyed your research, which means... the proof that you did this is somewhere in the building.<eos> This meeting is an opportunity for you to give us those files.<eos> If you don't, we can take that picture to a judge and get a warrant, but then you've lost your only chance to cooperate.<eos> You'll be facing three charges of murder.<eos> If you can get a judge to believe that's me, you have evidence of what?<eos> The fact that I used an aerosol can?<eos> The virus, if it exists, leaves no trace of itself behind.
Ever since I killed Weston Steward, and Chavez found Nick's Grimm book on my bed.<eos> They've been watching you too. Me?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you're a hexenbiest.<eos> Was.<eos> Yeah, they know about that too, and about your baby.<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> No, they don't want your kid.<eos> Tell me about that motorcycle.<eos> It's mine.
Yeah, they know about that too, and about your baby.<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> No, they don't want your kid.<eos> Tell me about that motorcycle.<eos> It's mine.<eos> You want to show me?<eos> Sure.<eos> So, they gave it to me, like, six months after I started.<eos> It's not normal.<eos> It does all kinds of things.
There's one here and one in the upper abdominal region.<eos> I also found several small nicks to the cortical bone on the left tenth and 11th ribs.<eos> Knife wounds to the chest could mean the victim was stabbed to death.<eos> The predation seems particularly aggressive in the regions closest to the stab wound.<eos> It's possible the blood from the wound drew the fish to those areas first.<eos> I'll take a Mikrosil mold of the nicks to see if I can identify the weapon that caused it.<eos> You may not need to.<eos> The tip of the knife.<eos> It's lodged in the victim's tenth rib.<eos> Yeah, it probably broke off during the stabbing.
No.<eos> You would have been hyper-focused on looking for him, so any movement would have caught your eye.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Just a car.<eos> What kind of car?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's just a car.<eos> Play it over in your mind slowly.<eos> Is there anything about the car that stood out?<eos> It was gray.
Which may have led to a murder.<eos> When's the last time you saw Lindsay?<eos> Uh... Couple weeks ago, we did an interview for the documentary's DVD extras.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You've done what?<eos> Two movies since your documentary with Lindsay?<eos> Three if you count my short.<eos> You've still got her pictures up?<eos> The film was my baby.<eos> It holds a very special place in my heart.
Did you ever talk to the neighbors about their band practice?<eos> _<eos> I wanted to throw a rock through the window.<eos> _<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ooh, okay.<eos> She's back.<eos> You're on a deserted island with nothing but a blanket, a packed lunch and a gazebo.<eos> There's only one guy there.<eos> Who is it?
Finish processing the car.<eos> Hello, people that work even lower underground than I do.<eos> Hello, Abby.<eos> Yeah, to what do we owe the pleasure?<eos> I found an odd compound in Captain Doblin's blood and I was wondering if maybe he had some kind of medical issue that could explain it.<eos> No, the captain was in perfect physical health.<eos> Though, I-I read his file, and he could be suffering from one or more personality disorders.<eos> JIMMY:<eos> This is not an organic compound.<eos> It looks manufactured.
That kid is you.<eos> You've got your whole life to roll your eyes.<eos> Today isn't just about building a duck village.<eos> It's about building your smile.<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> There it is.<eos> As you can see, our little duck harbor has a working lighthouse.<eos> Wait a second -- what in the world did he just say?<eos> A working lighthouse?<eos> Yes, it is working.
- Are you sure? - Uh...<eos> What -- what do I do?<eos> Okay, uh, stay calm.<eos> I-I'll talk you through the labor.<eos> They're coming, Lily!<eos> Okay, Claire -- Tell me what you see!<eos> Oh, god.<eos> I think I see a beak.<eos> Well, the good news is we're not breach.<eos> It looks like it's struggling to break through.
He doesn't want to fight.<eos> What should we do about that, gentlemen?<eos> Don't make me do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The plane's not going to Halifax?<eos> Apparently not.<eos> But we're going to Halifax.<eos> NSA intel indicated that's where the plane was heading.<eos> Uh... it's not.<eos> It's landing near Pittsburgh.
I... I have the right to sell it.<eos> Yeah, but then we'd have to add felony, fraud and misrepresentation to your list of charges.<eos> Or you could face an early grave, depending on who the buyer is.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> That's not the Bullitt Mustang.<eos> It's just a green '68.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you can check the VIN number.<eos> It's over there on the... passenger side dashboard.
Probably.<eos> I can't believe there's been a giant UFO under the town this whole time.<eos> I wish my mind could be where yours is right now, Dipper.<eos> When confirmation of extraterrestrials still had that punch.<eos> Now it's just sort of, meh.<eos> McGucket and I used to come down here all the time to raid their tech ad study their language.<eos> This is so cool!<eos> The substance we need so seal the rift is an alien adhesive, strong enough to keep the hull of a spacecraft together.<eos> Just one dollop of this adhesive should be enough to seal a crack in space-time.<eos> Also, if it touches you, it will seal up all the orifices in your face, so try so avoid that.
So when we found Keisha, you hadn't seen her for months, but Jeanette and Matt told you to report that you had.<eos> This is where I say that my client has information that could prove very helpful in bolstering your case.<eos> Depending on what we hear, we could downgrade from manslaughter to criminally negligent homicide.<eos> Which is still a felony.<eos> We'll stop here then.<eos> Not another word, Keith.<eos> No, look, wait.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I mean, they have to know.<eos> Jeanette... so she calls me that Saturday, and she orders me to come into the office, and it's closed, but...
We also found det chords and fuses.<eos> Directional explosives.<eos> A crew blasted into a stash house two years ago.<eos> They drilled in, mounted it, and then blasted clean through 16 inches of concrete.<eos> They're not blowing something up.<eos> They're blasting in.<eos> "Would any of these buildings be targets for C4 explosives?"<eos> These are all plain concrete foundations.<eos> No reinforcements.<eos> A blast wouldn't break into the building, it would bring it down.

But Dmitri's now been MIA for more than eight hours.<eos> It's possible there's an innocent explanation.<eos> Well, I admire your optimism, Professor.<eos> Look, Dmitri will lay low until he sees an opening.<eos> That's how he was trained.<eos> I'm sure he'll recover the phone soon.<eos> Problem is, he can't.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> - We had the phone removed.<eos> We couldn't risk it falling into the wrong hands.
I tried to keep you alive.<eos> Give me the pill. You speak English?<eos> Everyone speak some English.<eos> Give me the pill.<eos> I can't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This pill, it gives you answers, da?<eos> Fix problems?<eos> Yeah, it can, but...<eos> This weight, all the time it is on me.
Our apologies, Your Honor.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> And this new chemical compound that my client created... it contains no illegal attributes?<eos> Tert-Butyl 4-hydroxybutanoate is electrically neutral, while GHB is an ionic compound.<eos> So, would that be like the difference between Coke and Pepsi?<eos> No, it's more like the difference between a butyrate-Co-A ligase and a glycine N-acyltransferase.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Dr. Marcotte, the Federal Analogue Act does not require that a drug be listed as a controlled substance for it to be illegal... is that correct?<eos> That's my understanding.<eos> If it is substantially similar to a controlled substance, it is treated as though it were - a controlled substance?
Separate trials, separate juries.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Great meeting.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Screw you.<eos> The state calls Scott Pierre-Paul.<eos> Mr. Pierre-Paul, do you have reason to believe Roland Hlavin knew he was making a designer drug?<eos> Yeah, he knew.<eos> He marketed it as an alternative to GHB.<eos> Said it was safer, no adverse side effects.
Hi!<eos> Okay, Tandy, we're gonna have to add<eos> "no talking-slash-total silence" to your punishment.<eos> I'm just trying to spread good cheer.<eos> You know, show everybody how much I care about them.<eos> I'm not bothering you guys, am I?<eos> It has come to my attention that there has been some unhappiness with the volume and frequency of my heartfelt compliments.<eos> Carol?<eos> I had Carol go out to the pet store and get this new collar for me.<eos> It is voice activated, so whenever I speak, a burst of citronella will be shot out into my face, thus assaulting my senses and delivering the silence you requested
That it was an accident.<eos> But I wasn't there, so I didn't know what to believe.<eos> And I wanted to go to the cops and explain what happened, but Stan said that we'd all go to jail.<eos> And I couldn't do that to Max.<eos> He already lost his father and his uncle.<eos> And he...<eos> He couldn't lose me, too.<eos> So I...didn't say anything.<eos> Fear cripples you.<eos> It makes you do nothing.
I mean, Lucifer would know how God ended the Darkness.<eos> He was there.<eos> So God assured you of this, did he?<eos> Let's say you're making this up.<eos> I mean, I never think of you as imaginative.<eos> We're not saying it's gonna happen.<eos> We just wanna know... Theoretically, ...if it's possible.<eos> The cage is a can of worms you do not want to open.<eos> I believe this conversation is over.<eos> Is it?
He holds on to girls until they're worn out, then trades them to networks across the country.<eos> Trevor says Ulrich is operating a brothel out of a club in Bridgeport.<eos> Hank.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I got a state's attorney downstairs who says he needs to talk to you right now.<eos> I got this.<eos> We'll gear up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sergeant, I know you've had a busy day.<eos> Well, it's not over.
Yeah, maybe a couple.<eos> You wanted to see me, sir?<eos> You did good in there today.<eos> He wasn't a killer, sir, just desperate.<eos> I stared down the barrel of that gun when he first took you hostage.<eos> Sir?<eos> Which is odd, because when you turned it in to evidence, it was unloaded, no bullets in the magazine, which reduces his charge to reckless endangerment.<eos> You never saw Frazier load or unload that weapon.<eos> No, Sergeant.<eos> It must have been empty the whole time.
- Yummy.<eos> - I'm just trying to...<eos> You coming over?<eos> Oh, the cat.<eos> - I'll call you.<eos> - The cat?<eos> Don't call.<eos> Just come over.<eos> Jay, yo, I got a ping on Ethan's phone.<eos> It was moving, but now it has stopped.
The body has approximately eleven organ systems all doing different things at the same time.<eos> In order to keep us functioning or, well, alive, they need one voice, a leader, a master, and, in our brains, that job belongs to the pituitary gland.<eos> It senses the body's needs before they even arise, working non-stop.
Jade.<eos> Jade, can you hear me?<eos> Now can I get out of here?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, you will soon enough.<eos> Ah, yeah.<eos> Oh, Grey...<eos> just the person I needed to see.<eos> A hot appy came in tonight.<eos> Now, it hasn't ruptured, but you need to do...
[Scoffs] I certainly wouldn't voice them publicly.<eos> But if you did voice them publicly, that might slow things down, give us time to verify the Intel.<eos> You want me to put my foot in my mouth?<eos> Yes, Susan.<eos> Oh, why didn't you say so?<eos> [Crowd shouting] Eyes forward, ignore questions.<eos> - Straight to the building.<eos> - Uh-huh. Woman: Madam Vice President, are you pleased with the terms of the nuclear treaty?<eos> I've read it thoroughly.<eos> I think it's a good and fair treaty.
He knew who you were, Ms. Lambert.<eos> He chose you.<eos> Wait.<eos> So, is it...?<eos> Is it my fault that Don's dead?<eos> How's Vivian holding up?<eos> Since she blames herself for her husband's death?<eos> Not so good.<eos> Her phone get us anywhere? Ow!<eos> We're pinging the number that she was in contact with, hoping it will lead us to this... Frank.
A face on top of another face could easily mean he's undercover or he's two-faced.<eos> Which is bad news for the two missing agents.<eos> They were both undercover.<eos> Yeah, John Portman vanished a week ago.<eos> And then Sarah Miles disappeared yesterday.<eos> All of these agents were investigating the Libertad drug cartel.<eos> Well, if someone knew that they were undercover, then there has to be a mole on the inside.<eos> Well, we have to consider all possibilities.<eos> This cartel is in fact unique in a few ways.<eos> Yeah, it appeared on the Darknet after the Silk Road was shut down.
We've I.D.'d some of the lower level members, but who we really need to get to is Ben Franklin.<eos> This individual is the nexus between the ground operation and the Internet.<eos> We think Bowers made contact with that person, but he was killed before we could follow up.<eos> Have you checked in with their families?<eos> Any of them made contact?<eos> Funny you should ask.<eos> Sarah Miles' husband says there was a hang-up call from a number he didn't recognize 3 days ago.<eos> It was the anniversary of his and Sarah's first date.<eos> Did you trace the call?<eos> It came from a bar just outside of town.
Last bus of the day.<eos> Good place for a serial killer to pick up any stragglers.<eos> This must be a stop for migrant workers.<eos> Probably get dropped off here and then shuttled to farms throughout the valley.<eos> It's not harvest season right now.<eos> The store's closed.<eos> Hey, mama, listen, I need you to find the owner of the Diablo General Store in Esperanza Valley.<eos> Okey dokey.<eos> Uh, looks like that store has been owned by the Dufour family for 60 years, currently managed by Jacob Dufour.<eos> It's closed in the winter months.
I have diplomatic immunity.<eos> You may expel me or let me go, but you may not under any circumstance bore me.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He's private security.<eos> So why were you on Crandall's jet?<eos> He abducted a German biophysicist. I was tasked with finding him.<eos> You were on that jet to find Elizabeth Keen, just like you were at Wing Yee this morning.<eos> Oh, no. I was at Wing Yee for their wonton soup.<eos> It is fantastic.
They're calling him Hasaan.<eos> I'm sorry, Samar.<eos> I'm getting to the truth a little too late.<eos> The Lazarum hostages have all been executed.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> If my brother is Hasaan, why would he risk an attack like this?<eos> For the list...<eos> The list of Mossad agents and their informants working around the world to find and execute Hasaan.<eos> That list is I.S.O.O. secure.<eos> It's not available electronically.
It's just...<eos> that's the least scary pasta.<eos> It's in the name.<eos> And now, while I stitch Lady Bobbenstein back up, get ready for the next part of our haunted tour.<eos> I smell a costume change!<eos> You guys, I think I know what this haunted house needs.<eos> Grapes?<eos> Should I call my guy?<eos> No, Gene.<eos> It needs scares.
Good idea.<eos> (dial tone hums) Oh, thank God.<eos> It works.<eos> Wow, this phonebook is, like, from the '90s.<eos> Let's see if Tony Toni Tow-me is still in business.<eos> Hey, Mom, question, why does this house have mothball smell?<eos> Follow-up question, whose house is this?<eos> David Lee Mothball? Maybe the owner of a mothball team?<eos> It's an empty house that Mort said we could use.<eos> It belonged to one of his clients.
I've just seen Angela walking into the cathedral with Rowenna and Jane."<eos> I don't know what they - "Jane!"<eos> "Hello?"<eos> They've taken...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What is it?<eos> James, her boyfriend, is Boy Bishop.<eos> On St Nicholas Day, the Bishop of Hereford hands over power to the Boy Bishop enthroned in his place.<eos> So technically, on this day every year, the cathedral is without its spiritual head.<eos> Today it will be more vulnerable than ever.
- Yes, but...<eos> - Will you teach me how to do it later?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When you're a player...<eos> - What?<eos> - You'll see when we play football.<eos> - Are you going to teach me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Football has always been my passion.<eos> It was always what I enjoyed doing the most.
Apparently, some of their seed blew onto his farm.<eos> They claimed he illegally infringed on their patent and they sued him.<eos> The defense cost matchett a fortune.<eos> He must have lost everything.<eos> Aram, did you get those files? You've stumbled on a state-of-the-art virology shop.<eos> Matchett didn't steal verdiant's genome blueprint so he could release it publicly.<eos> He needed it to identify its weaknesses and design a virus tailor-made to destroy it.<eos> He wants to sabotage their gmo crop? 90% of all corn grown in America is genetically modified. Verdiant is the largest producer of it.<eos> In fact, this one strain is planted all over the world.<eos> If this virus gets out, it will spread fast.
Did you sleep at all?<eos> Don't sleep.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since my sister died.<eos> These photos are bringing everything back up.<eos> I keep thinking of the call I got from my mother, telling me that Emily had been killed.<eos> Before the call, I was this-this Agent Afloat, starting this new career.<eos> Life couldn't have been better.<eos> After the call, I live in this world where... I'll never see my sister again.<eos> If that call had to come, if it could have come a minute later, five minutes later even...
Yeah, let's go!<eos> All right, follow me!<eos> This way, everyone!<eos> Another local business is closing its doors tonight after being taken down by Yelp reviewers.<eos> Whistlin' Willy's, a child favorite in town, was destroyed and its owner stripped and beheaded.<eos> The following video is graphic.<eos> No, please! No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Aww!<eos> We all loved Whistlin' Willy's.<eos> It didn't do well with Yelpers.
She's gonna be upset, ashamed.<eos> Now, I'll do my best to protect her.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> I can't go.<eos> - You heard Annalise.<eos> - I can't sell out my sister without at least giving her a chance to explain.<eos> Catherine sold you out the minute she didn't tell you she knew Philip.<eos> - Maybe she doesn't know him.<eos> - What about the gun?<eos> She probably didn't know it was there.
I said you could do it, and you did it.<eos> I'm free!<eos> And I have another chance with Sharon.<eos> No way their relationship survives this.<eos> Sharon hates you, Dale.<eos> You're a stalker, you're pathetic, and you're fired.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> For helping you win the case.<eos> You want the trophy, it's in a box in the basement.
We use it.<eos> I'm advising Caleb to take the plea deal.<eos> But why?<eos> Because he confessed to me at the house.<eos> So?<eos> Sinclair's got no case.<eos> Plus, we've been handing her her ass this whole time.<eos> That's not true anymore.<eos> Caleb showed me where he was hiding the gun.<eos> It's in a toolbox in the basement.
Soon as your alibi checks out, yeah.<eos> Of course, that could take a while.<eos> I were you, I'd get cozy.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, you can't keep me in here.<eos> That's illegal.<eos> Come on, Frankie.<eos> You never let the law get in your way.<eos> Why start now?<eos> Hey.<eos> I've reassembled the skull, and it is ready for its close-up.
I don't see it.<eos> Each of these shapes is completely distinct.<eos> Angela, position the rocky surface on top, rotating it 180 degrees.<eos> Now position the flat edge several inches below that, horizontally, with the sharp force trauma outline to the left of that.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Why does that look familiar?<eos> Because you live in it.<eos> That is the great Commonwealth of Virginia.<eos> Oh. Well, how can a state be a murder weapon?<eos> Well, unless the state of Virginia is composed of coal, it's not.

You were just a child.<eos> You didn't know any better.<eos> But the old man was right.<eos> I knew unless I did something, I'd end up like that.<eos> Everybody would.<eos> People get old.<eos> It's natural.<eos> No.<eos> The answer is right here, practically under our feet.<eos> It has been for centuries.
But... you really are just a politician now, huh?<eos> Go.<eos> (elevator bell dings)<eos> How is this possible?<eos> These are the preliminary results from the blood and tissue samples found underneath our victim's fingernails.<eos> Yeah, he fought back.<eos> He was getting his eyes clawed out.<eos> Yeah, that's the problem.<eos> There's only a single source of DNA.<eos> And it belongs to our victim.
the unfortunate deceased Byron Sutton, Mr. Gregory Cummings,<eos> Susan Trent and this is her brother, Matthew Trent.<eos> May we leave, please?<eos> My sister is unwell.<eos> Mr. Trent, what can you tell me about this evening's events?<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> Nothing of importance.<eos> Everyone smoked opium, Byron thought it was just marvelous.<eos> Did he say anything?<eos> He mentioned something about it being strong, that he could feel it all over his body or some such nonsense.
Well, I may not know all the English names correct, but it includes ma huang; you call it sea grape, aconite, peppermint and ginseng.<eos> Aconite.<eos> As in, wolfsbane?<eos> That's a very dangerous and very toxic plant.<eos> Yes!<eos> The plant, yes, very dangerous.<eos> Not my preparation of it.<eos> I am trained.<eos> I make the powder myself with great care.<eos> It is safe in small quantities.
I feel the most delicious tingling in my body, like all of my senses are on fire.<eos> I understand now how opium awakens an appetite...<eos> I'm not hungry in the slightest.<eos> ... of a more carnal nature...<eos> Julia.<eos> We are not alone.<eos> I see no one.<eos> No one but you.<eos> William... look at this dragon.<eos> It's as though it could breathe fire at any moment.
You're seeing the red of the dragon's mouth and interpreting it as fire.<eos> William,<eos> I'm aware that I am looking at a tapestry and not an actual dragon.<eos> You might find this experience more beneficial if you ceased to analyze it and just embrace it.<eos> Did you know, Julia, that in Ancient China, only Emperors were allowed to depict five clawed dragons?<eos> Anyone found in possession of such things was put to death.<eos> Then I suppose Byron Sutton was willing to invoke the wrath of the ancients.<eos> - How so?<eos> - His pipe has an engraving of a dragon with five claws on it.<eos> Remarkably, it's just like this one.
It was Lawrence.<eos> He was supposed to smoke that damn pipe.<eos> Dr. Sutton, you are under arrest for the murder of Byron Sutton.<eos> It was Lawrence!<eos> It was his fault, it's not mine.<eos> Not mine.<eos> Despite the darker side of opium, I enjoyed our little experiment. Yes.<eos> Not one that I would care to repeat.<eos> No?<eos> Not even the sensation it invoked?
I've never been in a fight.<eos> I have.<eos> Yes, it was a dance fight.<eos> I won.<eos> No one wins in a dance fight.<eos> Well, if we're going out there, I got a little something in my medical kit that'll stack the odds in our favor.<eos> Heroin?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> No, it's vitamin B12 shots.<eos> It'll give us a nice natural boost, like sending back a sandwich or sleeping without pants on.
Oh, we will. If there's anything left of him.<eos> Sir, rebel reinforcements have arrived.<eos> One shuttle and one ship of unknown design.<eos> I would hardly call that reinforcements.<eos> You boys better give me some room.<eos> You heard the captain.<eos> Sabine, we'll get one shot at this.<eos> Then it's a good thing you trust me.<eos> Sir, the unidentified ship is taking the lead.<eos> It's moving into attack position off our starboard side.
The only way for them to stay... is to trade places with living souls.<eos> Meaning us?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And when the moon reaches its peak, the ferry from the underworld will arrive... and drag us down there.<eos> That doesn't sound good.<eos> Speaking as one who's died and been there, it's not.<eos> So, how do we stop it?<eos> We can't.<eos> The underworld is worse than you can possibly imagine.<eos> It's gonna make you wish the old stories of fire and brimstone were true.

Excalibur would be of any use would be if... if Emma takes all the darkness into herself... and uses the sword to destroy it. And herself.<eos> Excalibur was always destined... for the hands of a true hero.<eos> That's it?<eos> You don't want to make a deal or something?<eos> No.<eos> You're a brave woman, Emma Swan... but it might not work.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, that blade... it chooses who it finds worthy.<eos> And it chooses its miracles.
For the first time, you were truly selfless.<eos> You know, I don't need to see the world to know what I want anymore.<eos> What I want is to be with you.<eos> Now, you see. This isn't the library or Granny's or some bus station, Miss Swan.<eos> This is my shop.<eos> Unless the sign says "open"... you're not invited.<eos> I think I was invited.<eos> I hear whispering.<eos> It's the dagger.<eos> It's calling to me.
Couples put up locks. As a symbol of their everlasting love.<eos> We should go find that scrapbook.<eos> Can I have my hand back now?<eos> Die with the con, liv.<eos> No, it's voss.<eos> V-o-s-s.<eos> He's a beat cop at the 12th.<eos> All morning?<eos> You're sure?<eos> - It was down there!
Chief walt price speaking.<eos> It's detective cavanaugh here.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> That evidence I told you about?<eos> The scrapbook?<eos> It's gone missing.<eos> Babineaux must've gotten to it.<eos> Damn it, cavanaugh!<eos> How the hell did you let that happen?<eos> It was in my desk, someone could've...
Thank you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> But fire is wildly difficult to contain.<eos> And just when you think you've extinguished the blaze...<eos> - Bailey's looking for you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You have to pull it together.<eos> - You're getting yourself in trouble.<eos> - I know.<eos> ...it reignites.
It's a stupid conversation in the first place.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Boxing is better than MMA in all ways.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Let me explain something to you, okay?<eos> Boxing is civilized.<eos> Which is probably why you don't like it that much, okay?<eos> It's a technical sport.<eos> It requires something that you do not have.
We don't know what they're bringing in.<eos> It could be guns, it could be explosives.<eos> Well, whatever he's got planned, it's gonna be big.<eos> This event is attracting major attention from all over the world. Yeah.<eos> Speaking of which, fight's about to start.<eos> Yeah, which means Gabriel's probably already inside.<eos> The first round of this scheduled 12-round championship fight has clearly gone to Haynes.<eos> And if Luke Nakano doesn't find a way to solve the left jab of Devon Haynes, it's gonna be a quick and painful night for the hometown hero.<eos> He's looked completely overmatched since the opening bell.<eos> Haynes backs Nakano up. Haynes with a devastating right, and it looks like it may have hurt Nakano.

Check out the moves on this baby!<eos> This brute force bot is grinding through 72 potential passcodes per minute, trying to crack into Quinn's hidden partition.<eos> Hey, don't touch it.<eos> I don't want to have to start over.<eos> We're lucky that this calculator app only accepts numbers.<eos> No letters or symbols means there's only about 10 billion possible combinations.<eos> Yeah, but Quinn programmed the calculator to overwrite the hidden partition if it senses a forensic tool.<eos> Now, are you sure we're not gonna lose everything.<eos> No, the bot replicates the action of entering a code.<eos> It stopped.
Where are you from originally?<eos> Maryland.<eos> Oh, Maryland.<eos> - Baltimore?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Tough neighborhood.<eos> No.<eos> Loyola.<eos> We don't see many applicants from that law school.<eos> I think it's underrated, actually.
I think I left my emergency packet back at my place.<eos> Brian, if someone gives you an emergency packet, because your place has been compromised, you...<eos> Don't leave it in the place that's been compromised.<eos> Jinx.<eos> The FBI can ping that phone's location, Brian.<eos> Yeah, just to the nearest tower, though.<eos> It doesn't prove anything.<eos> And besides, that DIC is way too egotistical to have somebody ping his cell phone.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's not DIC.

Jackson's had one, but now he's throwing it away.<eos> Will you please stop?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This party sucks.<eos> Say "cheese"!<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Y-you asked for Manchego cheese.<eos> You didn't say how much you needed, so I just got a bunch.<eos> It's pretty pricy, but I...

You'll be able to go up and see him in recovery soon enough.<eos> Do all your patients say things they don't mean because of the pain?<eos> I find that pain is usually the precipice for the truth, yeah.<eos> He's totally right.<eos> I kept hinting about his weight.<eos> What an awful thing to do to a person you love.<eos> His weight bothered you?<eos> No.<eos> That's what's so stupid.<eos> I thought it bothered him.
It also makes sense that you, or one of your scumbags, caught up to DJ, tossed her out of the van and left her for dead.<eos> She stole one of the stones.<eos> And she was my responsibility. I'm going to have to cover that loss.<eos> I looked everywhere.<eos> I couldn't find her.<eos> I swear on my mother's life.<eos> Not knowing your mother, we're going to need something a little bit more tangible.<eos> The women arrived with luggage posing as tourist.<eos> There's no way that DJ's suitcase fit through that window.<eos> Where is it?
One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.<eos> So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a game where you're given three people and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.<eos> Well, my game is better, 'cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.<eos> Let's just play.<eos> I'll start you off easy.<eos> Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.<eos> Hmm. Well,<eos> I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse.
Sheldon Cooper's descent into madness... day two.<eos> It's 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate.<eos> My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry.<eos> It's only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades.<eos> I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.<eos> Since when do you hum songs?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You were just humming.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.
Who cares?<eos> What are you doing in my room?<eos> I...<eos> Stop it!<eos> That's mine!<eos> Why are you so strong? !<eos> Problem solved.<eos> Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.<eos> Dear Crazy Future Sheldon... this is a thermostat.<eos> It controls the temperature of the apartment.
Live long and suck it!<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Come in!<eos> Oh!<eos> Hi, Sheldon.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.
Really coat your tongue.<eos> Now swallow.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Much better.<eos> Okay, Jay, what you're gonna want to do is hold the sauce in your mouth, sw--<eos> I know how eating works.<eos> - Not too shabby.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You know who else makes a mean sauce is Gloria's dead aunt.<eos> - Oh. - Oh, there it is right there.
Cilantro!<eos> What?<eos> That car backfiring, it sounded like gunshots.<eos> I remember when I was a little girl in my aunt's kitchen, and she started chopping the cilantro really loud so that we couldn't hear the noise.<eos> Yes, okay.<eos> Well, what else do you remember?<eos> Well, nothing, Cam.<eos> It was 30 years ago.<eos> No, the recipe is inside you!<eos> It just needs to come out!
I'm making pasghetti!<eos> You are adorable.<eos> I remember when I had everyone in the palm of my hand with a two-foot putt like "pasghetti."<eos> We both know you know how to say it.<eos> Hey, guys, thanks again for helping me to get that listing.<eos> Cyril's house.<eos> - Pretty sexy, huh?<eos> - Ridonk.<eos> This place makes the Playboy mansion look like an old folks' home.<eos> Which I guess it kind of is now.

Go ahead and take that, please.<eos> The dispensary that was raided belongs to a private pharmaceutical lab that manufactures and securely stores our NZT supply.<eos> Well, not that securely.<eos> I mean, that guy knew about it.<eos> There were three of them, actually.<eos> And no, I don't think they did know.<eos> The shooter's cohorts cleared out of there before he discovered the NZT locker.<eos> Seems they were targeting oxycodone.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> It's the highest street value.
By being more aggressive, by being more human, - which resulted in this accident. - No.<eos> This accident was caused by humans.<eos> Then why did you erase the car's hard drive?<eos> I did not erase the hard drive.<eos> - Then how did it get erased?<eos> - Why don't we take a break?<eos> No, I'd like to answer that.<eos> The hard drive was damaged by the force of the accident.<eos> We're not talking about an airplane's black box here.<eos> It is vulnerable to impact.
- And what is that, Gloria?<eos> - I just got off the phone with the esteemed donor who so graciously lent us your apartment. - Uh-huh. - And whose daughter,<eos> Sarabelle, you just fired. He's threatening to evict you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> You--Gloria, I was told to make myself at home.<eos> - I have seen thee and her, and I do adore thee.<eos> - You're on very thin ice.<eos> And I suggest you get off of it before it breaks and we both fall through.
This ice feels very good to me.<eos> And now I cannot hear you.<eos> Because I'm listening to<eos> Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky.<eos> Which, by the way, I'm sure he used to love ice skating.<eos> Russians, you know?<eos> Pavel!<eos> - Ms. Windsor?<eos> Is there a problem with the floor?<eos> - Oh, no, no. It's absolutely perfect, Pavel.
She called and she said reddington was missing,<eos> And she asked me to trace his burner number.<eos> She made me promise not to tell ressler.<eos> You know where they are, and you're not gonna tell him.<eos> I only know the truth about my brother Because of reddington.<eos> I owe him for that this once.<eos> Why use agent ressler's laptop?<eos> When liz called, i wasn't thinking.<eos> His laptop -- he must have left it at my work station. I don't know.<eos> It was just there.
We worked Tuesdays together.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just... I can't believe someone would want to do that to her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know anybody who'd want to hurt her?<eos> Which one of those is Victoria's?<eos> Oh, okay, thanks.<eos> That's club property.<eos> You got a warrant?<eos> Well... it kind of looks open to me.
The red dots indicate the location of the gunshots heard three nights ago.<eos> Well, the victim was last seen leaving Morty's bar at 1:30, so we can lose all the gunfire prior to that.<eos> As well as where the arrests were made.<eos> That leaves us with two.<eos> Hopefully not after I run the gunshots through the sound-forging software.<eos> Now we just plot the decibels as a function of frequency.<eos> And what exactly are we watching for?<eos> The frequencies at which the two gunshots came in.<eos> Small-caliber firearms tend to have higher decibels, but not so much in the lower frequencies.<eos> So the fact that the first shot had a higher decibel in the lower frequency means it came from a large-caliber weapon?
What if Sally, Doreen, Fern, and Elsie made a pact to kill Dray?<eos> They agreed to stick to the same story if they were questioned.<eos> Then under pressure three of them crumbled and the blame went to Sally.<eos> Someone is exacting revenge on those who got away - with Mr. Dray's murder.<eos> - Julia, there are five killers.<eos> Counting Sally Brown, four of them are dead.<eos> That means one of them is still out there.<eos> If we are right, there is still one more statue the killer must cast.<eos> Sir, we've ascertained the motive for the electroplates murders.<eos> It dates back to the Albert Dray murder.
Well, sir, I wasn't...<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Quite swift.<eos> Quite swift, sir.<eos> All this local option business is ridiculous, if you ask me.<eos> Sir, if it's what the people of the Junction want, I see no reason to prevent it.<eos> Liquor is a good thing for a good man.<eos> A few drunks having too much is hardly cause to get rid of it.<eos> I've never understood the appeal of alcohol, sir.<eos> It impedes the brain's ability to function, making it impossible to think clearly.
Get out!<eos> I can walk out myself, sir.<eos> Despite the worrying circumstances, it's a pleasure to see you both again.<eos> Indeed, Jacques.<eos> How long have you been living up here?<eos> I bought this lodge 10 years ago.<eos> - And you?<eos> - I'm just here for the fishing.<eos> It really is a striking property.<eos> Strangely enough, it used to belong to Mr. Singer.
- I'm doing a trust fall!<eos> - Oh, I've got to videotape this!<eos> Listen, listen, I want you to 100% know that<eos> I'm definitely not going to catch you. Okay?<eos> I don't hear negativity.<eos> All I hear is friendship.<eos> Okay, you're definitely gonna fall, so...<eos> My heart says I'm not.<eos> Ok, well this is gonna hurt much more than when your Netflix special comes out and nobody watches it.<eos> I won't lie to you. That will hurt when it comes out on December 1.
- You don't own the thing, but you want me to let you root around inside.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - $3?<eos> - Hey, pal, we're the firefighters who put out that fire.<eos> We have some property that belongs to the driver, and we just want to give it back to him.<eos> - I think I can help you out.<eos> Guy left his wallet in the console.<eos> - Who abandons a camper in such a hurry that they leave behind a wallet?<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thanks. I supposed it was empty when you found it.
I fought under that flag.<eos> Just like Dad, just like Grandpa.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, you want to burn it, you don't love this country, get the hell out.<eos> It's not that simple, Danny.<eos> Oh, now we got to hear from the golden boy who never even wore a uniform?<eos> I wear one now, and no one respects what the flag stands for more than I do.<eos> You know what, then I'll tell you what.<eos> Hop on an airplane, go to some godforsaken hellhole, and watch all your buddies get blown away, then talk to us - about what the flag stands for. - Hey.<eos> Let's keep it civilized, okay?<eos> Look, everyone at this table respects your service, but when you defend the flag, you defend all the rights it stands for.
They're leaving.<eos> This is a First Amendment case.<eos> I know that, and you know that, but they don't know that.<eos> Then have them talk to me.<eos> They don't want to be argued out of their position.<eos> There isn't much neutral ground on abortion.<eos> On free speech.<eos> Your Honor, we will stipulate that the non-disclosure agreement applied on the premises, but the conversation did not take place there.<eos> They met at the conference and were on - an officially scheduled break. - Off-premises.<eos> You're saying the conversation wasn't covered by the non-disclosure agreement because it happened somewhere else?
I tackled him, the gun went off.<eos> Okay, take it easy.<eos> I think you just saved our lives, Hank.<eos> I guess you guys are rubbing off on me, huh?<eos> Kaelani's gun was a .22.<eos> Same as the other shooters.<eos> You all right?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> It took a lot of courage to do what you did, Hank.<eos> I mean, if this guy had got a shot off, it would have been one of us they'd be taking pictures of right now.
Cause if you step to him, you'd best be ready to step to me!<eos> You wanna dance, ese? !<eos> Easy, babe, easy.<eos> Breathe, breathe...<eos> Look, alright? Do I do things for Jackie?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Look at it from my perspective.<eos> Look at all the things I get.<eos> She's amazing at sex.<eos> When my penis gets inducted into the penis hall of fame, it's going to give an amazing acceptance speech.
So I checked Matt's alibi, but he was with HIS girlfriend.<eos> The thing is... ..it's Beth.<eos> How was the library?<eos> Quiet.<eos> Lots of books.<eos> Come and sit down.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, our chat yesterday...<eos> Yeah?<eos> It meant a lot.
I never really looked at the guy.<eos> You saying that was him?<eos> Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, yeah.<eos> How tall was he? My height?<eos> Mick's height?<eos> Average, I think.<eos> And he had a hat - a baseball cap.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I never really looked at him, I was too busy looking at his shoe.<eos> It was black.
'It's him!<eos> The Captain.'<eos> 'Leave me alone! '<eos> GUNSHOT What did I tell you?<eos> Long Ben!<eos> You think Errol was murdered by a pirate ghost?<eos> Why not?<eos> I saw a ghost once.<eos> Seriously, it properly freaked me out.<eos> It came into my hotel room, groaned and then wandered off again.
It had real trouble with light and shadow.<eos> It got a lot of other stuff wrong, too.<eos> Just nothing else that looked so...<eos> - Racist?<eos> - Right.<eos> It's gotten better.<eos> Google had this problem, too.<eos> Did the algorithm ever mistake a white person for an animal?<eos> Why would it do that?<eos> Because it mistakes white people for polar bears or white seals.
You're Rebecca's neighbor, right?<eos> - I met you at her party. - Oh.<eos> You got really drunk, and then you slow-danced with that giant fish.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> No, it did...<eos> I have pictures.<eos> I saw you ask it to go home with you.<eos> Does this present say, "our mom sucks, but I'm gonna try very hard not to hold it against you"?<eos> No.<eos> It says you're old and still think kids play outside.
It's a cultural wasteland.<eos> I mean, it's completely arse about face. And it is tough to drink hot toddies when you're shvitzing.<eos> Oh, I'm Jewish, by the way.<eos> - You're Jewish? - Yes.<eos> - A British Jew?<eos> - Yes!<eos> That is fabulous.<eos> British Jew. Tea and matzo, anyone?<eos> You're funny.<eos> Well, since you're British, we must do tea, even if it's iced.

But at least I thought I had you.<eos> Cheer up, Jada.<eos> You're not gonna get traffic like this in Wisconsin.<eos> What is it I will get?<eos> Hmm, thousand types of cheese, great skiing, and no one trying to murder you.<eos> I will never again see my family or my homeland.<eos> This does not sound like much of a reward to me.<eos> The reward is life on your terms not your family.<eos> New name, new identity.<eos> This horror story, it's over.
Victim's name was Eddie Ross.<eos> We had to I.D. him with dental records.<eos> Stabbed in the chest and incinerated.<eos> Did the killer also throw him off a roof?<eos> He was dead before the fire started.<eos> Figure there was a struggle, the perp torched the place to cover up any evidence he left behind.<eos> The neighbor-- you said you interviewed her yourself.<eos> Yeah. And she smelled a gas leak, as in natural gas?<eos> Well, her unit and Ross's both have gas stoves.<eos> She thought maybe the pilot went out, only it didn't.
Should answer all your questions.<eos> Just like he wrote in his statement.<eos> He hired those workers to move the drums, and he let them use his company's truck to do it.<eos> And he did it at the same time the fire broke out at Eddie Ross's place.<eos> A despicable alibi, but an alibi nonetheless.<eos> Duncan Brice is not our killer.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm punishing my brain.<eos> And what did your brain do to deserve punishment?<eos> It's what it didn't do.
I'm punishing my brain.<eos> And what did your brain do to deserve punishment?<eos> It's what it didn't do.<eos> We know that Duncan Brice is an abhorrent human being who'd rather hide evidence of toxic waste than protect his tenants.<eos> And he's almost certainly behind the death of Eddie Ross.<eos> He had an accomplice-- someone who went to kill Eddie while Duncan dealt with the drums.<eos> That's why we went to separate quarters-- to try and figure out who it was, right?<eos> I've been pouring through the man's life for hours now, trying to find someone he would plausibly approach for such a task, and I have nothing to show for it.<eos> How fares your brain?<eos> Actually, it thinks it found something.
We agreed.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Even if it's something small, if you two wake up together on Christmas morning, I guarantee you she'll have bought you something.<eos> Why?<eos> Women are more thoughtful than men.<eos> It's Christmas, she cares about you.<eos> At the very least, you should have backup plan.<eos> Like what?<eos> The emergency gift.<eos> You don't need it, you don't use it, but it's there if you do.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> My payload.<eos> - If it warms up, it'll blow.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm hauling liquid hydrogen in there.<eos> Enough to knock down the whole neighborhood.<eos> Capp, let's get the cutters.<eos> Capp.<eos> That valve is damaged.<eos> As it warms, it expands.

"Early diagnosis, anterograde amnesia".<eos> Yeah, or in layman's terms, chronic short-term memory loss.<eos> It's like she remembers everything up until the point of being hit on her head, but nothing since.<eos> Her memory keeps resetting.<eos> Like Dory in Finding Nemo?<eos> Yeah - or me, after three pints of Mick's scrumpy.<eos> It's a bit...convenient, isn't it?<eos> I thought that. Then I looked at the results.<eos> Fractured skull.<eos> Now, it has healed over, but it wasn't there before she went off the boat.
Robert didn't believe her.<eos> Did you?<eos> Rose?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Know what this is?<eos> Bindweed.<eos> A bloody nightmare.<eos> Calystegia sepium.<eos> When it flowers, it looks pretty enough but... it'll choke everything else to death.
Look, everyone's already taken off but I've got a couple of hours to kill so can I at least buy you a beer?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Merry Christmas!<eos> - You all came!<eos> I don't have to damn you all to hell anymore.<eos> We all changed our plans.<eos> My Christmas wish came true.<eos> I just want everyone to be happy.<eos> That reminds me though, I want to hear everyone's Christmas wish.<eos> My wish is that someone would stop pretending like that kiss didn't mean something when it so clearly did mean something.
Allright,allright,lots tocatch upon.<eos> Jane was trying to balance motherhood with grad school.<eos> Making things harder: the evil classmate who wrote an exposé about Rafael's family.<eos> Oh, and speaking of family drama, Jane's father, Rogelio, invested all his money into his passion project.<eos> - Unfortunately, it decked...
I think at this point we can share with the secretary that this asset is being handled by her husband.<eos> Never a dull moment.<eos> How confident are Dr. McCord and DIA in this asset?<eos> - Highly, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> Recommend moving all nonessential resources from Kharkiv and Luhansk to Mariupol as quickly as possible.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Ephraim, could you wait a minute?<eos> Of course.<eos> As you'd expect, our NATO allies are eager for us to end this conflict before it expands.
Well, it would be very nice to get this... Maklovsky in a room, huh?<eos> - That's gonna be hard.<eos> - He's dead.<eos> Killed in a violent mugging in Moscow one week after Pavel Ostrov died.<eos> Okay, but wait a second.<eos> We still don't have anything that directly connects Maria - or Maklovsky...<eos> - Except this.<eos> DIA's source in the hospital was able to get us a list of every prescription that Maklovsky wrote during that two-week period, including one for Progestafil.<eos> A rarely used, injectable, blood coagulant.<eos> NIH said that in extreme doses, it could cause an embolism in someone who recently had surgery.
We've been losing sleep over this case for 15 years."<eos> We knew the technology had advanced, so we asked for the testing again.<eos> The material was sent down to the crime laboratory again, and what they found was that there were 13 pubic hairs that had been collected during the pubic hair combings of the victim.<eos> Eleven of those hairs had no root.<eos> So they were down to two pubic hairs.<eos> One of those hairs was from a female, probably Penny Beerntsen's own hair.<eos> The truth in this matter came down to that one remaining pubic hair.<eos> They got a full profile.<eos> That profile conclusively excluded Steven Avery.<eos> It could not have come from him.
Until Shelly was...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You need to tell me everything.<eos> About what happened at your house that night.<eos> Um... it was Zo's idea.<eos> I didn't want to do it, but I was scared to say no.<eos> And he had this power over us.<eos> Whatever Zo said, we did.<eos> We got there around 9:00.<eos> Sofia didn't want to use her key, because she was afraid it could lead back to her.
And Lieutenant Lenk and Sergeant Colborn are officers of Calumet County?<eos> - Uh, no, Manitowoc County.<eos> - Manitowoc County.<eos> And as far as you know, no one saw this key until November 8th, is that right?<eos> Correct.<eos> And those slippers were moved before the key was seen?<eos> Yes.<eos> And the first time they were moved, nobody saw the key?<eos> The key wasn't there the first time they were moved.<eos> And when you saw it there, it was sitting out there in plain view right on the floor, is that right?
No, sir, I did not.<eos> [Buting] It's not enough to just get the key.<eos> He wants Avery's DNA on that.<eos> And so he is gonna wait until it is the right time.<eos> And there is a Calumet deputy with him on all of these searches.<eos> Yep, there is, somewhere near.<eos> Somewhere nearby, and he was just waiting for the right time... when he could do it.<eos> That key does not fall from... you know, in between the backboard and the frame of that little bookcase.<eos> And find its way underneath a pair of slippers.<eos> Yeah, it just does...
Did you ever write a report about that?<eos> No, I did not, sir.<eos> Well, actually you did, didn't you?<eos> It was about eight years later, wasn't it?<eos> I wrote a statement on it.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You wrote that statement in 2003, the day after Steven Avery finally walked out of prison, didn't you?<eos> I don't know what day Steve was released from prison, but I wrote the statement in 2003.<eos> That's all I have.<eos> Sergeant Colborn, back in 1994 or '95, if you would've written a report... what would it have been about?
No, I did not, sir.<eos> Well, actually you did, didn't you?<eos> It was about eight years later, wasn't it?<eos> I wrote a statement on it.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You wrote that statement in 2003, the day after Steven Avery finally walked out of prison, didn't you?<eos> I don't know what day Steve was released from prison, but I wrote the statement in 2003.<eos> That's all I have.<eos> Sergeant Colborn, back in 1994 or '95, if you would've written a report... what would it have been about?<eos> [Colborn] I don't know what it would've been about.
- Yes, just once!<eos> - Don't call me "honey-poo."<eos> - I'll call you honey-poo if I want.<eos> Now that takes the cake!<eos> I have to be the concierge here too!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - My darling Marcelle!<eos> Oh! The chair from number 10.<eos> Who put it here?<eos> What's it doing here?
That was me.<eos> He did write a court story.<eos> I re-wrote it.<eos> What?<eos> Girls do not do re-writes.<eos> Why not?<eos> That's simply how we do things here.<eos> We have rules, protocol.<eos> Those rules are dumb.<eos> If copy's good, it's good.
- All right, so can we go then?<eos> This does remind me of a time...<eos> Johann, if you tell me one of your stories, I swear I will turn your insides into your outsides.<eos> For another day, then.<eos> Off we go.<eos> Okay, bud.<eos> Let's see how long we can keep these guys busy.<eos> We're not here to fight, bud.<eos> Toothless, sky!<eos> Let's just hurry up with this ridiculous plan before it falls apart, which it will.
- [Ruffnut] Jerk!<eos> - I think she saw it.<eos> How lucky are we? [chuckles]<eos> To be able to study a Seashocker this closely?<eos> Okay, but we have to be careful.<eos> We don't want to hurt the dragon.<eos> Oh, Hiccup, when would I ever hurt a dragon?<eos> [dragon screeching] [sighs] Look at how fluidly it moves through the water.<eos> - Truly masterful.<eos> - What's it even doing here?

But, if I was to publish them in their present state, I'd be sent to the lunatic asylum.<eos> You don't understand. These...<eos> I don't think about this the same way you do.<eos> These steps you want, what you want,<eos> I do not know how to do.<eos> Well, you can just begin by trying your best and see if you don't surprise yourself.<eos> - Sir, do you know something I don't?<eos> - Apparently not.<eos> No, God and I don't see exactly eye to eye.<eos> So if I prepare for rain, then it won't.
We're back!<eos> - I missed you!<eos> - Hey, Dad!<eos> Samantha, Mason, thank you!<eos> Samantha and I did it alone.<eos> I know that men do not go that high.<eos> A distribute gifts!<eos> We take a huge lift. Top all throw a paper airplane.<eos> What happened?<eos> It flew!
- Kenny.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Kenny, this is Mason and I want you to show the place today.<eos> Hello.<eos> Welcome to the mess.<eos> The class!<eos> Listen!<eos> We have a new student with us.<eos> His name is Mason.<eos> It is sitting in the back row.
- Yes, Phillip.<eos> Phillip ¿read?<eos> Sign that says:<eos> "Do not use this bathroom is broken."<eos> Is it so difficult?<eos> I dunno.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I think it will make the house for sale.<eos> Why?<eos> It's very big for us.
- Yes, you fucked a guy from uni.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - I do not regret anything.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> It's a relief to be with someone who is not depressed all the time.<eos> The world is not so horrible.<eos> Not everything is a big conspiracy.<eos> I'm glad you could think so.<eos> Sure dating an athlete helps you ... clear your mind.<eos> It's not an athlete.
Darling!<eos> Honeypot, I'm coming!<eos> Honeypot!<eos> Honeypot!<eos> But it wasn't my fault.<eos> Who else was in the house?<eos> The door was locked.<eos> - There was an elephant.<eos> - An elephant?<eos> It had the head of an elephant and body of a snake, but it tried to shoot me!
-That's not the same thing.<eos> -No, it isn't.<eos> Now talk me through your very scary memo, but keep in mind I don't have your Ph.D.<eos> Two weeks ago, I noticed a series of accounts in our Russian partner's records to which our company's computers are denied access.<eos> Massive currency accounts, all in U.S. Treasuries.<eos> Cherevin's made a total commitment to U.S. dollars when there's been a hurricane in the Gulf and a string of negative economic reports.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> It's external sterilized intervention.<eos> Like I'm an idiot, please?<eos> The dollar should be going down, but it's up.
No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's a machine that thinks it's Alex Murphy.<eos> And in my book that's legal.<eos> Well done.<eos> Well done.<eos> Hey, Doctor, what happens if I tase an exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?<eos> I, uh, I think we're all curious to find out.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> If I had a pulse, it'd be racing.
Yeah, but what about after the vote?<eos> I mean, those two should not be allowed contact.<eos> If she starts putting ideas in his head... Bring her in.<eos> I'll handle the explanation.<eos> And what about Alex?<eos> You know, unfortunately, we can't just keep him on ice.<eos> The shooting at the station spooked some of the politicians.<eos> They're our clients. We have to take care of them.<eos> They're fine when a machine is lowering the murder rate, but when a man is investigating city politics, they get nervous.<eos> All right. First off, it's not a man, okay?
You fight much harder than you fuck.<eos> Surrender to me or meet your death.<eos> Who would you fight if not for me?<eos> No one could challenge your skill.<eos> I would rather die a free man than as a slave.<eos> Even if the chain was attached to you.<eos> It begins as a whisper.<eos> A promise.<eos> The lightest of breezes dances through the rigging, as it creaks above the death cries of 10,000 men.<eos> It moves through her hair as gently as a lover's hand.
Not unlike the Foot Clan and what they'd like to do to our city.<eos> Then one day, a hero arose.<eos> A great alchemist discovered the antidote to the warlord's poison.<eos> The cure-all for his evil.<eos> Your father and I were trying to recreate that cure-all.<eos> We developed a mutagen capable of stimulating self-repair on a cellular level.<eos> What were you going to do with it?<eos> Imagine New York City, being victim to a chemical attack.<eos> This mutagen would be able to reverse its effects.<eos> It would save the city, it would save the people.
We need to break a left!<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> We gotta find the elevators and get up to the roof.<eos> You guys get out of here.<eos> Get to a safe distance.<eos> No, no, we can go find Sacks and get our hands on the mutagen as a contingency plan, just in case...<eos> You know.<eos> Thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> If we don't make it back, bring the mutagen to Splinter.<eos> It can save his life.
Go cry home to your mama.<eos> - What took you so long?<eos> - We should go.<eos> Do the thing. Make the tires skirt!<eos> How did that work out for you back there?<eos> I think it would have worked out a lot better if I had a gun.<eos> So, you need a gun to interrogate children?<eos> It's about having confidence.<eos> Me having a gun just gives me a certain level of confidence.<eos> Knowing that it's below my belt. That's all I'm saying, man.
They are but some of the scapulars of our fallen brothers and sisters.<eos> We have always been out numbered in battle.<eos> After many hard-fought victories, our ranks have thinned.<eos> Demons however... remain strong.<eos> To help you survive against them. The Queen has asked us to provide you with weapons.<eos> Demons can only be descended with sacramentals.<eos> Blessed objects, such as the crucifix or holy water.<eos> Any object can sacramental, by marking them with the blessed symbol of the Gargoyle Order.<eos> - Descended.<eos> - When a demon is killed, it's spirit descends to hell, where it remains trapped for all eternity.
- Of course you do.<eos> Stay with us.<eos> Help us to understand your father's work, and together we can unlock those answers and many more.<eos> Yes.<eos> Victor Frankenstein gave you life, but could not restore your soul.<eos> Could it? There's no sign of the creature. It could be anywhere by now.<eos> It will find a safe place where it can study the journal, then it will come back here!<eos> Come back?<eos> I've been pursuing the creature for the better part of 200 years.<eos> - It will Return. - For what?
Can your comment wait?<eos> I just wanna say that the picnic is gonna be a good place to reach out and form relationships with other people.<eos> Duly noted, Jerry.<eos> We all wanna get out of here, so, John, you'll be setting up the barbecue grills in the parking lot.<eos> Dave's bringing drinks. Sheryl's providing decorations, and Fiona's doing the music.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've got an idea, while we were sitting here.<eos> You know the office corridor?<eos> I thought it would be the perfect place for a conga line.
- Very soon.<eos> Goodbye, Phillip.<eos> Goodbye... for now.<eos> Stop doing that.<eos> Well?<eos> That boy is the answer!<eos> No, Diaval.<eos> - Yes!<eos> True love's kiss, remember?<eos> It can break the spell.
I got a picture.<eos> - Nah.<eos> You think maybe he robbed the bar?<eos> I'm hearing here and there that this guy has something to do with the Whelan disappearance.<eos> Really?<eos> That's a really good-looking dog.<eos> I came by to give him his afternoon walk.<eos> - Great. - I freaked.<eos> Is your cell on?<eos> Yeah, but it's on vibrate.
Have to wait and see.<eos> You're a very, very strange person, Hector.<eos> The kind of person I normally would avoid like the plague.<eos> Glad I didn't, buddy.<eos> Thank you, Edward. I mean it.<eos> Sir, you do realize that this is four flights.<eos> - That is two days.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> And the last flight is not so...<eos> - Well, it is not exactly...
- Well, it is not exactly...<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Let me put it this way.<eos> First class.<eos> Business class.<eos> Economy.<eos> You.<eos> Bring it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> If you look at this plane, you'll notice it's quite old.
It's your first Christmas!<eos> I hope you got my present!<eos> Thanks for the book, Alex.<eos> I know she'll love it one day.<eos> What is it?<eos> This is my new apartment.<eos> What's this you're doing here, darling?<eos> Um, handmade hearts.<eos> And here, we have my favorite Back to the Future poster.<eos> It would look so special in the bathroom.
Are you absolutely certain you're ready?"<eos> And when it appeared "Abercrombie" was ready.<eos> I picked her up, very Rhett Butler, and carried her to my bed.<eos> - Where I couldn't get it up.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - But...<eos> - I can certainly relate to that. In the middle of the night, I woke up with this gigantic erection, God...<eos> God knows how.<eos> So I shake her, shouting, "Please stick it in for me, Delilah."<eos> I was afraid of it going away before I could... while I was hunting for the right place to put it.
So tidy.<eos> Here.<eos> I got him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you back to bed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Estelle made you some stuffed cabbage for later.<eos> There's this new drug in Paris.<eos> Kessler's lover is flying out to get it.<eos> Here it is.
He's the Keeper of the Runners.<eos> Every morning, when those doors open, they run the maze... mapping it, memorizing it, trying to find a way out.<eos> How long have they been looking?<eos> Three years.<eos> And they haven't found anything?<eos> It's a lot easier said than done.<eos> Listen.<eos> Hear that?<eos> It's the maze, changing.<eos> It changes every night.
Meet me in the woods in half-an-hour.<eos> Will this be enough?<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on!<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> There's something in there.<eos> You mean, besides a Griever pancake?<eos> Whoa, what are you doing?<eos> I thought you said it was dead.
The political, military and economic.<eos> But, and this is key, each part has to interconnect to show how none of the three nodes functions without the other.<eos> It's a linear film, of course, but I imagine it as kind of a hypertext. So, what's it about?<eos> To be clear, the film is really about the working class, and I can't speak on behalf of the working class.<eos> I can't make their film, of course.<eos> But they have to be felt as the impossible subject of the text.<eos> If that makes sense.<eos> But it isn't even really about the power structure but about what it means to make a film about it.<eos> It's about the very possibility of making this film.<eos> It's really about America.
Do you need the stuff about Turkish politics?<eos> Yes, because it connects to what he's saying about the shift in power in the contemporary global economy. All right.<eos> But it feels like a detour.<eos> What about the lengthy history of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire?<eos> You need that?<eos> The interview with Tillie Kupferschmidst's great-great niece?<eos> That's the emotional center of the movie.<eos> I mean, that's where things come together.<eos> Without that, I don't, I... I mean, why make the film?<eos> - Yeah. But it's too long.

I really like you, too. We're friends.<eos> I really believed it.<eos> I was a bet.<eos> Are you okay, son?<eos> I'm not crying. I'm not.<eos> Are you filming this?<eos> Josh, your sleeve is on fire!<eos> I took your note, by the way. I cut the stuff about Turkish politics.<eos> You were right, I don't need it.<eos> It doesn't matter that it was faked because the movie isn't about Afghanistan or Kent, or anyone, it's all about Jamie.
How does it do this?<eos> It's a smart house.<eos> So, it recognizes your voice and then adjusts itself accordingly.<eos> It's like a friend.<eos> I consider it a friend.<eos> But I have real friends that aren't robots.<eos> Let's forget this conversation and the previous conversation and start afresh.<eos> Got that?<eos> Great.<eos> I'm gonna record your voice now, Annie, and it'll be in the system.
- There's a next movie?<eos> - There're four more.<eos> Shut up!<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - Cool!<eos> I gotta get back to work.<eos> You can't stay for the party?<eos> No. I haven't worked in two hours and three of my men think I'm dead.<eos> I'm alive.<eos> You've worked enough. lf your building gets any taller it's gonna hit the sun.
Well, actually, you left the door to the roof wedged open. So I just...<eos> - Did I?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I must stop doing that. Yeah.<eos> I mean, you should be scared.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> No, I can see that.<eos> The tea is lovely.<eos> It's called Lapsang Souchong.<eos> It's black and from China.
Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I can't believe Al...<eos> You're moving up through the ranks, and he's failing.<eos> It makes him hate himself and it makes him hate you.<eos> He's just afraid.<eos> Everyone's afraid.<eos> I know, but fear does something strange to people like Al.<eos> But not you.<eos> Fear doesn't shut you down, it wakes you up.
Take your time.<eos> I'm just enjoying myself in this shrinking box.<eos> As a Dauntless soldier, you have to follow orders... you don't always agree, with.<eos> Who is she?<eos> She's an innocent.<eos> I have to kill her.<eos> But I can never do it. Unless I look away.<eos> Why are we in Abnegation?<eos> Your last fear is your worst fear.<eos> It lives in the deepest part of your mind.
About nine minutes from now.<eos> Fury was right about that ship.<eos> Somebody's trying to hide something.<eos> This drive is protected by some sort of Al.<eos> It keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.<eos> Can you override it?<eos> The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me.<eos> Slightly.<eos> I'm gonna try running a tracer.<eos> This is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.
HYDRA's new world order will arise.<eos> We won, Captain.<eos> Your death amounts to the same as your life.<eos> A zero sum.<eos> As I was saying...<eos> What's on this drive?<eos> Project Insight requires insight.<eos> So, I wrote an algorithm.<eos> What kind of algorithm?<eos> What does it do?
No.<eos> None of that.<eos> Dr. Brannamon, you found something else in his system at the time of death?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> Mark Blackwell had oxycodone-paracetamol in his blood.<eos> Percocet.<eos> And your lab registered his blood alcohol level...<eos> - ...at .23? - Yes.<eos> In that condition, could he have been riding in a straight line?<eos> If he could ride a bike at all, it would have been swerving.
But it all started that day in 1973... the day she first killed.<eos> The day she truly became...<eos> Mystique.<eos> You want to go back there.<eos> If I can get to her, stop the assassination... keep her out of their hands... then we can stop the Sentinels from ever being born.<eos> And end this war before it ever begins.<eos> I can send someone back a couple weeks.<eos> Maybe a month.<eos> But you're talking about going back decades.<eos> You have the most powerful brain in the world, Professor... but the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps.
I can't do this.<eos> My mind...<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> - It won't take it.<eos> - You're just a little rusty.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> It's not a question of being rusty.<eos> I can flip the switches. I can turn the knobs.<eos> But my power comes from here.<eos> It comes from...
Charles.<eos> So this is what becomes of us.<eos> Erik was right.<eos> Humanity does this to us.<eos> Not if we show them a better path.<eos> You still believe?<eos> Just because someone stumbles, loses their way... it doesn't mean they're lost forever.<eos> Sometimes we all need a little help.<eos> I'm not the man I was.<eos> I open my mind... and it almost overwhelms me.
- What's the poem about?<eos> -A bird.<eos> It's about a bird?<eos> - What kind of bird?<eos> -A pigeon.<eos> About a pigeon.<eos> And what did the pigeon do?<eos> -It sat on a branch.<eos> -it sat on a branch?<eos> - And what did it do on the branch?
It rested and reflected?<eos> - What did the pigeon reflect on?<eos> -The fact that it had no money.<eos> - What was that?<eos> -The fact that it had no money.<eos> That it had no money?<eos> Gosh.<eos> - What happened then?<eos> -it flew home.<eos> And then it flew home?
There are people here who are getting up early for work tomorrow. In a tiny cabin we will stay Spend our lives so peaceful day by day<eos> I've come to realize something.<eos> I realize I've been greedy all my life.<eos> Ungenerous.<eos> And that's why I've become so unhappy.<eos> I've been greedy all my life. Ungenerous.<eos> And that's why I've become so unhappy.<eos> Show respect to His Majesty the King!<eos> His Majesty the King needs to use your bathroom.<eos> - Where is it?
No, I'm full.<eos> Just dump it in the ocean.<eos> You know, we're all in the same boat, here.<eos> Actually, we're not.<eos> And perhaps you could express a little more concern... over the fact that you stole and destroyed... a $19 million vehicle!<eos> Bill me!<eos> Corporal?<eos> Corporal!<eos> We're picking up a signal, sir.<eos> It's five klicks southwest... but it stopped at that remote island.
My family were butchered by the Romans.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - "Sorry"?<eos> What would a Roman know of such things?<eos> I am not a Roman.<eos> I'm a citizen of Pompeii.<eos> Then why do I see Rome's eagle everywhere I turn?<eos> I'm no part of that.<eos> After a year in Rome, I hoped never to see that eagle again.<eos> And yet, here it is, thrust into the soil outside my home.
Men killing each other for our amusement is not a sport.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> All new.<eos> I don't have time for this, Graecus.<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> That we cancel the games?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Merely postpone them.<eos> This amphitheater has stood for a hundred years.<eos> It withstood the great earthquake.
Seriously, guys!<eos> Who's next?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Check it out.<eos> It's a jackpot. What?<eos> Look, with the guns... with the SWAT, and Mossi's boss, I got all his guys pinned.<eos> I've got enough evidence to put this guy away for years.<eos> That's great, man.<eos> Remember that long tunnel?<eos> See where it leads?

You don't believe me.<eos> I paid a premium for something, you know.<eos> And my policy coverage includes the whole... family unit.<eos> Charlie was family unit and that thing killed him.<eos> Killed him, sir?<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> Be careful, sir.<eos> The instrument that you are handling could be a threat for your health.<eos> I am thrilled to inform you that your unit is in perfect condition.<eos> It's the only one in this kitchen who couldn't harm a living being, even if you force it to.
Daddy?<eos> It's easy to give you a ride.<eos> That cop... has described the incident<eos> as a group of machines that are alive.<eos> Alive.<eos> Before the first Pilgrim was manufactured... there was a precedent.<eos> It was nothing more than a quantum brain manufactured in a lab.<eos> But it was a genuine unit with no restrictions... and no protocols.<eos> During eight days, we had a free-flowing dialogue with that unit.<eos> We learned from it and it learned from us.

Mmm-mmm. No.<eos> He is in possession of a letter written by your father to his.<eos> It makes reference to a Mr. Lipizzaner, as in the Spanish horses which are born black but gradually turn white.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is a process I'm guessing your bank is familiar with?<eos> The letter contains a number.<eos> Does it fit?<eos> Does it fit what?<eos> Is the number an account reference in use at this bank?<eos> I'm afraid my bank doesn't broadcast the manner in which it does its business.
Spectacular, isn't it?<eos> It was here, on the Acropolis hill, that some believe Theseus's father, King Aegeus, looked out to sea, waiting for his son to return.<eos> See, Theseus had promised his father that if he defeated the Minotaur, he'd hoist a white sail on his ship as a tribute but he was so excited to get back home he forgot and he flew the same black sail that he set out with.<eos> Well, thinking his son was dead, the heartbroken king flung himself onto the rocks below, another victim of the cruel tricks gods play on men.<eos> Well, I hope you ladies brought your handkerchiefs, 'cause the next thing you're about to see has been known to make some weep at first sight.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Completed in 438 BC, the Parthenon.<eos> From the Greek word "parthenes", meaning "virgins".<eos> "The ancient Greeks were masters of deception.<eos> "Even though the base of the Parthenon appears straight to the naked eye, "it is, in fact, completely crooked.
Our task is to deliver this sword to our brother.<eos> Maybe Kai was wrong.<eos> What Nariko did protected Kai.<eos> Sword stopped that horrid fish lady.<eos> Maybe sword isn't bad.<eos> Kai, I felt its power flowing through me.<eos> But as it did, I could feel the sword tearing my soul apart.<eos> The sword will kill the bearer.<eos> It's only a matter of time.<eos> It's too powerful.
Well, they started it.<eos> Nariko make more blood than Kai.<eos> We're close.<eos> You know what's strange?<eos> I can feel it.<eos> He's in there.<eos> Nariko!<eos> Sword is bad.<eos> Very bad.<eos> It wants to kill Nariko.
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.<eos> Come on!<eos> Finger to the throat means death.<eos> Metaphor.<eos> Yeah, sorta.<eos> No.<eos> Xandar!<eos> You stand accused.<eos> Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now.<eos> It is the tinder on which you burn.
Nullify it as best you can.<eos> At this height a bomb would tear this plane apart, but we descend to 8,000 feet, pressure equalizes, and then we have a chance.<eos> So you're just gonna let the bomb go off?<eos> Of course not, I'm gonna stop it.<eos> But if I can't, I'd rather be prepared, wouldn't you?<eos> The man who brought this bomb on the plane may try something.<eos> Can I trust you to stop him?<eos> You're damn straight you can.<eos> Hey, Reilly, sorry about the nose.<eos> It was never my best feature.
Things build up, all the shit a person goes through during the day. All the petty little humiliations.<eos> I have no complaints.<eos> Is it political?<eos> Do you have feelings about the government?<eos> Did someone order you to do these things?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Tell me about the voice.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't say anything about the voice.<eos> Did it just start telling you to do things today?
Who are you?<eos> Alan Turing.<eos> Ah, Turing.<eos> The mathematician.<eos> Correct.<eos> -However could I have guessed?<eos> -Well, you didn't.<eos> You just read it on that piece of paper.<eos> King's College, Cambridge.<eos> Now, it says here you were a bit of a prodigy in the maths department.
Spontaneous combustion, however, totally real.<eos> What? You gotta get back here right now.<eos> One of those idiots is in the building and he's pretending to be my husband!<eos> Why don't you tell them he's not your husband?<eos> Because I don't even know what they're up to.<eos> He must be trying to sell the box.<eos> Just get back here!<eos> This microscopic robot, or nanobot can be injected into the human body to detect and cure cancer.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Can it sing?
This microscopic robot, or nanobot can be injected into the human body to detect and cure cancer.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Can it sing?<eos> Uh... What?<eos> They got a large-mouth bass now that you hang it on the wall.<eos> When you walk past it, it sings Take Me to the River.<eos> Are you saying...<eos> What I'm saying is, you're this close, but there's a drawing board you should be getting back to.<eos> Next!<eos> But it cures cancer.
It's fitted with a digital cinema camera that will, when we find one of these bad boys give us the shot of the century.<eos> A sight nobody but God has witnessed: the eye of the tornado.<eos> That means "cut," Jacob.<eos> Cut it.<eos> Let's get some B roll.<eos> Get shots of the claws, the instruments on the back, panel stuff.<eos> - Just give me stuff I can use. Okay?<eos> - Got it.<eos> My storm's expanding.<eos> That means it's going to be really big by the time it gets here.
Yeah, but no vortex.<eos> - Jacob. I got some circulation over here.<eos> - Over here, got it.<eos> It's heading towards those trees.<eos> I'm on Oakwood Road.<eos> If you're in Shaw County, you need to get yourself to a safe place now.<eos> This thing is going to track right, almost towards town.<eos> There it is now.<eos> You can see the wall cloud.<eos> It's lower as it transitions to the east.
Get in.<eos> - Let's go find your brother.<eos> - All right.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> Come on.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> Dad, it's getting worse out there.<eos> Still no signal.<eos> My phone.<eos> It's not working.
What do I wanna say? Um...<eos> Go easy on Trey.<eos> He's gonna tell you that this is all his fault.<eos> This was his idea. But it wasn't.<eos> It's just Trey. His attention-seeking behavior.<eos> My idea.<eos> My fault.<eos> Trey, you should be the person you always were, dude, because you're awesome.<eos> You're awesome and I'm proud of you and just live every day like it's your last.<eos> Because, shit, someday it will be.
What do you think?<eos> Why don't you look at all of this?<eos> This could be yours.<eos> What about this land?<eos> Purple People Eater's back and she looks hungry.<eos> Isn't this incredible?<eos> - I knew you would like it.<eos> - Hey, you! Hey.<eos> I own this house!<eos> It's not for sale!
Well, what do you think?<eos> Well, I think that just 'cause Billy works downtown he doesn't... All right.<eos> I'll call him.<eos> God, you're such a punk!<eos> - Tom.<eos> - What?<eos> The phone's not charged.<eos> Is it so hard to like put the phone back on the charger? Gimme.<eos> Gimme it. Gimme it.<eos> Gimme it. It's dead.
You will just hold it over my head, go to your room.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Gross.<eos> It's cold and gross.<eos> It just keeps coming.<eos> Hey, you gotta turn the knob!<eos> No, I mean the punishments from the universe.<eos> It's a flood, it's practically biblical.<eos> Where the fuck is your plunger?<eos> It should be right next to the, um...
Don't think that's overdoing it?<eos> No.<eos> I think he's gonna be psyched the order's done three days early.<eos> I think he's gonna be flipping out to see us out on his course.<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if he gives us a membership.<eos> -Are you serious?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God. I want that.<eos> DALE: Surprise. Ha, ha.<eos> Sir, we finished your order and it is ready to be shipped.
Come on. This is not helpful.<eos> Think seriously.<eos> You're right.<eos> There's other things people have done.<eos> - There's plots.<eos> -For money.<eos> - The plot of the movie Speed.<eos> -Yes, there you go.<eos> Put a bomb on a bus.<eos> So we'll rig a bus so that when it goes below 5D miles an hour, it blows up.
- They're not even allowed at this pool.<eos> -I can't turn my mind off.<eos> - Guys.<eos> Guys.<eos> Guys.<eos> -Will you stop it?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's not argue, okay?<eos> We came up with an awesome plan.<eos> It is smart.
If he was tied up here the whole time, how could Rex have the same phone?<eos> - They switched pants!<eos> -Yeah.<eos> They got it.<eos> - Check it.<eos> -lt's the same ringtone, sir.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's my phone.<eos> I have the same ringtone.<eos> It's an inspiring ringtone.
- Oh, shit.<eos> -Dale, buddy, you okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> - Oh, my God. -Oh, wow.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> -What was that?<eos> Dale, let's put this down.<eos> What was the plan here, buddy?<eos> - I overreacted.<eos> It's not even sharp.
Ok.<eos> People cave when you offer double.<eos> Like they've won lotto.<eos> But I haven't been able to get a hold of the third owner:<eos> Þormóður Thorlacius.<eos> - Yes, Móri, the poet.<eos> - He owns the house?<eos> Yes, clearly.<eos> - Don't you have his number?<eos> - Yes, but it's only a home phone.
'I needed to hit the air-bag, 'which I did.<eos> 'Speed was paramount.<eos> 'The air-bag needed to be got out of the way 'just as John cleared the station.<eos> 'But we needed him to see a body.<eos> 'That's where Molly came in.<eos> 'Like figures on a weather clock, we went one way, John went the other.<eos> 'Then, our well-timed cyclist...' '..put John briefly out of action, 'giving me time to switch places with the corpse on the pavement.<eos> 'The rest was just window dressing.'<eos> 'And one final touch, a squash ball under the armpit.<eos> 'Apply enough pressure and it momentarily cuts off the pulse.'
What?<eos> You have groupies?<eos> Why don't I get groupies?<eos> Excuse me. Doctor waters, would you like to do a run through?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> I'll see you backstage.<eos> Alright.<eos> Important distinction, um...<eos> This created brain is self-sustaining.<eos> And it's capable of, er, of emotional expressivity.
I failed.<eos> Human emotion...<eos> It can contain illogical conflict.<eos> Can love someone.<eos> And yet hate the things that they've done.<eos> Machine can't reconcile that.<eos> Can you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does the virus work?<eos> Once it executes, it'll wipe out anything with the machine's code on it.
Welcome.<eos> Glad you're here.<eos> I think the real problem is how we get past the machine's defenses.<eos> Why don't we take out the solar field?<eos> Deprive it of its power and possibly slow it down.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't see how that's gonna work.<eos> He wants to upload me to him... its consciousness. Absolutely not.<eos> We inject the infected virus into my system and then I go back and let him upload me.<eos> There's a chance it won't detect it until it's too late.

That was the last time I saw my father.<eos> It turns out Beth, Mickey and Theo were right.<eos> A few weeks after I left, my dad got shitfaced drunk in a bar,<eos> and confessed to killing my mother.<eos> He hung himselfnin his jail cell with a sheet.<eos> Before he died, he revealed that my mother's body was in the freezer,<eos> and that he'd taken it out during the night while I was sleeping.<eos> He buried her up in the mountains.<eos> Since it'd been frozen for so long,<eos> her corpse decomposed freakishly fast, turning to liquid as it melted.
-Okay, sounds good.<eos> -Great! Last hug.<eos> Baymax!<eos> -Baymax! -Hey!<eos> Baymax!<eos> Baymax!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.<eos> I told you, it's broken.
Thank you.<eos> Ah, Manolo.<eos> Always giving away stuff for free.<eos> Right, dad?<eos> Joaquin's father, captain mondragon... Had passed away fighting the fearsome bandit... Known as chakal.<eos> Who's in there?<eos> Young sir, may I please have some of your bread?<eos> I'm so hungry.<eos> This bread is for my father.<eos> And it's delicious.
You stalked her, you threatened her... and you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized.<eos> Your wife is missing, and you came all this way to tell me this?<eos> I thought there might be another side to this story.<eos> Mr. Collings.<eos> Fuck.<eos> The missing persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne.<eos> She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the Amazing Amy kids' book series.<eos> You're reading that diary again?<eos> You know how it ends.<eos> It interests me.

" The end.<eos> Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it?<eos> It's private.

" The end.<eos> Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it?<eos> It's private.<eos> There's no one there.<eos> Why didn't he make sure it actually burned?
Knowing you were out there... was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years.<eos> Let's go to the police.<eos> You can explain everything.<eos> No, I can't turn up now.<eos> I'd be a pariah.<eos> Everyone would hate me.<eos> Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?<eos> He should go to prison for what he's done.<eos> I'm setting you up at my lake house.<eos> It's utterly secluded.
The van Hoytl?<eos> - Tax-free? - Can she do that?<eos> Who's Gustave H?<eos> I'm afraid that's me, darling.<eos> That fucking faggot!<eos> He's a concierge.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I've come to pay my respects to a great woman whom I loved.<eos> - This man is an intruder in my home!<eos> - It's not yours yet, Dmitri.
Dope.<eos> That looks like cum.<eos> That's cum.<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> Already got cum on the mattress, dawg.<eos> Welcome to college.<eos> Fuck, yeah.<eos> Hilarious shirt that signals we drink alcohol.<eos> Some bacon machine that my mom got me.<eos> I do not understand how it works.
Welcome to college.<eos> Fuck, yeah.<eos> Hilarious shirt that signals we drink alcohol.<eos> Some bacon machine that my mom got me.<eos> I do not understand how it works.<eos> It's true.<eos> Super high-Tech police gear.<eos> Carte Blanche with the budget, motherfucker.<eos> I'm going to veto that poster.<eos> It's a touch childish. Okay.
We jump street, and we about to jump in yo' ass.<eos> Right in the crack.<eos> Don't do it, leatherface.<eos> He's got the drugs!<eos> This is so boring.<eos> No one's getting shot.<eos> My God.<eos> Did you just get shot, like, right after I fucking said that?<eos> Can I have your gun?<eos> It's bigger.
I will be avenged.<eos> Dragon sickness ...<eos> I've seen it before.<eos> That look, the terrible need.<eos> It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.<eos> It sent his grandfather mad.<eos> Balin, if- if Thorin ... had the Arkenstone.<eos> Well, if- if it was found ... would it help ?<eos> That stone ... crowns all.<eos> It's the summit of this great wealth, bestowing power ... upon he who bears it.
But I haven't seen real paper since I was a girl.<eos> Only two kinds of people use paper...<eos> Romantics, and spies afraid of being hacked.<eos> There's certainly nothing romantic about oxygen logs.<eos> According to this, they haven't used oxygen in three months.<eos> Must be a hoax.<eos> Tastes like oxygen.<eos> Maybe they figured out a way to make it synthetically.<eos> Maybe they did...<eos> And maybe it poisoned them.
Sir, you need to implement section 361 immediately.<eos> Tell me exactly how one isolated explosion can mushroom into a quarantine of the Moon?<eos> Please.<eos> An entire colony of people is missing. There are reports of... Impossible biological entities.<eos> I personally witnessed a man disappear into thin air beneath the gaze of 10,000 de-socketed human eyeballs, and everyone here is breathing oxygen of an unknown origin.<eos> Now, Mr. secretary, whatever is causing all this is some kind of something that should be contained.<eos> The Earth cannot survive without the Moon, so you damn well better deliver me some answers soon and keep this quarantine quiet!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We keep thinking the flower's new.<eos> Maybe it's super-old, but it's just always fed off helium trapped deep down in the Moon.

Ladies and gentlemen of Yonville, you see before you your great doctor,<eos> Charles Bovary, who today will finally cure our poor crippled friend Hippolyte of his most ignominious of traits.<eos> You may come forward, but keep your calm.<eos> Remember.<eos> Some more brandy.<eos> Come, come, come.<eos> Take a good slug of that.<eos> - Good boy.<eos> - Monsieur Dubuc, if you would hold the box.<eos> It must not move.
I become totally out of control.<eos> God is actually works!<eos> Now I can go to my house.<eos> God, my remote control got stolen. Can you give it back?<eos> I want to go home.<eos> Sir, this God is gone out of battery.<eos> It does work but then it turns off.<eos> What do you mean ..?<eos> - I mean, put a new battery in it.<eos> It does not require any battery.
How much can a little God can help you?<eos> Can he catch the thief with His little legs?<eos> Go inside temple.<eos> There was a big God. Catch his bare feet. Run very fast.<eos> Take this coconuts, and some money to him. Your job will be done. Give me Rs. 200.<eos> Everyone was waiting for their turn carrying coconuts and money. Each one with his own task to be done.<eos> Two hours later, there was my turn.<eos> God, oh God.<eos> God, give me back my remote control.<eos> Where is it?
He stole my mango and that's that?<eos> pascal Faria?<eos> Mango?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Look, I've seen a ghost there.<eos> That house is haunted and evil!<eos> Is it Pedro?<eos> Is there a house that is haunted and friendly?<eos> I don't think we should mess with ghosts.<eos> If there is a ghost, it must be guarding a treasure.
You have to go with me!<eos> I will not put my family in danger again.<eos> Blu is my family, and I'm not leaving him behind.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Look, Eduardo, I might not be the birdliest bird in the flock... but, for once, that's actually a good thing.<eos> You know the jungle... I know humans.<eos> And I know that, together, we can stop them.<eos> We can't let them take our home.<eos> Sure, it's hot and loud and filled with creepy bugs... but it's ours.
Hello?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Where are we?<eos> Pacific Palisades.<eos> How did you find this place?<eos> Wasn't easy.<eos> It's--<eos> - It's-- - Fucking beautiful. Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it's ours, for like a month.
Can I have a turn?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Careful, or the bridge will be over here.<eos> You can lower the gates, can't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Switch tracks.<eos> - This one.<eos> Wait.<eos> Stop for a second.<eos> Can it pull this?
What the hell was that?<eos> You never talk to her like that.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Jen!<eos> I got a guy who beats his wife's face in, in front of their kid, and the next day he's back home.<eos> All right.<eos> I got a lady who throws her kid into a ravine.<eos> You want another one?<eos> Last week, an alleyway off Buck Street, first call of the night, I pull a baby out of the bottom of a dumpster.<eos> I'm giving it mouth-to-mouth.<eos> It's already dead.
Great.<eos> I... have been in that house.<eos> Yeah, well, now I live there.<eos> I'm Sam.<eos> Why are you crying, Sam?<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't like that question.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's empty.

So you like Latin music, huh?<eos> - The mix tape.<eos> - Oh, right, the mix, yes.<eos> Oh, I am a Latino boy big time, I am, music wise.<eos> Thanks for listening to that.<eos> It was a real labour of love for me.<eos> That track at the end of side one, oh...<eos> Oh, shoot, that's the...<eos> That's my favourite track.<eos> - Isn't it just so er... tracky?

"Brings undesirable personalities under control... that can either be assimilated or annihilated."<eos> These personalities may be undesirable to you... but they're my friends.<eos> Most of 'em.<eos> "Side effects may include cardiac arrhythmia... memory loss, seizures and incontinence."<eos> You piss your pants?<eos> Have you-Have you even read this?<eos> Isn't it time you went home?<eos> For some reason, the part of me that goes for you ducks out for the small talk... and leaves me to pick up the wet patches.<eos> This machine isn't gonna help you.<eos> It's gonna make you boring like everybody else.
No one knows what their real face looks like anymore.<eos> - It's all fake.<eos> - I have to get out of here.<eos> No.<eos> And go where?<eos> Out there with the mundanes?<eos> They're all fakes, Suki.<eos> They're all photocopies.<eos> Sinclair tried to make you one of them by killing the best part of you.<eos> But he started something his machine can't stop 'cause it works for us now.
The instability of the child care system would have been fuel to fire.<eos> She probably adopted an identity for each new situation.<eos> Eventually she fell through one of the cracks and ended up here.<eos> - And when was that?<eos> - Four years ago.<eos> And nobody's come looking for her?<eos> Nobody wants her.<eos> Some of her identities can be a bit wild.<eos> Is this IQ score a typo?<eos> It's higher than mine.
- Who's Veronica Orr?<eos> - That is a confidential file, Suki.<eos> This is patient number 99.<eos> I heard you on the phone.<eos> - You lost her.<eos> - I didn't lose her.<eos> Give me the file.<eos> What, she was on the machine too?<eos> It was a different kind of machine.<eos> It didn't work.
Alice!<eos> First the hens, then the rooster.<eos> I'm coming back for you, boy.<eos> I did this to you. It's my fault. Leave her alone.<eos> God made me this way, Hogan.<eos> I'm sure he knew what he was doing.<eos> They say you find out who you really are on the way down.<eos> But I've already seen it.<eos> The Scribbler's machine shows you everything.<eos> It wakes up parts of the brain that we never use.
Drop the weapon!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> I've got him!<eos> I've got it under control!<eos> You are a coward, Lonely Wolf.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - What's up?<eos> What's going on?<eos> And the wolf... where did it come from?
Forget her!<eos> I dumped her ass last night 'cause I want you.<eos> Well, I don't want you!<eos> I've been happier in the last three months than any day of our marriage.<eos> Okay, I can feel the breeze from your charade.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Look, I'm done.<eos> If you have anything to say, say it to my lawyer.<eos> You have a lawyer already?<eos> It's the guy Matt's ex-wife used.
- No.<eos> What do I tell Sean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> That's what you tell him.<eos> I can't just lie.<eos> First of all, not lying. It's omitting.<eos> There is a huge difference between omitting and lying.<eos> That said, I also believe in lying.<eos> I don't want to start our new lives with this giant secret.<eos> - So, it was giant?
Don't do it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, you be good.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> No, I...<eos> No. Take this.<eos> Pookie, I can't take your crack.<eos> It's worth about $10 on the street.
You wanna sell me crack?<eos> Well, I technically don't wanna sell it because I think that that's wrong.<eos> But I was hoping that maybe make a return or something.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> A return.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got the receipt?<eos> The... Uh...<eos> Or maybe the box it came in?
I shall cogitate upon it.<eos> Thank you. Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's that Mr Haydon.<eos> He's brought a cold blast of air in with him.<eos> Mr Haydon, to what do I owe the honour of your presence this morning?<eos> I trust that this is not an inconvenience to you, Turner.<eos> Now, will you accept ten pounds?<eos> - Ten pounds, sir?<eos> - I wish to be free of the debt.<eos> - It weighs heavily upon me.
Anyone?<eos> Clank, help us!<eos> Down here!<eos> Clank!<eos> In here!<eos> In the box!<eos> - Ms. Bell?<eos> - Help, we're stuck.<eos> Right.<eos> How does it open?
Is this because of the sods?<eos> The city treats trees like they're an animated objects.<eos> - I am sorry, they were.<eos> - So you're just gonna... buy another house?<eos> Well, we can't keep living in the Four Seasons forever.<eos> But how can you afford this?<eos> How can anyone afford anything?<eos> I mean is not like you two recently came into a lot of money, did you?<eos> Yeah, did you?<eos> We're not gonna buy it, it's out of our range.
Is that a severed penis?<eos> Always about the client.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Some chilled Veuve Clicquot for the returning honeymooners.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Karl with a "K" was quite simply the personification of total client satisfaction.<eos> - What about her?<eos> - She's dead.<eos> But, uh, I got you a blueberry muffin.<eos> It's on the seat.
Cocaine is my first and longest-standing love, but I would be equally lost without good Scotch whiskey and sadomasochism.<eos> I want you to try something when you have a free moment.<eos> You just make a fist, and hit yourself in the face as hard as you can.<eos> I swear to God, you will find it so fucking freeing.<eos> It is like...<eos> It is like stepping off a cliff.<eos> ...Holy shit!<eos> - There it is.<eos> - You okay back there?<eos> That metallic taste, it's tremendous!
Ah, fuck!<eos> Stretch!<eos> - All right.<eos> - You are going to jail.<eos> The police put out a warrant for your arrest.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where...<eos> Where's the limo?<eos> - Driving down Sunset with me.<eos> - It's running?
What?<eos> I'm telling you, the ice is gonna break.<eos> I can fucking hear it.<eos> I can see the crack.<eos> It's not going to break!<eos> Don't come near me.<eos> Ivan, you have to trust me now, okay?<eos> No, stay there.<eos> Please, please stop!<eos> Ivan, it's not going to break.
Yes, all right.<eos> Yeah, come in.<eos> Clem, hello.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - I noticed this discolouration on my arm.<eos> I thought it was the flesh-eating virus, but the infirmary says it's just a dry patch.<eos> Well, better luck next time.<eos> But the good news is,<eos> I have now finished your completed script, and...<eos> It's brilliant.
Sit down.<eos> Why did you write this?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Well, what was the thing that made you want to write this story?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - OK.<eos> Your favourite film, Dirty Dancing, what's that about?<eos> A girl who learns to dance and falls in love.<eos> Yes.<eos> But isn't it about more than that?
- What do you mean?<eos> - Well, what was the thing that made you want to write this story?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - OK.<eos> Your favourite film, Dirty Dancing, what's that about?<eos> A girl who learns to dance and falls in love.<eos> Yes.<eos> But isn't it about more than that?<eos> Isn't it about a girl named Baby who discovers that she is in fact becoming a woman?<eos> Isn't it about lost innocence?
That's just the way I put it.<eos> What I meant is I want to go to bed with you.<eos> And?<eos> "And" what?<eos> How do you find the idea?<eos> Good.<eos> I want you.<eos> I'm glad to hear that.<eos> I'd also like to see your penis.<eos> I'm glad to hear that. It'd probably be hard to avoid.
Any medications?<eos> - Statin.<eos> It's for high cholesterol.<eos> - Statin's okay.<eos> Have you ever been under a general anesthetic?<eos> Yes, and no complications.<eos> I think that's enough questions, yeah?<eos> Oh, he's just going through the checklist, sir... which, legend has it, you wrote.<eos> Great to see you, Thomas.<eos> Hey. Now get this appendix the hell out of me before it blows.
It's legit.<eos> No.<eos> Just, um... no.<eos> Charlie.<eos> No! I'm not buying your crystal for you, Oliver.<eos> Malcolm mentioned an issue with your hand.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Alex, everything hangs on your ability to stretch his wife's omentum from her stomach to her brain.<eos> Not to worry.<eos> It's very malleable, stretches like dough.
Is that gay?<eos> Well, as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Everything That's Gay, that's pretty gay.<eos> It's not gay. Oh, it's pretty gay.<eos> No it's not. Yeah.<eos> That's the point.<eos> That's pretty gay.<eos> If I was gay, I'd just ram that jolly dildo right up my stupid asshole.<eos> Thatta girl.<eos> It's because I'm straight and I know that I got this big black dildo in my desk drawer...<eos> Oh, it's black.
Thatta girl.<eos> It's because I'm straight and I know that I got this big black dildo in my desk drawer...<eos> Oh, it's black.<eos> You have a desk?<eos> You see? It's long.<eos> It should say on the dildo<eos> "From the desk of Jim Norton. "<eos> I've never known a guy to have a vibrator. How do you...<eos> A vibrator makes you come?<eos> Oh, it makes me come so good.
Otherwise the deal': off, and then you're stuck with them.<eos> Do what you want with them.<eos> The load arrived, you know.<eos> Use them as... what are they called 'I<eos> Scarecrow: !<eos> Fucking stamp this !<eos> Well, ma'am, you pleased lo be going lo the dam 'I<eos> And the bear 'I<eos> It's difficult to get close to a bear.<eos> You've been here a while now, if it was around, you'd have found it.
-That's fantastic, Travis.<eos> Yeah, and Dustin is heading up Model UN soon to be Rhodes Scholar and who knows what else.<eos> And Jim, teacher of the year.<eos> -Well, hey, listen--<eos> -I mean, come on.<eos> The talent at this table, that is stunning.<eos> -And Andy, with your drumming.<eos> -It's going okay, Andy?<eos> Yeah, it's going really, really well, actually.<eos> I'm part of Shaffer's top jazz orchestra which means it's the best in the country.
What is--?<eos> You said Jayvees?<eos> No, it's JVC. It's like a-<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, okay,<eos> Well, I don't know if I can come, I-- I'll have to check with my boyfriend,<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll check, but I don't know,<eos> I don't really think he likes jazz music,<eos> Yeah, I mean, it's not for everybody.
I had three.<eos> Gloomy, Ruddy and Pickle.<eos> The bathrooms gone!<eos> Yes, it's upstairs now.<eos> We expanded the living room. It's handier and sunnier as we often eat here.<eos> What a pity. From the tub, you could see the oak.<eos> The oak!<eos> Why did you chop it down?<eos> To get the afternoon light.<eos> It was 300 years old!
Well, uh...<eos> Maybe we should all go out for a drink or something.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> That sounds great, except I can't.<eos> I've got a wig fitting.<eos> My pilot starts tomorrow.<eos> She's stealing the wardrobe.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Uh, I didn't know you had a pilot. Mm-hmm.<eos> What's it about?
You don't have to audition.<eos> No shit?<eos> You just have to go in and meet.<eos> And I don't have to read?<eos> And you don't have to read. All right.<eos> I'm thinking it's time to stop taking the meds.<eos> It would be a huge mistake to stop now.<eos> I cannot stress this enough.<eos> Aah!<eos> This script isn't going to you. It isn't going to Fox.
I've also got Carol rance here.<eos> Kim wants to come over, too.<eos> No!<eos> This is fun.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll call back if anything changes.<eos> Nothing is going to change.<eos> Aren't you going to get that?<eos> We never use that phone.<eos> It came with the house.
Versus coffee being a process that you get to watch and participate in... and then somebody hands it to you.<eos> It tends to be more beautiful.<eos> And that's a huge symbolic change.<eos> The great thing about improving your coffee brewing... is that it's not subtle.<eos> Once you get something that's really good, vibrant and well-made... it's hard to go back.<eos> Even though we see in the U.S. a lot of popularity... with brewed, filter, pour-over drip coffee... espresso is still captivating a new audience.<eos> Espresso is not a drink. It's a kind of drug.<eos> That's why my espresso is less than one ounce.<eos> Sometimes it's a half-ounce.<eos> Doesn't matter if it's bigger or small... most important is invited to the other world.
The elevator shaft.<eos> It's more detailed than the model for the contest.<eos> It's got a great view of the fjord.<eos> Eleven stories tall at the most.<eos> That's the old office building.<eos> We couldn't tear it down.<eos> Now it's completely integrated.<eos> It slopes down.<eos> If you go further down, you can feel the portal.<eos> It lifts it.
There's record rainfall in Albuquerque, hail in the Panhandle and three major rivers cresting.<eos> Something is definitely altering this planet's weather.<eos> And you think it's this Touchstone?<eos> - Kind of a reach, isn't it?<eos> - Not really, if you think about it.<eos> Whoever left that device on Madrona probably keyed it to its atmospheric conditions.<eos> Somebody brings it back to Earth, starts fiddling around with it and... who knows?<eos> !<eos> - We don't know it's on Earth.<eos> - I'm thinking it is.
What are the odds of that?<eos> - I said, "Yes."<eos> - What?<eos> I said, "Yes."<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Come here!<eos> Wow.<eos> Let's have a look at that ring.<eos> It's beautiful.
What's the use of mending a man if he's to be broken within a few hours past mending?<eos> Death falls upon the innocent and the guilty alike, Oswin.<eos> And it's with us always.<eos> Never let that shake your faith in the hereafter.<eos> There is no arrow cleaves the soul.<eos> What is this terrible smell?<eos> Lt's my potion, Brother.<eos> Your potion?<eos> The one Mistress Vernold bought for me at the fair from a sweet old dame.<eos> It's to sustain a man from dusk till dawn.
Shall we look for something simpler?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We have this very pretty, simple model, very girlish.<eos> That suits you.<eos> Are you pregnant, Mona?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Too much wine last night.<eos> Do you like the dress?<eos> - Mmm... it's really pretty.
I'm yelling, throwing things.<eos> I said, "we don't have a child together.<eos> You have a child, not me."<eos> You, selfish sonovabitch!<eos> She ain't mine, goddamit!<eos> I think that's what Cassie heard.<eos> In the morning, I went down to the room, she was gone.<eos> A couple of weeks went by.<eos> We got a letter.<eos> It was from here, Montreal.
Marvellous!<eos> And now you are dressed for a ball.<eos> And you will learn to dance for one as well.<eos> Dimitri... I'm... I'm not very good at it.<eos> And...<eos> One, two, three. One, two, three.<eos> No. Anya, you don't lead. Let him.<eos> That dress is really beautiful.<eos> - Do you think so? - Yes.<eos> It was nice on the hanger, but it looks even better on you.
I have the keys right here in my pocket.<eos> Would you like to see it?<eos> Who are you, dear lady?<eos> On second thought, you're way too old for me.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Please...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Come on.<eos> Show me how the satellites work.<eos> First I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard then I will pull Batman's heart from his body and feel it freeze in my hands.
Maybe a friend'll let you use his place.<eos> You're always bitching about your sex life.<eos> I'm trying to help.<eos> I tell her you gave me the number?<eos> Not my name!<eos> Don't use your real name.<eos> Of course.<eos> Not the real name.<eos> You borrow a friend's apartment, you use his name.<eos> That way it'll be on the bell.
The crime world`s after me.<eos> All the money I`m throwing at her is just empty promises.<eos> You don`t know the PBC.<eos> Pasta Basica Cocaina.<eos> The PBC Cartel ?<eos> Peru, Bolivia, Colombia.<eos> You`re walking a tight rope in Sphere No 2.<eos> Be a good boy and we won`t eliminate you from the program.<eos> Public opinion hates forgers.<eos> It hates people playing with their petty secrets !
We're bueno?<eos> Pleasure doing business with you caballeros.<eos> Oh, Columbia, the gem of the ocean The home of the brave and the free<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> What are you doing? You want to throw me in the pool?<eos> You got the balls?<eos> He hasn't made a pick yet.<eos> Forget those dogs.<eos> Hey, you know, if you took my blood pressure right now, it'd be down 100%.
Mr. President?<eos> Priest Vito Cornelius, expert of astrophenomenon.<eos> I... have a different theory to offer you, sir.<eos> You have 20 seconds.<eos> Imagine that this... thing is not anything that can be identified... because it prefers not to be.<eos> Wherever there is life... it brings death... because it's evil.<eos> Absolute evil.<eos> One more reason to shoot first.<eos> Evil begets evil, Mr. President.<eos> Shooting will only make it stronger.
- I'm cold.<eos> - So am I.<eos> - I hate you.<eos> - Hate me if you want, but you must obey me.<eos> I won't.<eos> I'll die fýrst.<eos> Hmm. How will you die?<eos> I'll drown myself in the lake.<eos> - How will you make your body stay underwater?<eos> - It just will.
It's--<eos> - Professor, it's gone!<eos> It is!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> Professor, I think you gave it a little too much free will.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> There's not a darn thing to be afraid of, pal.<eos> How can anything get in your window?<eos> It's closed, okay?
Of course, nobody knows how much there is.<eos> I guess we could take as much as we want.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> All those things are true.<eos> I mean, it's not like the money belongs to anybody.<eos> - That would be one point of view.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Except it's not a point of view shared by the A.T.F.<eos> Once we make this evidence, it belongs to us.
You stand on the beach and taste the salty smell of the wind that comes from the ocean, and inside you feel the warmth of never ending freedom,<eos> and on your lips the bitter, tear- soaked kiss of your lover.<eos> I have never been to the ocean.<eos> That can't be true!<eos> You have never ever been to the ocean?<eos> Never - ever!<eos> Both of us are knocking on heavens door, drinking tequila we are biting-the-dust experts and you have never - ever been to the ocean!<eos> Never - ever!<eos> Don't you know how it is when you arrive in heaven?<eos> In heaven that's all they talk about - the ocean - and how wonderful it is.
So...<eos> Don't give up<eos> Full stop,inverted comma<eos> I read it again, wait a minute<eos> "Just like tears..." I havn't finished it yet Like tears gush...<eos> My words gush...<eos> I have to stop words Like words disappear<eos> Or stay in the eyepit<eos> I lay on the bed welcome it first words begin to coruscate a poem soon is finished<eos> Under the sky full of stars it can console people's sentimental heart so don't give up
My hips do the dips My belly has turned to jelly My chest is not at its best<eos> What about magnesium?<eos> You can try it.<eos> I'll prescribe you some.<eos> There again, magnesium settles or it doesn't.<eos> We don't know much about it.<eos> Two tests a few days apart can give totally different results.<eos> What do you expect me to tell you?<eos> What about my low blood pressure?<eos> True, it is a bit low but it could rise again in the next ten minutes.
Come on in.<eos> May I, Harv?<eos> Sure.<eos> Sit down.<eos> This lawsuit bothers me, Mr. Baylor.<eos> I wouldn't use the word "frivolous", but I'm not impressed with the merits of it to be Frank.<eos> In fact, I'm really tired of these type of lawsuits.<eos> I'm inclined to grant the motion to dismiss.<eos> Now, you can refile it in federal court, you know, take it somewhere else.<eos> I don't want it clogging up my docket.
Emma, you don't know what you're dealing with here.<eos> What?<eos> - They took my pills.<eos> - No, they didn't.<eos> I palmed them from your purse.<eos> I need one or two.<eos> I need...<eos> I have a bad heart.<eos> - I know.<eos> - It's starting to pound.
Matthew Truman.<eos> These meetings are unlawful!<eos> MAN: If we had decent wages...<eos> If there are any more, Major Sharpe and his men will break them up and arrest all those attending.<eos> No!<eos> Well, where is it?<eos> Rossendale's estate, man.<eos> I don't think you should get involved.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Where is it?
You promised you would not fight again.<eos> You fought a duel.<eos> Then you left me on my own.<eos> I did not leave you.<eos> I came back from battle and you were gone.<eos> You went to London.<eos> You took a peacock for a lover.<eos> - You emptied my bank accounts.<eos> - You broke your promise.<eos> That promise was foolish and I am sorry for breaking it, but it does not balance up what you did to me.
Really?<eos> Interesting role model.<eos> According to Eastern philosophy, the body has seven chakra points.<eos> Energy centers, like the heart or genitals.<eos> The purpose of these implements is to probe those organs... inflicting the maximum amount of pain... whilst keeping the victim alive for as long as possible.<eos> Dr. Kaufman's record was 52 hours.<eos> I'm hoping to break it.<eos> I would've thought watching your TV shows was torture enough.<eos> Save this one till last.<eos> When you remove Mr. Bond's heart... there should be just enough time for him to watch it stop beating.
In Madrid, we'll do something more final.<eos> More talking, lots of close-ups, lots of emotion and tears.<eos> People love that.<eos> We'll need the boy, of course.<eos> -But what do we get out of this?<eos> -Popularity, and money.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> We'll touch the hearts of the whole country.<eos> Heaven is everything which I cannot reach.<eos> The apple on the tree if it is not within arm's reach.
There is a continuum between material and idea.<eos> The figurative arts operate in the vicinity of alchemy.<eos> Alchemy strives after the irreducible qualities of a thing.<eos> In the alchemical view, Gold is a combination of yellowness, specific weight, flexibility, malleability, and so on.<eos> If one could induce an element that embodied all these qualities, one would have gold.<eos> In the seventeenth century, during the height of Still Life painting, arrived the modern natural sciences.<eos> Their discoveries would become the basis for an immense profusion of new objects.<eos> For every need, for every distress, a new object shall provide the remedy. Just as each age has its own kind of divinity.<eos> The new natural sciences abandoned their attempts to produce gold but art did not.<eos> It sought after truth in appearances.
That's perfect.<eos> And if we cache it as a vertical shot?<eos> That's great.<eos> - Yes, just right.<eos> It's great!<eos> The word 'fetish' - originally a Portuguese term - arrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century at the height of Still Life painting.<eos> Sailors reported that along the African coasts there were cults which worshipped arbitrarily chosen objects as divinities.<eos> Fetishes - things which posses something divine that is beyond meaning.<eos> Three centuries later in 1906 Marcell Mauss writes:<eos> "The term 'fetish' must be definitively abandoned, it corresponds precisely to nothing."
INDEED, HER FIANCE IS EXPECTED ANY DAY.<eos> I SEE WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE.<eos> WE'RE UNUSED TO THESE THINGS AND WE HAD NO THOUGHT THEN OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.<eos> MISS FAIRLIE, IT WAS IN ANY CASE MADNESS FOR A TUTOR TO ENTERTAIN SUCH HOPES<eos> AND I GRATEFULLY ACCEPT THE OFFER OF FRIENDSHIP.<eos> IN MY DEFENSE, I CAN ONLY SWEAR IT IS THE FIRST TIME A PERSONAL SYMPATHY EVER ENCROACHED IN MY TEACHING.<eos> Marian:<eos> I CANNOT GET THE SHAPE OF THE CHURCH.<eos> I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A GOOD LIKENESS OF THIS PLACE.<eos> IT IS VERY DEAR TO US.
WE MUST BRING HER FOOD AND CLOTHING.<eos> I WILL LOOK OUT FOR SOME OF MY OWN.<eos> SHE HAD SUCH SADNESS.<eos> SHE'S FREE.<eos> BUT AT WHAT COST, LAURA?<eos> DOES IT MATTER, MARIAN?<eos> AT LEAST SHE CAN MOVE ON FROM THOSE WHO ABUSE HER.<eos> AND SO CAN YOU.<eos> MY LETTER WAS IN THE POST THIS MORNING.<eos> BY TOMORROW IT WILL BE WITH GILMORE
That was incredible.<eos> It's Kenshin's original sword-drawing technique.<eos> Why didn't you cut me?<eos> In honor of the men I killed,<eos> I vowed to never use my sword to kill anyone ever again.<eos> That's how I atone for them.<eos> Gentatsu...<eos> Shigure, I love the blue sky over Mount Bandai.<eos> I do too.<eos> The blue sky must be high and clear no matter how far away it is.
Kenshin...<eos> Shigure!<eos> Shigure!<eos> Mr. Shigure!<eos> Mr. Shigure!<eos> Shigure!<eos> Toki, are you there?<eos> I am.<eos> I am right here.<eos> Gentatsu, the blue sky has to be high and clear, no matter how far away it is.
Yes, and someday I want to teach this story to my students.<eos> They should know how people felt during the Bakumatsu.<eos> They might grow up to create the world Shigure dreamed of.<eos> One in which no blood is shed.<eos> I hope you'll visit his grave soon.<eos> I most definitely will.<eos> When the flowers are in bloom, let's all visit his grave together.<eos> Yeah! Good idea!<eos> Be careful!<eos> The blue sky should be high and clear no matter how far away it is.
Sometimes, when you hold out for everything you walk away with nothing.<eos> Remember that the next time a fat man asks you for advice.<eos> ALLY: Why can 't I give advice to whoever?<eos> I mean, I obviously have love all figured out.<eos> I don't know what else you could have done.<eos> Maybe I have encouraged him to hold out for the illusion of marriage and the reality is he could end up alone.<eos> If he doesn't love her...<eos> He does.<eos> She just doesn't make his heart bounce.<eos> It should.
Good, captain.<eos> Then we can proceed.<eos> Anything new from the hyperspace probes?<eos> They picked up something minutes ago, but it's hard to get a fix.<eos> - Is it Sheridan?<eos> - We can't be sure, but it's possible.<eos> - Do we go in after him?<eos> - Negative.<eos> Every engagement in hyperspace has turned into a disaster for both sides.<eos> It's too volatile.
- I thought we agreed...<eos> I can't have you giving your life energy and operating this machine at the same time.<eos> What happens if you pass out during the process?<eos> Lt'll just keep taking your life energy until you're dead, correct?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Even this brief exposure, a few seconds apiece confirms that the alien healing device is extremely dangerous and should not be used again.<eos> Even under extreme conditions until we can control it more precisely or it will result in the death of whoever uses it.<eos> It was, after all, designed as a means of capital punishment.<eos> It does this by transferring life energy from one person to another.
I imagine that we'll only hold him as long as we hold you.<eos> But, of course, that means that as long as you continue to resist we can't let him go.<eos> - You've been interrogated before.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Anyone I know?<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Well, it's certainly strange you don't seem to know the rules.<eos> Perhaps I should explain them in case you've forgotten.<eos> This is your confession.<eos> It goes on at some length.
His blood is pure.<eos> You've tasted it.<eos> I'm your faithful dog.<eos> You bring me scraps.<eos> I... I didn't mean...<eos> I have waited.<eos> For 3 score years I have waited.<eos> here in this house of... worship.<eos> My ascension is almost at hand.<eos> Pray that when it comes, I'm in a better mood.
There were seven of these guys.<eos> I've killed six.<eos> If I can get the last one, the curse will be lifted and I'll be free.<eos> I'm sure it's someone in that stupid talent show.<eos> But now the demon will be moving on.<eos> - So if someone's missing from the show<eos> - We'll know who our demon is.<eos> - The show!<eos> - What?<eos> It's going to start!
But HoHos are a vital part of my cognitive process.<eos> Sorry, Xand.<eos> Someplace I have to be.<eos> Buffy!<eos> He is passing under our feet right now.<eos> No worries.<eos> We're close to decoding the manuscript.<eos> We just need a bit more time.<eos> Time is ours.<eos> It brings the Slayer closer to them.
You, too.<eos> Can you hand me a towel, Ray?<eos> Ray?<eos> Amy, help me look.<eos> -I just came by....<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> -My engagement ring.<eos> I might not be the best person to help.<eos> I've spent the last 10 years looking for an engagement ring.<eos> It couldn't have just disappeared.
Happy, you know....<eos> These are beautiful.<eos> I cried, too.<eos> Roses are twice as much on Valentine's Day.<eos> Listen, Ray...<eos> I have something to tell you.<eos> I've looked everywhere, but I....<eos> I think I've lost my engagement ring.<eos> All right, don't worry.<eos> I'm sure it will turn up.
They always use Maris' spa day to play hooky.<eos> I just hope she hasn't changed the locks.<eos> What do you know?<eos> You know, this is sort of exciting.<eos> Even as a child, I always fancied I might make a first-rate society cat burglar.<eos> I think I'm right.<eos> Yes.<eos> All it takes is stealth, cunning and a key to the door.<eos> The letter should be over here with the rest of Maris' unopened mail.<eos> Yeah, there it is.
It's delicious.<eos> You own an Italian restaurant, and you think that tastes good?<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Lebanon.<eos> Hand me those tomatoes.<eos> I'll show you what it should taste like.<eos> How long will this take?<eos> I got another critic to yell at.<eos> Joanna, I want to talk about that interview.<eos> I thought it went very well.
It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up".<eos> Oversized bracelets, oversized earrings oversizing of accessories, in general, is very popular now.<eos> Can I borrow this?<eos> My milk's gone bad.<eos> I hate that.<eos> I once had a thing of half-and-half.<eos> Stole my car.<eos> So how was your date with Ginger?<eos> Great.<eos> It was great.
L don't know why I thought he could manage a fishing boat.<eos> L don't know what possessed him.<eos> He just had this thing in his head about getting right out... into the open... as far as possible.<eos> What nine years in a steel cage do for you!<eos> And they think it happened when?<eos> Some time on Thursday?<eos> That's where his diary finished.<eos> First thing Thursday morning.<eos> He left a message on my machine on Monday afternoon.<eos> It sounded fairly urgent, but... I didn't have a number for him.
- No, but that's one problem.<eos> Why?<eos> I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day...<eos> Walking around naked?<eos> That is not a good look for a man.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's a good look for a woman.<eos> Well, female body is a work of art.<eos> The male body is utilitarian.<eos> It's for getting around.
But I choose the Commander.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Mr. Worf thinks very highly of you, General.<eos> I think very highly of him.<eos> Then I can't think of a better man for the job if you'll take it.<eos> I would be honored.<eos> Ops to Sisko.<eos> Sisko here.<eos> You're receiving an incoming message.<eos> It's from Dukat.
Whatever they are they are coming right at us.<eos> Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.<eos> You still haven't lost them.<eos> I know that.<eos> There are four more Jem'Hadar ships in close pursuit and at least two ahead of us on an intercept course.<eos> We must warn the station.<eos> There is only one reason for the Dominion to hide such a large fleet this close to the wormhole.<eos> You think they're planning to attack the Alpha Quadrant?<eos> I'm certain of it.<eos> Your message is transmitting but it's hard to tell if it's getting through all this interference.
Thanks.<eos> You always know just the right thing to say.<eos> How's my baby boy?<eos> He recognized me.<eos> Did he?<eos> Hold on... I'm getting a priority one distress signal from the Gamma Quadrant.<eos> Dax to Sisko.<eos> You better come out here.<eos> What is it?<eos> I've got a message from Worf, but it's badly garbled.
Tain.<eos> What is wrong with him?<eos> It's his heart.<eos> Really?<eos> There are many people who'd say he doesn't have one.<eos> He was convinced that you would come.<eos> He knew I had no choice.<eos> Tain.<eos> Tain, I'm here.<eos> My message... it got through?
I'm trying to block them out... but I can't.<eos> Every time she has a vision, specific regions of her cerebral cortex go into a state of hyper-stimulation-- memory engrams, perceptual centers.<eos> I can't be sure, but I think there's more going on here than just a simple"hello."<eos> Enhance this grid.<eos> I want to take a closer look at the detonator.<eos> We must analyze the bioship.<eos> Your data.<eos> You're human, aren't you?<eos> This body was assimilated 18 years ago.<eos> It ceased to be human at that time.
That "autonomic response" caused this drone to reset back to its original programming.<eos> If the rest of those corpses somehow reactivate-- we'd have a major problem on our hands.<eos> I'm afraid he's getting worse.<eos> There must be something we can do for him.<eos> You know better than anyone how limited our medical resources are.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, there is only one option.<eos> Would it be safe?<eos> Would... what be safe?<eos> As I'm sure you're aware, the Borg collective consciousness is extremely powerful.<eos> It allowed us to transfer information instantaneously-- to think with one mind.
Gentlemen, please.<eos> Believe me, we're not conspiring against you.<eos> Captain, there's a spatial distortion heading toward us.<eos> Whatever it is, it's huge-- five light-years across and it's expanding.<eos> Tracking its origin.<eos> A vessel near the Zahl homeworld.<eos> What?<eos> It appears to be a massive buildup of temporal energy-- some kind of space-time shock wave.<eos> Tom?<eos> It's destabilizing our warp field.
- What's the other thing?<eos> Striated muscle tissue.<eos> - What's unusual about that?<eos> - In and of itself, nothing.<eos> - Where I found it, however...<eos> - Where did you find it?<eos> Everywhere. His entire body.<eos> This man has a thin stratum of voluntary muscle tissue... ..underpinning the entire dermal layer of his skin.<eos> That's not normal. This man's body is quite a scientific specimen.<eos> And thankfully, it's preserved and intact.
Either way, we'll find out what you know about it.<eos> It's a kind of catalyst.<eos> - A catalyst for what?<eos> - A self-sustaining endothermic reaction.<eos> It's a rapid freezing agent.<eos> Something Jason's been engineering for years.<eos> See, when a cell freezes, its moisture forms into ice crystals, which literally grind up the cell from the inside out.<eos> But extreme rapid freezing causes a smoother, glass-like structure to form, so the cell can survive being thawed, at least according to Jason's theory.<eos> This compound, has Jason actually tested it yet?<eos> He hasn't tested it yet because it doesn't exist, except in the computer.
Not all the teeth.<eos> The top teeth are okay.<eos> But the bottom teeth, look.<eos> Ugly, right?<eos> Well, that.<eos> There, see?<eos> I knew it.<eos> I'm a lot better-looking with a suntan.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> Shouldn't look at my face when it's relaxed.
handball£¬ all right.<eos> I was way off there.<eos> Hi£¬ listen£¬ I brought you some whole milk.<eos> I think you could use some calcium in this house.<eos> -What?<eos> -Don't be alarmed£¬ dear.<eos> It's just that when I was here this morning£¬ the twins looked bow-Iegged.<eos> Thank you£¬ Marie£¬ but we have milk.<eos> No£¬ I threw it out.<eos> It smelled questionable.
Drinking's the only vice I have left.<eos> If I gave that up, what'd be left?<eos> It's fresh.<eos> Jasmine.<eos> This is your adopted grandson?<eos> Son, daughter, who cares. It's an extra pair of hands.<eos> Better than being on my own.<eos> True.<eos> Heard you refused Master Liang's offer.<eos> It wouldn't exactly have been a piece of cake.
You're always pushing me away.<eos> Oh, will you look at this shirt?<eos> It's a rag!<eos> No matter how many shirts I send him, he only wears this one.<eos> You look awful.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Val's getting married.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> I got pork roast for dinner.<eos> I wanted to get filet mignon, but it's so expensive.
Elinor Galash has been fucking pilots for two years.<eos> You've gotta learn to see the hints people transmit.<eos> Be sensitive to what's going on around you.<eos> It'll help you personally.<eos> I'll bring the matches, and you'll bring the spray.<eos> (in English) OK.<eos> Bring black.<eos> They'll put us into "Catastrophes in Israel".<eos> This is the westernmost tree in the forest.<eos> It carries virus zero.
Go aheah, man.<eos> Tell her what you saw.<eos> Chambers emptied his freezer, and put his wife in it.<eos> I know he did.<eos> Did you see Caroline Chambers body in the freezer?<eos> Well...<eos> I didn't see her body in the freezer.<eos> -What?<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> But I know it's in there, because he's got this stuff on the floor and it's melting
On this night<eos> On this night<eos> On this night of a thousand stars Let me take you to heaven's door Where the music of love's guitars<eos> Plays forever more<eos> Your act hasn't changed much<eos> Neither has yours<eos> I stand here as a servant of the people<eos> As we come together for a marvelous cause<eos> You've shown by your presence, your deeds and applause<eos> What the people can do, true power is yours Not the government's, unless it represents the people
Can you run the bloods?<eos> Look at this.<eos> On his wrist.<eos> All right, so we've got a hospital wristband.<eos> Hold him. Hold him!<eos> No name, no hospital.<eos> Anyone seen one of these?<eos> Silver.<eos> Pressure's 90 over palp and dropping.<eos> Where's it going?
And every verse needs to have 12 syllables.<eos> 12 syllables?<eos> Yes, 12 syllables.<eos> Listen:<eos> It's not in wealth that your attraction lies, your sparkling charms, your soft, yet flashing eyes, your airs, your graces, it is these in which my ravished heart perceives you to be rich.<eos> These treasure only I want to possess.<eos> Lies rhymes with eyes.<eos> Which rhymes with rich.<eos> A vowel is missing.<eos> Yes, it follows in the next verse:
Go! Son of a bitch.<eos> What the fuck was goin' on in there?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Why, out of all the godforsaken shitholes in Mexico, do we have to meet here?<eos> One place is just as good as another.<eos> You ever been here before? No.<eos> Ah, I drove by it a couple times.<eos> It's a rowdy place. It's out in the middle of nowhere. There'll be no cops.<eos> And it's open from dusk till dawn.
Oh, the blues ain't nothing but a woman crying for a man.<eos> I said the blues ain't nothing but a woman loving a married man.<eos> The blues ain't nothing<eos> but a common low down heart disease.<eos> Try to keep your man happy although you find him real hard to please.<eos> -Oh, my God, it's...<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Hi. Hi.<eos> Look, I tried to return the dress.<eos> No, it looks good.
Norway is to take an honourable place in the new Europe.<eos> You said so.<eos> But Terboven has said repeatedly that Norway will cease to exist.<eos> Terboven says there won't be a Norway in the future.<eos> No Norway.<eos> We'll be reduced to a German province.<eos> We'll be a German province.<eos> Contrary to other countries, you have your own government.<eos> - Norway has her own government.<eos> - But it carries no weight.
'Cause I could fall like a tear<eos> Nothing else I can do<eos> But I'm not alone<eos> Nothing's beside me<eos> All I see is<eos> The others blinded<eos> But I could fall<eos> As if I was young<eos> Ooh, with a lifetime to think of you<eos> If all this influence that this part of the country has... in this musical scene has... if it doesn't do anything with it... that would be the tragedy.

Just came in from the Persian Gulf.<eos> Correction, sir.<eos> We have two confirmed visual contacts.<eos> Mr President, they're tracking another one off the California coastline!<eos> All right, put it on.<eos> General, you might wanna watch this.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we are interrupting our regular broadcast to bring you extraordinary events taking place in Russia.<eos> This unexplained disturbance and the resulting hysteria are incredible.<eos> How would you describe what you are seeing?<eos> It is clearing the mountains, moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor.
I'm so afraid.<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> Johanna?<eos> It fell out of the sky.<eos> Must be from one of the neighbors.<eos> Did it come from the left or the right?<eos> From above.<eos> I'll ask around.<eos> I found this dress in the garden.<eos> Is it yours?
A gloomy painting with a cheerful dress.<eos> That's a -<eos> That's a contrast.<eos> If you don't say it, then I will.<eos> Do you have any idea what the painter had in mind?<eos> A gloomy man, a gloomy woman, a gloomy little boy, a cheerful dress.<eos> Nobody?<eos> Shall I say it again then?<eos> In comparison to the couple and the boy, the dress seems to be laughing.<eos> It's saying, "Chin up."

Don't be gloomy, boy.<eos> Do the couple and the boy listen to the dress?<eos> No.<eos> For them, the dress isn't there.<eos> It doesn't actually exist.
Thank you very much.<eos> So, how's your family?<eos> I don't really have a family per se.<eos> So what are you working on?<eos> Well, as you know, I am working on a drug that will cure depression.<eos> Go on.<eos> I really don't have my notes with me.<eos> Apparently I do have my notes with me.<eos> The results have been very positive.<eos> Is it ready?

Got those childbearing hips.<eos> (CLEARS THROAT) Baby'll pop right out.<eos> (MAKES POPPING SOUND) Your family got any money?<eos> I ain't paying for no big-ass wedding.<eos> Oh, Carla, I know a wonderful minister.<eos> What religious background are you?<eos> GRANDMA: Yeah, I still got my wedding dress.<eos> If you want it, I'll take it in.<eos> You'd look so lovely in it.<eos> It's white though.
They want the world all to themselves.<eos> We don't have to share anything.<eos> We're tougher than the Droids.<eos> And with these guns, we can take them all.<eos> You still have your two guys.<eos> We have a truce.<eos> If it's broken, there could be a free-for-all. We could all end up dead.<eos> But you... you're an outsider.<eos> Did she tell you about the treasure?<eos> I told her I know where it is.
Mr. Murphy, what exactly attracts you to the leisure industry?<eos> In a word, pleasure.<eos> Like, my pleasure in other people's leisure.<eos> Do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?<eos> Oh, yes, 'cause I'm a bit of a perfectionist, actually.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> See, for me, it's got to be the best, or it's nothing at all.<eos> Like, if things get a bit dodgy, I cannot be bothered.<eos> But I've got good vibes about this interview thing today.<eos> Seems to me like it's going pretty well.
- It's a clean break this time.<eos> You're staying here where we can keep an eye on you.<eos> I appreciate what you're trying to do. But I just need one more score.<eos> Just bring me one more hit.<eos> I need one more fucking hit!<eos> You fuck!<eos> Hit.<eos> Hit.<eos> Well, this is a good fucking laugh, ain't it?<eos> You sweat that shite out of your system, 'cause if I come back and it's still here,
You take your orders from me, not from M. Poirot!<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> What the hell to you think you're doing?<eos> - Measuring the coat.<eos> - I can see that.<eos> - Just as I thought.<eos> The coat.<eos> It is short.
Speak of Mlle. Bella Duveen, mon ami.<eos> You can't protect her no longer.<eos> I must speak with her at once.<eos> Her name isn't Bella, it's Isabel.<eos> Isabel to you, mon ami, but Bella Duveen to Jack Renauld.<eos> Remember the "B.D." that we found in the letter?<eos> - That letter was writen to Paul Renauld. - Non, non, non, Hastings.<eos> It was addressed to "My dearest one".<eos> Why do you assume it was his?<eos> Because it was in his coat's pocket.
You'll find me down in the fields.<eos> What an amateur!<eos> It's just the hobby of a spoiled rich boy.<eos> He'll soon cry and quit anyway.<eos> In the new age the world will be united as one consciousness and become a single living creature.<eos> Understand?<eos> He's always partying all night.<eos> He says it's art.<eos> Farmers don't need art.<eos> It's only for people of leisure.
Parnet:<eos> And is that your life's dream? That's what attracts you to animals?<eos> Deleuze: That's what constitutes a world, that's what constitutes a world.<eos> Parnet:<eos> Hence, your animal-writing relationship, that is, the writer, for you, is also someone who has a world... it's more compl-Yes, I don't know, because there are other aspects:<eos> it is not enough to have a world to be an animal.<eos> What fascinates me completely are territorial matters.<eos> With Felix [Guattari], we really created a concept, nearly a philosophical concept, with the idea of territory.<eos> Animals with territory-OK, there are animals without territory, fine- but animals with territory, it's amazing because constituting a territory is, for me, nearly the birth of art.<eos> How an animal marks its territory, everyone knows, everyone always invokes stories of anal glands, of urine, of... with which it marks the borders of its territory.
- Good morning, Delenn.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - How are things with your government?<eos> - Well, for the moment, blissfully quiet.<eos> At least so far as we're concerned.<eos> President Clark's having a hard time keeping everything bottled up back home so we're not on the top of his list of priorities right now.<eos> And the Resistance?<eos> Gathering their forces, putting their people into place.<eos> With everybody busy planning their next move, we get a break.<eos> It'll be short, but I'll take it.
I am here to protect you.<eos> I admire your honesty and your record and your attitude.<eos> And I don't want to see anyone use those against you.<eos> Quite frankly, I think I could come to like you, quite a lot.<eos> Well, here we are.<eos> If you'll just plug yourself into the matrix, we'll take it from there.<eos> - It's occupied.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Yes, of course, my mistake.<eos> I spend so much time out of my body, I sometimes forget where it is.
- Hey.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - They're giving me the VIP treatment.<eos> You didn't tell me you were such a big shot around here.<eos> Well....<eos> - How do I look?<eos> - Like hell.<eos> Why didn't you tell me, Cailyn?<eos> Singing is the only thing that's ever meant a damn to me.<eos> It let's me know I'm alive.

Can anyone hear me?<eos> They're killing us!<eos> The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.<eos> It failed.<eos> But in the year of the Shadow War, it became something greater... our last, best hope for victory.<eos> The year is 2260.<eos> The place, Babylon 5.<eos> Your ship is ready, Entil'Zha.<eos> The letter seems to have disturbed you.<eos> Perhaps if you told me what it says, I might be able-
Help me, Oswin!<eos> Don't spill any more.<eos> Now, take it to the blood pit and dispose of it at once!<eos> Hold his head... while I try and get this poppy juice down his throat.<eos> It has calmed him before.<eos> Has he had another vision, Brother Cadfael?<eos> His soul is most wondrously open.<eos> Or his head is weak through loss of blood.<eos> Do you deny the benefits of blood-letting, Brother Cadfael?<eos> That it calms the body, and therefore the soul.
Should I not go with him, Brother Prior, that the humility of our devotion may be doubled?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Brother Columbanus has earned the right to honour the saint in solitude.<eos> So the monks of Shrewsbury do deal in peace as well as arrogance<eos> Yes, I'm sorry we brought so much turbulence to you here, Father Ianto.<eos> Brother Cadfael, you are not the cause of it.<eos> No, but neither have I found the truth, which might prevent more bloodshed.<eos> And I have very little time left.<eos> Peredur will recover, though.<eos> Confession is a bitter medicine, but in the end it's more healing than this.
Yes.<eos> I'll crank it up right now.<eos> I don't like the sound of that.<eos> We'll have to get it fixed.<eos> Oh, no, Father.<eos> Don't, please!<eos> What?<eos> Father, I love the whole tea-making thing.<eos> You know, the playful splash of the tea as it hits the bottom of the cup.<eos> The thrill of adding the milk, watching it settle for a moment, before it filters slowly down, changing the colour from dark brown to... a lighter brown.
Anything like that?<eos> Well, you know the way God made us all, right, and He's looking down at us from Heaven and everything?<eos> And His son came down and saved everyone and all that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And when we die, we go to Heaven.<eos> Yes, what about it?<eos> That's the bit I have trouble with.<eos> That is the key to the matter, Father.<eos> When you come face to face with death, it makes you think about things.<eos> I saw that film recently, Apollo 13, and it reminded me of my own brush with death.
Like a dreary fog on a Scottish moor.<eos> Rather than accent, it overwhelms.<eos> Rather than flirt, it assaults.<eos> Rather than watching the ball game, I have to listen to this.<eos> ROZ: Hey, you guys.<eos> - Hey, Roz.<eos> - Like to join us?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Frasier, listen, don't forget your staff meeting tomorrow.<eos> It starts at--
You are dialing.<eos> Hi, this is Richard.<eos> Please leave a message at the tone.<eos> You have two new messages.<eos> What a cool job.<eos> "You have two new messages."<eos> Please pass the pie.<eos> Hi, it's Monica.<eos> I'm just checking in.<eos> I got a message and didn't know if it was old or new.
Because if there's any doubt at all, I feel that we should cultivate it.<eos> Cultivate it?<eos> Yes, you know, deal with it.<eos> We have to deal with the doubt, Susan.<eos> The doubt must be dealt with.<eos> I have no doubt, George.<eos> Do you?<eos> No.<eos> You know, I can't wait to get that dress.<eos> Yeah, it should arrive imminently.
We have to deal with the doubt, Susan.<eos> The doubt must be dealt with.<eos> I have no doubt, George.<eos> Do you?<eos> No.<eos> You know, I can't wait to get that dress.<eos> Yeah, it should arrive imminently.<eos> Arrive?<eos> -Yes, from Milan.<eos> -But you said it was in the store.
-Right there, yeah.<eos> -Loses a bet on a horse?<eos> -Secretariat, anti-Semitic.<eos> -Even the horse-<eos> - Even the animal.<eos> The High Holy Days in the temple?<eos> Rabbi, anti-Semite.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> My Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of my bit.<eos> She thought it was funny, so he accused her of being an anti-Semite.
Why would he mind?<eos> We're his parents.<eos> -Hi, Elaine.<eos> -Hello.<eos> -Jerry's not here?<eos> -No.<eos> -Oh, my God.<eos> -What?<eos> A poppy seed.<eos> It must have been in the chicken.
Just one minute.<eos> Thanks.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks, everybody.<eos> Sir, have a seat.<eos> Well, we've discussed this.<eos> Here's the feeling.<eos> You got a greeting.<eos> It starts with an H. How's 20 bucks sound?
- Well, I was telling Carrie about our argument.<eos> And when I told them the name, they just loved it.<eos> - So, what are you saying?<eos> - They're naming their baby Seven.<eos> What?<eos> They're stealing the name?<eos> That's my name.<eos> I made it up.<eos> I can't believe they're using it.<eos> Now, it's not gonna be original.
So that's the situation.<eos> You present an interesting dilemma.<eos> Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle.<eos> And yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner.<eos> Quite the conundrum.<eos> As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have.<eos> It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve the privilege of mail.<eos> Stuffing parcels in mailboxes, where they don't belong.<eos> Newman!<eos> But you must promise that you will abide by my decision no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you.
Talking about humanoid relationships can't be that interesting to you.<eos> For the most part, no.<eos> You don't have to bother.<eos> I can personally vouch for every one of my employees who had access to that food.<eos> Ha. I can't tell you how relieved that makes me feel.<eos> I'm reading some sort of power signature.<eos> Ah...<eos> A Ferengi eavesdropping device.<eos> I don't suppose you know anything about this.<eos> Oh! There it is.

There it is.<eos> I've been looking for that all day.<eos> You admit it's yours?
I'm going to have to kill some of them.<eos> It is possible.<eos> violence might be required to retake the ship.<eos> I've worked so... so hard over the Iast few months... to control the violent feelings.<eos> I'm almost at peace with myself.<eos> I mean, I see the day coming when I couId be.<eos> Mr. Suder... if Lieutenant Tuvok were here, I know he would tell you there are times when violence is required to defend yourself, to defend your ship, to defend your crew.<eos> Yes.<eos> There is a logical use for violence for everyone else.<eos> With me, once it begins...
It seems the people have a myth... an epic poem called "The Song of the Sages,"<eos> which predicts the arrival of two demigods from the sky, the Sages, who would rule over the people as benevolent protectors.<eos> But these Ferengi are anything but benevolent.<eos> What they've done is co-opt the local mythology by using advanced technology like the replicator to convince the people that they're the two Sages spoken of in the poem.<eos> Of course, being Ferengi, they haven't just co-opted the mythology.<eos> They've cornered the market... on everything.<eos> It's disgusting, Captain.<eos> The two Ferengi live in a palatial temple, while the people are lucky to have a roof over their heads.<eos> Apparently, it wasn't always like that.<eos> According to the people that we met, before the Ferengi came, the society may have been primitive, but it was flourishing.
Here.<eos> This one's all right to hold.<eos> shall I use it on the sick man?<eos> Yes, that's a good idea.<eos> The pilot of the freighter died.<eos> We should keep going.<eos> Mr. Paris...<eos> Captain.<eos> I am detecting a vessel.<eos> It's one of the swarm.
It enhanced Tieran's neural pattern and sent it out along the peripheral nerves.<eos> The actual transfer took place through these bioelectric microfibers.<eos> When they came in direct contact with Kes, they transmitted Tieran's pattern up through her nervous system and into her brain.<eos> I assume Tieran would implant a device like this in his new body as quickly as possible.<eos> Perhaps we can use that to our advantage.<eos> My thoughts exactly.<eos> This synaptic stimulator will tap into the implant in Kes's body and remove the alien neural pattern.<eos> Then her own consciousness can take over.<eos> Yes, but how close would you have to get to use this device?<eos> To be fully effective, it would have to come in direct contact with her skin.
You'll feel yourself crumbling from within, your sanity slipping away.<eos> I won't stop until you're broken and helpless.<eos> There's nowhere you can go to get away from me.<eos> I'll be relentless and merciless just like you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> !<eos> You were is such a deep sleep, I had to use a stimulant to bring you out of it.<eos> Your neural stress readings are extremely erratic.<eos> This has gone too far.<eos> You must transfer out of this body before it destroys you.
Of seeing your father by yourself?<eos> Don't run away.<eos> Unless you step forward, nothing will change.<eos> I know that!<eos> You'll begin to realize, after that first step, it's just as important to take another step.<eos> Anyway, go see him tomorrow with your chin held high, because you'll be seeing your mother too.<eos> Well, good night.<eos> Hey, you bought a new dress for tomorrow, didn't you?<eos> Let me see! Oh, you want to see?<eos> It's an expensive one.
- Yeah, he might.<eos> Or he might not. It doesn't matter. We're not going anywhere in that plane.<eos> Why not?<eos> If we can refuel it, then why...<eos> Remember the matches?<eos> - The ones from the restaurant that wouldn't light?<eos> What about 'em?<eos> - If the matches won't light and the beer's flat...<eos> - then jet fuel won't burn.<eos> It'll be as used up and worn out as everything else in this world.
Hey, look, I thought I'd...<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know...<eos> Be quiet!<eos> He's hiding over there.<eos> Behind something.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> I don't hear a thing.<eos> - I do! I hear his heart.<eos> It's beating very fast, and very hard.
Thousands of kids died in terrible pain.<eos> That's why he came here... to get away from his shame and guilt.<eos> He says that in the silence of the night... he can still hear how... he little victims scream.<eos> Now it's important to pinch artery 143.<eos> You heard him.<eos> Watch the neurometer.<eos> I'll try to stabilize the radioisotope regulator...<eos> - with injections of...<eos> - Shit, a purple hemorrhage!<eos> - It's flooding everything!
What would you get in exchange?<eos> A brother.<eos> If I take his place, maybe I'll see his big brother again.<eos> You are trying to trap me, aren't you?<eos> You don't risk very much.<eos> So be it.<eos> Well, my chickadee, huh?<eos> Sometimes it's better to land in the muck, huh?<eos> Hey, you'd better get out of this place.<eos> It's going sky-high!
Aye!<eos> Aye!<eos> You've come, dozens of ye, like rats to the granary, like field mice when there's harvest home.<eos> And what good will it do ye?<eos> You're all damned!<eos> Damned!<eos> Do you ever stop to think what that word means?<eos> No-o-o-o.<eos> No,you don't.<eos> It means... endless, horrifying torment.
No, please, look at this.<eos> Higher Common Sense. Very good.<eos> Very clever.<eos> Especially the introduction.<eos> That's for you.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I think she's charming.<eos> Wait 'til we've finished.<eos> Do you like your new dress, Elfine?<eos> Oh, it's heavenly.
!<eos> How much does he pay you?<eos> $50,000 a year.<eos> $50,000.<eos> Cash.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're a mess again.<eos> Come here.<eos> On the counter.<eos> I didn't open this place just to see it fail.
- Come in.<eos> - We've come for the children.<eos> - We need them at home.<eos> Well, this is most irregular.<eos> Refreshments!<eos> Anyone in need of refreshments?<eos> Ahem.<eos> Go on. Go on home.<eos> I can't say I like this village.<eos> It's altogether far too quiet.
What happened?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Find the ambulance?<eos> - Dumped it four blocks from here.<eos> - 22nd Street.<eos> They torched it.<eos> Burned the guns, clothes, everything.<eos> They were airborne. They taped the last few seconds of the black-and-whites.<eos> Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago. Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier a day before yesterday.<eos> You taking this one? Or does it stay in Division?
It's not safe.<eos> This isn't cholera land.<eos> This is my land where I dress in the evening.<eos> Do you like the dress?<eos> I don't know...<eos> Yes, I like it.<eos> - Do you want to know why I chose it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> It's like the one in Manosque.
Listen to me before it's too late.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> He's carrying the cure for--<eos> I told her if she wants to get with me... then I want to get with her.<eos> Screw the physical disability.<eos> Because it's about the feeling.<eos> What's up?<eos> Wind, maybe.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's crazy, but if I really have the cure... it could save you.

And believe this:<eos> We're going out with a bang, baby.<eos> So get your VCRs ready, 'cause we got what you need.<eos> We got the cure to NAS.<eos> That's right.<eos> The cure to the black shakes.<eos> It's coming to you live from the labs up at PharmaKom.<eos> And believe this:<eos> They did not want you to get this information.<eos> So here it is, coming at you, LoTek style.
We win again.<eos> (Laughs) let's get a beer.<eos> I think my business is done here.<eos> Aubrey,being lousy at bowling isn't necessarily a bad thing.<eos> you know,I think it's working.<eos> Things are... crackling.<eos> Well,she definitely likes him.<eos> You think he likes her?<eos> He'd better.<eos> It's your arm swing.It's not loose.
Marianne ...<eos> - Haven't you finished yet?<eos> - No. Patience.<eos> You're not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?<eos> - There is nothing under ten pence.<eos> - Do you want us to starve?<eos> No.<eos> Just not to eat beef.<eos> If my behaviour was improper, I should be sensible of it.<eos> It has caused impertinent remarks.
- They have something else.<eos> - They're heathen?<eos> The story goes: There was a great shipwreck hereabouts - long, long ago.<eos> A galleon bearing treasure from Mexico to the King of Spain.<eos> Not only gold, but idols for him to see.<eos> Even people<eos> - from that terrible hand.<eos> - Treasure?<eos> Oh, that catches your ear, laddie.<eos> Well, if it's still there, nobody's found it yet.
At least, sell me some tree.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I have two conditions only:<eos> You cannot knock it down and you cannot keep me from doing anything with the tree.<eos> I am really glad.<eos> But what will I give to you?<eos> Take this book.<eos> It's a good book.<eos> When a man has a problem it's like staying in a room he can't get out of.<eos> He tries the window but it's too high.
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.<eos> I must speak to Hill!<eos> It is not Mr Bingley.<eos> It is a person I never saw in the whole course of my life.<eos> - Colonel Forster!<eos> - Captain Carter!<eos> No, I know. Denny!<eos> About a month ago, I received this letter.<eos> About a fortnight ago, I answered it, for it was a case of some delicacy, requiring early attention.<eos> It is from my cousin, Mr Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.
- You're right. - What?<eos> Oh, Colin!<eos> Celia was mooning after you like a little ghost, but you never even looked at her.<eos> So, I said to her, "Become a case, something he can study.<eos> Then maybe you'll have more luck".<eos> It certainly worked. Oui.<eos> But was it not the idea to steal items only of the little worth?<eos> Yes.<eos> But then she went and pinched that ring from Pat's room.<eos> I could see at once how much it was worth, and... thought the police might be called in.
What was it doing in your head?<eos> It was trying to survive and go home.<eos> It must have come through that rift in Sector 1 4 and somehow wound up in that Markab's body.<eos> It drove him mad.<eos> How did you figure out what it wanted?<eos> The images I got: fear, loss, home.<eos> Somehow, it was sending me a message touching deep emotions in me which mirrored its own state.<eos> I was actually seeing what it felt.<eos> This is fantastic.<eos> For this creature not to show up on my scans it would have to be totally different from every alien species we know.

I used to dress up in revealing lingerie, and when he came through the door I leapt on top of him and had sex right there in the hall.<eos> So, you had a good sleep, then?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Oh, God. I'm sorry, Father.<eos> I've probably shocked you.<eos> Oh! Go away with you.<eos> I've heard more shocking things through the years in confessión.<eos> Do you every think about the future?<eos> I used to think about the future, and then it became the present, so I thought about it quite often then, and then it was in the past so I didn't think about it that much.
I do not want to talk about it!<eos> I just want this film business over with.<eos> Film?<eos> What film?<eos> This blasphemous film, The Passion of Saint Tibulus.<eos> Now, His Holiness has banned it.<eos> But a loophole means the bloody thing's showing in this dump.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Is it any good, do you know?<eos> I don't care if it's any good or not.
The main emitter coupling has been depolarized.<eos> I must have accidentally inverted the power flow when I tried to modify the phaser array.<eos> I can't believe it. A first-year engineering student wouldn't make a mistake like that.<eos> This wasn't your fault, Mr. O'Brien.<eos> And it wasn't an accident.<eos> Gilora...<eos> Dejar is a member of the Obsidian Order. She was assigned to our team for security reasons.<eos> I believe she sabotaged this coupling.<eos> The Order has always been opposed to the peace treaty with Bajor.<eos> They sent you here to sabotage the relay because if the first joint venture between Cardassia and Bajor was a failure it would probably be the last.
Tain.<eos> Ah, Garak, it's good of you to come.<eos> It spares me the trouble of having to send someone else to kill you.<eos> Come in, come in!<eos> It's been a long time, Elim.<eos> So, you're a tailor now.<eos> Is this one of your creations?<eos> A minor example of my work, yes.<eos> I don't think I like the neckline.<eos> Well, you always did have a keen sense of fashion but you seem to have let it go along with your once-trim figure.
Besides, we don't have the time.<eos> President Truman's an impatient man.<eos> He wants answers and he wants them now.<eos> Jeff, General Denning I think you'd better come inside right away.<eos> My name is Quark, Chief Financial Officer of the Ferengi Alliance and...<eos> I've got a business proposition for you.<eos> I don't see any universal translator.<eos> Trust me. It's in there.<eos> So this gadget of yours is what makes it possible for us to understand each other?<eos> How's it work?
Gentlemen, if I were you I would seriously consider taking this offer.<eos> Or else what?<eos> The Governor won't let this situation continue forever.<eos> Tell him if he wants to see those hostages again, he's going to have to do better.<eos> - Tough talk.<eos> - l was bluffing.<eos> - l couldn't tell.<eos> - l hope she couldn't either.<eos> Try opening that menu.<eos> It brings me back to the same screen.
Last year, when the Romulans tried to invade the Founders' homeworld we went up against a dozen Jem'Hadar ships.<eos> I know, Chief, uh, you've told me the story.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, unless you want to hear it again you better get down to the torpedo bay and start working on those probes.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Janklow. I'm going to need a dualitic inverter.<eos> There's one in the cargo bay.<eos> Right, Chief.<eos> Hull breach on deck two.<eos> An emergency force field is in place but it won't hold up long against this pressure.
I should have let him stay on that space station where he belongs.<eos> Worf.<eos> What is it?<eos> Lunch.<eos> Delicious, isn't it?<eos> A hunt builds the appetite.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> Ah, but it'll make a good part of the story-- how we slew the beast?<eos> Remember?<eos> It attacked us from the dark, five meters long.
You asked me to visit you sometime.<eos> Open up. hurry!<eos> Someone's looking for you.<eos> - Me? - That's right.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I've come for my letter.<eos> What letter.?<eos> Ask the chief<eos> You've been keeping it.<eos> - He says it's with you. - Me?
Come on!<eos> Shake his hand!<eos> Mattress distribution in the camp yard.<eos> It's your heart, isn't it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That's what they said.<eos> Great.<eos> Why didn't they give you medicine?<eos> - They ran out.<eos> When there's none, it's free.
It's a fad.<eos> Anyway I see you've been having some problems with the board.<eos> I guess Sidney's been putting the screws to you, Norman.<eos> Norville.<eos> Say what you like about his ethics, he's a balls-to-the-wall businessman.<eos> Beat you any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.<eos> Any particular reason you didn't give him my blue letter?<eos> Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.<eos> I must've mislaid it.<eos> It's in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
She registered in his room.<eos> Under what name?<eos> illegible.<eos> Then... there was this terrible storm, a deluge.<eos> The woman hid in her room... waiting.<eos> Ashamed to show her face, I'd say.<eos> And then, the letter arrived.<eos> You opened the letter.<eos> I had to.<eos> How else would I know who it was for?
He said it in..... in 'La Rime en 194O'.<eos> 'Le Creve-coeur'<eos> "When I close the book, I will have no regrets."<eos> "I've seen so many people live so badly, and so many people die so well."<eos> The image is a pure creation of the mind.<eos> It can not be born of a comparison, but from drawing together two distant realities.<eos> The more the ties between these two realities are distant and right, the stronger the image will be.<eos> Two realities with no ties cannot be usefully drawn together No image is created.<eos> and two contrary realities do not reconcile with each other.<eos> An image is not strong because it is brutal or fantastic, but because the association of ideas is distant. distant, and correct.
That is what darkness is.<eos> -the name that was given to me.<eos> Precisely<eos> Self-portrait<eos> Not autobiography.<eos> Fourth thirty 3O/4O.<eos> - No,game, game<eos> Our pre war<eos> The past is never dead<eos> It hasn't even passed yet
Understand?<eos> There are no stars in the sky here.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Imagine...<eos> The sun's shining, burning your skin.<eos> And the sand...<eos> You can smell it.<eos> As far as the eye can see.<eos> There's the sea...<eos> It's really rough.
I love your knee.<eos> Love your thigh.<eos> Love your stomach.<eos> Love your finger.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Goddamn it, Mickey!<eos> I just took it off so I wouldn't snag my hair when I washed it.<eos> Okay, baby, look.<eos> Even if that ring pulls out every hair on your head, it stays on.<eos> If it tears out my eyeballs, it never comes off.
Now, at last, their souls are free.<eos> When we lack the fruits of their labours, we will miss them.<eos> Here.<eos> - Why did they let this happen?<eos> - The warden wants us to fight.<eos> - Why? - Because he can do as he pleases.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> This place is secret, it's private.<eos> The authorities keep it classified.<eos> No one knows it exists.
- Lance, get in here!<eos> - Right?<eos> Pig.<eos> - Get the fuck outta my way.<eos> - Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.<eos> - While I'm doing this, you take off her shirt and find her heart.<eos> - Does it gotta be exact?<eos> - We're giving her a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact.<eos> I don't know exactly where her heart is.<eos> I think it's right here.
In the fucking bag.<eos> Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.<eos> Now get the fuck down on the floor.<eos> In the bag.<eos> In the bag.<eos> In the bag.<eos> - What's in the case?<eos> - My boss's dirty laundry.<eos> - Your boss makes you do his laundry?<eos> - When he wants it clean.
- The director sent me.<eos> - "Madame" Director!<eos> Continue, Gil.<eos> Continue!<eos> All around us people are jealous<eos> They all blame me to have eyes for you too sweet. to love you madly my love!<eos> madly in love night and day!<eos> It's not nice! But I do not care, how they behaved because I think it's normal to love you madly my love!<eos> madly in love night and day!<eos> I think every moment anything can happen but my heart can not change it will really always for you!
What you're doing is just as bad as when the Borg destroyed your world.<eos> They killed millions, too. Including your wife and children.<eos> Nice try.<eos> There was a time when I wouldn't hurt a fly. Then the Borg came.<eos> They showed me that there is one constant in this universe... death.<eos> We're all going to die sometime.<eos> It's just a question of how and when.<eos> You will too, Captain.<eos> Aren't you beginning to feel time gaining on you?<eos> Like a predator, it's stalking you.
The way he spoke yesterday, I was beginning to believe it.<eos> Why the hell did he stir the shit up?<eos> If I'd known he wanted the same as us, I'd have saved him the trouble.<eos> It's crazy to say that it was my fault.<eos> I had nothing to do with that little idiot.<eos> Even her name drove me up the wall.<eos> Estike, what's that?<eos> Is that a name?<eos> She's eaten a lot of rat poison and that's it.<eos> Perhaps it was better for the poor thing.
I dream a scene at night, I Write it down in the morning.<eos> Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine Where it's going.<eos> At least tell me What it's about so far.<eos> - Coffee.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I can tell you What the nightmare's about so far.<eos> It's about this entity...<eos> Whatever you Want to call it.<eos> It's old.<eos> It's very old.

Thank you.<eos> I demand an explanation.<eos> You must stop this charade.<eos> Give the report to Moesgaard and get it over with!<eos> That´s not up to you to say.<eos> Everyone has the right to a single mistake, if they learn by it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I haven´t committed any errors.<eos> If I read this report correctly, Mona´s blood pressure fell too low.<eos> For twenty minutes! You write that it stabilised at once.
Food was freely offered to passing travellers, and each day was lived in bliss.<eos> As the sun set, fireplaces were lit, time for a warm rest. Into sleep they went quietly.<eos> But one night, while all slept, a Iow, menacing growl came from the edge of the forest.<eos> Each day, it grew louder.<eos> Chilrden could not play outside.<eos> Men could not go hunting.<eos> The villagers were frightened and convened a meeting.<eos> The village elder spoke:<eos> "A mountain-sized monster lives at the edge of our village. "<eos> "Surely it will come here in search of food. "
Let him sleep.<eos> What is this?<eos> What happened?<eos> A car ran over it.<eos> Help me make a grave?<eos> Yes, I shall.<eos> As soon as I get a little better.<eos> It is like the scales of a reptile, or the bark of a tree.<eos> Rusty steel, smells like blood.<eos> It also gives off its own warmth.

Granny, I love you so much!<eos> Is it Jesus' book?<eos> Yes, honey.<eos> The angel is waiting for you.<eos> Ring the bell.<eos> The ducks turned yellow.<eos> And here're our swans.<eos> Father, mother and me.<eos> - Look at the seed.<eos> It's alive.

You didn't ask.<eos> I demand you turn over this jamming device at once.<eos> It's being repaired.<eos> Babylon Control out.<eos> Commander, we don't even have a jamming device.<eos> He doesn't know that.<eos> It'll discourage him from sending any more ships down there.<eos> What's that?<eos> We're picking up increased seismic activity inside Epsilon 3.<eos> It started when the Hyperion ships launched.
You wish to speak to me?<eos> Now is your time.<eos> This council stopped the war against the humans because of prophecy.<eos> Because Valen said that the humans, some among them had a destiny which we could not interfere with.<eos> It was my place to study them, to determine if the prophecy was correct.<eos> I have not yet finished that task.<eos> How much more is there to learn?<eos> They are a primitive people.<eos> I doubt the prophecy.<eos> It may have referred to others.
There are simply no funds available.<eos> Now despite this unfortunate accident our experts say you have enough people for this year, and that...<eos> How many of those experts ever worked a space dock?<eos> Or tried to refuel a ship while being pushed because of overscheduling?<eos> Or felt the pain in their bones from operating a zero-G cargo loader?<eos> You have a point, Mr...?<eos> Mr. Eduardo Delvientos, senior foreman.<eos> And, yeah, I got a point.<eos> I've worked docks for 40 years and this equipment... won't last two months.<eos> It needs to be overhauled, but we don't have the money.
I wondered where the Raiders got their weapons.<eos> Then I thought of our talk.<eos> Narns sell to anyone who can pay.<eos> Just like during the war.<eos> You send an advisor to show weapon operation and to ensure they aren't resold to a third party.<eos> When we disabled the command and control ship we went aboard and found your friend here.<eos> That's not all.<eos> When the ship docked and we went inside, we found these data crystals.<eos> They hold reports between Ragesh 3 and Narn Central Command.<eos> They confirm what Mollari said about the attack on the colony that it was unprovoked. The invitation was made at gunpoint.
It can be a dangerous place.<eos> But it's our last, best hope for peace.<eos> This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.<eos> The year is 2258.<eos> The name of the place is Babylon 5.<eos> It should come as no surprise, G'Kar.<eos> You ruined my family's name and humiliated me before the council.<eos> Retribution was inevitable.<eos> But retribution is also expensive.<eos> Properly executed, it would leave me penniless.
- Now she thinks she's found it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think....<eos> I think that for the first time in years I see her smiling.<eos> - I see hope in her eyes.<eos> - Her machine doesn't work.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Have you tested it?<eos> Examined it? No.<eos> If it was real, why are you here?
That will pass.<eos> If it isn't completely gone, come back in a week.<eos> - We'll see what we can do. - I will.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - All right, dear.<eos> - Laura.<eos> - Yes?<eos> It looks as though I was wrong.<eos> This device is more than what it seems.<eos> It does heal.
- Can you see them?<eos> - Oh, yes, thank you.<eos> Hello, Niles.<eos> Whatever are you doing here?<eos> I bought an emerald necklace for Maris, and I needed someplace to hide it.<eos> Emeralds?<eos> Well, may I see it?<eos> Not at the moment, no.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - It's down me blouse.
Whatever are you doing here?<eos> I bought an emerald necklace for Maris, and I needed someplace to hide it.<eos> Emeralds?<eos> Well, may I see it?<eos> Not at the moment, no.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - It's down me blouse.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, I'm sure Maris will never think of looking for it there.<eos> It slipped down there when I was trying it on.
- I'll fire it up for you.<eos> - That won't be necessary.<eos> I like to sit in my chair, not vibrate.<eos> Thank you any... Oh!<eos> Ooh!<eos> - It also has shiatsu. - Ohh...<eos> I never knew a chair could be this satisfying.<eos> I never knew anything could.<eos> I want it!<eos> I'm sure it would fit in with Maris' antiques? !
Try this.<eos> Look, I appreciate this, Frasier, but that...<eos> It really isn't me.<eos> Dad, you haven't even sat in it yet.<eos> Come on down, Martin Crane.<eos> That's disgusting!<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm a creature of habit.<eos> I think I'd rather have my old chair back.<eos> But why?<eos> This chair is a lot more comfortable and it's therapeutic.
Leo!<eos> Leo, bring Mr Crane's chair back.<eos> - Sorry, Fish 'n' Chips.<eos> Someone took it.<eos> - What?<eos> Someone broke into my storage space and stole the chair?<eos> - Storage space?<eos> - That's where I told you to put it!<eos> Not another day like last Tuesday.<eos> - Where is it?
- It's John...<eos> So remember, Stephanie, a little emotional flexibility is a good thing.<eos> Just as the mighty oak snaps and falls in a windstorm, so the weeping willow bends and lives to see another day.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, any update on the chair?<eos> - The calls have been pouring in.<eos> - Really?<eos> What are they?<eos> Spotted at the top of the Space Needle, in the Governor's mansion...<eos> One man saw it flying over his house, but thought it was just a tacky spaceship.
Oh, God!<eos> No, don't touch that.<eos> Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough having to return it to him.<eos> "Barry, remember me?<eos> I'm the girl that stomped on your heart in front of your family"<eos> Now I must return the ring, without the ring which makes it so much harder.<eos> Easy, we'll find it.<eos> Won't we?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> When did you have it last?
Don't ever forget that.<eos> Well, there's not much chance of that, is there?<eos> What do you mean, we're trapped?<eos> I mean, we're trapped.<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if the entire station is locked down.<eos> But you're a shape-shifter.<eos> Excuse me, a changeling.<eos> So change into something and get us out of here.<eos> This force field isn't just protecting the door.<eos> It goes through the bulkheads, the ceiling, the deck.
Should be a perfect place to set up a colony.<eos> Someone's beaten us to it.<eos> - Life-forms?<eos> - Human life-forms.<eos> I see nothing about a colony in the Orellius system.<eos> - Trying hailing frequencies.<eos> - Moving into orbit.<eos> No response.<eos> I'm picking up a duonetic field.<eos> It may be blocking communications.
I want to stay with you.<eos> He doesn't have to stay here as long as I can monitor his condition regularly.<eos> Well, it seems I have my first houseguest.<eos> You can change into any of these objects?<eos> With varying degrees of success.<eos> Some forms are more difficult to emulate than others.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Like this one.<eos> As you can see, I haven't mastered the humanoid face.<eos> I've found it to be quite challenging.
I'm following the trail.<eos> Moving toward corridor 2-H.<eos> - Nothing is showing up.<eos> - l figured as much.<eos> Did the security cameras give you anything?<eos> The security cameras stopped operating for 43 seconds at 0300 hours, five minutes, right when the alarm sounded.<eos> Stopped?<eos> You mean someone turned them off.<eos> More likely some kind of power interruption.<eos> It might have affected the security field around the life-form, too.
- Security to ops.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - There's no one here.<eos> - No sign of Odo?<eos> - 'No.' l can help you with that, Major.<eos> The creature you're after is Odo.<eos> There must have been a reaction to the volcanic gas on the planet.<eos> is there any way to communicate with him?<eos> It's not Odo, really.<eos> It's separate and independent from the Odo we know, and yet it's aware of me.
- l'm sorry to disappoint you.<eos> - lt's too late for apologies.<eos> The Dominion will not stand by and allow ships from your side to violate our territory.<eos> I hear the Klingons are effective warriors.<eos> What's that weapon they're so fond of? The bat'leth?<eos> I am not interested in discussing the Klingons.<eos> All right.<eos> Then what about the Cardassians?<eos> Are you satisfied with the treaty your Federation made with them?<eos> It seems a tactical error.
Wait. I have just the thing.<eos> Vulcan port.<eos> Three centuries old.<eos> Very rare, very expensive.<eos> A glass?<eos> Not even a taste?<eos> I'm not thirsty.<eos> It will be right here if you develop a thirst.<eos> You mentioned a business proposition.<eos> It is private.
And I burst into tears, and I knew that if I went up to him he wouldn't recognize me after a year.<eos> And Gideon would get mad that I didn't let him know I was coming after a year.<eos> I wanted to hug them and kiss Shir, who I once was ready to kill.<eos> Then I ran away from there and got on a bus and didn't stop crying the whole way... I couldn't get them out of my mind...<eos> And I wanted to die.<eos> I took Antomin in the room and on the way... because I couldn't stop crying, except for once, when I laughed because I opened the window and saw I was only on the second floor and I want to commit myself.<eos> Don't you have any more red ones?<eos> You know, I once wanted to write and publish an article,<eos> ''Loneliness as a disease''.<eos> It isn't a symptom or a mental disorder. It's a disease, a real disease.
''because Allah has chosen you among all other people ''to fuck us up<eos> ''because Allah has chosen you among all other people ''to fuck us up.''<eos> ''My Lord, my Lord, ''may it never end ''the battle and the tension ''the trembling in the belly ''and the butt of the rifle ''stopped in the guts<eos> ''the close range ''the sparkle in the eyes ''the body of an Arab ''without his head, without his dick.'' l bet you a beer she doesn't enter?<eos> Bet you a beer she does?<eos> Excuse me, can I pass?<eos> -On to me?<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you know you have the honor of sitting on the spear's head?<eos> Three days ago it took out three with one magazine.
- Are you scared?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> - Are you scared?<eos> D'you think it'll fly?<eos> - I'm more than sure.<eos> Let's do it then!<eos> I can't wait any longer.<eos> I'm flying!<eos> Sometimes you have to crash into a tree to know what to do, and realize the secret of anything is meaningless.<eos> My English teacher talked about this Russian guy, who said that if you see a gun in the first half of a book, you can be sure it'll go off in the second half.
I'm sure you're known.<eos> Some literary circles know very well that you have things to write.<eos> They want to scare you.<eos> To deter Jacques Prevel from writing something they know has merit.<eos> They don't want it to be common knowledge...<eos> I loved your letter about my poems.<eos> Keep it to yourself.<eos> I published my letters from the asylum.<eos> But I absolutely don't want that one published.<eos> I don't want it circulated either...
So sweet.<eos> Only five more days.<eos> Only five more days.<eos> I'm going back. I'm tired.<eos> We ran out of vodka and whiskey, if that's what you had in mind.<eos> If we were dead, then you'd miss us.<eos> Nice atmosphere.<eos> Can the sun fall down?<eos> -No, Micky.<eos> It does so at night.
- She is very sick.<eos> - Sick? What is that?<eos> No one reaches the moment of death... without falling sick at least once.<eos> Even kings?<eos> And death-- what moment is that?<eos> Show me death.<eos> This is death, my Lord.<eos> Here the ashes are given to the river, my Lord.<eos> Death is the moment of separation... which comes to every person in every family.<eos> When a body grows cold and stiff like wood, it has to be burned like wood.
I think about the past - my mother, my father.<eos> I don't really know how he died.<eos> My parents split up when I was four.<eos> The stuff about spy planes and pilots<eos> - I made it all up to impress you.<eos> To make me tutor you.<eos> You needn't worry, Norstadt, you're not crazy.<eos> You're shrewd.<eos> People spend too much time thinking about the past.<eos> Whatever else it is, it's gone.
It was a terrible shock.<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> She needs it.<eos> She must have it.<eos> - What did she say?<eos> - To throw the piano overboard.<eos> It's quite safe.<eos> They are managing.<eos> She doesn't want it.<eos> She says it's spoiled!
I pardon you.<eos> GOETH: What do they want?<eos> STERN: I don't know, but they're in my office right now reviewing our books.<eos> As my accountant, tell me, should I be alarmed that the auditors are reviewing my books? Well...<eos> Or have you done your job properly?<eos> You needn't be alarmed.<eos> I needn't be alarmed.<eos> (GASPS) I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Do you know how much this saddle is worth?<eos> Do you know how much it costs?
Get us the big one!<eos> - Come on, Mom. Please?<eos> - Here you go, guys. - l...<eos> - We want the big one.<eos> - Yeah, that's fine.<eos> It's changing.<eos> That's what's wild about the sunset.<eos> It'll just change really, really slowly in front of your eyes.<eos> I love the sky.<eos> It's so limitless.

I was breathless.<eos> Sometimes you seem so frail.<eos> I have to go to my room.<eos> I won't be long.<eos> Oh, you young people have no stamina.<eos> Henry, you don't only have to see it... you have to feel it.<eos> You have to feel the earth turning.<eos> We're flying through the clouds.<eos> - I don't want this moment to end.<eos> - It will never end.
The only one, according to your paintings.<eos> I admit that the human universe is infinitely richer than my meagre palette.<eos> For instance, I do absolutely no justice at all to the nervous Nellies and the shrinking violets, the saints...<eos> You're very contemptuous of shrinking violets.<eos> Dear Estella, I'm a shrinking violet myself.<eos> I choose to live not in the real world but in here.<eos> I flee from the real world into my little studio and there before me is the unlimited canvas of my imagination.<eos> But your paintings, they do go out into the real world.<eos> While you have a wonderful imagination, most are stunted and you have no idea what effect they'll have on people or what they might incite them to.<eos> Mr Campion, in my opinion, the female body is the most beautiful thing in the world and if it turns you into a ravenous maniac I'd suggest it's a good idea if your wife takes the greatest care to get undressed behind a screen.
Dr Scully, can you lD these marks?<eos> Needle punctures, maybe.<eos> An animal bite.<eos> Electrocution of some kind.<eos> How's your chemistry?<eos> This substance was found in the surrounding tissue.<eos> It's organic.<eos> I don't know. ls it some kind of synthetic protein?<eos> I've never seen it before either.<eos> But here it is again in Sturgis, South Dakota.
Anyway, it's not my problem.<eos> - Monsieur Hall?<eos> I noticed that you were not at the party last night.<eos> - Well, I wasn't in a party mood.<eos> - May I ask where you were?<eos> - I went for a walk. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really will be late.<eos> Thank you, Saunders.<eos> - I only stayed with her 'cause I felt sorry for her.<eos> - So you were alone in the room with the necklace.<eos> - Yeah, for about two seconds. Didn't even know it was there.
We will do a search.<eos> And, Hastings, do not leave stone on stone.<eos> Since he knows, Monsieur Poirot, it is not a will usually is read before the funeral one.<eos> But in this case I made an exception,<eos> Sirs and Ladies, perhaps be better we seat ourselves.<eos> It was not a complicated will, Mr. Poirot.<eos> We were all presents like witnesses there are ten years.<eos> The will, Monsieur Siddaway?<eos> It does not seem to be here.<eos> Do not be absurd, dear, it will be.
I can't!<eos> That's it.<eos> You're grounded.<eos> You can't ground me.<eos> I'm a grown man.<eos> You wanna live here you respect the rules of our house.<eos> You're grounded!<eos> So where are we gonna go eat?<eos> I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.<eos> I love that place, but it's usually so crowded.
It's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide.<eos> That's my TV Guide, ripped to shreds!<eos> - She gave that to you?<eos> - Hey is that The Twi/ight Zone you're watching?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, this is a good one.<eos> Next stop, Queensborough P/aza.<eos> Gyro.<eos> I like your place.<eos> It's very unassuming.
Actually, I thought I'd lift this 1 987 Buick Skylark over my head.<eos> Hi-yo! Johnny, that's amazing.<eos> Oh, yeah? Get a load of this.<eos> I've got to fire that agent.<eos> This was a great show, Krusty.<eos> You deserve an Emmy for this.<eos> Forget it.<eos> The Academy hates me.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Bunch of old, know-nothing dinosaurs... wouldn't know entertainment if it bit 'em in the--
Hmm. Mr. Hutz, do you know you're not wearing any pants?<eos> What?<eos> I move for a bad court thingy.<eos> You mean a mistrial?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's why you're the judge, and I'm the law-talkin' guy.<eos> The lawyer.<eos> - Right. The foreman will pass the verdict to the bailiff.<eos> This verdict is written on a cocktail napkin!<eos> And it still says 'guilty.' And 'guilty' is spelled wrong!
Main Street!<eos> Main Street!<eos> Main Street!<eos> All those in favor Of Grampa Simpson's plan... for rebuilding Main Street, please-- -<eos> You know, a town with money's a little like the mule with a spinning wheel.<eos> No one knows how he got it, and danged if he knows how to use it.<eos> - Mule.<eos> The name's Lanley, Lyle Lanley... and I come before you good people tonight with an idea.<eos> Probably the greatest-<eos> - Ah, it's not for you.
If you were still a man... I see your temper hasn't improved.<eos> Damn it!<eos> - Don't talk about that!<eos> - Curzon warned you about it.<eos> You're not going to get me off track here.<eos> Do you remember that Argosian lieutenant who threw a drink in your face?<eos> And you knocked me down before I could kill him.<eos> I still have a little scar here from your ring finger.<eos> I tried on that ring after Curzon died.<eos> It just slipped off my finger.
Consider it my gift to you.<eos> Oh, my apologies.<eos> We'll see you there.<eos> Kira out.<eos> Well done.<eos> You certainly fooled her, didn't you, Constable?<eos> We're running out of time, Doctor.<eos> I've just about finished. I've set up an ionic interference signal in cargo bay four, calibrated to lock onto the resonance frequencies of the telepathic field and drive it out of all those affected.<eos> And what will happen to it then?<eos> It'll stay suspended as long as the interference is in effect.
- She has mine.<eos> You can't believe teaching the facts about the wormhole is blasphemy?<eos> Some revisions in the curriculum might be appropriate.<eos> You teach lots of Bajorans.<eos> I'm not going to let a Bajoran spiritual leader dictate what's taught in my class.<eos> Then maybe we need two schools - one for Bajoran children, another for the Federation.<eos> If we start separating Bajoran and Federation interests...<eos> A lot of Bajoran and Federation interests are separate.<eos> I've been telling you that all along.<eos> Nobody's saying there can't be spiritual teaching but can't it be in addition to what's taught in Mrs O'Brien's class?
- Sitting.<eos> They went straight to Quark's, but not for the gambling.<eos> And certainly not for the food.<eos> They're just sitting.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> Why don't I lock them up and call the Klingons to come get them?<eos> If they're enemies of the Klingon High Council...<eos> They haven't broken any laws here.<eos> You can't just throw them in jail.<eos> Cardassian rule may have been oppressive, but at least it was simple.
Then it has started.<eos> Get me Admiral Chekote at Starfleet Command.<eos> I feel the Prophets smiling on me today, Vedek.<eos> The prophets have rarely encountered a "pagh" as forceful as yours, Minister Jaro.<eos> What's it to be, Winn?<eos> - Be?<eos> - Don't tease me.<eos> I can't interpret the prophecies for you, Essa.<eos> I know the future.<eos> It belongs to me.
- What's gone, Madam Ambassador?<eos> - My latinum hair brooch.<eos> Quark!<eos> I had just made my third straight cross, I was picking up the dice, something brushed against me, and my God, I've been wigged!<eos> What's the problem, here?<eos> Someone has stolen Ambassador Troi's hair brooch.<eos> I'm sorry, but as the sign says, we are not responsible for the loss of items.<eos> - Sign?<eos> - The one above the door.<eos> It's too high up to read.
Constable.<eos> We need someone to speak out, someone the people will listen to.<eos> There. That should do it.<eos> - How do I look?<eos> - As...handsome as ever.<eos> Really?<eos> - Jake, what are you doing up?<eos> - l couldn't sleep.<eos> How was your date?<eos> It was tonight, wasn't it?
It will be several hours before it cools enough for us to enter.<eos> Data, do you have any plans right now?<eos> I do not.<eos> Maybe we should spend a little time together.<eos> I'd love to see your quarters.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will be playing this piece at a recital tomorrow evening.<eos> That was beautiful.<eos> I have been told that my playing is technically flawless but no one has ever described it as beautiful.<eos> It was.
I found Voval, the shuttle pilot.<eos> He's still alive.<eos> He can help us get away from here.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'll jump unless you promise to love me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't promise.<eos> You have been manipulating me, haven't you?<eos> Jean-Luc, what are you saying?<eos> The necklace... it broke.
I don't care.<eos> I'll jump unless you promise to love me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't promise.<eos> You have been manipulating me, haven't you?<eos> Jean-Luc, what are you saying?<eos> The necklace... it broke.<eos> I saw it in the cargo freighter on the floor by the fire.<eos> I left it there.<eos> Now it's around your neck.

What is my rank and position?<eos> You're a Commander and First Officer.<eos> Are we still married?<eos> Yes.<eos> I am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular RNA.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I do not know.<eos> I will have to analyze these readings.<eos> I have found that the quantum flux in Worf's cellular RNA extends to the subatomic level.<eos> It is asynchronous with normal matter.
It is the flash point of an explosion. - And it is expanding.<eos> - Expanding?<eos> I thought that time was suspended.<eos> We were incorrect.<eos> I have determined that time is moving at an infinitesimal rate.<eos> Why didn't we notice it before?<eos> Our conclusion was based on observations of the crew.<eos> A warp-core breach moves at a faster rate.<eos> The motion of the cloud is within my visual-detection threshold.<eos> At its current rate, it will consume the Enterprise in nine hours, 17 minutes.
I see her mostly in Hareton.<eos> I've come to fetch you home to Wuthering Heights.<eos> I've found a new tenant for this house, and I want my children about me.<eos> Go make yourself ready.<eos> I haven't been in this room since the night I returned.<eos> I've made the sexton remove the earth from her coffin.<eos> Aren't you ashamed to disturb the dead?<eos> I disturb nobody.<eos> I gave myself some ease... when I saw her face again.<eos> It is her as yet.
You're not convinced?<eos> I was always made to come here for the holidays.<eos> That isn't fair.<eos> While, of course, the company was fine...<eos> I should hope.<eos> my childhood wasn't all wonderful.<eos> Really?<eos> As a matter of fact, it wasn't.<eos> Perhaps...<eos> I don't know, perhaps it was... Perhaps it was too perfect... nothing was to disturb the surface of things.
Why didn't you kick him in the balls and tell him he has ugly children? I thought he'd appreciate a fresh point of view.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> He's the boss.<eos> - We're different.<eos> - Yes. Come Monday, I will still have a job.<eos> Hi, Mr Simpson.<eos> Is Gwen, yes?<eos> I remember. Beautiful Gwen from Hungary who speaks no English.<eos> That is a drawing of an engagement ring... which I designed and even built.<eos> But, as engagement rings go, it turned out to be a little... you know, "big" for the lady.
As a European, I was not allowed at the ceremony.<eos> But Minh Tam had obtained a meeting with Camille the day before the engagement.<eos> I saw emperor Ming Mang's tomb.<eos> He was 25 when he began searching for his burial place.<eos> He found the place, which resembled a dream he'd had.<eos> So he designed it. He planted trees, flowers, everything in gentle, continuous lines. Not a single broken line.<eos> And when the landscape was exactly like in his dream, he said:<eos> "I can die now."<eos> I dream of such a place too, but to live there.<eos> This place exists, Camille... it's yours.
You shouldn't act so proud, with what's said about Camille.<eos> And about you too, in Saigon!<eos> Yes, my dear Yvette, "how awful"!<eos> Today I staked out a parcel of land with Kim.<eos> For ten minutes I thought only of my rubber trees.<eos> And then while getting dressed<eos> Now I'm almost cheerful.<eos> Sometimes the despair diminishes.<eos> As if it's evaporated, gone.<eos> Sometimes it's suffocating.
These liberties have robbed dinner of its charm.<eos> Is Edouard's work good?<eos> He's improving.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Good night.<eos> With this weather, I'II be able to go to Bouveret.<eos> If the east wind stays, I'II get to go by Yvoire.<eos> I Iove this lake more than anything else...<eos> At dawn right before summer starts, it smells like cut hay.

Even for a hug.<eos> I bet you drove it with the top down even in the rain.<eos> Best time.<eos> I hope that when I die I'll have owned a sports car... had a family... a home.<eos> Mom died an old lady who never did anything with the top down.<eos> One day with the top down is better than a lifetime in a box.<eos> Groucho said he wouldn't belong to any club... that would have him as a member.<eos> I know what he meant, but with ivy it was different.<eos> Her acceptance didn't make me think less of her.<eos> It made me think more of me.
You have to reconsider your philosophy.<eos> All right, I'm sorry.<eos> Whatever you decide to do is inevitable. Look at my life.<eos> The life you tried to take.<eos> There was Annapolis, Vietnam, so on.<eos> I missed the 60s, and I believe if I had been there to contribute, everything would've been fine.<eos> Bill, if this is about reliving the 60s, you can forget it.<eos> The movement is dead.<eos> Hence the name.<eos> It moves a certain distance, then it stops.
We're jumping into a shit storm here.<eos> Must've been a power surge.<eos> That's the last one.<eos> This will disable their weapon systems within a half-hour.<eos> Mr. Ryback, may I have your attention, please?<eos> This is Captain Krill speaking.<eos> I'd like you to look at the monitors where you are at this point in time.<eos> Are you watching?<eos> I prepared a special show for you.<eos> Here it goes.
Jeroen<eos> Jeoroen<eos> Jeroen<eos> Jeroen Yes, sir<eos> Taste good?<eos> Really small?<eos> Just like little foot<eos> You know Galileo Travels?<eos> What is the name of place the Giant live?<eos> It was... Bradingo?
Is that possible?<eos> We have seen that echoes or after-images from previous loops appear as distortions in the dekyon field.<eos> We could send an echo into the next loop.<eos> - Like a message in a bottle?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> We could enhance a dekyon emission and send ourselves a message.<eos> Not a long one, only a few characters.<eos> Maybe one word.<eos> How will we know to pick up that word?<eos> If the dekyon emission is modulated correctly, it will set up resonances in my positronic subprocessors.
Yes, Mrs Cameron.<eos> There's a list of chores on the kitchen table.<eos> I'd like them completed by the time I return.<eos> I'll be out all afternoon.<eos> Yes, Mrs Cameron.<eos> (TYPEWRITER KEYS TAP) MAN: Mr Taylor, please.<eos> SECOND MAN: Dr Campbell?<eos> This way, please.<eos> Waiting for inspiration, Mr Simms?<eos> Well, it has to come from somewhere!
You came before your time.<eos> From now on, the use of off-screen voices such as narration in this film is prohibited by the authority vested in me as the director!<eos> Wait!<eos> Please.<eos> Please. You are going to protect us, aren't you?<eos> That's outside my contract.<eos> But please, can't you possibly...?<eos> Mr. Kawai, was it?<eos> Originally, an image isn't a dangerous thing at all.<eos> It's objective, fair, and if I may say so, democratic.
Come, Mr Prysock.<eos> I am staying at the Waldorf Hotel, Bertie.<eos> Kindly ask Cyril to contact me there this evening.<eos> Don't forget we're going to see Blumenfield's show tonight.<eos> Oh, no, indeed, Mr Prysock.<eos> Cyril should contact me this afternoon.<eos> Oh, Jeeves!<eos> You didn't give me any letter.<eos> Didn't I?<eos> It only would have depressed you.
I'm very grateful for your opinion, but I must say that what I had in mind from you was abject quivering apology.<eos> This is very sad, Jeeves, but I'll have to think seriously about your future.<eos> (Lady Florence) Are you a footman or an ostler?<eos> I trust that is not alcohol I smell.<eos> Drunkenness may be de rigueur in some houses, but I should be sorry to see it take hold here.<eos> - My lady. - Read these.<eos> They're an introduction - to the Theosophical Society.<eos> - Thank you, my lady.<eos> - Yes, Lady Florence.<eos> - Well, I've thought about your future, and I think it should continue in the vein of your immediate past.
So, what have you two come up with?<eos> We thought about this in a variety of ways but the basic idea is I play myself... - May I?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I think I can sum up the show for you with one word:<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> The show is about nothing.<eos> - It's not about nothing.

Now, you're not escaping another appointment, are you?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Oh, I suppose eventually we all have to live up to our obligations.<eos> Ah! Well, now, tell me. What brings you here to brighten my day?<eos> I wanted to say I'm sorry if I got you in any trouble. Oh.<eos> Oh, that's very sweet, dear, but I really wasn't in any trouble.<eos> Until I saw this dress.<eos> Ugh!<eos> Ugly, isn't it?<eos> - What's it for?
I want your analysis.<eos> Mr. Worf... fire phasers, maximum intensity limited spectrum, 001 mark 045.<eos> An experiment, Captain?<eos> Exactly, Number One.<eos> Firing phasers.<eos> Explanation, Mr. Data.<eos> Phaser energy was reflected by the gravitational wave fronts.<eos> It is similar to the phenomenon distorting our sensor signals.<eos> Phasers and sensors, both useless.<eos> Mr. Data, this reflection phenomenon... would it have the same effect on a disrupter-style weapon?
I'll have to run a base-pair correlation to see if there's any sign of DNA breakdown.<eos> Sir, Commander La Forge and I were planning to re-create the circumstances of the explosion on the Yosemite. And that might give us some answers.<eos> Permission to continue with the experiment?<eos> Granted.<eos> Tell Mr. O'Brien to take all the primary transporters off-line.<eos> I don't want to risk any further contaminations.<eos> Make sure you take all the necessary safety precautions.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> I'd like you to wear this monitoring device.<eos> It will tell me if there's the slightest sign of increased ionization.
Aye, sir.<eos> Okay.<eos> What would they have done first?<eos> Standard analysis begins with a resonance frequency scan.<eos> That sounds like a good place to start. Let's do that.<eos> DATA:<eos> Initiating resonance sweep.<eos> Frequency range at three--<eos> Barclay, check the containment field.<eos> The field is at its maximum limit, but it is holding.
I thought it was a good idea.<eos> I tried stamp collecting, building the little ships in a bottle.<eos> None of it seemed right.<eos> But I finally found the hobby that suits me.<eos> I'm reconstructing tomatoes... from ketchup.<eos> Mr. Chrome! Mr. Chrome!<eos> Mr. Chrome--<eos> Sir--<eos> Mr. Chrome, show's not over yet!<eos> Oh, it-- it is for me, pal.
- Go back to sleep.<eos> - Right.<eos> It ain't worth it.<eos> So you won the dogfight fair and square and I was dating the officer's wife for one night.<eos> - Roger that, Corporal.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> See what I mean?<eos> I do.<eos> Let me tell you something about bullshit.<eos> It's everywhere.
You'll see what I'm talking.<eos> The horror.<eos> The river, sleepless, crowded with memories of men and ships, hunters for gold and pursuers of fame.<eos> What greatness has not flowed on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth?<eos> The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires.<eos> The river is black tonight, my friends.<eos> Look, it seems to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.<eos> To me, the great hope is that now these little eight-millimeter video recorders and stuff are coming out, some people who normally wouldn't make movies are gonna be making them.<eos> And, you know, suddenly, one day, some little fat girl in Ohio is gonna be the new Mozart and make a beautiful film with her little father's camcorder.<eos> And, for once, the so-called professionalism about movies will be destroyed forever, you know, and it will really become an art form.
Men who remove all guilt by making murder a meaningless act of a loner.<eos> We've all become Hamlets in our country, children of a slain father-leader whose killers still possess the throne.<eos> The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us with the secret murder at the heart of the American Dream.<eos> He forces on us the appalling questions:<eos> Of what is our Constitution made?<eos> What are our lives worth? What is the future of a democracy where a President can be assassinated under suspicious circumstances while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles?<eos> How many more political murders disguised as heart attacks suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?<eos> How many plane and car crashes will occur before they are exposed for what they are?<eos> "Treason doth never prosper," wrote an English poet.<eos> "What's the reason? "For if it prosper, none dare call it treason. "
Pigeon.<eos> Scott Favor broke his heart.<eos> Sure is quiet.<eos> He's either in heaven or hell now.<eos> Be sure it isn't to hell.<eos> He's tried to be an honest sort.<eos> I'm the one who heard him cry out last night.<eos> He said, "God, God, God"... three or four times. And when I got there, I put my hand into the bed and felt his feet.<eos> And they were cold as stones.<eos> And I checked the rest of his body... and it, too, was as cold as stone.
We're calling your bluff.<eos> Now put your hands on top of your head and come out.<eos> We've got you surrounded front and... hey!<eos> Frank, what are you doing?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Frank!<eos> Frank!<eos> Help!<eos> - Your coat, sir?<eos> - Yes, it is.
Why won't you answer me?<eos> ! Please!<eos> - Good morning.<eos> I'm Donna Ferucchi.<eos> - I'm Gene Cassel with sports.<eos> And I'm Tim Langhorn.<eos> Our top story this morning:<eos> Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old daughter of Senator Ruth Martin listed as a missing person is believed to have been kidnapped by the killer known as "Buffalo Bill. " Memphis police say the missing girl's blouse has been identified sliced up the back, in what has become a kind of grim calling card.<eos> Young Catherine is the only daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin the Republican senator from Tennessee.<eos> And while her kidnapping is not considered politically motivated it has stirred the government to its highest levels.
Does she remind you of Alice?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - Not at all?<eos> I often have... that strange and penetrating dream, of an unknown woman... whom I love and who loves me.<eos> And every time, she's neither quite the same... nor completely different...<eos> and she loves me... and understands me...<eos> Is she a brunette... a blonde or a redhead?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Her name.<eos> I remember it's soft and melodious. Like life's exiled lovers.
Oh, lordy, you didn't tell him I was with old sweet cheeks here?<eos> When he saw me, miss, he leapt to that conclusion himself.<eos> - Was he cross?<eos> - l could not say.<eos> A dark hue suffused his cheek and he attempted to kick a passing cat.<eos> I'd better get back to the yacht and explain things.<eos> After all this time, he still thinks Bertie and I are madly in love.<eos> My dratted engagement to Pauline Stoker seems to dog the footsteps.<eos> Indeed it does, sir.<eos> It only lasted two days and I was unconscious most of the time.
Do get a move on, Jeeves.<eos> "The tall young man smiled crookedly, "lifting his oil-grimed hands in helpless apology.<eos> "Myrtle's eyes flashed.<eos> She tossed her blonde curls.<eos> "She was not to know that this figure in stained overalls<eos> "and with a worn cloth cap set at a jaunty angle atop a head of unruly curls,<eos> "was the 14th Earl Strathmorlick of Strathmorlick,<eos> "Lord High Keeper of Dunoon Castle, "and laird of ten thousand fertile acres in his native Dumfriesshire."<eos> I do trust that your experience in St Monica's has not spoilt your taste for adoption, sir.<eos> I must confess it has given me pause, Jeeves.
Crosstown traffic.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We were just about to extract a confession from your client.<eos> Extract this, Logan.<eos> Ms. Fahey's a hell of a lawyer.<eos> You don't have to say anything you don't want to.<eos> Don't worry, he hasn't.<eos> All right, all right, Christian, your attorney is here now... so, what about it, hmm?<eos> Hmm?<eos> It was in your jacket...
It was this morning.<eos> I got up late, after last night's concert.<eos> We had Nacora in the play. And Katherine Bird.<eos> I came into the room...<eos> - My beautiful emerald necklace!<eos> - But it is insured, Mr. Hardman.<eos> - Insured?<eos> - Is it?<eos> Of course it's insured, but that is not the point.<eos> It is irreplaceable.

So fine, I figure, that's where this relationship is finally gonna settle.<eos> Polite nodding.<eos> Then one day he doesn't nod.<eos> Like I don't exist?<eos> He went from nods to nothing.<eos> Now there's this intense animosity whenever we pass.<eos> I mean, it's like we really hate each other.<eos> It's based on nothing.<eos> A relationship is an organism.<eos> You created this thing and then you starved it, so it turned against you.
-You don't know what you do?<eos> -No.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> -You're very tense.<eos> -Coffee.<eos> Too much coffee.<eos> Take off those pants.<eos> I'll work the hamstring.<eos> Oh, the hamstring's fine.<eos> -But you wrote that it was tender.
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.<eos> Worried somebody's gonna pee on it?<eos> - It's Purple 23.<eos> Remember that.<eos> - Oh, I got it.<eos> That I'm supposed to remember.<eos> Where the car is, that's insignificant.<eos> I think they're labouring.<eos> Look at this place!<eos> It's huge!
So it seems you have another dilemma one that questions your convictions.<eos> Well, I've never been afraid of reevaluating my convictions, Professor and now, well, I have 20 million reasons to do so.<eos> And why did you ask to see me?<eos> Because your presence gives me a potential access to a kind of information that I've never had available to me before and if I am to reexamine my beliefs then I must take advantage of every possible asset.<eos> It would have been irresponsible of me not to ask you here.<eos> However you come to terms with your beliefs, Captain I must tell you, I'm quite comfortable with mine.<eos> How can you be?<eos> How can you be comfortable watching people die?<eos> Um... let me put it to you this way.<eos> If I were to tell you that none of those people died you'd easily conclude that you tried your solution and it succeeded so you'd confidently try again.
You will just have...<eos> Darmok and JaIad at Tanagra.<eos> Temba!<eos> His arms wide.<eos> I'II go along with that.<eos> Commander sensors are picking up an electromagnetic disturbance approaching the Captain's position.<eos> analysis?<eos> A variable induction fieId-- possibly a Iife-form.<eos> How close is it to the Captain?<eos> The field is erratic, appearing and disappearing but it appears to be moving toward him.
Stand by to fire, Mr. Worf.<eos> Commander the Tamarian's bioscan is becoming unreadable.<eos> He may be dead, sir.<eos> If we know that, so do the Tamarians.<eos> Riker to La Forge.<eos> La Forge here.<eos> I need those phasers.<eos> Sir.<eos> Sensors are tracking the entity.<eos> It is approaching Captain Picard's position.
Let's move the containers over to here.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> It'll buy us some time.<eos> You know, we're going to have to do this by hand.<eos> With all the radiation floating around in here we can't trust the anti-grav units.<eos> There... just before the second time we were hit.<eos> See the subspace distortion?<eos> Yes.<eos> How big is a quantum filament?<eos> Well, it could be hundreds of meters long but it has almost no mass which makes it very difficult to detect.

Doctor, have you ever scanned your samples for gamma radiation?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> We are seeing high-energy reactions that may show up in a gamma scan.<eos> And if they do, we might find a pattern, a kind of marker left behind by the entity.<eos> It's a good idea, Data.<eos> Frankly, I just don't see what that would get us.<eos> If the entity left a residual trace of antiproton in the samples we collected, a gamma-radiation scan would reveal that.<eos> Getting that readout now, Data.<eos> If we try a logarithmic scale, we will have better resolution.<eos> - There it is.
Getting that readout now, Data.<eos> If we try a logarithmic scale, we will have better resolution.<eos> - There it is.<eos> See it? - Yes.<eos> Doctor?<eos> A sharp spike at 10 keV.<eos> Another.<eos> A pattern.<eos> So we know the entity leaves antiprotons behind.<eos> If it also deposits antiprotons in space as it travels, can we detect them?
But let's hope we don't have to use them.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> If we can possibly avoid firing on it, then I would hope...<eos> Aren't you going to kill it?<eos> Perhaps you should join me in my Ready Room.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why are we pursuing the entity if not to destroy it?<eos> We're not hunters, doctor, nor is it our role to exact revenge.<eos> What do you propose?<eos> We track it down, greet it warmly, and ask it if it would mind terribly not ravaging any more planets?
It's activating the reticular formation.<eos> There's heavy synaptic activity all over the place.<eos> I wonder what happens after prolonged exposure.<eos> Speed up the processor and we'll find out.<eos> The effects seem centered around the frontal lobe.<eos> Computer, enhance frontal lobe, full spectrum.<eos> It's stimulating the septal area.<eos> That's the pleasure center of the brain.<eos> Whatever this thing does, it must feel pretty good.<eos> No wonder it's so popular.
- Good. - Permit me to withdraw.<eos> Will you and your wife be at the State dinner?<eos> We're looking forward to it.<eos> It's years since old Pardek has been invited to an official function.<eos> He's too attached to the common man for most people.<eos> That is their loss.<eos> I find Pardek has unique insight into many issues.<eos> Let me tell you, Spock, we're going to start something here, that will redraw the face of the quadrant.<eos> Are you prepared to support reunification?<eos> I believe it must eventually come.
Take a seat, please.<eos> Excuse me, I'm finishing a speech.<eos> For you, Mr Spock.<eos> I enjoy writing.<eos> I don't do it often in this job.<eos> Maybe you would be happier in another job.<eos> Feel free to change any words. I've tried to make it sound Vulcan.<eos> A lot of unnecessarily long words.<eos> In a few hours, you will deliver this statement with our proconsul.<eos> It will announce that a peace envoy is on its way from Romulus.
- Thanks, Harry.<eos> Well, no fibers, no prints.<eos> You were right.<eos> If it is Earle, he didn't miss a beat.<eos> Did you hear anything from Denise?<eos> The Bureau and the DEA cleared me of all criminal charges.<eos> The suspension still stands.<eos> I'm waiting to hear from Gordon.<eos> In the meantime, you're still my deputy.<eos> If you want this case, it's yours.
That didn't hurt very much... because I know the ancient art of karate.<eos> Karate focuses the mind and gives one self-confidence.<eos> People from all walks of life: - doctors...<eos> -Hi-yaah! - homemakers... - Hu-yaah!<eos> High karate at low, low prices.<eos> I cannot tell a lie. This is a great deal. Hohh!<eos> Hey, Mom, how about... if I learn karate?<eos> Will that make you happy?<eos> That sounds fine.<eos> See, you knock TV, and then it helps you out.
And it usually works.<eos> Cheap son of a....<eos> Homer, breakfast is ready.<eos> Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake.<eos> I finally understand the meaning of....<eos> -Of what?<eos> -Better half.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Where's the letter?<eos> Where is it?

! Marge?<eos> Homer!<eos> Marge!<eos> Holy cow, you're as big as a house!<eos> Homer, come home with me.<eos> No, Marge, I can't.<eos> I mean, look at me.<eos> I'm a trainee. They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce.<eos> And I can't buy you a decent wedding ring.<eos> Any ring is fine, as long as it's from you.
Will it stay puffed like that?<eos> Sure, why not?<eos> Mr. Agopian made me sleep on my back.<eos> Don't bother with that.<eos> Come in Saturday, I'll comb it for you.<eos> That's nice of you.<eos> Till Saturday.<eos> What got into you the other day?<eos> You were probably making fun of me, but... if you weren't teasing, then I appreciate your proposal.<eos> If it still holds, yes,
He's the guy that was sitting at the table behind ours without talking to anyone all evening.<eos> Then, outside, he got the cab that we were trying to flag down.<eos> But he insisted that we take it, so Nick insisted that he come along too... so that there should be no ill feeling.<eos> What it shows is that a kind of belief is innate in all of us.<eos> At some point most of us lose that... after which it can only be regained by a conscious act of faith.<eos> You've experienced that?<eos> Uh, no, I haven't.<eos> I-I hope to someday.<eos> Actually, it wasn't my cab.<eos> I was just there waiting for the light to change when it pulled up.
Miss!<eos> Miss!<eos> Stop!<eos> Open up!<eos> There's trouble down here.<eos> Miss!<eos> Open the door, asshole!<eos> The window was walled up, Bob!<eos> The window was walled up!<eos> Of course it was.
Which way is that?<eos> In the morning the sun would be easterly. I think we can assume that.<eos> That it's morning?<eos> If it is, and the sun is over there, for instance, that would be northerly.<eos> On the other hand, if it is not morning and the sun is over there. that would still be northerly.<eos> To put it another way, if we came from down there, and it's morning, the sun would be up there... but if is actually, over there, and it's still morning, we must have come from back there and if that is southerly, and the sun is really over there... then it's the afternoon.<eos> However, if none of these is the case.<eos> Why don't you go and have a look?<eos> Pragmatism! Is that all you have to offer?<eos> I merely suggest the position of the sun... if it is out, would give you a rough idea of the time.
- In her room.<eos> She comes every Wednesday when they play tennis.<eos> She's so stupid.<eos> - It's me, Auntie.<eos> - What a surprise.<eos> The new wallpaper's lovely.<eos> - This is for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Don't kiss me near my ear.<eos> It buzzes.
You know, that woman's got the sweetest nature.<eos> Splendid view of the festivities, eh?<eos> Didn't you come last year?<eos> I say!<eos> Look at that! What a display!<eos> Beautiful.<eos> I think I'll run inside and get a coat.<eos> Oh, let me.<eos> You wouldn't know where to find it.<eos> Oh, Maggie, get mine, too. It's in my room.
He would have been a...<eos> I don't know. A kind of a world hero.<eos> His uncle would have come round in the end, anyway.<eos> Yes. Yes, I see.<eos> I never told anyone, not even Freddie.<eos> Even when the uncle of Michael Seton died a week ago?<eos> It seemed boastful... while the papers were full of Michael's flight.<eos> Michael would have hated that.<eos> Mademoiselle, you once mentioned you had made a will.<eos> Where is it, this will?
I got a lot of good ideas.<eos> Trouble is, most of them suck.<eos> I got a lot of good ideas for new products like that.<eos> That's what I think about on my off duty hours, things we need, products we ought to have that we don't have.<eos> You know what we ought to have, we ought to have a diet salad dressing called 500 Islands.<eos> See, good God damn ideas, like that, huh?<eos> A Christian deodorant, Thou Shalt Not Smell.<eos> How about a feminine hygiene spray called Sprunt.<eos> Huh? Well, you'd never forget the name, would you?<eos> It would always be on the tip of your tongue, see?
Shell shock.<eos> Almost sounds like the guns themselves.<eos> That was 70 years ago.<eos> Then a whole generation went by, and the Second World War came along and the very same combat condition was called battle fatigue.<eos> Four syllables now, it takes a little longer to say, doesn't seem to hurt as much.<eos> Fatigue is a nicer word than shock.<eos> Shell shock, battle fatigue.<eos> Then we had the war in Korea in 1950,<eos> Madison Avenue was riding high by that time, and the very same combat condition was called Operational Exhaustion.<eos> Hey, we're up to eight syllables now, and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase, it's totally sterile now.
I got some more shopping for you to do.<eos> Find me an attorney. OK?<eos> Almost the best that money can buy.<eos> No, I'm not in trouble.<eos> I'm gonna get outta my contract.<eos> I don't care if it's expensive.<eos> Listen.<eos> Elaine!<eos> I have struck gold here.<eos> Actually, it struck me.
- How did you know?<eos> - lt was in Dr Sanderson's journal.<eos> Oh.<eos> I didn't even know he had a wife.<eos> Until the funeral, that is.<eos> Her picture's in the file, isn't it?<eos> - (Ed) Why don't you use any lights?<eos> - (Kim) I like source.<eos> - You do? Why?<eos> - Because it delivers reality.
Dirty swine!<eos> I beg your pardon, Lady Millicent.<eos> How much is he asking?<eos> 20,000 pounds.<eos> I doubt if I could raise a thousand even!<eos> - And you have seen this letter?<eos> - Yes. I went to his house in Wimbledon.<eos> He held it up for me to see.<eos> I tried to snatch it but he was too quick for me.<eos> So where is it now?
-Who the hell is that?<eos> -Bullwinkle.<eos> -Who's that?<eos> -Underdog. Don't you know anything?<eos> They should use cartoons made in the last 50 years.<eos> This is a tradition.<eos> If you build a balloon for every cartoon character you'll turn the parade into a farce.<eos> Maggie!<eos> I'm about to unveil my centerpiece.<eos> It's a tribute to the women who made our country great.
All right!<eos> Two birds with one stone!<eos> Okay, everybody out!<eos> Some of the players you see may make it to the big leagues.<eos> -Will we see washed-up major leaguers?<eos> -Sure, there's a nice mix.<eos> There's no better place to spend a balmy summers' night.<eos> The grass of the outfield, the brick of the infield and the chalk lines that divide the man from the boy.<eos> Lisa, you're forgetting the beer.<eos> It comes in 72-ounce tubs.
A popular supermarket tabloid has offered a reward of$5,000... to anyone who brings in the creature alive.<eos> Naturally, we'll have more on this story as it develops.<eos> We now return you to the president's address already in progress.<eos> It looks as if you girls have been getting along all right, but it's a darn good thing we found you when we did.<eos> There's something horrible roaming these woods.<eos> There is?<eos> Why, that's my husband!<eos> His name isn't Bigfoot.<eos> His name is Homer.<eos> - What does it eat?
He moved.<eos> - This is too creepy.<eos> I don't like this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, Shel...<eos> Okay, maybe you're right.<eos> I mean, I don't want to exploit him or nothing.<eos> Sorry, Leo.<eos> We sort of got carried away.<eos> No need to make your rehabilitation any more difficult than it already is.
- Hey!<eos> I don't know who to love more:<eos> my son, Joshua, who's captain of the footballteam,:<eos> or my daughter, Amber, who got the lead in the school play.<eos> Usually, I use their grades as a tiebreaker, but they both got straight A's this term.<eos> - What's a mother to do?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Well, I sense greatness in my family.<eos> - Your family?<eos> Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there.
What this has all been leading up to, if you haven't already guessed, Tony, is that I'm going to have to fire you from your job.<eos> Control, I'm slightly at a loss for words.<eos> Believe me when I tell you, Tony, that this isn't easy for me at all.<eos> In fact, it's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in all my years as Head of the Secret Service.<eos> I certainly don't envy you having to pass on a bit of news like the one you've just passed on to me.<eos> That's very understanding of you, Tony. Well, Control, I suppose that's that, then.<eos> Yes, Tony, it is.<eos> Well, Control, may I take this opportunity of saying how much I've enjoyed working for you, and wish you the best of luck in all your future spying?<eos> Thank you, Tony. And I can tell you that this place just won't be the same without you.<eos> No, I suppose it'll be quite different, won't it, Control? Because I won't be here.
Leonard has Parkinson's disease?<eos> No.<eos> Um, well, his symptoms are like parkinson's<eos> But, then again, they're not. Then what will this medicine do for him?<eos> I don't know what it will do for him, if anything at all.<eos> What do you think it will do?<eos> I'm not sure<eos> Because it was designed for a totally different disorder.<eos> What do you hope it will do?<eos> I hope it will bring him back from wherever he is.
What made you realize it wasn't a dream?<eos> When I spoke and you understood me.<eos> You told him I was a kind man.<eos> How kind is it to give life Only to take it away again?<eos> It's given and taken away from all of us.<eos> Why doesn't that comfort me?<eos> Because you are a kind man.<eos> Because he's your friend.<eos> Sayer: The summer was extraordinary.<eos> It was a season of rebirth and innocence.
Now!<eos> At Clamp Enterprises we want you to achieve all you can.<eos> Turn on the lights in my office.<eos> You want me to work in the dark?<eos> This is new.<eos> Phoebe, come on, hurry!<eos> Hey, that's Clamp!<eos> Let's go!<eos> - Has the building been evacuated?<eos> - Is it on fire?
- So I'll see you later then?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Bring me a Scotch and a bottle of whatever Mrs. Talbot's drinking.<eos> I had a professor in law school who'd say:<eos> " Don't ever let a case beat you down.<eos> Always trust what you feel inside."<eos> But he wasn't a litigator.<eos> He was dropping pearls of wisdom on young, idealistic students.<eos> You're trusting your heart.<eos> And you're going to get it broken.
No, I'm not behind.<eos> No, on schedule.<eos> Don't be like that.<eos> When we get to Cairo, we'll have done 2,000 Miles - about 12th of the circumnavigation.<eos> Sheffield United beat Newcastle?<eos> What?<eos> Passepartout, not interested in football, Is getting bored and prowls the deck In search of innocent victims.<eos> Swine!<eos> It's only near land That sea travel becomes interesting.<eos> In the Corinth Canal, it becomes spectacular!
How about that?<eos> There we are, a "P".<eos> Blob at the end for an artistic touch.<eos> There we are... A nice "P".<eos> How about that?<eos> This bit's boring, so go and film some Arty shots of sea while I have some Chianti.<eos> That's enough of that!<eos> My last meal in Europe.<eos> The mâitre d', Eros, Presents me with my handiwork.<eos> Alas, it no longer resembles a "P".
Thought you went back to Mexico to be with your family.<eos> I did go, but my daughters, they were all married and gone.<eos> And my wife, she was harder to get along with than ever.<eos> So I came back.<eos> Where are all the others?<eos> Jake's buried up in Kansas.<eos> Deets in Montana.<eos> Gus is in a little stand of pecan trees alongside a creek where he used to picnic with a woman.<eos> The rest of the boys are up in the north country, building a ranch.<eos> They say it burned down about a year ago.
- Tell me, Ace!<eos> - Excuse me!<eos> I must speak with you.<eos> - I need your help, Doctor.<eos> - Yes.<eos> It can't be easy being so far away from home, struggling to adapt to an alien environment.<eos> - I'm as human as you are.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm afflicted with an enemy... a vile and base creature pitted against me.<eos> It's waiting for me now.
Yours truly, Hugo Cornworthy, Secretary.<eos> P.S. Please bring this letter with you."<eos> Repeat that, if you please, Hastings.<eos> "Dear sir --"<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just the postscript.<eos> "P.S. Please bring this letter with you."<eos> Why?<eos> Why, Hastings?<eos> An interesting letter.<eos> Is it? I thought it was rather dull.
They did not present all the facts.<eos> So, everything was pointing to the butler.<eos> - Billet what yes?<eos> - Yes, au questionne.<eos> Because of his post, she was the only person what had a motive, and the opportunity of poisoning the sherry.<eos> But the writer arranged a slow police officer and he cheap-speaks, to summarize the whole case in a secondary childlike plot.<eos> - The door was opened.<eos> - Between, Inspector.<eos> One seems to treat a banal case.<eos> I am afraid that it is not worthy his attention, Poirot.
No, I just couldn't.<eos> Or am I thinking of bus lanes?<eos> "Underneath the bellied skies Where dust and rain find space to fall "To fall and lie and change again Without a care or mind at all<eos> "For art and life and things above "In that, there, look just there "No right left up down past or future<eos> Hugh, you chose that poem.<eos> Um, for God's sake, why?<eos> I chose it for a number of reasons, Stephen.<eos> - Chief amongst them being?<eos> - Well...<eos> Can I perhaps turn that question round and say, "Because it was short"?
Evolve your way out of that one.<eos> No way out now!<eos> - No changing!<eos> - You are the most unhappy creature.<eos> - I shall look after you.<eos> - They swapped over.<eos> We have work to do.<eos> Entries to devise to complete the catalogue.<eos> No nukes?<eos> Isn't it going to explode?
- Hey !<eos> I don't know who to love more.:<eos> my son,Joshua, who's captain of the football team,:<eos> or my daughter, Amber, who got the lead in the school play.<eos> Usually, I use their grades as a tiebreaker, but they both got straight A's this term.<eos> - What's a mother to do ?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Well, I sense greatness in my family.<eos> - Your family ?<eos> Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there.
Unimaginably penetrating, intense eyes, I assumed.<eos> I wonder if it was just a coincidence that I specialized in ophthalmology.<eos> I'm so proud of you, Judah.<eos> Sharon is, we all are.<eos> All together.<eos> - Why did you write the letter?<eos> - We've been through it.<eos> You wanna destroy my family?<eos> I want her to know her husband.<eos> It was lying there all day.
- He's rich and he's a success.<eos> - Give me a little credit.<eos> I always did give you a little credit until today.<eos> We used to laugh at him.<eos> The silly shows he puts on, the way he talks.<eos> He's endearing.<eos> This is my worst fear realized.<eos> I wanted to give you this letter back.<eos> - It's my one love letter.<eos> - It's beautiful.
Young men only interested in fighting and killing.<eos> Yes but has it always been like that? Since the beginning of time?<eos> - What do you see, Erik?<eos> - I see... the world.<eos> Is it night or day, Erik?<eos> - It is day, of course, Freya.<eos> - Is it winter or summer, Erik?<eos> The winter has passed. It is... summer.<eos> Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?<eos> No, it's up beyond the clouds where it always is.
We haven't thought about the consequences, Oppie.<eos> - Oppie?<eos> - Wilson!<eos> We've been waiting for the data for two weeks.<eos> When are we gonna get it?<eos> Wilson is correct.<eos> We have to talk about what we're all thinking but not saying.<eos> This argument is arcane, Edward.<eos> This thing is becoming real.<eos> It's going to affect lives, thousands of lives.
Is she too busy?<eos> What does this have to do with you?<eos> That's what I have to find out.<eos> We are behind on the mortgage.<eos> That field ate up all of our savings. We could lose this farm.<eos> I won't even stay in motels.<eos> I'll sleep in the car. I'll beg for food.<eos> No. Now, this is too much.<eos> I understand your need to prove to yourself and to the world you are not turning into your father, but you have.<eos> You believed in the magic. It happened.
They would remain in here and only be used in case of a nuclear emergency that would threaten the country.<eos> And only under strict control!<eos> But then, Godzilla came along and the rest is history.<eos> As for myself, I hate the idea of the cells being locked up.<eos> These are the Godzilla cells?<eos> Japan was devastated by nuclear bombs, and we now have Godzilla...<eos> It's only fair that we use it as a weapon, that will protect us from our enemies.<eos> An earthquake?<eos> A powerful eruption occurred at Mt. Mihara, on Oshima Island, a short time ago...<eos> It caused a series of tremors that were felt throughout the Kanto region.
In case any physical sign of G's action, such as voice and motion is confirmed.<eos> The Super-X2 has been substantially improved with the installation of the latest on-board supercomputer, that controls automatic and remote functions.<eos> It's also submersible, capable of operating at such extreme depths as 10,000 meters.<eos> Its armor is also the latest, TA-32.<eos> It's twice as durable as the titanium-alloy on the Super-X.<eos> Right.<eos> This way, please.<eos> That is called the Fire-Mirror.<eos> It was completely constructed with synthetic diamonds.<eos> If the mirror is hit with Godzilla's radioactive breath it will return its attack a thousand-fold.
What if he does?<eos> He's not going to tell me to put it back.<eos> Believe me, I know this guy.<eos> That bonsai shop was his dream come true.<eos> - He won't have me put it back.<eos> - I don't think we should be doing this.<eos> I saw his face when he lost his job.<eos> Believe me, I know what I'm doing.<eos> But what about the tree?<eos> Isn't it going to die?
Look inside of yourself<eos> And listen Listen to your heart<eos> Sure looked defeated when you came home tonight<eos> I know that you're discouraged<eos> Tired of the fight<eos> Sometimes it gets so hard<eos> That you don't know what to do<eos> If you close your eyes the truth is there for you<eos> Listen to your heart<eos> It knows right from wrong
Listen to your heart<eos> It knows right from wrong<eos> Let it guide you<eos> Listen to your heart<eos> It will make you strong<eos> Look inside of yourself<eos> And listen to your<eos> Heart<eos> Listen to your heart<eos> It knows right from wrong
I got the idea for it after we met the first time.<eos> But I really haven't got the girl's face right.<eos> I've been waiting for you to come back to get it right.<eos> - You mean, that's me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Would you be my model?<eos> But I'm not very beautiful.<eos> Why do you want me?<eos> You've got a great face.<eos> Besides, it's prettier than it was the last time.
-You didn't.<eos> -l thought I told you about her.<eos> She teaches political science I met her the night I did the show in Lansing.<eos> -There's no milk in here.<eos> -Wait.<eos> What is she-- What is she like?<eos> Oh, she's really great.<eos> She's got a real warmth about her.<eos> And she's really bright and really pretty.<eos> And the conversation, though, I mean, it was....
IMAGES OF THE WEEK<eos> For the third year running, Algiers is seeing a number of campers from France and elsewhere flying in to enjoy a holiday.<eos> Thanks to Air France, what was once the preserve of millionaires is now a popular weekend break.<eos> "A camel to suit any budget" would be... a good slogan for Camp Matifou.<eos> I had the urge to go and join her, to see what she was plotting.<eos> But she might have misinterpreted my move.<eos> And I was afraid a colleague from Cahiers might see me with her.<eos> Fowl plague is an infectious disease which afflicts all farmyard birds but, under natural conditions, the most significant losses occur among chickens.<eos> Scientists have been aware of this disease since the late 19th century.<eos> It seems to have been identified for the first time in Italy by Perroncito in 1878.
Well, where will I dry the washing?<eos> Come on, Kay.<eos> It'll be lovely- our anniversary tree.<eos> What about the roots, Lou?<eos> They spread in under the house.<eos> That kind of damage costs a fortune.<eos> Kay!<eos> Let's not do it.<eos> I don't want this tree.<eos> It's yellow and sick.
That kind of damage costs a fortune.<eos> Kay!<eos> Let's not do it.<eos> I don't want this tree.<eos> It's yellow and sick.<eos> Jesus!<eos> See ya.<eos> Uh, it's a good tree, Kay.<eos> That yellow, it's nothing.<eos> What if it does die?
That's Broken Heart.<eos> - Kay?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Thunder!<eos> Thunder!<eos> Giddyap!<eos> Our tree's gone.<eos> That's strange.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got it looking nice.
There's someone with her.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm coming in.<eos> Surprise!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You know you're not allowed.<eos> You broke the bloody window.<eos> I'm really mad at you.<eos> It wouldn't open, Kay.
There's a secret.<eos> It's called tapping.<eos> I tweaked the company's equipment to do it.<eos> Every time you call the Banana club, I can pick up the call.<eos> Why would you do such a thing?<eos> First of all, I Iike your voice.<eos> secondly, I Iike your face.<eos> I can see in your face that you're not the type who takes life too seriously.<eos> And I Iike your body.<eos> However much I hurt it, it bounces back.
There you are, job done at a fraction of the cost.<eos> It's not so easy to remember when you're caught up in the work though, is it?<eos> Exactly, that's why I suggest that you follow my infallible method.<eos> Oh, what's that?<eos> Now, observe, calum, and inwardly digest what I am about to demonstrate.<eos> Memorize the desirable length of silk or catgut that you mean to use and close your eyes.<eos> Form a mental picture of intense clarity...<eos> Got it!<eos> The image now resides up here.<eos> Forgotten until the need arises when it will spring instantly into mental view.
It'll make you badly, thou knows.<eos> I'm not here to discuss my health.<eos> Have you got a sick animal?<eos> Sick animal, did you say?<eos> I'm not a veterinary, thou knows, it's up to thee to judge.<eos> Come on then, where is it?<eos> - Where's what?<eos> If you don't show me the animal, I am getting back in my car and I am going.<eos> Your animal then may die unattended and you'll be out of pocket.<eos> So for the last time, where is it?
- Aye, poor old lad's looking right poorly.<eos> All right, mollie.<eos> I'll come out straightaway.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm afraid he really is very bad.<eos> Aye, knew as much the minute I saw him.<eos> He's in a coma and even if I-- say the truth of it, Mr. herriot.<eos> We've known each other too long to start saying aught else.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll give him a stimulant, but I don't think it'll work this time.
His name is Feodor.<eos> Fedka?<eos> No, I do not remember.<eos> Do not you lose it in the cards would he now be killed?<eos> Shatov, listen.<eos> First of all, you need to determine Is it important to Shakespeare jug of kerosene?<eos> I say yes!<eos> Yes, Shakespeare, Raphael higher Socialism, above chemistry, above all!<eos> Humanity may well not live without Englishmen, as well as without the Germans, and even more so - without the Russian.<eos> It can live without bread, without science.

This woman roof ... it does?<eos> It is necessary to pull it, it will fall!<eos> Vain!<eos> The fire is no longer in homes he minds!<eos> We must all give up!<eos> All.<eos> The emergence of a new substance -- great mystery, inexplicable.<eos> Sometimes I begin to think that humanity completely.<eos> As we live in perfect harmony.<eos> This feeling is undeniable, it comes five or six seconds.
-Did you get soaked, Ginny?<eos> -Begin, Mr Cope.<eos> -Of course I didn't.<eos> -Very well.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> In this will your late husband left you a life interest in his entire estate.<eos> After your death it is to be distributed equally among the children.
Thank you.<eos> Poirot and I are old friends.<eos> We were together in India.<eos> In Burma, I believe it was.<eos> What on earth has brought you out here, old chap?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> A nose for murder, perhaps.<eos> Murder?<eos> Where?<eos> Oh, no, it hasn't happened yet.
- Then by--<eos> - Betelgeuse.<eos> Strike!<eos> Let's roll!<eos> Then by the authority vested in me--<eos> - The ring please.<eos> - The ring!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> I've got it, honey.<eos> Here it is. Here you go.
And to be made happy yourself? I...<eos> Of course not.<eos> We loved each other once, didn't we?<eos> I think it was love.<eos> And you made me very happy.<eos> And I could again. We just untied the knot. It was never broken.<eos> Illusions of course, are by their nature sweet.<eos> I have no illusions. I lost them on my travels.<eos> Now I want to come home.<eos> As for this present infatuation, it won't last but for the moment, it is beyond my control.
- No, I'm a reader, not a repeater.<eos> I'm old and you mustn't contradict me.<eos> - Can I change my bedside-man now?<eos> - Of course, madame.<eos> Tell me how you like them.<eos> Gorky: "Lenin and the Russian peasant".<eos> "What was exceptionally great in him was his ardent conviction that sorrow is not the necessary basis of being but an evil which man must and should sweep away."<eos> Not bad.<eos> Or else Lenin:<eos> "Marx's doctrine is all-powerful because it is fair, complete, harmonious".
I've brought a beautiful work by Marguerite Duras,<eos> "The Lover".<eos> "Fifteen and a half.<eos> It's the crossing of the river."<eos> "I'm wearing a silk dress.<eos> It's worn, almost transparent."<eos> "It was my mother's.<eos> One day, thinking it too light, she gave it to me."<eos> "This dress is sleeveless and very low-cut."<eos> "It has the brownish tones that silk takes on with age."

You know, people...<eos> On the council, for example, there are reds and whites.<eos> Just imagine, I had complaints from both.<eos> The carnations were highly unpopular.<eos> The florists felt you were invading their patch.<eos> And this one...<eos> Fortunately, you were there to prevent her falling.<eos> Had her husband seen her, from where he is, making fun of a perfectly well-organised, peaceful demonstration.<eos> Unworthy.<eos> Reading is fine, but look where it leads.
That outfit does not spell "defence."<eos> -What does it spell?<eos> -"Barbara."<eos> Do you still prefer McDonald's for work experience?<eos> -Miguel!<eos> -McDonald's for work experience.<eos> -l'm having second thoughts.<eos> -Not now, Miguel.<eos> Ms McLaughlin, I'm considering Long John Silver's.<eos> I looked into the future and it may be fish.
- The law is the law.<eos> That's a comfort.<eos> I of course allow you to hire a lawyer.<eos> We'll examine within 48 hours your provisional release but, until then, I'm really sorry...<eos> Seraphin Monge!<eos> The village is going to try to get you. You must leave.<eos> For ever.<eos> Crime poisons everything.<eos> Assassins and victims.<eos> And it's catching.
- It's not easy to say.<eos> Are you very very sad?<eos> She was much more than my sister.<eos> - You can't understand.<eos> - I can. Because, now, there are two of us.<eos> Look at Seraphin:<eos> he's alone, truly alone, because he hasn't got anything to give.<eos> But I need you.<eos> - I'll never leave you.<eos> Seraphin, you're not going to believe this, but I'm sure I left my ring on the stone, here, and it disappeared.
Don't confuse sex and love, Mr. Hart.<eos> It'll spoil both of them for you.<eos> Have you ever been in love?<eos> I understand Stone made his money in the rubber trade.<eos> Bertie?<eos> I guess you could call it that.<eos> Bertie invented the first really effective prophylactic but now he's obsessed with buying the best collection of modern art in Europe.<eos> There's to be an exhibit of his latest purchases in about two weeks' time.<eos> I wouldn't fight with him if I were you.<eos> I like your face the way it is.
Come on, get him!<eos> - Michael?<eos> - Katie, are you okay?<eos> - Michael got away.<eos> - No way.<eos> He told us to meet him here, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This place?<eos> Nobody's been here for years.<eos> It's kind of spooky.
Later.<eos> Later.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> That bitch Ivan sleeps with had the nerve to call me.<eos> He should be more discreet.<eos> Why haven't I thrown those out?<eos> Dad wouldn't let you. I could sell them at the store, you know?<eos> I like wearing them.<eos> It's as if time stood still.<eos> Well, it hasn't stood still.
- How are the girls?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Where's Candela?<eos> In your room.<eos> Did anything happen? No, no.<eos> Did you see the lawyer?<eos> Yes. I'll tell you about it later.<eos> You mind my wearing your dress?<eos> Keep it.<eos> It looks nicer on you.
- No...<eos> They were taken down at Ludwig's docks.<eos> A Panamanian ship came in... lt wasn't on Ludwig's records.<eos> Probably an oversight.<eos> How is your... meat?<eos> You be the judge of that.<eos> I've got nine more.<eos> - Have you seen that ship?<eos> - l don't know.<eos> It doesn't look like one of ours.
Get a good night's sleep.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> Bingo!<eos> "20 million deposited, Omani Bank, Zurich, upon proof of Queen's death"?<eos> Entering without a search warrant, destroying property, arson, sexual assault with a concrete dildo...<eos> What the hell were you doing there in the first place?<eos> Sorry, Your Honour, but we have reason to believe that Ludwig is involved in a plot to assassinate the Queen.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> Where is this evidence?<eos> Well, it burned in the fire.
We'll be back soon!<eos> Ulf, come on, hurry up.<eos> Always to the front or too far behind.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's what I told you before.<eos> We're tunneling through the Earth.<eos> All of us.<eos> We are using a engine.<eos> The engine is going to shaft for breaking the rock and dirt.<eos> The engine you see, it mixes fast enough... ..to be there before the moon turns full.
You have to go to Kmart, 400 Oak Street.<eos> We are not going to Cincinnati, and that's final.<eos> - Get my boxer shorts at Kmart.<eos> - That is final.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> I'm goin' out of my mind!<eos> What difference does it make where you buy underwear?<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> Underwear is underwear!<eos> It is underwear wherever you buy it, in Cincinnati or wherever!
starring Buddy Hackett, Jamie Farr, the Solid Gold Dancers and Mary-Lou Retton as Tiny Tim. - Hosted by Sir John Houseman... - Bah!<eos> It all starts on Christmas Eve - Christmas Eve on lBC.<eos> Oh, my gosh... Does THAT suck?<eos> Y-you know who loves Mary-Lou Retton, Frank?<eos> My kids. - Yeah.<eos> - Children love an acrobat.<eos> Oh... We have spent 40 million on a live TV show, you guys have got an ad with America's favourite old fart... reading a book in front of a fireplace!<eos> Now... I have to kill all of you.<eos> Mother, help me!<eos> Excuse me, sir, uh... but we've been running that spot now for over a month and... well, it's getting a hell of a response.
Take an old blanket out to them or make a sandwich and say, "Here."<eos> "l get it now."<eos> And if you give, then it can happen, the miracle can happen to you.<eos> Not just the poor and hungry, Everybody's gotta have this miracle!<eos> It can happen tonight for you all!<eos> If you believe in this pure thing, the miracle will happen and you'll want it again tomorrow!<eos> You won't say, "Christmas is once a year and it's a fraud." It's not!<eos> It can happen every day!<eos> You've just got to want that feeling!<eos> You'll want it every day! It can happen to you!
Why are you standing?<eos> Give me a rag.<eos> Please, we don't want any tea of yours!<eos> Just don't be nervous, I beg you, and no scenes!<eos> - All the ducks go in pairs...<eos> - Now she'll gad about all night.<eos> Having one of her fits.<eos> The state is a very complex organism.<eos> To put it to use you have...<eos> It has to be comprehended as a whole.
Get dressed.<eos> And so gradually I got preoccupied with the thoughts about the state, and, with sadness and amazement, I came to understand that we all were living each to his own liking, and hardly anyone cared for the state's interests.<eos> And even if anybody shouts at every street corner about its interests, he's just pretending, his self comes first, he just wants to look vanguard, and thus steal more.<eos> Take sedatives.<eos> I saw how our state was being squandered.<eos> Each does his best at his place.<eos> And still our state is alive.<eos> What is it alive by?<eos> And I came to a conclusion - by its structure.<eos> The structure of the state is such that even with the minimum that we're giving it, it is still capable of strengthening itself by some way.
Immortal life and beauty...<eos> is our destiny...soon.<eos> Then, I will bite you girl;<eos> you will know immortality, too.<eos> So continue to produce the darkness.<eos> Your name is Eve.<eos> Girl, you must menstruate, quickly!<eos> We must destroy...<eos> Their secret weapon...<eos> Before it's complete!
Vengeance on whom Kane?<eos> You're too late.<eos> All your frozen mercenaries are dead.<eos> I can soon find more.<eos> But where can you find another home planet?<eos> You're talking in riddles, Doctor.<eos> Proamon is my home planet.<eos> Was your home planet?<eos> Check your navigational equipment.<eos> It's all fully operative now.
It's the coming together of all opposites, the final conjunction.<eos> SVANKMAJER: There are, indeed, many constant elements that survive from the original Surrealist movement.<eos> Dreams, eroticism, a magical perception of the world.<eos> But for the creative artist, the experiences of childhood are the most important.<eos> I always find that a preliminary impulse is generated from childhood memories.<eos> It seems to be the film that, in some sense, is closest to Surrealism.<eos> It's certainly very close to the Surrealist idea about the peculiar value and properties of childhood in the Finst Manifesto of Sunnealism, in 1 924.<eos> Breton actually began the description of childhood.<eos> And...how... in childhood, the imagination has full reign.<eos> It doesn't actually know any boundaries.
There, all better.<eos> You drink too much, Mrs. Perrin.<eos> Quiet, brat!<eos> Nothing wrong with a drop of the good stuff.<eos> - Got any stamps?<eos> - I'm not trading with you guys anymore.<eos> I've got some jam.<eos> After lunch.<eos> The doctor's wife loves your jam.<eos> It puts her in the mood.
If you give the treasure back to us, you make us beggars again.<eos> Such insult could never be forgiven.<eos> Good afternoon, Martha Spruce.<eos> Goodbye, Benjamin.<eos> I mean... ..good afternoon.<eos> - Keep them safe.<eos> - I'll guard them with my life.<eos> Times are gonna take an upturn, Benjamin.<eos> I can smell prosperity in the air.<eos> I wish that it could be.
Rachel!<eos> Randy, no! She's dead, can't you see that?<eos> It ate Rachel.<eos> It fucking ate her up, man!<eos> - What is this thing, Poncho? - I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You read the science books. You're the brainball.<eos> What the fuck is that thing? Nothing like this in any science book I ever read.<eos> Deke, it ate Rachel!
Come on, man.<eos> You read the science books. You're the brainball.<eos> What the fuck is that thing? Nothing like this in any science book I ever read.<eos> Deke, it ate Rachel!<eos> Shut up!<eos> - Think we can swim past it, Randy?<eos> - No! Stop it or I swear to God I'm gonna smoke you.<eos> I'm not kidding. Poncho, do you think we can swim it?<eos> You saw how fast it took Rachel.<eos> Maybe it was hungry then. Maybe it's full.

Why wasn't i notified?<eos> - I sent you a memo.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Did you check your box? .<eos> - Of course, i did!<eos> You didn't send it to me, that's what.<eos> - Sir, i did.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - All right, find it.<eos> - It has to be here.
Doctor?<eos> I'm not an expert in yak manure.<eos> Could you tell us then the amount of bat guano Accumulated monthly By the flapped-Wing chilean fruit bat?<eos> I object.<eos> What does bat guano and yak manure Have to do with this case?<eos> I'll tell you what it has to do with this case.<eos> It has as much to do with it as polymer chemistry-- Exactly nothing!<eos> It is all a lot of crap!<eos> This case is not about polymer chemistry.<eos> It is about murder and blood.
One day, I still remember... the glacier melted and the icebergs drifted to the north.<eos> A tree passed by, still green, with an empty bird's nest.<eos> Only the fish had leapt over a myriad of years.<eos> Then came the moment when the bees drowned.<eos> Some time later, the two stags fought on the bank.<eos> Then the flies and the antlers, like branches, flowing down the river.<eos> All that ever grew again was grass... growing over the bodies of wild cats, wild boar and buffaloes.<eos> One morning, out of the savannah, its forehead smeared with grass... appeared the biped, our image, so long awaited.<eos> And its first word was a shout.<eos> Was it "ah" or "oh", or was it merely a groan?
- He did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That don't sound like Johnny.<eos> - Well--<eos> - Where's the ring?<eos> - Here.<eos> It looks stupid.<eos> It's a pinky ring.<eos> - It's a man's ring.<eos> - It's temporary!
- This was done by Marc Chagall.<eos> - As you can see, he was a great artist.<eos> - Kind of gaudy.<eos> He was having some fun.<eos> - They get some turnout for this stuff.<eos> - It's the best thing there is.<eos> I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.<eos> You haven't once said you like my dress.<eos> I like your dress.<eos> It's very bright.
The maniac's in the apartment.<eos> You could be the maniac.<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> I'Il show you my identification.<eos> - Can you see it? - No!<eos> I can't.<eos> Waita second.<eos> Now you can see it.<eos> Anyone can get one.<eos> It's a fake!
I thought I was going faster.<eos> You were supposed to be this colossus... you were this great legendary thing... and yet he gains!<eos> I'm carrying three people, and he got only himself.<eos> I do not accept excuses. I have to find a new giant.<eos> Don't say that, Vizzini, please.<eos> Did I make it clear that your job is at stake?<eos> He's got very good arms. He didn't fall?<eos> Inconceivable!<eos> You keep using that word.<eos> I do not think it means what you think it means.
For the princess?<eos> To the death?<eos> I accept.<eos> Good, then pour the wine.<eos> Inhale this, but do not touch. I smell nothing.<eos> What you do not smell is called iocane powder.<eos> It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid... and is among the more deadly poisons known to man.<eos> All right.<eos> Where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun.<eos> It ends when you decide, and we both drink... and find out who is right... and who is dead.
Ed has a friend at one of the agencies.<eos> Maybe she can help me and Dot.<eos> There's somethin' wrong with my semen.<eos> What you gonna name it?<eos> Ed.<eos> Ed Junior.<eos> - But I thought you said it was a boy.<eos> - Well, as in Edward.<eos> We just like that name.<eos> It's a good one.
Look.<eos> Brains three times the size of ours.<eos> If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great, they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.<eos> It's Captain Pike they've got.<eos> He needs help. And he probably needs it fast.<eos> Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power.<eos> We'll try blasting through that metal.<eos> Thousands of us are already probing... the creature's thoughts, Magistrate.<eos> We find excellent memory capacity.<eos> I read most strongly a recent death struggle... in which it fought to protect its life.
In the governmental leaflet, it says, "Remove thin materials from windows."<eos> And in the County Council leaflet, it says, "Hang white sheets in the windows."<eos> I wonder which is correct.<eos> Oh!<eos> It says peanut butter.<eos> We haven't got any.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> - Never mind, ducks.<eos> I don't like it, nor do you.<eos> - No, but it's on the official list.
There can't be anything wrong with you.<eos> I expect it's... it's just the...<eos> the after-effects of the bomb.<eos> Oh, I... I... I do... fancy a nice cup of tea.<eos> Do you think the cows have been affected by the bomb, dear?<eos> No, I... I shouldn't think so.<eos> They're...<eos> They're all out in the country.<eos> Supplies of milk will be maintained.<eos> It is... essential for the maintenance of... healthy bones and teeth.
Yeah. 150.<eos> Walk into a shoe store with 150 bucks... You leave with one shoe.<eos> We were working on 5,000.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get in.<eos> It's cold.<eos> Vincent.<eos> You got me talking to myself.<eos> Half of me says I got a hold of... the best thing I ever seen.<eos> Half of me says it ain't worth it.
Who's bothering you now?<eos> is Mr. Rooney in?<eos> No, I'm sorry, he's not.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I seriously doubt it.<eos> When's he back?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's left the school grounds on personal business.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I suppose it means it's personal and it's none of your business, young lady.
Look, this...<eos> This is not a phony phone call.<eos> There is an intruder, male, Caucasian, possibly armed, certainly weird, in my kitchen.<eos> Yeah, my, my...<eos> My name's Bueller.<eos> It's real nice that you hope my brother's feeling better, but I'm in danger, okay?<eos> I am very cute.<eos> I am very alone.<eos> And I'm very protective of my body.<eos> I do not want it violated, or killed, all right?
No.<eos> I could be your girlfriend, if you want.<eos> I think about you when I go to the bathroom.<eos> Come here, honey.<eos> "He's all right What do you think about Jesus?<eos> "He's all right What do you think about Jesus?<eos> "He's all right...."<eos> Where's my bag?<eos> Honey, look at this place!<eos> It's beautiful!
Just as the planet began to self- destruct, we found Spock, alive.<eos> His body had been regenerated, but his mind was a blank.<eos> Escaping Genesis, we used the captured Klingon vessel to transport us to Vulcan, where a mysterious ceremony was performed by Spock's people, in an attempt to restore his memory.<eos> You came back for me?<eos> You would have done the same for me.<eos> Why would you do this?<eos> Because the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many.<eos> Meanwhile, back on Earth, the punishment for our disobedience awaited us.<eos> What do you make of it?<eos> It appears to be a probe from an intelligence unknown to us.
I would accept that as an axiom.<eos> Then you stand here alive because of a mistake made by your flawed, feeling, human friends.<eos> They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the one, you, was more important to them.<eos> - Humans make illogical decisions.<eos> - They do indeed.<eos> Here it comes now.<eos> - What's causing that?<eos> - A powerful amplification wave.<eos> - Can we isolate the wave?<eos> - No, it's impacting on our systems.
We promised to show nasty Baggins the way out.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But we are curious, what has he got in his pocket?<eos> What has he got in his pocket?<eos> Never you mind.<eos> A promise is a promise.<eos> Yes...<eos> But never mind, never mind... My magic ring will help me to eat him.<eos> Here it is...<eos> Here it is, here it is...

I'm not hungry.<eos> I prefer shells.<eos> Don't you dare pull faces!<eos> Eat up and shut up!<eos> See? And you said you weren't hungry?<eos> Here's a letter for you.<eos> From my father?<eos> -It's for you to read<eos> - I won't. Bye!<eos> I won't... but it's already open.
I bequeath to you half of my wealth.<eos> Try to be sensible as how you use it.<eos> Do not become a slave of money.<eos> Protect your hearth.<eos> Raise a good son.<eos> You're leaving me alone.<eos> Why?<eos> DREAM AND PRESENTIMENT OF DEATH<eos> The sun goes up, then the sun goes down.<eos> It returns to where it has risen from.
Shut your eyes, Dorothy.<eos> Now?<eos> He looked like...<eos> - The devil.<eos> Yes.<eos> And he's scared of feathers!<eos> Not for me, thanks.<eos> This Finicky-Nick doesn't like our beer!<eos> You don't like our beer?<eos> It's good.
Nothing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Sure?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I know now who's the richest.<eos> I've investigated.<eos> According to ancient custom the Princess will throw a golden apple, the man it stops by will become her husband.<eos> But that's not gold.<eos> No, I shall gold it.<eos> What if it rolls some Pauper?
Something without sugar.<eos> McFly.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Biff.<eos> I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug!<eos> - Biff.<eos> Guys.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> - You got my homework finished?<eos> Actually, I figured since it wasn't due 'til Monday...
No, the fool is me... for serving as butt to your laughing-stock.<eos> But you're another for losing your keep.<eos> You know, Kaede... the view is more pleasant... now that is it mine.<eos> As I recall... a banner used to hang there.<eos> Yes, Father's banner.<eos> Also his helmet and armour. Where are they?<eos> I gave them to Father's men.<eos> The armour doesn't matter.<eos> But the banner...<eos> My lord... it belongs with the head of the house of lchimonji.
Life. And each person knows for himself the extreme gap that often exists between personal experience and the depiction of that experience up there on the screen.<eos> We have learned to consider the vast distance separating cinema from life as so perfectly natural that we gasp and give a start when we suddenly discover something true or real in a movie, be it nothing more than the gesture of a child in the background,<eos> or a bird flying across the frame, or a cloud casting its shadow over the scene for but an instant.<eos> It is a rarity in today's cinema to find such moments of truth. For people are objects to show themselves as they really are.<eos> That's what was so unique in Ozu's films, and above all, in his later ones.<eos> There were such moments of truth.<eos> No, not just moments. Long-range truth lasting from the first image to the last.<eos> Films which actually and continuously dealt with life itself, and in which the people, the objects, the cities, and the countrysides revealed themselves.<eos> Such a depiction of reality, such an art, is no longer to be found in the cinema.<eos> It was once.
Temporary.<eos> Divine, believe me, it won't be a departure.<eos> It will be a temporary absence.<eos> Feodora, Feodora.<eos> I believe, that it's excessive to argue if it's decent or not for a woman to be brave, while the men remain in uncertainty.<eos> Many have said:<eos> "Departure, temporary absence".<eos> I'll say it straight.<eos> Flight!<eos> And I think, that fleeing is the worst option, even if it saves our lifes for a short time. Even though we can't avoid death.
Yeah, and you use dried seguro sardines.<eos> Those fish are not fit to eat.<eos> Their innards stink.<eos> How dare you!<eos> You stupid amateurs could never appreciate my noodles!<eos> But people who eat noodles are all amateurs.<eos> So why make noodles amateurs can't appreciate?<eos> She's right.<eos> You let the dough sit too long.<eos> It smells like soda.
It used to be good, though.<eos> They tend to be fussy.<eos> What's the story about this wine?<eos> You mean this Medoc, a 1980 Chateau Pichon Lalande.<eos> The weather was bad in 1980... and it was a bad year for Bordeaux.<eos> The other day I was in the alley behind Chat Qui Peche... and found some empty bottles... including this particular Chateau Pichon Lalande.<eos> There was still 5cm left.<eos> So I brought it home and decanted it.<eos> They say that 1980 is a bad year for the Médoc... But no. A pleasant surprise!<eos> It was a bit light. But such a firm flavor!
Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> And congratulations!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> And look at this beautiful counter!<eos> The lighting is perfect.<eos> Tabo, did you write the menu?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> It's great too.
It'll take more than that and I'm not speaking just from a personal point of view.<eos> You'll be responsible for the social unrest that might arise from hasty actions so you must stop him in time.<eos> That fellow can have fun arresting petty criminals but he mustn't touch the banks.<eos> If he submits new evidence, don't act without calling me.<eos> Tell him clearly that this isn't a matter for the police.<eos> Understand?<eos> Allow me to bring to your attention sir, that we are two separate powers of the State.<eos> You're speaking to a Prosecutor.<eos> We can talk and be in agreement, but if it's an order...<eos> At times, the State must override everything. And it must be free to make decisions and give orders.
Well, what Amyand said is right.<eos> What you call the spirit of the mountain is fire itself.<eos> And that fire will pour down onto your settlement destroying everything in its path.<eos> It has happened before, but do you have knowledge that will help us?<eos> I can't save your planet, but I can get you away from here.<eos> Where did you find these?<eos> Tell me, please.<eos> They're gifts of Logar.<eos> This equipment is relatively new.<eos> It comes from a Trion spacecraft.
Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.<eos> Did we?<eos> I don't think it was really decided, Your Majesty.<eos> - German.<eos> Please let it be German.<eos> - Why so?<eos> Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto.<eos> Have I seen it?<eos> I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.<eos> It's quite new.
You know Sparky was hit.<eos> We don't have a dog.<eos> Look, I don't mind if you have a new dog but you can't let him run aroud scaring half the neighbourhood.<eos> But we didn't get another dog!<eos> I saw a monster!<eos> Look, would it make you feel better if I went in and check for you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Honey, maybe you just imagined it.<eos> I didn't imagine what I saw! And Rose didn't either!<eos> It was 6 feet tall and he tried to eat my Raymond!
So long, Billy.<eos> Goddamn foreign cars.<eos> Hey, doctor.<eos> Morning, Billy.<eos> Get in there and be quiet.<eos> - You just made it.<eos> - Again.<eos> Will you sign this petition?<eos> Sure.<eos> What's it for?
- Your eye. Don't worry.<eos> It looks worse than it feels, believe me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope so. Listen, I never got a chance to thank you.<eos> Oh, no. That was nothing.<eos> I'm just sorry about your radio.<eos> Yeah. I'm more sorry about your eye.<eos> I mean, I guess you should've just given it to him.<eos> Why?<eos> It wasn't his, right?
Watch this. Hey, you guys.<eos> How you doing?<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Hey, sorry about the eye there, Johnny.<eos> Your shoulder okay, Tommy? You guys be careful not to go step in front of any more buses now, all right?<eos> Hold it. Remember what sensei said?<eos> - You got to wait for the tournament.<eos> - Must be take-a-worm-for-a-walk week!<eos> You did all that damage?<eos> Like, you know, when you make a wish in a shower it always comes true?
What the hell?<eos> He switched back again.<eos> What a fucking dolt!<eos> Conclusions: we know that Hedberg has no alibi for the robbery.<eos> Now we must find out how much Dahlgren and his men know.<eos> We must keep an eye on his investigation.<eos> Take the necessary measures.<eos> - How far can we go?<eos> Can we use the Japanese equipment?<eos> - Has it arrived?
He can tell time from that little thing<eos> Now our time will start running again<eos> Sound the horn<eos> Who on earth is that, I can't see<eos> It's Tsubana<eos> Is she new here?<eos> Perhaps she is dead<eos> Time doesn't flow here<eos> Really? Is it true?<eos> Did it stop half-way through?
The explanation comes from the image combined with the sound.<eos> - Do the audience understand your style?<eos> - No, they don't understand.<eos> They watch films that are photographed plays all the time so they can't understand.<eos> They want to see actors acting by the way they speak, by the modulation in their voices, the narrative.<eos> That's all they're looking for.<eos> If there is no pe_ormance and no famous actors, they see a void.<eos> I understand them well.<eos> But the cinema must evolve.<eos> It can't stay like this forever.

I'll end on that.
For a moment I thought it had taken you over.<eos> Well, for a moment it did.<eos> What you saw was an attempted temporal bonding.<eos> The molecular realignment of two basically incompatible life forms.<eos> I checked the sensors.<eos> This creature is formed from antimatter.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Then it's worse than I feared.<eos> But the creature failed.<eos> It's not in our dimension now.

Then we'll go to the police.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'll handle it alone.<eos> The space-time parameters of the Matrix have been invaded by a creature from the antimatter world.<eos> We know its composition and how unstable is the magnetism that shields it.<eos> The creature must be expelled immediately if we are to avert disaster.<eos> Without knowing its purpose here?<eos> Its presence here must be our first concern.<eos> Antimatter cannot coexist in harmony in our universe.<eos> Lord President, this creature is here now because it bonded with me.
But I admit only to them.<eos> Another fault: being popular and strong, when only anonymity and cunning guarantee one a long life.<eos> If you desire a long life, you must not be loved.<eos> That's one of our new laws, all the more powerful for being unwritten.<eos> Woe to strong men loved by the people!<eos> Long live mediocre, taciturn, bitter men, huddled in their offices.<eos> The Revolution is like Saturn: It devours its own children.<eos> Why must we... What fate propels us to condemn rather than forgive? Destroy rather than save?<eos> Why all this bloodshed?<eos> When, if ever, will it stop?
So will you.<eos> Then there's some... leftover life to kill.<eos> My Jack... and his perfume of Paris...<eos> Paris and the golden coach.<eos> You'll find what you're looking for... but after?<eos> It's right here.<eos> I can see it.<eos> The gold.<eos> It runs like a river to the shore of the lake.<eos> There it goes, diving underwater.
Kind of stupid to make a saltcellar out of gold.<eos> Stupid, my ass.<eos> The alchemists made gold out of salt.<eos> Oh, no, Jack. It's bad luck.<eos> Throw some over your shoulder quickly.<eos> I don't believe in luck, good or bad... but everybody believes in a little bit of gold... even if it's just a wedding band.<eos> No. Leave it. Let it burn.<eos> Where's my necklace?<eos> I forgot.<eos> She thought it was ostentatious.
We're gonna have a damn good time.<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> It is pretty.<eos> I'm sorry, Tracy. I... It's the cold.<eos> I'll go and get something to keep warm.<eos> Don't be long, huh? No.<eos> I knew it would be you.<eos> Tracy.<eos> There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting.<eos> It's luring me on as of old... and it isn't the gold that I'm wanting... so much as just finding the gold.
We got the milk!<eos> Lots of it!<eos> The milk patrol to the rescue!<eos> Mother!<eos> Hello!<eos> You'll never guess what we've got.<eos> Milk!<eos> So much milk!<eos> We bought it in the market.<eos> It's in cans from America. It's better than fresh.
Yeah, well, that's all I could do in the time.<eos> We've been dead busy in the shop.<eos> - You write your essays at work?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Denny doesn't like me doing this.<eos> He gets narked if I work at home and I can't be bothered arguing with him.<eos> Rita, you can't go on producing work as thin as this, not if you want to pass an exam.<eos> I thought that was the right answer.<eos> I sort of encapsulated all me ideas into one line.<eos> It's the basis for an argument but a single line is not an essay.
Fall in love?<eos> With who?<eos> My God, Frank, I'm just talking to some students down on the lawn.<eos> Jesus, I've heard of matchmaking but this is ridiculous.<eos> Well, stop burbling on about Mr Tyson.<eos> I'm not burbling on.<eos> Well?<eos> What's me essay like?<eos> It, er...<eos> It wouldn't look out of place with these.
I'm pleased to see you.<eos> Really Jack.<eos> I wanted to come.<eos> Don't apologize.<eos> But I've wronged you, badly.<eos> Help me water these things.<eos> Look, I need to talk to you.<eos> Remember this one?<eos> You know I don't.<eos> It flowers once every five years.

The President's got his own problems with the Bay of Pigs.<eos> He doesn't want the astronauts' image tarnished.<eos> Nothing these guys do is going to be called a failure.<eos> These astronauts are our Davids.<eos> You'd think the public would know they're just doing what monkeys have done.<eos> You think a monkey knows he's sitting on a rocket that might explode?<eos> These astronauts know that.<eos> I'll tell you something.<eos> It takes a special man to volunteer for a suicide mission.<eos> Especially when it's on TV.
As far as I'm concerned, that's a socially positive act.<eos> What about it, Nicki?<eos> Is it socially positive?<eos> Well, I think we live in overstimulated times.<eos> We crave stimulation for its own sake.<eos> We gorge ourselves on it. We always want more, whether it's tactile, emotional or sexual, and I think that's bad.<eos> Then why did you wear that dress?<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - That dress.<eos> It's very stimulating, and-- and it's red.
Videodrome.<eos> Mention it to your father. He may want to have a conversation.<eos> I love the view.<eos> Torture, murder, mutilation.<eos> Videodrome.<eos> What you see on that show, it's for real.<eos> I'm gonna audition.<eos> I was made for that show.<eos> It has something that you don't have, Max.<eos> It has a philosophy, and that is what makes it dangerous.
You know, it's the military.<eos> I've brought these packages for the little one.<eos> Look, my sweet.<eos> This is your uniform for the school.<eos> Your collar and your books.<eos> And this is your school bag.<eos> At the mean time I've finished your marriage procedure and talked to the director.<eos> Next week your wedding will be performed.<eos> I've also found a wedding dress for rent.<eos> It'll be very nice on Hatice.
Much good may it do him, unless Bigon is there.<eos> I've not seen Bigon for some time, Your Majesty.<eos> -It need not concern you, Persuasion.<eos> -The boy appears lost.<eos> MONARCH: He'll find his way.<eos> You can take that off to conserve it.<eos> The life-support system is on.<eos> That red light indicates it.<eos> -Is the course controlled from here?<eos> -Yes, but it is an automatic control.
Ok, well rehearsed.<eos> - Save your nonsense.<eos> - What nonsense.<eos> Yes, all that nonsense like everybody else.<eos> Let's hear it.<eos> For me it is fine.<eos> The light, the light, turn it off!<eos> I'm just a painter.<eos> A horrible future awaits me.<eos> And even if it wasn't terrible...
Are you the devil?<eos> I had a friend one time in reform school named Paul.<eos> I held him down while he got raped.<eos> Well, see, I ran into him later on in prison, and he was making this ring out of silver.<eos> I said, "Give me that ring, punk."<eos> And he said, "Are you the devil?"<eos> I didn't answer him.<eos> I just took his fucking ring.<eos> When I got married for the second time, my mother was so mad, she dressed me in a black wedding dress.<eos> It was short with a slit up the sides.
She's out of my life, can I stay here tonight?<eos> Come on in.<eos> My old lady's back, so coolit.<eos> I'm gonna hide for a few days,<eos> Mama, and I ain't gonna tell you where.<eos> I would never tell him nothing.<eos> He's awful persistent.<eos> Hi.<eos> Kathryne, I want you to take good care of this beer.<eos> It's stolen property.
Go on. "What shape it will take...."<eos> Jinnah has what?<eos> Jinnah has cooperated with the British.<eos> It has given him power and the freedom to speak.<eos> And he's filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.<eos> And that I find hard to bear even in prison.<eos> It's hard for me to see this as a solution to the 20th century's problems.<eos> I have friends who keep telling me how much it costs them to keep me in poverty.<eos> But I know happiness does not come with things even 20th-century things.<eos> It can come from work and pride in what you do.
- What did he say?<eos> - He said, the 31st floor has to be behind it.<eos> The 31st floor?<eos> It's a common joke in our company... whenever something goes wrong, it's always the fault of the 31st floor.<eos> Just a saying, you know.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Ah-u-aha!<eos> Please follow the instructions of the security personal.<eos> People with impaired mobility may use the fireman's lift.<eos> The building... could it collapse?

- Sarpeels<eos> Another scourge on Perdide They're very dangerous creepers<eos> Oh, how awful!<eos> - Do you think Piel is...<eos> - No. I've questioned him<eos> He hasn't got near the caves<eos> I'm worried about the lake<eos> The lake?<eos> What's the danger there?<eos> It's just a body of water per se, filled with friendly little fish
I'd buy it myself if I had the money.<eos> The castle is a bargain at this price.<eos> There's period furniture in the drawing room.<eos> The lawyer is in Paris, but if you're interested, he can be reached on Monday.<eos> All the furniture is included with the castle.<eos> The library has many rare works from the last century.<eos> They say you Americans like strange things.<eos> Well, there are vaults beneath the castle... where the owners were buried.<eos> Have you seen the piano?<eos> It still works.
What is the matter with you, my dear<eos> Have you taken leave of your senses, or what is it?<eos> Do you not hear me or understand what I say?<eos> ...<eos> Heaven be thanked, I am still in my right mind and speak plainly enough!<eos> Lizaveta Ivanovna did not hear her.<eos> On returning home she ran to her room, and drew the letter out of her glove: it was not sealed.<eos> Lizaveta read it.<eos> The letter contained a declaration of love;<eos> it was tender, respectful, and copied word for word from a German novel.
Quick.<eos> This light...<eos> Get them!<eos> - I got it!<eos> - Champagne is in the back!<eos> I couldn't remember Nathan's brand when I went to the store.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What kind?<eos> The guy at the shop said something Rosé.<eos> The guy at the shop said it's very good.
The people there were made to stand for, sometimes, days.<eos> They were naked and they had no water.<eos> And their hands reached out from the bars, and they cried and pled.<eos> This woman will be Commandant Hoess' secretary.<eos> Take her downstairs.<eos> See that she showers thoroughly.<eos> Give me your clothes.<eos> Here is the shower.<eos> You must use this disinfectant soap.<eos> It burns and it stinks.
I've passed by here so often.<eos> I've never seen a radio, so small, so cunning.<eos> I couldn't believe it really worked.<eos> I just...<eos> Liar!<eos> You wanted to steal it.<eos> I knew by the look on your face.<eos> You must believe me. I wouldn't take your radio.<eos> Yes, you would.<eos> It cost 70 marks.
Does she have the strength for the way?<eos> She's ill, her clothes are thin.<eos> She'll freeze and cause them trouble.<eos> Let her freeze and die.<eos> You can't cross the Cobantasý Pass like this.<eos> - If you go like this, you'll freeze.<eos> - I'll freeze?<eos> You'll freeze.<eos> The pass is pretty windy.<eos> It will freeze a man instantly.
Matchboxes.<eos> Admiral Muspratt apparently had one on the finest collections in the country.<eos> Matchboxes.<eos> Matchboxes.<eos> I think she's past child-bearing.<eos> In Italy no one believes there's going to be a war.<eos> they think it will all be arranged.<eos> I suppose, Julia, you no longer have access to political information<eos> Cara, here, is fortunately a British citizen by marriage.<eos> It is not a thing she customarily mentions but it may prove valuable.
- Anyone else like one?<eos> - Please, we're trying to have a meeting.<eos> - If you'd all care to look at the agenda. - Hello!<eos> Hello!<eos> Who's that?<eos> Remember me?<eos> I...<eos> I made a discovery...<eos> I'd like to tell you about.<eos> - Is it on the agenda?
You are obviously being totally naive!<eos> When you've been in marketing as long as I have, you know that before any new product can be developed it has to be properly researched.<eos> We've got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to its image... - Stick it up your nose! - Precisely what we need to know.<eos> Do people want fire that can be fitted nasally?<eos> And the wheel!<eos> What about this wheel thing?<eos> They say it's a fascinating project.<eos> We're having a little difficulty there. Difficulty?<eos> It's the single simplest machine in the entire Universe!<eos> All right, Mr Wiseguy! You're so clever, you tell us what colour it should be!
Simple creamy, English charm playing tigers.<eos> You're quite right.<eos> Of course I'm right, my dear.<eos> I was right years ago more years, I am happy to say than either of us shows when I warned you.<eos> I took you out to dinner to warn you of charm.<eos> I warned you expressly and in great detail of the Flyte family.<eos> Charm is the great English blight.<eos> It does not exist outside these damp islands.<eos> It spots and kills anything it touches.<eos> It kills love.

Now you'll be an even stronger part of my life.<eos> It's beautiful here.<eos> Being with you.<eos> I'm asking you not to feel ashamed.<eos> Even if I'll fret about it tonight.<eos> And you too, for sure.<eos> Don't regret anything, even this savagery.<eos> We couldn't find anything else.<eos> We must overcome the shame and remember tonight as a beautiful and great night.<eos> And flatten this dirty feeling of shame even if it floors us first.
But it had to let because they paid a fine.<eos> Look this one.<eos> She is sexually attractive, huh?<eos> Hm. I'm about, man, starting to be feminine.<eos> I'm probably so.<eos> But they're just monsters, Leave that to shoot for money.<eos> Dad says:<eos> 'No woman's trust.'<eos> Hey, here's a poem from Vrchlickýho.<eos> However, it is therefore vulgar.
My child, never leave him, that brother I give to you.<eos> She also said: One day you'll have to tell him so, as I say it to you now, that he mustn't leave Agatha.<eos> She said as well: You have the good fortune to live an unalterable love, and one day to die from it.<eos> - You're leaving tomorrow at dawn.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Forever, isn't that so?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Until your arrival within the confines of the new continent where nothing else will happen. Nothing, once more.<eos> Except this love.<eos> Was that summer as beautiful as we say it was?
- But just a minute, Avon.<eos> - We'll take you with us on one condition.<eos> What's that?<eos> The robbery goes ahead just as you and your former associates planned it with one minor modification.<eos> We will use the teleport to steal your gold.<eos> ORAC:<eos> I fear that will not be possible, Avon.<eos> Why not?<eos> The processed gold will have undergone a subneutronic overlap shift.<eos> If subjected to the teleport process as well, it will reduce to dust irrevocably.
Naturally.<eos> Deep in the rock below this base, there's a room.<eos> I found it when I first came here.<eos> As far as I can tell, it was carved from some mineral deposit, a pocket of some element which I still know very little about, despite nearly 200 years of study.<eos> If at first you don't succeed.<eos> You think I'm insane, don't you?<eos> - It had occurred to me.<eos> - The room exists, Avon.<eos> And since I found it I haven't aged one day.<eos> It cleanses me of all the corruptions of time and appetite.
By now, I probably would be.<eos> If it wasn't for this mysterious room.<eos> And what it contains.<eos> - And what might that be, Dorian?<eos> - Ah, Soolin.<eos> I was just about to summon you.<eos> Not with a gun in your hand.<eos> What does the room contain, Dorian?<eos> All the madness and rotting corruption which would have been mine.<eos> It contains horror, Soolin.
It begins.<eos> I knew it would.<eos> The room accepts you.<eos> It will make you one and give you my death.<eos> What is it?<eos> Can you hear it?<eos> - I underestimated you, too, didn't I?<eos> - I knew you'd see it, Avon.<eos> My creature will need to understand.<eos> It must warn me of approaching death.
Can you hear it?<eos> - I underestimated you, too, didn't I?<eos> - I knew you'd see it, Avon.<eos> My creature will need to understand.<eos> It must warn me of approaching death.<eos> - Yours will be its understanding.<eos> - What is it?<eos> That's what you're going to replace, my dear.<eos> You and the others.<eos> I imagine it was once a man.
-Why don't you answer it?<eos> Go on.<eos> Go on.<eos> There's got to be a trick to this, Davis.<eos> This place is unreal.<eos> -Doctor, it stopped.<eos> -Yes, so now we know.<eos> Know what?<eos> The message was very faint.<eos> It was from Traken.
- Are there any signs of life?<eos> - A few cats and dogs.<eos> Triffids, of course.<eos> I'm pretty certain other people go raiding there.<eos> There's indications of that, but I didn't see anybody.<eos> - I think it's my last visit, too.<eos> - Why?<eos> I was cruising down Tottenham Court Road and a building collapsed.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> It was ready to go.
How many weapons?<eos> Or what was in the weapons?<eos> They never told us.<eos> They never asked us.<eos> I suppose one of these weapons had been specially constructed to emit a radiation that our eyes couldn't stand.<eos> Something that would burn out the optic nerve.<eos> - That couldn't blind the whole world.<eos> - Suppose there was an accident.<eos> This weapon would operate at low levels, only blinding people they wanted to blind.<eos> But after the accident, it went off so far up that anyone on earth could receive direct radiation from it.
I'm confused. Is there some question as to the authenticity of the will?<eos> I'm confused too.<eos> You have a problem with the witnessing or the signatures? What are you getting at?<eos> No, I'm afraid the problem lies elsewhere.<eos> Would anybody mind if I smoked?<eos> No, I don't need my own. I'll just breathe the air.<eos> Everything's in order up to there.<eos> The problem comes in the language of the bequest to Heather.<eos> It's a technical matter. In writing the will, I'm afraid Mr. Racine violated what's known as "the rule against perpetuities."<eos> It forbids an inheritance to be passed down indefinitely for generations.
I need proof.<eos> I have it.<eos> And he listens to her!<eos> She is talking nonsense... and he's listening!<eos> Can I please go to the toilet and cut my wrists?<eos> You laugh about it, but it happens.<eos> At such an hour, a man doesn't know if he's joking or dreaming, or what he's doing.<eos> Detective?<eos> Could I ask you for your opinion now?<eos> My opinion Madam doesn't matter... because it will never change yours, will it?
During the absurd exertions of military discipline an art that deadens the mind through physical strain and saps the soul by means of violence I take refuge in my memories of you.<eos> In your voice, your letters.<eos> The letters I'll write you.<eos> I invoke your name:<eos> I went there on my son's birthday.<eos> But the real reason I visited that portrait studio was to have one of me to send you.<eos> You see?<eos> I'm smiling for you.<eos> But I had to restrain my heart.<eos> It was ordering my eyes to weep.
When he wakes up he pretends that nothing happened.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I'm at war against women.<eos> They...have no foresight.<eos> There's nothing about them that is stable, there's nothing to trust.<eos> They're dangerous.<eos> There is nothing in common among women except menstruation.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I come from a place where evil seems easier to pinpoint because you can see it in the flesh.<eos> It becomes people so you know exactly the danger of being deformed by it.
Right now!<eos> Not a word to those chicken-hearts about our going to the Castle.<eos> She d give me hell.<eos> Hire a carriage and rush to the police prefect with this free-mason ring.<eos> Explain the situation.<eos> Should I not return within 24 hours he must send a police corps to take the castle by storm.<eos> Oh God, no corpses!<eos> Who will tend Your Lordship's precious throat?<eos> I shall.<eos> It belongs not only to me, but to the whole world.
If he beefs on us, that's your problem, too.<eos> - Who are your inside people?<eos> - That's my end.<eos> You don't have to know.<eos> - So what do you say, Frank?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What do you mean, you don't know?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> I don't believe in lifetime subscriptions.<eos> Maybe it don't fit in with my retirement...
Which means that thing will be back with its friends.<eos> Which means that we'd better be ready for them.<eos> It's not the thing they sent before.<eos> Stand by, Dayna.<eos> Something nasty this way comes.<eos> Tarrant, all the energy's draining from the banks.<eos> The blasters are useless.<eos> It would seem that this crude device is intended to frighten primitive people...<eos> - from underdeveloped worlds.<eos> - It's doing a pretty good job on me.
They are traveling so fast that it's only 10,000 times slower than the speed of light.<eos> The Voyager spacecraft will take 40,000 years to go the distance to the nearest stars and they're not even headed towards the nearest stars.<eos> But is there a method by which we could travel in a conveniently short time to the stars?<eos> Can we travel close to the speed of light?<eos> And what's magic about the speed of light?<eos> Can't we travel faster than that?<eos> It turns out that there is something very strange about the speed of light. Something that provides the key to our understanding of time and space.<eos> The story of its discovery takes us to Tuscany in northern Italy.<eos> There's something timeless about this place.<eos> A century ago, it probably looked very much the same.
- Let's have a drink...<eos> What d'you mean? Katerina, of course.<eos> Oh yes, sure...<eos> How long have you been working at television?<eos> It will be twenty-five years soon.<eos> So you were at the very beginning?<eos> Even then I knew that television was the future of mankind.<eos> - I wanted to explain...<eos> - I understand...<eos> It would change our life.
- Steve!<eos> - Got a cigarette, Nels?<eos> Linda, your husband and the others are alive but unconscious.<eos> Just like Gerald Ford.<eos> There's a chance we can save them if Striker lands that plane in time.<eos> That isn't much of a chance.<eos> I don't know. We're doing everything we can.<eos> Now excuse me.<eos> Where did you get that dress?<eos> It's awful!
You go to bed early, I don't.<eos> Where can I go?<eos> It's only 10 pm.<eos> - That's true, it's early.<eos> SHUT UP!<eos> Play something.<eos> Is there a theatre?<eos> - Yes, there is.<eos> - Fine!<eos> - It is open only on thursday.
I am not an animal!<eos> I am a human being!<eos> I am a man.<eos> Out of the way, sir.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Mr. Treves, sir, they've found him!<eos> I think they've found John!<eos> Keep still, girl!<eos> It was nice of Mrs. Kendal to give me this dress.<eos> It's beautiful!
I have gained myself.<eos> I could not say that, were it not for you.<eos> Well... you have done so much for me as well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead and Nora and be back in a few minutes!<eos> Very good, my friend.<eos> My friend!<eos> Mrs. Kendal!<eos> Your Royal Highness, Ladies and Gentlemen!<eos> Tonight's performance was very special to me, because it was very special to someone else, a man who knows the theatre and who loves the theatre.
You will know... when you are calm, at peace... passive.<eos> A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense... never for attack.<eos> - But tell me why I can't...<eos> - No. There is no why.<eos> Nothing more will I teach you today.<eos> Clear your mind of questions.<eos> There's something not right here.<eos> I feel cold.<eos> - That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force.<eos> A domain of evil it is.

I have a suspicion but it's too horrible to think about.<eos> Now where are we?<eos> Right in the bowels of the ship.<eos> Disused fuel tanks, I think.<eos> - I can hear that sound again.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What are we looking for?<eos> - A way out.<eos> Ah.<eos> I doubt very much that the creature lives in the Tower, but since the Tower feeds it, I imagine it lives close by.
If they want to burn the books let them read them first.<eos> Doubt is a privilege.<eos> Children need the sure things first.<eos> If you don't give that to them, they'll just end up being lost.<eos> A whole generation of bums, that's a bit much.<eos> It's not working with those eggs,<eos> I've had it!<eos> Those eggs!<eos> I work myself out, but it won't do if you buy eggs like those.<eos> The education is more democratic now, it fits the capacities of the children, doing away with any kind of selection.
They were so full of energy.<eos> It was amazing!<eos> One half of my heart is here, doctor, but the other is in China, with the army marching towards the yellow river.<eos> Every morning, doctor, at dawn, my heart is shot in Greece.<eos> And when prisonners fall in their sleep, when you hear footsteps leaving the infirmary, my heart goes away, doctor.<eos> In an old wooden house in Istanbul.<eos> It's been ten years, doctor, that I've got nothing to give to my people.<eos> Only an apple, a red apple, my heart.<eos> It's because of all this, doctor, not the arterioesclerosis, nor nicotine, nor jail, that it hurts in my chest.<eos> I watch the night through the window, and despite the walls that oppress my heart, it still beats with the furthest star.
And yes, the Jaguar or the Corvette would be just fine.<eos> Your son, Oliver.<eos> I don't remember this barbed wire in the brochures.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Now, according to my information, the auto is in that garage.<eos> - How did you find a garage?<eos> - It came with the house.<eos> - You own this place?<eos> - Well, technically, it's still in escrow.
It came right away from the mother.<eos> That means she's brave, huh?<eos> - What are you gonna call her?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> I've gotta think.<eos> She's special, so it's gotta be a special name.<eos> What's that?<eos> The name of the puppy:<eos> Nerak!<eos> - But what does it mean?
Why was she blindfolded?<eos> They said it was part of a game.<eos> They used to meet in the chapel.<eos> Sometimes there seems to be something out there.<eos> Sometimes... I hear someone whispering in the wind.<eos> Mrs Aylwood, what do you think happened to Karen?<eos> I think she's still out there.<eos> - What nonsense.<eos> - I told you there was a ghost.<eos> As long as it keeps out of the house, I can live with it.
Venechka was younger than you.<eos> You went to the war and he attended his classes at the conservatoire.<eos> I remember he bought flowers to his mother every time he got his scholarship.<eos> Who has ever bought flowers in our apartment?<eos> He was so myopic.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Yes, I am. The war is over. There are so many things to do.<eos> I was also happy at your age.<eos> My happiness was overwhelming.<eos> And then it started shrinking and shrinking...
I can't tell you that. Excuse me I don't know.<eos> And I don't need it. There is no clock at my place. That one broke down...<eos> - I can't find the time to fix it.<eos> - Then how do you wake up to go to work?<eos> I never miss it. I have always gotten up with a lark.<eos> Besides the radio is on.<eos> I get up in time.<eos> - It will never let you miss the work.<eos> - Is it on around the clock?<eos> Yes, it doesn't bother me.
-Romana.<eos> -Romana?<eos> -Ah!<eos> Shut up, K9.<eos> -Ah...<eos> -What are you doing in that body?<eos> -Regenerating.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> But you can't wear that body.<eos> I thought it looked very nice on the Princess.
-Yes, sir.<eos> Destroy that and we can still win.<eos> I'll show Princess Astra and her pacifist friends.<eos> She's beginning to panic, becoming a thorn in my flesh, an irritant.<eos> She could be useful to my enemies.<eos> Something tells me her value to me may be at an end.<eos> Don't lose track of that Zeon device.<eos> -It may not be...<eos> -Just don't lose it.<eos> Inform me as soon as it comes within missile range.
Then what do you have?<eos> What I have, isn't with me now.<eos> The revolver that shoots?<eos> How many bullets?<eos> Six.<eos> I can show it to you, only if you promise me that you won't climb the terrace walls, again.<eos> I've another weapon. It can't be seen.<eos> What?<eos> - Intelligence. It's kept over here.<eos> Sometimes, it suddenly enters a person's mind, and learns all that is stored there.
Are you filming people going to the toilet?<eos> I thought they were all coming out<eos> Why not hide in the toilet?<eos> That's enough!<eos> What was that about?<eos> He wanted it nice and formal, the idiot<eos> She's asleep<eos> What happened?<eos> To the mirror?<eos> - It broke
There's a place in the river-- I can't remember--<eos> Must've been a gardenia plantation or a flower plantation at one time.<eos> It's all wild and overgrown now. But for about-- for about five miles you'd think that... heaven just fell on the earth... in the form of gardenias.<eos> Have you ever considered... any real freedoms?<eos> Freedoms from the opinion of others?<eos> Even the opinions of yourself?<eos> Did they say why, Willard?<eos> Why they wanted to terminate my command?<eos> I was sent on a classified mission, sir.<eos> It's no longer classified, is it?
- Check it out.<eos> TV changer, man.<eos> What you got?<eos> Now move, honky, before I cut your white ass.<eos> If I see Raphael, I will give him your message.<eos> Do that.<eos> - Good day.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That tree is very sick.<eos> It needs care.
- Morning, gentlemen.<eos> Morning, Mr. President.<eos> We were unable...<eos> This is not what I requested.<eos> ... before Gardiner appeared at the Rands'.<eos> This information goes back a day and a half.<eos> Right, chief.<eos> - I want the standard file, you know that.<eos> Right, chief.<eos> - Well, where is it?
Cold, but nice.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> I don't think that fellow is 100%.<eos> I'll see if I can find us some place to stay.<eos> - Someplace pretty cheap.<eos> - Yeah, pretty cheap.<eos> About tomorrow morning...<eos> This ain't traveling weather.<eos> I know this place ain't fancy, but it's got a roof.<eos> And like you say, it's cheap.
Hey!<eos> Can we help you?<eos> What're you doing up there?<eos> Take care or you'll catch a cold!<eos> You are all infected!<eos> Nobody will survive!<eos> We won't do you any harm!<eos> Climb down!<eos> I don't want the blanket.<eos> It's surely full of germs!
Go back!<eos> You're way too close!<eos> We just want to know what happened.<eos> They splashed me!<eos> With blood and puke!<eos> On purpose!<eos> That's why I threw away everything.<eos> They took my car and drove away.<eos> I beg you, stay back!<eos> I threw away my undies too, it was dirty,
No, I was overjoyed.<eos> Quiet down, Ottokar's sleeping.<eos> The dishes are dirty!<eos> And the table is broken!<eos> And the good blanket!<eos> Where's the blanket we ordered?<eos> Now, do you take the trailer or not?<eos> I can take it back as well.<eos> Where's the blanket we ordered?<eos> I immediately want to know where it is!
You've been taught that they are the same<eos> You've been taught that the universe is bounded by five sides and that life has but five stages<eos> Primum- the pain of birth<eos> Secundum- the labor of maturing<eos> Tercium- the guilt of living<eos> Quartum- the terror of aging<eos> Quintum- the finality of death<eos> But this is not complete for five sides demand a sixth space a center and that is what you have to look forward to<eos> What is the sixth space?<eos> It's empty
"When light and shadow are joined once more..."<eos> "...it shall be restored." AD 1517.<eos> The date's in Roman numerals.<eos> So, that ring's 400 years old.<eos> - Sorry for the wait.<eos> - Mm, looks great!<eos> Something sure has your attention. What are you looking at?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Just this old ring I found.<eos> I was wondering if it was worth anything.
Believe luminescent cloud to be enormous power field surrounding alien vessel.<eos> Our sensor scans unable to penetrate.<eos> Imperial Klingon Cruiser Amar, continuing to attack.<eos> Our sensor drone is intercepting this on Quad L-14.<eos> That's within Klingon boundaries.<eos> Who are they fighting?<eos> Unknown, sir.<eos> I have an exterior visual.<eos> We've plotted a course on that cloud, Commander.<eos> It will pass into Federation space fairly close to us.

You mind telling us how?<eos> Fucking Coney Island must be 50 to 100 miles from here.<eos> - It's the only choice we got.<eos> - Yeah, real simple.<eos> Except that every cop in the city is looking to bust our heads.<eos> - We got something to think about.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What?<eos> The truce.<eos> Is it still on?
-Me?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> -Me?<eos> I'm the Doctor.<eos> What you're doing is terribly interesting, but you've got it wrong.<eos> A truly remarkable piece of equipment.<eos> I hope you'll agree.<eos> It makes the impossible possible.
He just crushed the life out of him.<eos> Look at this, 80-gauge colondin just ripped to cardboard!<eos> -We're abandoning the station!<eos> -In no circumstances.<eos> Not while I am Director here!<eos> It was just a tentacle, sir, the equivalent of one of my fingers!<eos> Imagine what's going to happen if that creature decides to attack us!<eos> We've put far too much into this project to abandon it now.<eos> There's only one thing to do.<eos> That is to find this creature and kill it before it kills us!
Hold tight.<eos> Look.<eos> Freeze.<eos> -It's gone.<eos> -Yes.<eos> What a good thing we remembered it reacts to movement.<eos> Yes, wasn't it?<eos> Let's get out of here before it changes its mind.<eos> If you're right, Fenner, about that thing attacking the settlement, we should be able to see it from here.<eos> It's over two miles away.
Marshal?<eos> Come in, Marshal.<eos> Oh, it's useless!<eos> He either can't or won't answer.<eos> And this time loop device isn't going to hold things back forever, is it?<eos> No, not unless the Doctor can find the sixth piece.<eos> And the sixth piece is somehow connected with Astra.<eos> -But she denies all knowledge of it?<eos> -All conscious knowledge, yes.<eos> But if she's the only one who knows the secret, and, if the knowledge is implanted, then it must have affected her, made her different is some slight way that just might show up in analysis.
Are you in the business yourself, sir?<eos> -What?<eos> -Seeing into the future?<eos> Oh, well...<eos> Crystal ball man, are you?<eos> Or do you favour goat entrails?<eos> No, I tend to use a police box affair.<eos> -A police box affair. Yes.<eos> -What about your prophecy?<eos> Did it by any chance concern the Lady Adrasta?
I sent the guards down after it.<eos> You realise what this means, Adrasta?<eos> It means a great green blob several hundred feet long is loose somewhere in these passageways.<eos> An angry green blob.<eos> A green blob you tried to kill.<eos> Karela, take the girl, the tin animal and some guards, go down into the Pit, find the Creature and kill it!<eos> Adrasta, you're insane.<eos> You have some idea of what that creature can do.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> At the moment, it's reasonably friendly.
What a pity.<eos> All dead and gone.<eos> Only appreciated by a select few, like you and me.<eos> You flatter me.<eos> Now, George, let's talk about your old boss.<eos> Control.<eos> He kept his name a secret.<eos> Shall we talk about Control?<eos> - If you insist.<eos> - It wasn't a secret to you, was it?
- Three hull punctures, sir.<eos> All sealed and solid.<eos> OK.<eos> Carry on.<eos> What was the force?<eos> Down to 9 again.<eos> It's reducing.<eos> Not before time.<eos> Where's that echo?<eos> It's practically on top of us!
That stuff is beginning to work.<eos> The tumour's smaller, much less inflamed.<eos> We must go on now.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Percy is all that matters.<eos> But why are they out there, Mr Herriot?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> Maybe something to do with the drug.<eos> - ln what way?<eos> It might be affecting his hormones, having a feminising effect.
Aye.<eos> About time.<eos> Care to watch, would you?<eos> - Yes, if that's all right.<eos> Watch closely, keep quiet and you might learn something.<eos> Right, Clinton.<eos> Put your lily-white hands to work and clean that lot up.<eos> Me and Herriot have things to do.<eos> I ought to get back to Darrowby.<eos> Aye, you'll not want to move the animal till it comes to.
- Who?<eos> - The Gardener!<eos> The most mysterious criminal of this century.<eos> His true identity and his origins are not known.<eos> He earned the nickname "Gardener" by his botanical experiments.<eos> Commissar!<eos> He appeared out of the Amazonian jungle where he'd lived with the local Indians.<eos> As you see, marked by a cross.<eos> The local shaman introduced him to a carnivourous plant the locals used to sacrifice the hearts of their captive enemies.<eos> When it got sick and lost its appetite, it got cured by an extract made out of the magician, and he became his successor.
You're not double-checking this stripping.<eos> I want it tighter.
Are you looking for something, sir?<eos> Yes, I'd like to know whether in the auction of the day after tomorrow, in the belongings of the Vallance family, there are any antique jewels.<eos> I don't know, the secretary can inform you.<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> I think I understood you are looking for some object.<eos> Yes, I'm looking for an old ring that belonged to the Vallance family.<eos> Almost all things in here belong to the Vallance family.<eos> Could you describe me that ring?<eos> It's a silver ring, shaped like an eight, with two amethysts inside of the curl.<eos> It's not here because the jewels will be auctioned another day.
A palace, a coat of arms ...<eos> - Lots of gold, shiny coins.<eos> - I'm not getting married.<eos> Father would be alone.<eos> - Father will find himself a wife.<eos> - He's done it before.<eos> Or you wouldn't be here.<eos> Beautiful old wine.<eos> Such a spicy tang.<eos> Perhaps it is too good for the wedding quests?
I promised that you would see him, not that he would see you...!<eos> You are beautiful!<eos> - My dowry must be huge to make you say such things...<eos> I ...<eos> - Get as much out of father as you can!<eos> - I have my reward. This dance.<eos> - Don't be so modest!<eos> I pay my debts too...<eos> I'm taking this mirror.<eos> - No, it's mine!
BRISK!<eos> He stopped every now and then... to "skissa" [skissa similar to kissa=urinate]<eos> Skissa=To sketch<eos> Here the master is painting a pair of eyeglasses<eos> A... a bicycle...<eos> A painting!<eos> Pablo Picasso continued wrestling with his art<eos> The Swedish-American multi-millionaire...<eos> Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim loved art... and artists<eos> Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim... was one of the many people that didn't understand Picasso's work... but she knew it was expensive, hence immortal.
Hey, what's going on here?<eos> - I should ask you that, Mr...<eos> Jozef Roelofs, surveyor with the Ministry of Public Works.<eos> Benjamin Rolus, mayor of Hamelen, owner of this estate.<eos> Right Mr Jozef Roelofs, tell me.<eos> We're marking out a new motorway.<eos> Yes, the E32.<eos> Transont, Hamelen, Pullendonk.<eos> Didn't you know?<eos> Yes, but not that it'd go through my estate.
I hear a television crew is here today to make a documentary on our orchestra<eos> Here we are, in this wonderful auditorium which was built in the 13th century and used to be a church<eos> You can see here some very old tombs and to my right...<eos> I have already told them this<eos> - I am the first violin and...<eos> - Good morning<eos> - Good morning<eos> - Good morning, Mirella<eos> Can someone take this cover off?<eos> - It's really heavy
- Workshop?<eos> Yes, the workshop.<eos> How beautiful.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Ancillary power station.<eos> Now, try your tracer.<eos> The humanoids are three levels below.<eos> - Finished?<eos> - Yes, it's finished.<eos> Where is it?
It's the ultimate weapon, the de-mat gun.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> - You built it under hypnosis.<eos> But how to arm it?<eos> Is that why the key remained hidden for so long?<eos> I could rule the universe with this, Chancellor.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Destroy that gun.<eos> Destroy all knowledge of it.<eos> It will throw us back to the darkest age.
-And in my way.<eos> -Your way?<eos> Final!<eos> We get rid of the problem once and for all.<eos> -No.<eos> -It's the only way.<eos> What about that creature, sir?<eos> Well, we've got to deal with that first.<eos> That's obvious.<eos> It's out there lurking somewhere, so once we've located it, we can then finish it off with depth charges.
Soon, dryfoot, you will wish you had died on the Stone of Blood.<eos> Guard the dryfoots, Varlik.<eos> No harm must come to them.<eos> I will talk to Kroll and he will tell me by which of the seven holy rituals they must meet death.<eos> Those depth charges are not going to make much impression on that creature.<eos> Not unless you hit a vital spot first time and you can't guarantee that.<eos> We've got nothing else.<eos> Can you think of a better way of killing it?<eos> Thawn, we've been here months and this is the first time we've ever set eyes on this creature.<eos> Now, surely, if it were hostile, we'd have known of it before!

There is something strange.<eos> Oh, what's that?<eos> The outward signs are that the man died quite recently.<eos> His watch is still working.<eos> He has a Thermos of tea in his pocket which is still hot, yesterday's newspaper.<eos> -The mud on his boots is still...<eos> -Yes, yes, yes, Stael, get on with it.<eos> The body is decomposing.<eos> Already?<eos> It's falling apart as you watch.
Today with modern techniques - carbon testing and so on - they can't possibly make a mistake.<eos> Believe me, Francesco, everything is just like the vision I have.<eos> The broken mirror, the...<eos> Oh, listen to me, Virginia, please...<eos> All right, let's say due to telepathic phenomenon, you've found the body of that poor woman.<eos> Now, don't think about it anymore.<eos> Leave it to the police.<eos> This thing is becoming an obsession, darling.<eos> Get it out of your mind!<eos> As for the mirror, I don't remember seeing it broken.
A lot of trouble.<eos> There's two of 'em.<eos> I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider.<eos> - You got a broom or snow shovel?<eos> - I left it at your house.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> There's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.<eos> - You got black soap?<eos> - It's for my complexion.
Where's the crew?<eos> !<eos> How the hell did it get here?<eos> !<eos> He says this guy's local.<eos> He was here last night.<eos> He saw it happen.<eos> Sunburn?<eos> He says the sun came out last night.<eos> He says it sang to him.
They're locked in, door post to door post as they move down in back stretch.<eos> The field comes down off the banking in turn four.<eos> Beau welles has the competition.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Wendell Scott moves up into first place.<eos> White flag is out.<eos> One lap to go.<eos> The field comes down showing Wendell Scott in command.<eos> Beau welles riding second.<eos> The wheel is wobbling.<eos> If it holds another half lap, it will be the most dramatic finish in the history of grand national racing.
# I can't afford a carriage<eos> # But you'll look sweet<eos> # On the seat of a bicycle built for two! #<eos> Everybody now!<eos> # Daisy, Daisy... #<eos> Do we need to give the responses?<eos> There's no obligation.<eos> # I'm half crazy... #<eos> When shall we go and look for the cave creature?<eos> Perhaps it'll come looking for us.
You'll be all right.<eos> Embryo what?<eos> Embryo Fendahleen.<eos> A creature from my own mythology.<eos> Supposed to have perished when the fifth planet broke up.<eos> At least, so they said.<eos> A creature from mythology?<eos> Do you know what you're talking about?<eos> Well, you saw it.<eos> It survived 12 million years.
You're joking.<eos> Bosses and workers, the old world all over again.<eos> That was their judgment.<eos> They come down out of that tree house, they have a quick sniff round and say, "No, thank you very much.<eos> It's not for me."<eos> Do you care what a couple of kids have got to say?<eos> They've convinced me that I was right in the first place, Greg.<eos> Let everybody develop his own way of life, at his own time, at his own speed.<eos> It may not make for efficiency, but at least we'll have a human society here, not just an economic unit.<eos> It'll turn into anarchy unless there's an aim, a clearly-defined purpose.
That's good.<eos> -It's only thunder, isn't it? -Mmm-hmm.<eos> Lizzie might be frightened if she wakes.<eos> Well, she won't be if you tell her that it's just thunder, will she?<eos> -Now, go on, hop it. Get back to bed.<eos> -All right, I'll tell her.<eos> Just thunder.<eos> Just thunder.<eos> That was a tree coming down just now.<eos> It could have come down on the house.
So?<eos> Well, one day, this settlement of yours is gonna need a new leader.<eos> -Someone younger.<eos> -You?<eos> No, no, someone younger, a different generation entirely.<eos> I mean, someone for whom, well, this is the reality.<eos> Not like you and me, rear-mirror drivers forever looking backwards.<eos> So?<eos> So you gotta make this place attractive to young people.<eos> 'Cause if you don't, it's gonna end up like one of those South Coast resorts.
It's evil! Sick! Despicable!<eos> Flesh! The Body!<eos> Bunches of rules and discipline!<eos> Control the body! Despise and dominate it with your mind! Hogwash!<eos> The body dominates the mind!<eos> Clogs it to the very corners!<eos> The body doesn't lose... it simply misses out.<eos> The body won't be denied.<eos> The body WON'T be denied!<eos> It keeps on fighting with the mind.
Never abandon your father.<eos> He'll never let you be sent away.<eos> Can I have some room?<eos> Rivière's mad at me!<eos> I'll sing you a song!<eos> A short one!<eos> Lisa, will you let me store my grain?<eos> I've worked to raise it with great pain<eos> Open wide! Let me bring it in!<eos> It will fill your empty bin!
I'll call security and have you thrown out if you're still here.<eos> Well, let's say fuck you, Hackett.<eos> You want me out of here... you'll have to drag me and the whole News Division out kicking and screaming.<eos> You think they'll quit their jobs for you?<eos> Not in this recession.<eos> Ruddy will have your ass.<eos> I got a hit!<eos> Ruddy doesn't count anymore!<eos> He was hoping I'd fall on my face with this Beale show, but I didn't.<eos> It's a big, fat, big-titted hit... and I don't have to waffle around with Ruddy anymore.
AND THE SHADES ARE PULLED DOWN.<eos> I LIVE RIGHT THERE. I LIVE RIGHT THERE.<eos> RIGHT THERE.<eos> 201 WEST 4TH STREET.<eos> WILLOW CORNERS, WISCONSIN.<eos> I LIVE RIGHT THERE.<eos> RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE.<eos> (Dr. Wilbur) THAT'S HARLEM.<eos> (Sybil as Peggy) I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE OTHER GLASS IS.<eos> [sobbing] IT'S IN DR. QUINONESS' INSTRUMENT CASE, AND IT'S ALL WHITE AND SHINY KNIVES. AND MY MOMMA SAYS, "I WILL TAKE YOU
-Why? You got me into this mess.<eos> Fine, where will you be?<eos> -I'll be in the bar.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> -Go on!<eos> Honey, is that you, dear?<eos> Yes. -I'm leaving in a minute.<eos> Holy shit! All these cops!<eos> -Honey, could you bring me my dress, please.<eos> It's on the chair.
When?<eos> Can you make it faster?<eos> She said, within an hour. Oh, God...<eos> I'll wait on the landing, and you will call me.<eos> Or you can explain everything yourself.<eos> And I'll go.<eos> Oh no, you sort out your own problems.<eos> 2 minutes to go before the New Year.<eos> Open the Champagne.<eos> It's in the fridge.
- What do they teach you?<eos> - I guess, the same thing.<eos> This is not fish. This is anything but fish in aspic.<eos> This is...<eos> It needs some horse-radish to go with.<eos> And I represent the most conservative of all professions.<eos> We can compete there.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> With us it is dangerous to have a personal opinion.<eos> What if it's a wrong one?
How I got into this predicament, I'll never know.<eos> Absolutely incredible.<eos> To be executed for a crime I never committed.<eos> Of course, isn't all mankind in the same boat?<eos> Isn't all mankind ultimately executed for a crime it never committed?
I'd hate to blow my brains out and then read in the papers they found something.<eos> Boris, let me show you how absurd your position is.<eos> All right. Let's say that there is no God, and each man is free to do exactly as he chooses.<eos> Well, what prevents you from murdering somebody?<eos> - Murder's immoral!<eos> - Morality is subjective.<eos> Yes, but subjectivity is objective.<eos> Not in any rational scheme of perception.<eos> Perception is irrational.<eos> It implies imminence.
Oh, what's this sore on my lip?<eos> I better see the doctor.<eos> Doc, I have this sore on my lip.<eos> - You have a social disease, my friend.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> If you do not treat it, you will go blind or insane!<eos> Well, men, that is the end of the play.<eos> Have a good time on your furlough, but look after yourselves.<eos> Well, what did you think of the play?<eos> Oh, it was weak.
- Yes, codfish is a dried fish.<eos> - Right.<eos> But ours was not only dried but also rotten.<eos> Right.<eos> They'd give us the worse fish they'd caught.<eos> - What about olive oil?<eos> - Olive oil?<eos> - You didn't have any of that?<eos> - All we had was palm tree oil.<eos> Was it as good as the oil here in Portugal?
Yesterday.<eos> Today.<eos> I don't remember yesterday.<eos> Today it rained.<eos> Why did you have to tie me up like that?<eos> You thought I'd call the police.<eos> I wouldn't have.<eos> Why?<eos> Sometimes...<eos> I take a picture that... isn't like me, but I took it, so it is like me.
THE MAGIC FLUTE<eos> OVERTURE<eos> ACT I<eos> Oh, help me, ye gods, will my prayers never reach you?<eos> Deliver me now from this beast, I beseech you<eos> Ye gods, show me mercy<eos> It's drawing so near
I wanted to...<eos> You see...<eos> Wow!<eos> You old donkey.<eos> What is my baby whispering?<eos> That my Krigsy has come at last!<eos> Yes, yes, it's me!<eos> Why doesn't my little baby embrace his little Krigsy?<eos> Because I haven't as yet got the promised permission.<eos> Where is it?

Then they deserve to perish, and perish they will when we launch our rocket.<eos> It's primed and ready.<eos> -The countdown for firing can begin immediately.<eos> -And it will fail.<eos> -It can't fail.<eos> -The Kaled dome cannot be penetrated.<eos> Your great rocket will hardly scratch it.<eos> This is the nature of my faith. Nyder.<eos> It is a simple chemical formula.<eos> If the substance is loaded into artillery shells and fired onto the surface of the Kaled dome, it will weaken the molecular structure and make it brittle.
Even some of the military are joining them.<eos> As I expected.<eos> -They will take action soon?<eos> -Almost certainly.<eos> They outnumber those of us who are loyal.<eos> Davros, why don't you let me take a squad of Elite men I can trust?<eos> In an hour, I could wipe out their leaders.<eos> You think like a soldier, Nyder.<eos> Rebellion is an idea in the mind.<eos> Suppress it and it hides away and festers.
Just be careful.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I think we can take care of things.<eos> Thanks for the warning.<eos> -No point in telling you to rest, I suppose.<eos> -No, there isn't.<eos> We've got to recover that time ring.<eos> Because without it, we'll never get off this planet.<eos> But where is it?<eos> It's on the desk in the main laboratory.
I don't believe it.<eos> -There's some more of it over here.<eos> -Oh, Harry.<eos> -Look.<eos> Gold.<eos> -Don't be so silly. It can't be gold.<eos> -Sarah, solid gold.<eos> -Harry, stop it!<eos> Anyway, it isn't ours.<eos> Well, it isn't anybody's, is it?
-You're fussing over nothing at all. -Harry, tell them.<eos> -I'm trying to tell them but they don't seem to...<eos> Please, wait. Where are you taking us?<eos> We weren't trying to steal your gold, if that's what you're thinking. Well, not really.<eos> HARRY:<eos> Of course we were. We were just...<eos> Voga, otherwise known as the Planet of Gold.<eos> He's hated and feared by Cybermen because gold is lethal to them. -How?<eos> -It's the perfect non-corrodible metal.<eos> It plates their breathing apparatus. And in effect, suffocates them.
Computer reports heavy phobic energy discharge between the beacon and Voga.<eos> That means the humans have recently used their transmat beam. -Yes, Leader.<eos> -Time to docking?<eos> -Sixteen minutes.<eos> -Good. Order the boarding party to the forward hatch.<eos> -The Doctor will be worrying about us.<eos> -I'm worrying about us.<eos> -What is this place, anyway?<eos> -I can tell you what it isn't.<eos> It isn't uninhabited.
-Shooting's too good for him.<eos> -So, what's it gonna be, Kellman? -Be?<eos> Are you going to die now?<eos> Or will you tell us where that pentalion drive is?<eos> You're not frightening me, Commander.<eos> You won't shoot.<eos> -But I have every right.<eos> -You can't prove a thing. No?<eos> Well, what about that box you had?<eos> The Doctor says it controls the Cybermats.
They'll have to be disposed of.<eos> Later.<eos> That was a near one.<eos> -We're nearly there, I think.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's the range and power of that weapon, Doctor?<eos> Power?<eos> Almost unlimited.<eos> Range, well, it could drill a hole in the surface of the moon.
- Yes.<eos> Your father is Father Kakinuma.<eos> The priest?<eos> is that true?<eos> Yes, it is true.<eos> He also asked me to dispose of your mother.<eos> That's a lie!<eos> It's true.<eos> Look at the sea.<eos> It hasn't changed.
Summer is nice and fun.<eos> You can swim and play and have- all- kinds- of- fun.<eos> You are a lucky man, Mr. Ingalls.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. Oleson.<eos> It's the only thing in this life I am absolutely sure of.<eos> Very lucky.<eos> Ma'am<eos> Ma', Pa' what'd you think?<eos> Did you like my essay?<eos> I thought it was lovely Mary.
This is the principle of commodity fetishism, the domination of society by... "intangible things as well as by tangible things,"<eos> that reaches its absolute fulfillment in the spectacle. where the tangible world finds itself replaced... by a selection of images which exists above it, and which at the same time has made itself... recognized as the tangible par excellence.<eos> The world at once present and absent... that the spectacle makes visible... is the world of the commodity... dominating everything that is lived.<eos> And the world of the commodity is thus shown as it is, for its movement is identical... to the distancing of men... from one another and from their global production.<eos> The domination of commodity... was at first exercised in an occult fashion over the economy, that itself, as the material base of social life, remained unrecognized and misunderstood, like the familiar which remains nonetheless unknown.<eos> In a society where the concrete commodity... remains rare or in the minority, the apparent domination of money presents itself... as the emissary with full powers... who speaks in the name of an unknown power.<eos> With the industrial revolution, the division of labor in manufacturing... and mass production for the world market, the commodity effectively appears... as a power that actually comes to occupy social life.<eos> It is then that political economy comes... to constitute the dominant science and the science of domination.<eos> The spectacle is a permanent opium war... to enforce the identification of goods with commodities, and of satisfaction... with survival increasing according to its own laws.<eos> But if consumable survival is something which should... always increase, it's because it never ceases to contain privation.
- Good evening, sir.<eos> How about a cup of coffee?<eos> Be prepared to remain all winter, all next winter, if necessary.<eos> I've waited a long time for that order, Sir... - which of course I didn't hear.<eos> - Of course you didn't hear.<eos> If you fail, I assure you the members of your court martial will... be the men who rode with us down at Shenandoah.<eos> I'll hand pick'em myself.<eos> Shenandoah.<eos> I wonder what history will say about Shenandoah.<eos> The victory of the bourgeoisie... is the victory of profoundly historical time, because it is the time... of the economic production that transforms the society, permanently and from top to bottom.
With the development of capitalism, irreversible time is unified globally.<eos> Universal history becomes a reality, for the entire world is assembled for the development of this time.<eos> But this history which is everywhere at one the same, is still only, the intra- historical refusal of history.<eos> The time of economic production, cut into equal abstract fragments, appears across the entire planet as the same day.<eos> Unified irreversible time is the time of the world market, and as a corollary of the world spectacle.<eos> The irreversible time of production is first of all... the measure of commodities.<eos> Thus, the time which is officially affirmed across... the entire expanse of the globe as the general time of society, signifying only the specialized interests which constitute it, is merely one particular time.<eos> The class struggles of the long... revolutionary epoch... inaugurated by the rise of the bourgeoisie... develop inseparably from historical thought, dialectics, thought which no longer stops at an investigation of the meaning... of what is, but rises to the knowledge of the dissolution... of all that is; and in the movement dissolves all separation.<eos> This historical thought is still only the consciousness... which arrives late, and which declares its justification post festum.<eos> Thus, it has surpassed separation only in thought.
We said no to May.<eos> Now she wants to bring in this animal from the outside.<eos> Think about equilibrium.<eos> Remember the delicate balance we must maintain.<eos> The presence will dismay our tranquility.<eos> May is a great scientist, but she also has destructive tendencies.<eos> - We have adequate means of controlling it.<eos> - Surely, we are not so vulnerable!<eos> Look at it.<eos> It knows its life is at stake. Otherwise, it would rape and kill, as it always has.
Had a bureau dresser down there and everything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He drowned, too.<eos> Come again? Yeah. Got drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.<eos> The L.A. River?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right under Hollenbeck Bridge.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> Why, it's dry as a bone, Morty.<eos> It's not completely dry. Well, he ain't going to exactly drown in a damp riverbed no matter how soused he is.
I need to ask you about the eighth reel, the sequence with the mother.<eos> We'll look at it later.<eos> At every level, I feel I'm blocked.<eos> By taking my childhood as the subject for this film... I get the feeling I'm exploiting it.<eos> It's the same with the landscape.<eos> The more I describe it, the more vague it gets.<eos> When you start to objectify yourself and your background... you turn them into a cheap spectacle.<eos> But that is the way to liberate oneself from childhood and its setting.<eos> Basically, the whole past is just fiction.<eos> But if I don't try to express it, it remains the core of my being.
Nothing could deter him from his intent, and one night he carried out his macabre plan.<eos> The mysterious hand of death had spared her face, which had remained as fresh and delicate as a rose.<eos> They found her beneath her tombstone amid her repugnant paraphernal -<eos> What's that?<eos> "Paraphernalia." Is that a sweet-smelling herb?<eos> Is it a rosary?<eos> - Not that either.<eos> It's a legal term for the personal property of a married woman.<eos> But in English, the word "paraphernalia" has a much broader meaning.<eos> It refers to any accoutrements, belongings, personal items, even fishing gear or a sewing kit.
My letter in the other.<eos> "I never had a drink before," I said, "but, oh, how I do enjoy it."<eos> I pulled the $350,000 string of pearls out of the waste-paper basket and said,<eos> "Here, dearest, you take them back to whoever from Chicago they belong to, "and tell him, tell them all, that Daisy's changed her mind."<eos> Daisy's changed her mind!<eos> Next day you married Tom Buchanan, without so much as a shiver.<eos> You know what Jordan did?<eos> She ran a cold tub and dropped me into it, dress and all.<eos> And I couldn't stop crying but I wouldn't let go of your letter.<eos> I hung onto it and hung onto it. Until... it came to pieces in the water melted away like snow.
Shame, you missed out!<eos> But you must have had fun.<eos> You were rich and handsome, what did you do?<eos> - What did I do?<eos> I studied and travelled.<eos> I fought in a war and I got married. But it didn't work out.<eos> And when I finally looked around, I found myself in the middle of people I no longer understood.<eos> Come on, Professor, We're not that different.<eos> No, he's right.<eos> Don't forget, society is what it is.
If I surrender, it is to you alone.<eos> You do not want that?<eos> What must I say?<eos> The "yes" that I see on your lips.<eos> If you see it, it is there.<eos> You can do with me as you wish.<eos> - What are you looking at?<eos> - The moon.<eos> Carmaduc says the little cloud drowns the moon.<eos> I say it strangles it.
What I could do, I have done.<eos> I loved you more than anyone has ever loved.<eos> You lie.<eos> You will never cease to love me.<eos> I shall suffer instead.<eos> You choose suffering?<eos> I have chosen nothing.<eos> If I could see into your heart.<eos> You see it.<eos> It bleeds; it is torn.
Yeah, calm down.<eos> All over, redhead.<eos> He'd killed us.<eos> Sooner or later.<eos> Yes, I understand...<eos> It's alright.<eos> You know he wanted to die rather than be taken alive. I understand.<eos> BEFORE COMITTING SUICIDE,<eos> THE MADMAN KILLED A COUPLE USING THEIR OWN REVOLVER.<eos> To protect itself, society starts mechanisms it can't control in the end.
The sister was not one of those who can to commit suicide.<eos> She loved life too.<eos> So I do not believe in her suicide.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> It's not like her.<eos> I think there are people who can commit suicide And people who never also, if you know what I mean.<eos> Yes.<eos> The desire to kill himself Does not appear out of nowhere.<eos> - It is always inside.
Well, it wasn't all that nice a job<eos> Dirty dishes wouldn't suit me at all<eos> Thank you, come again<eos> My life is quite nice, - although the business is going worse and worse<eos> But in this profession there's not much one can do<eos> With your face and figure you could charge a lot<eos> Do be quiet, Greta.<eos> I want to do it my own way<eos> Yes, yes, but don't let too much time pass<eos> One has to use one's body as long as it attracts men
- When we get to the museum.<eos> Could it have been a dream ?<eos> - Tell me, Marie...<eos> Yes ?<eos> You could wear long skirts.<eos> You don't have to show your thighs to the world.<eos> John likes it.<eos> - "John likes it".<eos> Are you going to find the animal ?<eos> Do you know where it is ?

When father sees, he'll kill us<eos> I know<eos> We must think of something<eos> -Undressing?<eos> -Why not, it doesn't matter now<eos> We must make the most of our time<eos> I will think of something<eos> Don't throw my coat on the floor!<eos> That coat will have to be returned<eos> It's not yours
Tell 'em the rest.<eos> When the time lock on the vault opens... these men will take what they came for.<eos> I will leave with them.<eos> We will return to my house.<eos> Keep on.<eos> There is another man at my house with my family.<eos> They will pick him up and leave.<eos> This man has told me no one will be hurt if no one interferes.<eos> So, everyone, please cooperate... and don't set off any alarms.<eos> What time does it open?
It'll take two of us working the inside.<eos> Any objections to Hooker as second man?<eos> We'll give Lonnegan the hook on the train and play him here.<eos> J.J., you think I can get in that poker game?<eos> Just show up with a lot of money and look like a sucker.<eos> I also gotta win.<eos> By the way, any of you guys been passing bad money lately?<eos> If he comes in again, stall him so I can get a look at him.<eos> Fella by the name of Stenner had this place 'til about six months ago... but he had to give it up.<eos> It doesn't look so good, but maybe you can fix it up a little bit.
We can't change the law...<eos> You are making it a little too easy for yourself, gentlemen.<eos> What did he say?<eos> - You don't sail around that thing this easily.<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> - Soon the world is...<eos> - An ethical problem...<eos> - You see...<eos> - Space attracts time.<eos> - What it attracts is death.
-How far do you think we've come?<eos> -It's hard to tell.<eos> We should strike one of the cooling ducts soon.<eos> What's that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just keep moving.<eos> Taron, could be the start of an eruption.<eos> It's possible.<eos> Then let's get back while we still have time.<eos> No, if it's coming, we're already too late.
I wonder if I can remember the way.<eos> - Got a bit of paper?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Can we go through the west seam?<eos> No, that was closed.<eos> - They haven't got any.<eos> - That's ridiculous!<eos> I thought so myself.<eos> We had the equipment up here a fortnight ago.<eos> It's in the storage shed behind the power house.
There was this old Taff in the pub and...<eos> The Doctor and the girl are the only ones to have seen these creatures?<eos> A load of old codswallop if you ask me, but I thought I ought to tell you.<eos> That's quite right.<eos> Quite right.<eos> And where is this egg now?<eos> Over at the Nuthutch.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, you'd better go and get it, hadn't you?<eos> It's a tremendous size.
He said he was very fond of delta particles.<eos> Ah.<eos> Is he here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Somewhere.<eos> I was hiding in the machine when he left.<eos> It becomes clear.<eos> Linx, what of the weapon?<eos> Very well.<eos> It is here.

Brown and Chestnut.<eos> No-one knew which one was the most greedy for food.<eos> It didn't matter anyway since their own mother herself could hardly tell who was Brown and who was Chestnut.<eos> And still two other twins, Red and Redhead, dirty, dedicated but more courageous than them you die.<eos> And at last, their last child, born alone this time.<eos> At his birth he was hardly taller than a thumb.<eos> And for this reason he was called Thumb.<eos> Tom Thumb.<eos> The name had stayed.<eos> And sometimes it provoked bouts of anger bigger than him.
Through the door?<eos> We started that awful journey from the courtyard.<eos> But how did the devil get in?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You do know!<eos> He slipped under the door.<eos> Or through the window, perhaps?<eos> Under the door.<eos> Was the window closed?<eos> It was open.
That's right.<eos> You mustn't do silly things, even if you're lonely.<eos> In the spring he sent me a postcard.<eos> You should study, Lisa.<eos> Come to the city in August.<eos> I'll get you into a technical school.<eos> That was last year, in 1941.<eos> Have faith, Lisa. Don't give up hoping.<eos> Maybe you will find happiness around the corner.<eos> And maybe it will be tomorrow.
I told Schneider we'd be gone for at least two months, maybe more.<eos> She cried and cried and said she'd miss us.<eos> I think the only reason she was crying, though, was because she knew she can't get 50 marks a month from anybody else for this pitiful little room.<eos> You know: "Money makes the world go around."<eos> Where've you been?<eos> I've been packing for hours.<eos> Have some champagne, darling.<eos> Compliments of Max.<eos> Oh, your laundry came back.<eos> It's there on the bed.
What times!<eos> The end of the world is really coming...<eos> Oh mother!<eos> All in embroidered silk, a real dream...<eos> You're right, I myself have seen the duchess wear that dress.<eos> - They say it comes from France...<eos> - The French have wanderful tailors but I find that dress truly scandalous!<eos> - Do you think it is too short?<eos> - Very short!<eos> To think it even shows your ankles!
I was very late for school.<eos> I began running downhill.<eos> Suddenly, I felt a strong sensation here.<eos> I came as I ran.<eos> Then I ran faster and faster, and the more I ran... the more I came.<eos> Two days later I tried running again... but no dice.<eos> Why don`t you listen to me?<eos> You know, it seems to me l`m talking to the wall.<eos> Your solitude weighs on me, you know?<eos> It isn`t indulgent or generous.
wardrobe, makeup, the way I make that fist before I go on.<eos> - You know, all that inside stuff. - Uh-huh.<eos> - Mary, did you finish that letter?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'll get it for you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just trying to keep up the troop's morale, Lou.<eos> Does he really believe that?<eos> Incredible.<eos> - Here it is, Mr. Grant. - Oh, thanks.
Do you always have to put me down in front of people?<eos> - Only when you start acting like Ironside.<eos> - You're acting like Ironside.<eos> Officers, I do hate to seem to be rushing things, but I really have to get going.<eos> It'll just be a few more minutes.<eos> Jackson, why don't you check the window sash?<eos> - Mary, here's a dress for you.<eos> It's brand new, never been worn.<eos> - Oh, Phyl...<eos> Here it is. It has 10,000 miles on it, but it's just back from the cleaners.
Computers are not part... of the working class, even if some who claim to speak for the working class, and especially certain "Marxist-Leninists"<eos> seem to act like machines or computers.<eos> Why discuss for hours a workshop's aims, and its immediate objectives.<eos> Do not focus on the future.<eos> Only discussion based on practice is useful.<eos> Or unity around ways of fighting the bosses.<eos> That's how you start to organize.<eos> It's easy.<eos> The lumpen must create their own rebel forces... in terms of their own life... their special relations... to the means of production and to social institutions.<eos> They must attack all the structures around them... including the right wing of their own class... when it tries to bar the road to revolution.
Even if what?<eos> If Terumichi is alive, I will not need a return ticket<eos> Ritsuko, is this your definition of a life without regrets?<eos> What a horrible face you make!<eos> Returning or not, in any case our life, hasn't it begun with a return, when we had been renaturalized from Manchuria?<eos> Yes, maybe.<eos> But if the renaturalization is the regret of the great Japanese empire... then we are all children barn from this regret<eos> This is valid for Setsuko, as well as you, Ritsuko... as for the children of war criminals like Tadashi<eos> Go, go, to the future!<eos> May it come or not
The state department?<eos> Hello, Rodge.<eos> Oh, no, Rodge.<eos> That's just a rumour.<eos> Rumour or not, Ed, this could play hard with our foreign monetary agreements.<eos> Believe me, Rodge, we are on top of this thing.<eos> No, sirree, not a single foreign country... will hear anything about it.<eos> Get me the US ambassador.<eos> How dare they meddle with their gold.<eos> It's all ours.

We're just alike.<eos> Poor dear, no contact with the world.<eos> She says nothing.<eos> She can't speak any more.<eos> No possibility of contact.<eos> I am Fini Straubinger, from Munich.<eos> No, but she looks at you.<eos> When you let go of my hand... it is as if we were... a thousand miles apart.<eos> Another much neglected group... unable to assert its rights... in our affluent society... where only production counts... is the group of the disabled.<eos> Society owes them more... than just the right to live... it owes them complete integration... in various aspects.
I'll take care of it.<eos> - Some are broken.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Throw 'em out.<eos> I've come to do my bills.<eos> Don't you do that in the office?<eos> It's too noisy.<eos> What is it?<eos> That dress you're wearing.<eos> It's pretty.
And notes come floating out.<eos> Oh, sorry, I don't smoke.<eos> Would you like to try it?<eos> No.<eos> You've been here five years?<eos> Shall I satisfy your curiosity?<eos> I'm a doctor of medicine.<eos> And a tramp by temperament.<eos> I'm also an alcoholic.<eos> My disease prevented me from practicing in Sydney, but out here it's scarcely noticeable.
Where do you come from? - From Luxembourg, Madam.<eos> Luxembourg ... lf l'm not mistaken, it's ruled by a very old dynasty.<eos> Grand duchess Marie-Adelaide.<eos> Marie-Adelaide, what a charming name!<eos> Say it again.<eos> Do your parents move in exalted circles in Luxembourg?<eos> My parents are wine growers.<eos> How strange!<eos> I've never heard of that wine.<eos> is it white or red?

I'll take care of my mother, you, get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> You just get out!<eos> C'mon, we have a lot to do.<eos> Oh, Willard!<eos> I don't want to seem precipitous, Willard, but, there are a few things about your mother's estate you should know right away.<eos> Your mother left everything to you. The house, the clothes, everything.<eos> Oh, what about money?<eos> Did she leave any money?<eos> Well, your mother was living on a small annuity, unfortunately it died with her.
You can get up now.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> You know, you really ought to keep this thing of yours under better control.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> He's only a mark three servo-robot.<eos> He's not very bright.<eos> What happened in here?<eos> Well, I only wish I knew.<eos> Something attacked this place late last night.<eos> Is it your place?

Why should they foist this gift onto us?<eos> They must want something.<eos> Jo, tell me again about that creature that you saw.<eos> You mean you believe me?<eos> Of course I believe you.<eos> I always did.<eos> Now then, you're quite sure it was Bill Filer that you heard?<eos> This body they found... was there no identification?<eos> Apparently not.<eos> When they touched it, it just disintegrated.
Mama, I'm tired.<eos> Me, too, and my feet hurt.<eos> Look, baby, it's late and the kids are bushed.<eos> - I'll bet we walked a hundred miles.<eos> - I'll bet it's more than a thousand.<eos> Now, now, darlings, cheer up.<eos> Mr O'Malley knows a place where we can stay tonight.<eos> How much farther is it, Mr O'Malley?<eos> Keep your whiskers up, tiger.<eos> It's just beyond that next chimney pot.
The roses are nice?<eos> Very nice.<eos> I'll go for the roses.<eos> Hm ... Very well.<eos> A dozen?<eos> A dozen.<eos> I'm Capella.<eos> Funny name.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know but it's funny.
There is only one Pope!<eos> Let me be not the judge, but allow a higher judge in. The Judgement of God.<eos> Gregorio, who is your champ?<eos> Here!<eos> I'm Brancaleone from Norcia, the champ of the Good Sheperd!<eos> Yes, I'm talking to you.<eos> False uncle, false king and even false champ of a false pope.<eos> - Champ...<eos> - If you're brave enough, arm your dishonoured sword! - Champ.<eos> - I'll tear through your heart even if it were stone and through the hearts of those who are loyal to you.
In his last speech the president Sigmundus , referring to the TV, said:<eos> Do you think we can speak honestly about the TV, about our TV like something that makes us brutes?<eos> Isn't the TV, like any tool invested by men, a technique whose function will depend on the function men give it?<eos> The function that we give it?<eos> Couldn't the TV be the most neutral and perfect instrument of education, information and conformism of mankind?<eos> Why should it be wrong that we like this or the other program?<eos> If you like watching TV for a while after dinner?<eos> Are we going to allow these eternally disatisfied, bitter people to ruin our lives, getting in the way of our desires?<eos> Doesn't TV make social comunication easier?<eos> Doesn't it allow us to reach you?
I think we're going to get away.<eos> - Let me at him!<eos> I've got a gun here.<eos> - We must be civilized.<eos> "And it came to pass after the plague that the Lord spake..."<eos> Grab the reins!<eos> Grab the reins!<eos> - Give it!<eos> Give me that shotgun.<eos> - No, it's mine!
I'm glad to hear that, my son.<eos> - I thought they were.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I know of one who is as brave as any Human Being.<eos> I'd like to meet this man and smoke with him.<eos> What is he called?<eos> He's called General Custer.<eos> General Custer.<eos> - What does the name mean, my son?<eos> - Well, it means "long hair".
You need help.<eos> Help and protection.<eos> Well, we offered it, my governor, personally.<eos> You had an appointment.<eos> He waited 15 minutes.<eos> - You slag, 15 minutes.<eos> - He checked the letter.<eos> You call this a service to the public?<eos> Look at this equipment.<eos> Not maintained, is it?
I might powder you.<eos> I might polish you.<eos> I might make you shiny like a mirror.<eos> I just don't know.<eos> What's that?<eos> What do you call it?<eos> Pectoral.<eos> Do you like my physique?<eos> Yeah, it's in...<eos> It's in good condition.
Why did I have to get with this woman?<eos> I'm going to make you pay for this!<eos> You'll see.<eos> - And use the soap.<eos> - Yeah, the soap.<eos> Where's the damn soap?<eos> It fell in the water.<eos> Soap.<eos> Soap.<eos> Ah, here it is.
What have we got here?<eos> What is it, Sir Keith?<eos> Open it, please.<eos> We've been getting traces of this stuff from number 2 output pipe for some time now.<eos> Recently, it's started coming out in greater quantities.<eos> -Analysis report?<eos> -None.<eos> -So far the substance has defied analysis.<eos> -Ridiculous.<eos> If it exists, it can be analysed.

This might be the last day of your lives.<eos> If by chance tomorrow, waking up, we realise we're still alive, ...well, let's thank the gods for giving us one more day.<eos> That's how a Roman man uses his head And I'm Roman.<eos> And I eat.<eos> Long live Trimalchio!<eos> Have you already finished?<eos> Try to use two fingers.<eos> Try to reach it.<eos> The ring is yours, if you want.<eos> It's yours.

Existence is more than a restless void.<eos> It's a dance which forces us to dance fanatically.<eos> When the objcet of thought is dead and fragmentary, the thought itself has an internal life, like that of a flame.<eos> There's no point in responding to those who believe that this world exists and justify themselves accordingly.<eos> When they speak, you can see them without hearing them.<eos> And even if you look at them, you can see only what exists far in the distance behind them.<eos> There's no point in exciting oneself "en route", trying to attract the attention of those who have only vague desires such as wasting time, laughing or becoming eccentric.<eos> You have to advance without a backward glance, paying no attention to those who haven't the strength to escape their immediate reality.<eos> Humanity overextends itself, trying to be the raison d'etre of the universe.<eos> If it becomes vital to the survival of the universe, it becomes a slave.
Also, we know how hard it is for an army to cross the Channel.<eos> The last little corporal who tried came a cropper.<eos> So don't threaten or dictate to us until you're marching up Whitehall.<eos> And even then, we won't listen.<eos> Heil Hitler.<eos> It's unforgivable.<eos> I lost my temper.<eos> The maddening thing is that he's right.<eos> We're not ready, we're on our own, and we've been playing for time.<eos> And it's running out.
Somebody found out there really was a map.<eos> Two weeks ago, the old man up and left the tribe.<eos> Why didn't he pass it on?<eos> I guess he didn't know who he could trust.<eos> See, the Apache have changed.<eos> They're beginning to think like white men now.<eos> The young ones figure they got more use for that gold...<eos> - ... than those old spirits have.<eos> - There isn't any gold.<eos> If there was, it would belong to the whole tribe.
I don't know this one, but he looks pale too.<eos> What are you?<eos> A dentist?<eos> He's the editor of the Hadleyberg Gazette.<eos> This one looks like a preacher.<eos> I preach.<eos> What do you preach?<eos> The word of God.<eos> But you like gold, huh?<eos> It can work for the Lord as well as the devil.
It'd cover the first collision.<eos> Yes, we must find out if another accident happened that day.<eos> We took care of that.<eos> The idea isn't new.<eos> There are different possibilities.<eos> Perhaps the car hasn't been damaged which is unlikely.<eos> Or maybe the guy put it in a private garage.<eos> In that case, it's still there<eos> Or he might have repaired it himself.<eos> If this hypothesis is right does it inform us about the man?
Look, the way you're going, you may find yourself on the front steps of the Russian embassy tomorrow.<eos> And that would be the end for me.<eos> But you would never get another defector.<eos> Colonel Kusenov, does the word "Topaz" mean anything to you?<eos> In what context?<eos> Just the word "Topaz."<eos> It's a gem, a stone used in jewelry.<eos> In intelligence matters.<eos> Where have you seen this word?<eos> What does it mean to you?
The Blessed Mary just gave it to me.<eos> - When?<eos> - A half-hour ago.<eos> I saw her.<eos> She appeared to me.<eos> To me, who had scorned and insulted her.<eos> Faith doesn't come to us through reason, but through the heart.<eos> Of course.<eos> Here, keep it.<eos> A miracle is always stirring, but it's nothing to get worked up about.
Right here, captain.<eos> Explain, Spock.<eos> One of a kind?<eos> - I am Bele.<eos> - Of the planet Cheron, no doubt.<eos> Forgive my unorthodox arrival.<eos> Your mode of travel was also unorthodox.<eos> Secure from Red Alert.<eos> What happened to your vehicle?<eos> It served me long and durably.
I'll drink to that.<eos> - What emotion?<eos> - Envy.<eos> None of these da Vinci paintings has been catalogued or reproduced.<eos> They are unknown works, apparently authentic to the last brushstroke and use of materials.<eos> Undiscovered da Vincis would be priceless. Would be?<eos> You mean you think they're fakes?<eos> Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes.<eos> Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin.<eos> Well, this could be what it seems to be.
What happened?<eos> The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the arm of the chair.<eos> No, Mr. Spock, I meant, what happened to us?<eos> That we have yet to ascertain.<eos> Mr. Spock.<eos> The planet's gone.<eos> What kind of earthquakes do they have in this place?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Any more like that, and they'll tear this planet apart<eos> Captain, this tremor we felt, if that's what it was... than it's certainly like no seismic disturbance I've ever felt before.
- Very well.<eos> Reduce speed to warp 7.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> Warp 7.<eos> Mr. Spock. Our speed has increased to warp 8.9 and still climbing. Bridge to Engineering.<eos> Negative effect on power reduction.<eos> Speed is still increasing.<eos> Aye, Mr. Spock, and I've found out why.<eos> The emergency bypass control of the matter/antimatter integrator is fused.<eos> It's completely useless.
- Remove his shields.<eos> What is your business in Stratos, Troglyte?<eos> - Speak!<eos> I command you.<eos> - My business is to repair.<eos> - Repair what?<eos> - There are damaged entrance panels.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Then you must have a repair permit.<eos> Where is it?
- Are you still there?<eos> - Yes, Your Excellency.<eos> There was considerable interference with your transmission.<eos> A lot of noise drowned out what was said.<eos> Would you repeat, please?<eos> I apologise for the noise, Your Excellency.<eos> To summarise, I request permission to transport down to Gideon.<eos> Forgive me, Mr. Spock.<eos> No criticism of your equipment was intended.<eos> But it has sent your captain on some strange journey, a safe one, we all still hope.
Her death is unnecessary.<eos> Even if she lives, her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would.<eos> No, her death at so young an age will let the people know for certain that our life cycle can be changed.<eos> It is the symbol that will bring forth the dedicated young volunteers.<eos> The serum in their new blood will change Gideon, and it will once more be the paradise it was.<eos> I'm glad that you are here.<eos> Is the time short?<eos> Very short.<eos> And I asked you to make our journey last forever.<eos> It began here.
Queen to Queen's Level 3, captain.<eos> You'll talk freely, and quite soon.<eos> What you see before you, captain, is my latest invention.<eos> Quite ordinary in appearance.<eos> Almost primitive, wouldn't you say?<eos> Yes, I recognise it.<eos> It's used for rehabilitation purposes.<eos> It helped many men back to health.<eos> Appearances can be deceiving.<eos> Once, it was a part of the rehabilitation process and, as such, quite painless.

You'd better take these, here.<eos> Drink up now - all down.<eos> That's it.<eos> Flashing ball burning her mind?<eos> What did she mean?<eos> Is it another of the Krotons weapons?<eos> I don't know...<eos> Look, you stay here with her, I'll go and get the Doctor.<eos> It's crystalline.<eos> Yes, it's hard but it-it's not brittle.
THE TWO HIGH-BRAINS ARE THERE. BRING THEM HERE.<eos> Could be a fracture.<eos> Feels painful enough.<eos> I'll strap it.<eos> Oh Doctor, give me the wood.<eos> Yes w.. hurry up Zoe!<eos> We've got to move out of here you know.<eos> You think there'll be another earthquake?<eos> Oh that was not an earthquake.<eos> Oh no, it was coming from the machine.
Be careful.<eos> INTERPOL and the police are looking for the criminal.<eos> - Is this the formula?<eos> - This is the one.<eos> Bromine, zinc, nickel...<eos> Almost all inferior metals can be transmuted into gold.<eos> My friends will have all they'll ever need.<eos> Provided that the formula works.<eos> You too will have a lot of gold.<eos> Gold was created by the Devil King to control the souls of men... but it turned out to be stronger than its creator.
My lord and master...<eos> I need you!<eos> We must time it precisely.<eos> Three minutes of bombardment.<eos> Eastern Imports Inc.<eos> - Good evening, miss.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, Mr. Lin is testing some new equipment.<eos> It arrived just today from the East.
- You need more ice?<eos> - Yes, if you would.<eos> I even published my memoirs in your paper, you may recall.<eos> Yes.<eos> I remember them very well.<eos> If I'm not mistaken, Simon, before you were an Idol, you were a clairvoyant psychic.<eos> Yes.<eos> I could read the future in cards and coffee grounds.<eos> But my specialty was the rotten egg.<eos> I'd crack a rotten egg, and read the future in the odor it released.
But, it's too late.<eos> Too late.<eos> We have to thank Egor somehow! - Mama, don't spoil him!<eos> He will be offended.<eos> He's our relative.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Wow, your hog in this coffin is cut or whole?<eos> - Cut, uncle Egor.<eos> - Mom, pass me my ice-cream.<eos> - But where's it?
The images in this film are real,the people are real. The facts have been collected from newspaper reports.<eos> 00:04:13,860 -- 00:04:17,861 Acid: this is what the American hippies call it.<eos> It means 'Acid' or LSD: Diethylamide lysergic acid.<eos> It's the most famous of the hallucinogens.<eos> It's use has defined the psychedelic generation.<eos> It is a tool of protest amongst the youth.<eos> Faces from the protest in New York.<eos> In the village... An area made famous by Jazz and then the Beatniks.<eos> Today, it's a centre for hippies, and the protest movement. The free men.<eos> The youth say there's a contradiction between what society promises, and what it's actually doing.
There are two reactions; the first is an acute reaction...<eos> The second is longer term toxic damage.<eos> Regarding the acute reaction, there are two consequences... One requires a longer stay in hospital, the other often leads to suicide...<eos> Hence the growing suicide rate...<eos> There have also been cases of self-mutilation...<eos> In California, a youth who had taken LSD, looked at himself in the mirror and said "Christ has suffered, why shouldn't I?"<eos> Went in to the bathroom and slashed his throat and both wrists.<eos> The next day, we went to see a psychedelic show with Paola...<eos> The venue was called 'The Underground"...<eos> It seemed to symbolise the entire underground psychedelic movement.
There's no reason to run away.<eos> Don't go crazy.<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> The murderer wants to kill me!<eos> Why do think that?<eos> Because I found Betty Ann's body.<eos> You should have told the police.<eos> Where's the body?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It disappeared.
-No, nothing serious.<eos> Which sport do you do?<eos> -The war, for 25 years.<eos> But during this time of peace, you've swollen up.<eos> You have cellulites.<eos> Just like my wife.<eos> -I have nothing to do with your wife.<eos> You do.<eos> -No. That check-up wasn't compulsory.<eos> It was. -It wasn't.
- It would be great.<eos> - If n anything against it?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> Give Roberta a drink now.<eos> - My husband's new building is visible where<eos> I would like to yes we see your building.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - What do you like?<eos> - The high black.<eos> - It is there.

I was just about your age then.<eos> It died...<eos> and that was sad.<eos> In the cupboard in my room is a picture book of horses. Can you go and fetch it?<eos> For Axel.<eos> You should look at those pictures carefully.<eos> There are a lot of horses you could be fond of.<eos> Come one, Victorine!<eos> Do you see that tree?<eos> It looks like my grandfather.
I might not have been able to warn you the floor is mined - small, sensitive, and quite deadly.<eos> Oh, I almost forgot, they will all explode anyway in 90 seconds.<eos> That's the hot line, or had you noticed?<eos> On from the butcher's and baker's into the candlestick maker's, only he never made candles like these.<eos> They have a cyanide derivative mixed with wax.<eos> As the wax burns, it gives off cyanide.<eos> Every candle is breathing poison into the air.<eos> I do so believe in double glazing, don't you?<eos> It keeps out the noise.<eos> Of course, it does keep out the air, too.
I don't know.<eos> Lieutenant Hadley, check the language banks and find out what a... heater is.<eos> One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this.<eos> - It's amazing.<eos> - They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society. - As the Bible.<eos> - In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down.<eos> The gangs nearly took over.<eos> Yeah, well, this Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all.<eos> We may quarrel with Mr. Oxmyx's methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one.<eos> This society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy.
Men seek us because through us they become great leaders.<eos> I took you because you cast a spell upon me.<eos> And I have spells that help me keep you.<eos> Remember this leaf?<eos> The night we camped by the water?<eos> The night of madness.<eos> Oh, Tyree, did you really hate that madness?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> It brought up evil beasts from my soul.
He's paralleling us again.<eos> He seems to have broken off the attack.<eos> What sort of readings, Mr. Spock?<eos> She is the source.<eos> Elaan?<eos> The necklace.<eos> What kind of jewels are in this?<eos> They call them radans.<eos> The necklace is supposed to bring you luck.<eos> It is of little value.
There will be no more loneliness for you.<eos> - There's something I need to tell you.<eos> - There is nothing you need to say.<eos> - But there is.<eos> - Then tell me.<eos> If the telling is such a need.<eos> I have an illness for which there is no cure.<eos> I have one year to live.<eos> Until I saw you, there was nothing in my heart.<eos> It sustained my life, but nothing more.

That is the way.<eos> Their voices sound mechanical.<eos> - Are they computers?<eos> - Computers?<eos> You've seen them?<eos> Do they have bodies?<eos> Not such as ours.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It is not used.<eos> It's very old.

Kirk out.<eos> - Hold our position, Mr. Kyle. - Aye, aye, sir.<eos> Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead.<eos> No analysis due to insufficient information.<eos> No speculation, no information, nothing.<eos> I've asked three times for information and you've been unable to supply it.<eos> "Insufficient data" is not sufficient, Mr. Spock. You're the science officer.<eos> You're to have sufficient data all the time.<eos> I am well aware of that, captain, but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon.<eos> It is beyond our experience, and the new information is not yet significant.
That is what is drawing us toward it, captain.<eos> The same way it drew the Intrepid to her death.<eos> That is an amoeba.<eos> Yes, I remember my basic biology, doctor.<eos> Do you mean to tell me that thing out there is a giant, single-celled animal?<eos> Yes, for lack of a better term.<eos> It's a very simple form of life.<eos> In fact, it's a much simpler form of life than what you're looking at now.<eos> But that thing out there apparently can perform all the functions that qualify it as a living organism.<eos> It can reproduce, it can breathe, it can eat, although I don't know what.
You want to play the part of the Victorian grandfather, that's all right by me.<eos> Must be a pretty good gimmick.<eos> You pay me well enough.<eos> It, uh... helps to sell to our customers.<eos> Yeah, sure, sure.<eos> You've, uh... never told me what it is exactly you've got against this Doctor and his friend.<eos> Some kind of vendetta or something?<eos> Explanations are not part of our arrangement.<eos> Oh, just wondering.<eos> Imagination is a virtue, but it can become a vice.
Each people has its beauty.<eos> How amazing it is that European eyes are usually coloured!<eos> I wonder who invented blue eyes.<eos> And Japanese men?<eos> Men were the mirrors in which I could see my own face.<eos> I was astonished when I understood that I was living in their eyes. The witnesses of my life.<eos> They never criticise me or look for the faults in my face.<eos> They seem to be looking at me through a frosted window.<eos> Why were they always so kind and always so generous whereas a real mirror never forgives me?<eos> There are myths and the past in a mirror, and it is proud of them.

Friends we shall never be and you know it.<eos> I'm unable to think of you and me separately.<eos> I see before us either despair and wretchedness, or happiness.<eos> - Is there no chance of it?<eos> - No! No!<eos> You know that friendship's not what I need.<eos> Only one thing can make me happy.<eos> That word which frightens you so.<eos> Yes, love.<eos> I don't like to use that word because it means so much to me.
I've never known this cruel streak in you.<eos> You call cruelty the husband's right to demand observance of decency?<eos> That is cruelty?<eos> It's worse than cruelty.<eos> It's baseness.<eos> No!<eos> Baseness is to leave a husband and son for your lover and still eat your husband's bread.<eos> I'll take the needed steps to put an end to this situation.<eos> You cannot imagine my situation any worse than I feel it to be myself.<eos> It will come to an end by itself very soon.
You always boast of your uprightness, so why don't you tell the truth?<eos> You should know I never have boasted.<eos> And I always tell the truth.<eos> I wish you could learn to respect...<eos> Respect... respect...<eos> Respect was invented to cover up the empty space left by the absence of love.<eos> Actually, if you no longer love me, it would be more honest to say so.<eos> Oh! It's getting intolerable!<eos> Why do you try my patience?<eos> It has limits!
That was my style. With any other girl, that is.<eos> In any case, for several days, we all got along quite pleasantly, each engrossed in his own pursuits, as well as chores around the house, to which we purposely attached exaggerated importance.<eos> Haydée proved quite compatible and able to follow our lead, without imitating our quirks too much.<eos> Nevertheless, I could sense a hitch somewhere, although Haydée very cleverly hid the game that, rightly or wrongly, I suspected she was playing.<eos> It was precisely this reserved quality that bothered me.<eos> So I decided to take a risk, afraid of settling for the easy way out, and force the issue.<eos> Shall we sit here?<eos> Catch.<eos> The worst thing around here is the wine.<eos> It's disgusting. I don't drink it anymore.
Most of them have known you practically since you were born.<eos> What is it, Ben?<eos> I'm just...<eos> Worried?<eos> Well...<eos> About what?<eos> I guess about my future.<eos> What about it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I want it to be...
There's just one?<eos> Right, just one.<eos> Where will you sleep?<eos> On the sofa, don't worry.<eos> This is great.<eos> Who do you bring here, the nurse?<eos> -Who?<eos> -l saw how she looked at you.<eos> Don't be absurd.<eos> You put the meat in the trunk, it stinks of gasoline.
Fine.<eos> A promise made...<eos> We can't leave him on the loose.<eos> He was picked up and held several hours by Homicide.<eos> The fact they released him proves nothing.<eos> He might still be a suspect.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> He came up with a terrific alibi.<eos> - And if it doesn't hold up?<eos> - No way it won't. It's a two-part alibi.
It's a sickness.<eos> And the doctor can help.<eos> It is the curse of Barcuna!<eos> By morning my people will be destroyed.<eos> Is this how a great chief leads his people?<eos> Will you allow your village to die without even trying to save it?<eos> I think I can help your child and your people.<eos> Please let me try.<eos> This medicine...<eos> Where is it?
THE WEST<eos> Civilization means belonging to class society a reality of contradictions<eos> The development of productive forces is linked to the exploitation of man by man<eos> Slavery, serfdom, wage-earning these are the forms of servitude characterizing civilization's epochs<eos> Engels observed the steps leading to class society and inter-class relations as beginning with the Greeks and ending in industrial capitalism<eos> Private property, monogamy and the state and from a classless society to a class society<eos> To be precise:<eos> Morgan, whom Engels drew upon said man progressed from advanced savagery to primitive barbarism when clan developed into tribe<eos> Mankind advances from primitive barbarism when individual tribes form a confederation of tribes<eos> It achieves the highest stage of barbarism when it passes from tribal confederation to military democracy
- Monday, after the fair.<eos> Don´t take it badly, but when my fiancée left 10 years ago I felt the same twinge in my heart.<eos> Your fiancée?<eos> It was because of her that I Ieft Paris.<eos> I moved here last month to relive my memories.<eos> Does she live in Rochefort?<eos> No, in Mexico.<eos> But we met here.<eos> It´s a strange story for an ordinary man like me.<eos> My fiancee found my name a bad joke. I think it even shocked her and one day I awoke
Do sit down.<eos> I'm still not tired.<eos> Perhaps you'd pour me some milk?<eos> I didn't have a very good night.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> Your milk.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Milk is the perfect food.<eos> It creates good temper.
Kirk to Enterprise.<eos> Enterprise, come in.<eos> Isn't that how we lost contact with the first landing party?<eos> What about it, Spock?<eos> Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference? I would say not, captain.<eos> There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference.<eos> And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors.<eos> Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.<eos> It could be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan.<eos> Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it?
Captain's log, stardate 4513.3.<eos> After having been taken over by an android, the Enterprise has been under way at warp 7 for four days.<eos> Now, we are entering orbit around a planet which has never been charted.<eos> The following individuals will be transported down to our planet:<eos> Yourself, science officer, medical officer, communications officer, and navigator. Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise.<eos> If you do not come with me, your engines will be destroyed and you will remain in orbit here forever.<eos> I must say, that's a gracious invitation.<eos> There is a word.<eos> Among us, there is no corresponding meaning.<eos> But it seems to mean something to you humans.
I know where all the organs are.<eos> But that's a lot different from actual surgical experience.<eos> So if I don't kill him with the operation, the drug probably will.<eos> What drug, doctor?<eos> My husband's asleep.<eos> What drug?<eos> A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body.<eos> It's only experimental.<eos> It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel V.<eos> It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver.
One of the men in critical condition, the other is dead.<eos> And I...<eos> I am now even more convinced that this is not only an intelligent creature, but the same which decimated the crew of the USS Farragut 11 years ago in another part of the galaxy.<eos> Both Spock and McCoy are doubtful of this, and I sense they also doubt my decision to stay and fight the thing.<eos> Why am I keeping the ship here?<eos> Ensign Garrovick, we've studied your report.<eos> Mr. Spock, will you begin? What was the size of the thing you saw, ensign?<eos> I'd say it measured from 10 to 60 cubic metres, sir.<eos> It varied in size, fluctuated as it moved.<eos> - Composition? - It was like a...
It varied in size, fluctuated as it moved.<eos> - Composition? - It was like a...<eos> A gaseous cloud.<eos> Parts of it, I could see through.<eos> Other parts were more dense. Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud?<eos> - Did I what, sir?<eos> - Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a creature, a living, thinking thing, rather than just a strange cloud of chemical elements?<eos> No, sir. But you didn't come into actual contact with it, did you?<eos> No, sir, I was furthest away from it.<eos> It seemed to come out of nowhere, hovered for a moment, then moved toward my men.
- This?<eos> "A Survey on Cygnian Respiratory Diseases"?<eos> I thought you took Garrovick some food.<eos> What were you doing with this?<eos> Applying psychology.<eos> The creature is slowing.<eos> It's down to warp 2.<eos> Reduce speed.<eos> Approach slowly.<eos> I don't understand. It was outrunning us.
You can add that little price tag to your monster hunt.<eos> - That's enough, Bones.<eos> - It's not enough!<eos> You didn't care, as long as you could hang your trophy on the wall.<eos> Well, it's not on it, captain. It's in it.<eos> Gentlemen, may I suggest we no longer belabour the question of whether or not we should have gone after the creature.<eos> The matter has been rendered academic.<eos> The creature is now after us.<eos> - "Creature," Mr. Spock?<eos> - It turned and attacked, doctor.

Inform them I'm committing this vessel to the destruction of the creature.<eos> We will rendezvous...<eos> Roundtrip time, Mr. Chekov?<eos> 1.7 days, sir.<eos> We will rendezvous with the USS Yorktown in 48 hours.<eos> I assume you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it.<eos> - Precisely. - You don't agree with Mr. Spock?<eos> It's the time factor that bothers me.<eos> Those drugs are perishable. Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn.<eos> If so, it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts,
I removed one from Spock's spinal cord, the other from your sister-in-law's body.<eos> They're both the same.<eos> The boy's far too weak to touch.<eos> Besides, the removal of the tissue wouldn't stop the pain anyhow, as far as I can tell.<eos> Did you operate on Spock in time? No, no, no. I just removed these for examination.<eos> His body's full of these tentacles, entwining and growing all about his nervous system.<eos> My nephew?<eos> The same.<eos> Evidently, when the creature attacks, it leaves a stinger, much like a bee or a wasp, leaving one of these in the victim's body.<eos> And it takes over the victim very rapidly.
I cannot let it spread beyond this colony, even if it means destroying... a million people down there.<eos> Captain's log, stardate 3289.8.<eos> I am faced with the most difficult decision of my life.<eos> Unless we find a way to destroy the creatures without killing their human hosts, my command responsibilities will force me to kill over a million people.<eos> Gentlemen? I regret I see no other choice for you, captain.<eos> We already know this thing has destroyed three civilizations, perhaps more.<eos> Gentlemen, I want it stopped too, but not at the cost of destroying over a million people.<eos> Including myself, doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew.<eos> Understandably upsetting.<eos> But once it spreads past here, there are dozens of colonies beyond, and billions of people.
Request denied.<eos> Captain. I do not make this request lightly.<eos> I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain, but I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness.<eos> Request denied.<eos> There must be another answer.<eos> Something in the sun killed that thing, before the Denevan died.<eos> All right.<eos> All right. You've tried heat... radiation...<eos> What other qualities or properties does the sun have?<eos> It exists physically.

Killers!<eos> Security alert.<eos> Space, the final frontier.<eos> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<eos> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<eos> Captain's log, supplemental entry.<eos> Two drops of cordrazine can save a man's life.<eos> A hundred times that amount has just accidentally been pumped into Dr. McCoy's body, and in a strange wild frenzy, he has fled the ship's Bridge.<eos> All connecting decks have been placed on alert.<eos> We have no way of knowing if the madness is permanent or temporary, or in what direction it will drive McCoy.
I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, captain, radius 100 miles.<eos> I've located our men, all of them.<eos> And I've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock.<eos> Bearing, 201, and that is all.<eos> - One creature in 100 miles?<eos> - Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone.<eos> Far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime.<eos> Then we're dealing with more than one creature despite your tricorder readings.<eos> Or we have a creature with an extremely long life span.<eos> Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels.
Mr. Spock our mission is to protect this colony, to get the pergium moving again.<eos> Maintain a constant reading on the creature.<eos> If we have to, we'll use phasers to cut our own tunnels.<eos> We'll try to surround it.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Spock, but I'm afraid the creature must die.<eos> I see no alternative myself, captain.<eos> It merely seems a pity.<eos> The search team is gathering in the main tunnel.<eos> Good.<eos> So it is wounded, and therefore twice as dangerous.

Is it alive?<eos> May I hold it?<eos> Oh, it's adorable.<eos> What is it?<eos> What is it?<eos> Why, lovely lady, it's a tribble.<eos> A tribble?<eos> Only the sweetest creature known to man.<eos> Excepting, of course, your lovely self.<eos> Oh, it's purring.
A highly cohesive electromagnetic field.<eos> Computer could the described entity assume physical form?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> Precedent:<eos> Mellitus, cloud creature of Alpha Majoris I.<eos> - Fairy tales.<eos> Ghosts and goblins. - No.<eos> I've seen the Mellitus myself.<eos> In its natural state, it's gaseous.<eos> When it's at rest, it's solid.
The computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else, until we order it to stop.<eos> Yes, that should keep that thing busy for a while.<eos> The Argelians will be the first to panic.<eos> Let's get back to the Briefing Room.<eos> I wonder who it is we're not supposed to be afraid of.<eos> Well, sir?<eos> I doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than a group of figures for a while.<eos> There is resistance, captain, but the directive is succeeding.<eos> Bank after bank is turning to the problem.<eos> If you drive it from the computers, it'll go somewhere else.
Father gave me this when I left home, driven out by him.<eos> It was the Sunday after the school festivities, remember, Govert?<eos> I'd known that ending for six months.<eos> Father had warned me.<eos> He disappeared six months ago.<eos> How it happened, no one knows.<eos> Something was wrong with a lock gate one night, on the Scheldt.<eos> They never found Father's body.<eos> When I gave them his description I didn't want to go into too many details.<eos> His sister seemed to know more about it than me but I tore up her statement because it said something about four fillings and two missing teeth and an old break of the lower left leg, that no one knew about
- A scotch whisky.<eos> - Matik... this is Greg.<eos> I'd give a lot to know if he's told the police.<eos> - Leaving us?<eos> - I am, yes.<eos> Here!<eos> Your lighter!<eos> Can I be straight, Galia, without upsetting you,<eos> I'll take you to Wespyr's but in another dress.<eos> It is pretty but not smart enough.
Can you unhook my dress, please?<eos> I'd like to fix my hair.<eos> The bathroom is over there.<eos> Look!<eos> There must be a pair of shoes to go with it.<eos> You're some girl!<eos> You look totally changed.<eos> That gown is my gift to you.<eos> Don't be upset!<eos> It suits you so perfectly.

You're a grown woman.<eos> Well, it would take too long to explain.<eos> Hey, that ring, it's gold!<eos> Look, you've got to trust me.<eos> It doesn't belong to me.<eos> It's my father's.<eos> Well, let me just look at it.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> I just want to look at it, that's all.<eos> It's beautiful.
I thought I won't find you.<eos> Hello, Cotolay.<eos> Why did you come?<eos> I have to tell you something, grandfather's things.<eos> What's wrong with grandpa?<eos> He caught me in the ruins searching for the treasure and became angry, he says that this treasure does not exist!<eos> Yes, Cotolay, it does exist.<eos> Is that right?<eos> You said it!<eos> But this treasure is not hidden in the ruins of nowhere, it is inside ourselves, and that is where we have to look,
Come on, Cotolay, I'm your friend, remember the swamp thing.<eos> Tell me, where did you get it?<eos> I am telling the truth.<eos> Do you want me to believe that the Benedictines have not received a single mark in trade for the land?<eos> I did not pay them with money.<eos> You're lying, Cotolay!<eos> I never lie, lying is not of men, and I am!<eos> I tell you're lying!<eos> The other day, your grandfather and you had a conversation about a treasure,<eos> Tell me, where is it?
I tell you're lying!<eos> The other day, your grandfather and you had a conversation about a treasure,<eos> Tell me, where is it?<eos> Leave it, Herminio, look no further, the treasure is not there.<eos> Perhaps you hold it?<eos> We all hold it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Francisco says that the treasure is within us.<eos> Do not try to mock me or I swear ...!<eos> Where is it?
- What do you mean?<eos> - This hill doesn't exist.<eos> - No, let him.<eos> This hill is over here.<eos> And there is an old wadi through here that cannot be seen from Latrun.<eos> Asher, listen to this:<eos> Since you have taken the village of Beit Jiza my camels can move through here.<eos> There's another way through these hills to Jerusalem.<eos> The Palmach boys have already found this wadi.<eos> It's barely wide enough for a jeep and it ends against the bottom of a cliff.
Yeah, but that's the problem.<eos> That doesn't exist.<eos> The square of a number is always positive.<eos> It's just a way of calculating these numbers.<eos> But how can you, when you know for certain mathematically that it's impossible?<eos> The peculiar thing is that you can actually calculate with these imaginary values.<eos> For example, you can build a bridge using this kind of formula, one that stands firm, even though it was calculated using something that doesn't even exist.<eos> Is there a gap in our reality?<eos> You sound like that Holy Joe of ours.<eos> The chasm between the body, which is made of matter, and that which it embodies, namely, the immortal soul.
Don't I know it!<eos> The film is released tomorrow.<eos> Then?<eos> My work is not good.<eos> Not good?<eos> Wrong.<eos> Too many things went wrong.<eos> As if I haven't seen the film and my opinion doesn't count!<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> - It is worth nothing.
He pretended to be busy with his foot and sat poking between his toes.<eos> I felt totally strange.<eos> Suddenly I heard Katarina say:<eos> "Aren't you going to come over here?"<eos> Then she took his hand and helped him take his jeans and shirt off.<eos> Suddenly he was over her and she helped him in and held his behind.<eos> The other boy just sat on the slope and watched.<eos> I heard Katarina whisper in his ear and laugh.<eos> I had his face right next to me.<eos> It was all red and swollen.
What would people think if we were lax?<eos> Yes, alas.<eos> Already our philosophers are writing:<eos> "If the prison gates were open to one victim.... the mob would force its way into them."<eos> They must be considered right.<eos> Don't worry for Suzanne.<eos> The lawyer will appeal - and the courts decide.<eos> The decision will be theirs...<eos> - You will abide by it?<eos> - Let's hope it is a wise one.
Otsuka's trapped us What's going on?<eos> I'll go over!<eos> He may get this building!<eos> Know the place where Kazuo Sasa's singing?<eos> Get out!<eos> Where'd you take Y oshii?<eos> He left with the money I put up for you<eos> You want my building?<eos> You're smart<eos> It belonged to someone else once

Charlie's our new darling<eos> We know not what he'll do<eos> Want to see something?<eos> Turn them over.<eos> Well, how did you do that?<eos> I can do a lot of card tricks.<eos> One of the men on the Antares showed me.<eos> I don't believe it!<eos> On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving.<eos> If the crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf, I want it to look like turkey.
Beautiful.<eos> No animals, no people, no worries.<eos> Just what the doctor ordered.<eos> Right, doctor?<eos> I couldn't have prescribed better.<eos> We are one weary ship.<eos> Do you think the captain will authorise a shore leave here?<eos> Well, depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties.<eos> You know, you have to see this place to believe it.<eos> It's like something out of Alice in Wonderland.
- We'd better get back to the glade. - Yes, sir.<eos> Look.<eos> Someone beaming down from the bridge. Trying to.<eos> Something's obstructing it.<eos> Mr. Spock.<eos> My orders were no one was to leave the ship.<eos> Necessary, captain.<eos> Unable to contact you by communicator, and the transporter is useless to us now.<eos> As I told you before, there's an unusual power field down here.<eos> It's soaking up all the energy at the source.
Kirk to Enterprise.<eos> Bridge to captain.<eos> Sulu here.<eos> It's definite, Mr. Sulu. The intruder can assume any shape, a crewman, you, myself, anyone.<eos> Understand?<eos> Affirmative, captain.<eos> Go to G.Q. 4.<eos> General Quarters 4, captain.<eos> The creature was trying to survive.<eos> It has that right, doesn't it?
Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and engineering levels, captain.<eos> However, no one or nothing has approached them as yet.<eos> Dr. McCoy?<eos> Yes?<eos> The Medical Department report, doctor.<eos> Well, we could offer it salt without tricks.<eos> There's no reason for it to attack us.<eos> Your attitude is laudable, doctor, but your reasoning is reckless.<eos> The creature is not dangerous when fed.<eos> No, it's simply trying to survive by using its natural ability to take other forms.

Crater, we don't know who or what we're looking for.<eos> We need your help, and now.<eos> I demanded, I even begged that you get off my planet.<eos> Can you recognise this thing when you see it?<eos> Professor I'll forego charges up to this point, but this creature is aboard my ship, and I'll have it, or I'll have your skin or both.<eos> I loved Nancy very much.<eos> Few women like my Nancy.<eos> She lives in my dreams.<eos> She walks and sings in my dreams.<eos> And it becomes Nancy for you.

It doesn't trick me.<eos> It needs love as much as it needs salt.<eos> When it killed Nancy, I almost destroyed it, but it isn't just a beast.<eos> It is intelligent and the last of its kind.
Slowly.<eos> Helm answering, sir.<eos> Power reversing.<eos> We're back to normal time, captain.<eos> Engines ahead.<eos> Warp one.<eos> Warp one, sir.<eos> - Mr. Spock?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The time warp what did it do to us?
Arh, you have some fresh information as to his whereabouts?<eos> I am on the track of some, but I need a free hand.<eos> Ahh!<eos> Don't cry out.<eos> I'm not very expert with these things and it just might go off in your face.<eos> You'll pay for this!<eos> Just keep very still.<eos> Why, great heavens, man, your throat.<eos> What?<eos> It's so swollen.
Old man, are ye truly a Sawbones?<eos> I would prefer you to use the correct term, sir.<eos> I am a doctor.<eos> Well, Doctor, ye had best start using your cleverness.<eos> So talk, before I let Cherub have ye.<eos> Let me show him first, Captain, eh?<eos> Let me give him a taste of Thomas Tickler.<eos> He'd be a credit to your trade, would Cherub, Doctor.<eos> A... touch like an angel's wing he has with that blade.<eos> Sharp as a whistle, it is.
How do you know?<eos> Well this is the planet Dido.<eos> I've been here before, I know them very well.<eos> What? They're very friendly people.<eos> Friendly? Yes!<eos> Oh, it certainly wasn't friendly to us!<eos> Must have kept Barbara, that... that scream!<eos> Barbara! Oh don't for heavens sake start scratching there.<eos> Try and find another way out.<eos> This thing, was it armed?

She'd a headache, but now she's better.<eos> How's your head, Mashenka? - Good, dad.<eos> - Maybe, mom.<eos> - Maybe, you just had breathed of smoke?<eos> The day went smoothly.<eos> But at night, Maria got sick.<eos> Quiet!<eos> Quickly, go to the city for a doctor!<eos> - A letter?<eos> - Here's it.
Time is a very strange thing.<eos> It is said people are here today but not there tomorrow.<eos> I say, you're there tomorrow but not here today.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> This means time.<eos> Tomorrow is there, but today - the present - does not exist.<eos> How can it exist, eh?<eos> How can it exist?<eos> Time is constantly moving.<eos> It does not stay at one place.
Non-existent. Only past and future. Right?<eos> Everybody wants money and wealth.<eos> Everybody wants money and wealth. Isn't that so?<eos> But it has to fall in the right hands.<eos> The hand has to be the right one.<eos> Got it?<eos> If it falls in the wrong hands, it can cause calamity.<eos> And that is what leads to confusion.<eos> Actually, wealth is not important.<eos> What is important is the hand on which it lands.
I wish I knew green. I can remember blue.<eos> The sky's blue, ain't it?<eos> Yeah, sometimes.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Now, you sit here by this tree.<eos> And you stay put, see!<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks again, Ole Pa.<eos> And, Ole Pa, my face?<eos> You're sure it's not too bad?
That's gonna be my favorite word from now on.<eos> I know a better word.<eos> Well, perhaps friend doesn't mean so much to you.<eos> - I suppose you've got lots of them.<eos> Well, what's your word, then?<eos> Or is it a secret?<eos> Tolerance.<eos> Tolerance?<eos> I don't think so much of that.<eos> What's it mean?
- I suppose you've got lots of them.<eos> Well, what's your word, then?<eos> Or is it a secret?<eos> Tolerance.<eos> Tolerance?<eos> I don't think so much of that.<eos> What's it mean?<eos> Well it means...<eos> When I've got a headache, Rose-Ann says, "You'll just have to tolerate it."<eos> It means you don't knock your neighbor because he thinks or looks different.
Would the emperor use words like that?<eos> They always say that officers repeat the emperor's words.<eos> How dare your filthy mouth speak the emperor's name!<eos> - I'm leaving, sir.<eos> - All right.<eos> You bastard!<eos> Good morning.<eos> What's that?<eos> Look at the sun.<eos> It's right above your head.
Do you need money?<eos> You are really very kind.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> My train is leaving in ten minutes.<eos> Now, there comes the television<eos> Due to this remarkable technological advance we are every day and every hour the astonished witnesses of a miracle<eos> Television can refine into perfection and virtually replace ... all the traditional forms of spectacle.<eos> Within a few years it has been installed in every living room<eos> And now it has become part of our daily life<eos> It is in tune with the rhythm of our lives
I'm beginning to think that sea of acid is a defence barrier.<eos> Except against glass submarines, eh, Doctor?<eos> What you mean is that all visitors are unwelcome.<eos> -Yes, it would seem so.<eos> -We must find Susan.<eos> She may have gone to have a look at that building.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> (EXCLAIMING)<eos> Oh, it's enormous!
I used to play here, alone.<eos> I'm glad it happened here.<eos> Are you sorry?<eos> - No!<eos> - Do you want to go home?<eos> No!<eos> Look!<eos> Come and see.<eos> That name used to make me laugh.<eos> It made me think of Laurel and Hardy.
I, in my world, and you... in yours, far from here.<eos> My world will be yours, Elisabeth.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> I don't belong to it anymore.<eos> Elisabeth !<eos> - What is it, Alan?<eos> - I was so frightened.<eos> It seemed as if your heart wasn't beating.<eos> My heart doesn't beat.<eos> It hasn't beaten for ten years.
TIME OF INDIFFERENCE<eos> - Are you asleep?<eos> - No.<eos> I was thinking about the dress.<eos> 18th-century, it would suit you well.
Wait!<eos> What are you going in there for?<eos> I have some sewing to do.<eos> What sewing?<eos> It's a secret.<eos> You know I don't like secrets.<eos> All right, if you insist.<eos> I'm making myself a black chiffon negligee.<eos> I just have to put the lace on the collar.<eos> I want it to be ready for tonight.
Too little and too late.<eos> We've drawn up a temporary property settlement.<eos> You get the piano... the pictures of Beethoven, and the classical records.<eos> She gets the popular records, the bed, and the love seat.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Zelda, remember five years ago... when we exchanged wedding rings... we promised for richer, poorer, better, worse?<eos> Where is your ring?<eos> My ring?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You want to know where it is?

Your exploits will go down in History.<eos> These decorations which H.M. has...<eos> Don't want your medals!<eos> We want to know who's running this country.<eos> Far away, away from the sea there's my village where my bonnie lives...<eos> Why?<eos> - You're incorrigible!<eos> A song, a couple of shots and you triumph!<eos> It's not the first time mankind is trying to overthrow those who shape its fate.<eos> It still keeps trying.
- No harm done.<eos> Anyway,I painted "Welcome Zachanassian" on the other side.<eos> If she shows herself very friendly. We can always turn the sigin around.<eos> Oh, Mayor? - Yes?<eos> - You wanna make a point about Karla's generosity in your speech?<eos> She was generous to a fault.<eos> I'll emphasize that.<eos> Any other suggestions?<eos> Say something about her sense of justice.<eos> It was deep... it was very deep.
- A lot of slaves died?<eos> - Yes, of course, but who cares?<eos> And they don't rebel?<eos> Not with the methods I use on them. It's not advisable.<eos> Yes, prevention is better than cure.<eos> I'll see you soon, Marcus.<eos> When you get back to Rome, perhaps you'll have less aversion for the games in the circus.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Have you ever tasted that stuff?<eos> It's disgusting.
- When is the next sacrifice?<eos> - Three days from today.<eos> The moon will pass before the sun and cause darkness.<eos> - At noon?<eos> - Even so.<eos> There is to be an eclipse.<eos> And Tlotoxl will offer human blood so that the sun will shine again!<eos> - Yes.<eos> - It's a trick.<eos> As High Priest of Knowledge, you know it will shine again!
Well, what does that prove?<eos> That we have a measure of time as long as it lasts.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> That explains the clock face.<eos> We had time taken away from us, and now it's being given back to us... because it's running out.<eos> The column!<eos> But....<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Doctor...<eos> -I thought it only moved when the power was on.
So...<eos> Cardiff Castle will be demolished, allowing the Blaidd Drwg Project to rise up, tall and proud, a monument to Welsh industry.<eos> And, yes, some of you might shiver.<eos> The words "nuclear power station"<eos> and "major population centre" aren't exactly the happiest of bedfellows.<eos> But I give you my personal guarantee that as long as I walk upon this Earth, no harm will come to any of my citizens.<eos> Now drink up, a toast...<eos> To the future!<eos> The future!<eos> And believe me... it will glow.
An obedient little girl who no longer wants to be my friend.<eos> No, I don't want to be your friend!<eos> And I don't want to see you either! Not because my father orders me.<eos> But for my own reasons.<eos> Why? Because you hate people!<eos> Lucy!<eos> On the contrary, I love them. But I can't bear their turpitude.<eos> They ruin everything, they break everything.<eos> Evil is hidden in them.<eos> It makes their actions vile... it infects their thoughts.
No, this is how it starts.<eos> Then one day he meets the girl of the spring.<eos> She's one of those girls that distributes the healing water, she's beautiful, young and ancient, a child and a woman already, authentic and radiant.<eos> There's no doubt that she's his salvation.<eos> You'll be dressed in white and your hair will be long, just the way you wear it.<eos> Turn the headlights off.<eos> And then?<eos> Let's leave.<eos> I don't like this place.<eos> It doesn't feel real.
I'm trying to prove it.<eos> They think I'm working with them, but I'm not, Reggie.<eos> Just believe that.<eos> How can I?<eos> You lied to me just the way Charles did.<eos> After promising you wouldn't.<eos> Oh, I want to believe you, Peter -<eos> I can't call you that anymore, can I?<eos> Take me a while to get used to your new name.<eos> What is it? Hmm?
- Now it turns out all you're interested in is the money.<eos> - That's right. - Oh.<eos> - Well, what would you like me to say?<eos> That a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me... than a quarter of a million dollars?<eos> - I don't suppose so.<eos> - It's a toss-up, I can tell you that. Hmm.<eos> - Hasn't it occurred to you... that I'm having a tough time keeping my hands off you?<eos> - Oh, you should see your face.<eos> - What's the matter with it?<eos> It's lovely. Ohh.
I'm going to see what he's up to.<eos> You stay here.<eos> Be careful, Adam.<eos> He's already killed three men.<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Taxi!<eos> Look out.<eos> All right, where's the letter?<eos> The letter, huh?<eos> It ain't worth nothin'. You know what I mean.
Stop.<eos> Worries over.<eos> Stop.<eos> Be happy."<eos> Sure, more like that.<eos> "Worries over.<eos> Be happy."<eos> My letter?<eos> Throw it away.<eos> It's meaningless now.
I also have to get curtains.<eos> They're working across the street, repairing the roof, and I sleep in the nude.<eos> Well, it's about time they started fixing up... You mean you don't wear anything?<eos> Nothing but a sleeping mask.<eos> That's all right, because the workmen wouldn't recognise you anyway.<eos> You know what I've got?<eos> An electric blanket.<eos> It was a present from somebody with the American Embassy.<eos> That must be nice, an electric blanket on a night like this.<eos> Only it doesn't work.
Snapping first sound...<eos> Long mitral murmurs...<eos> High-pitched pulmonary second sound.<eos> In my opinion, it is a pure mitral stenosis.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We can start?<eos> Close the chest and thank you for the assistance.<eos> I don't feel the carotid pulse.<eos> The heart has stopped functioning!<eos> The heart has no action, it has stopped!
I'm frightened.<eos> That scared me.<eos> It musn't come back again.<eos> Where's the doctor?<eos> Must I die all alone?<eos> Don't be afraid, I'm not going to die.<eos> I'm pulling myself together.<eos> I see.<eos> I've written you a letter, just like I promised.<eos> It's on the floor if you can find it.
Are you really the meanest girl on the face of the earth?<eos> That's what people tell me.<eos> They are wrong, you aren't mean at all.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you go to school arround here? - Yes.<eos> I didn't know they had a college in Caxton.<eos> They don't.<eos> You're going in highschool?<eos> They do grow things fast here, don't they?<eos> I've heard of southern hospitality The question is. It really exists?
The events depicted in this film started with the appearance of a mysterious, strange creature.<eos> It looked like a human with fish scales and huge toad-like eyes.
You've been away for too long.<eos> You seemed to think I was coming too often.<eos> Please, don't start this, Olsen.<eos> - Listen, Olsen.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I'd like to do something to help your paper.<eos> I was given a pearl necklace.<eos> You could pawn it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's locked up in my father's safe.
The chair, it's been sold.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well then, take it. Quit apologizing' and take it.<eos> Thank you, madam.<eos> If there had been some other way to pay off the debts...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I've got two things no one can ever take from me:<eos> This, and my land in Arizona.<eos> Lilith, I don't want to dash any hopes but that ranch is nearly worthless.<eos> Well, it's there, isn't it?
I think it's getting closer.<eos> At 35 degrees centigrade... sound travels at approximately... one...<eos> Great heavens, the tree's on fire.<eos> Look!<eos> We'll beat it out.<eos> No time for that sort of thing.<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> You see?<eos> It's too late now.<eos> The oil in the ombu tree, milord, it has a remarkably low flashpoint.
His excitement made him forget for a moment that the meeting at the museum had been the last.<eos> The Future was better protected than the Past.<eos> After more, painful tries, he eventually caught some waves of the world to come.<eos> He went through a brand new planet,<eos> Paris rebuilt, ten thousand incomprehensible avenues.<eos> Others were waiting for him.<eos> It was a brief encounter.<eos> Obviously, they rejected these scoriae of another time.<eos> He recited his lesson:<eos> because humanity had survived, it could not refuse to its own past the means of its survival.
Look... a white pygmy.<eos> - Well, at least she's got somebody.<eos> - Come on. I... I need a drink.<eos> You're... You're too tall for me.<eos> First a spook, now a midget.<eos> - Two scotch and waters.<eos> - Well, I think I've got that Spatterbox for you.<eos> Did you see one single thing about him that wasn't awful?<eos> Don't you think he had rather an intelligent-looking face?<eos> It looked to me like the inside of a small cantaloupe.
We'll send the car back tomorrow.<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> Have you seen her?<eos> Sir, I assure you we took good care of her.<eos> We treated her like a lady.<eos> What do you think she is?<eos> Just you wait!<eos> They can just wait for their long service medals.<eos> Drink this.<eos> Spanish wine, it's a real pick-me-up.
Did all that for not one penny?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I felt right sorry for her.<eos> She seemed-- - [ Gilmer Chuckling ]<eos> You felt sorry for her?<eos> A white woman?<eos> You felt sorry for her?<eos> To begin with, this case should never have come to trial.<eos> The State has not produced one iota of medical evidence that the crime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place.<eos> It has relied, instead, upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on cross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant.
He's going to tell.<eos> You've got to help me.<eos> We've got to leave.<eos> Please, Blanche.<eos> Help me.<eos> I like this place.<eos> We can just sit here for a while.<eos> And pretty soon the sun will come up and it will be nice.<eos> You should look at the sea.<eos> It has all lights on it.
Please give me stones.<eos> Wait, Francis.<eos> Francis.<eos> It seems to be infectious.<eos> Other people are helping him.<eos> A shoemaker, a field-worker, a tailor.<eos> We could learn from him about putting ideals into practice.<eos> - We take our spiritual heritage too much for granted.<eos> - Surely not you, Canon.<eos> It has to be rebuilt occasionally.
- I did.<eos> - You?<eos> But I left Brother Cattanei in charge.<eos> Brother Cattanei is dead.<eos> He died while you were in the Holy Land.<eos> Sit down, Father Francis.<eos> You're exhausted.<eos> - In your chair, please.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, it is no longer mine.
Dan.<eos> We're in the reception room.<eos> Living room.<eos> The study is in there.<eos> There are two bedrooms on this floor, three upstairs.<eos> The furniture is part antique, part US army.<eos> The piano is showing signs of wear and tear, but it's a genuine Bechstein.<eos> - Quite a view, isn't it, sir? - Yes.<eos> Uh... Senator, I really, really don't need all this.<eos> When the US government does something, it does it right.
Would you read it to the tribunal?<eos> "Death to the race defiler."<eos> - In what newspaper did it appear?<eos> - Julius Streicher's Der Stürmer.<eos> What was it in connection with?<eos> The Feldenstein case.<eos> What was the Feldenstein case?<eos> Your Honour! The defence objects to introduction of the Feldenstein case.<eos> It is a notorious case, perhaps the most notorious of the period.<eos> It has overtones and appeals to emotion that would perhaps be best not raised.
(CHIMING)<eos> (DOG BARKING)<eos> - What is it, Pongo? What is it?<eos> - Shh.<eos> It's the Great Dane.<eos> He has news for us.<eos> He'll meet us at Primrose Hill.<eos> - How'll we get out?<eos> - Uh, the back bedroom window.<eos> It's always open a wee bit.
I'm glad.<eos> Oh, Sir Itamiya...<eos> There was big trouble here just now.<eos> Leave the bodies here and carry the money.<eos> You pretend as if you've been wounded.<eos> You load the guns on the boat.<eos> And put the woman in a casket and load it with them.<eos> Hey, it's incredibly heavy, isn't it?<eos> Don't talk!<eos> The gold is called Daiho True Gold, and it's completely pure.
I could call you, pick you up, have a big unveiling.<eos> Am I wearing this right?<eos> I think so.<eos> Here.<eos> It's not tilted too much?<eos> This is a conservative firm.<eos> I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - The mirror.<eos> It's broken.
He governs.<eos> He's a governor.<eos> What does he govern?<eos> - A government.<eos> - What kind of government?<eos> - A government of Auvergne.<eos> - There's no such thing.<eos> There's a French government and that's it.<eos> I didn't mean that kind of government.<eos> - It's a governors' government. - I know what he means.

June.<eos> You have made an excellent choice.<eos> You will have beauty and revenge at the same time.<eos> Mrs. Talbot, now that Malla has given you the precious gift of youth, I think it only fitting you show your appreciation and give her your beautiful gold necklace.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> The expensive gold necklace you asked me to keep safely for you?<eos> Oh, yes, I remember.<eos> Malla, would you accept this gift from me?<eos> Since vanity has no regard for time, I will wear your necklace.<eos> Garvay knows exactly where it is.
That's for sure, but you missed the most important thing.<eos> I wouldn't want Neil to find you.<eos> So you're coming with me.<eos> I'm putting you on the next plane to New York.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Now, why don't you get out of here and leave me...<eos> This is a most persuasive little instrument, and if you don't want me to use it, you'd better hurry.<eos> You don't mind if I take my purse along, do you?<eos> And I'll need a coat.<eos> It's in the hall closet.
That crooked jeweller must have... must have switched stones?<eos> Well, I guess that... guess that about makes us even.<eos> - Not quite. - Hm?<eos> - I wonder what's happened to Billy.<eos> - That kid? He's probably tailing the dance-hall girls.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam, wait a minute.<eos> Now, look. Here's your ticket.<eos> And... here's a letter to Jenny.<eos> - It's kind of personal.
- Oh, that's a help.<eos> - Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.<eos> - What was it she saw?<eos> - Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.<eos> Mmm. I'm familiar with that kind of terror.<eos> This is something new to me.<eos> But what?<eos> That's the one, sir.<eos> - Chief, the expression.<eos> It's exactly...
Mother always used to say I look like you!<eos> Would you be good enough to stand erect and in a proper manner, please?<eos> And where in the world did you get that dress?<eos> It came in the missionary barrels.<eos> - Missionary barrels?<eos> - Yes. Her father was a minister.<eos> As a matter of fact, he was a missionary in the British West Indies.<eos> Pollyanna, this is going to be your new home... and I hope you'll be very happy with me.<eos> I'm very sorry about the dress, Aunt Polly.<eos> My father said it was a size too big... but that I should be glad it wasn't a pair of boys' trousers.
After all, there is an obligation to having wealth.<eos> Haven't you learned yet that people don't like false charity?<eos> Well, I don't want to talk about it any more.<eos> I don't know how we got off on this subject.<eos> Well, it isn't the way I wanted it.<eos> - Perhaps I should come again another time.<eos> - Yes, perhaps you should.<eos> And maybe you should call first?<eos> Yes, I'll do that.<eos> Pollyanna, look at your new dress. It's filthy!
I should never trust you<eos> And I feel jealous of that girl next door<eos> She sees you morning and evening, and I don't<eos> Do keep the window shut<eos> What else is there to tell?<eos> The more I write, the more you will laugh at my mistakes ut I don't care.<eos> You are the writer, not me<eos> Please take good care of yourself<eos> I am well, but my heart is sick.<eos> IT will heal when you come.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.<eos> I believe in the future of my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> And you can help them.<eos> How?<eos> You're an aristocrat.<eos> Your family's name is honored. You're a prince to your people.<eos> You're rich and powerful. Your reputation is stainless. They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.<eos> Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.<eos> It is worse than stupid, futile!

Together, we make a considerable man.<eos> Old friend.<eos> She always said you would return.<eos> She never gave up hope.<eos> Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.<eos> I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.<eos> But suppose that isn't possible.<eos> If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.<eos> Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.<eos> They could not make me tell them where it is.

Young in Nevers.<eos> Young in Nevers.<eos> And mad in Nevers too.<eos> You see, Nevers is the one city in the world... - the one thing in the world... - I dream of most at night<eos> and at the same time think about the least.<eos> What was this madness of yours in Nevers like?<eos> Madness is like intelligence.<eos> You can't explain it.<eos> just like intelligence.<eos> It comes over you, consumes you, and then you understand.

It's true.<eos> I guess you must understand that too.<eos> Did it ever happen to you again?<eos> It's over.<eos> During the war?<eos> Right after it.<eos> Was that one of the hardships of life in France after the war?<eos> You could say that.<eos> When did this madness of yours pass?<eos> It went away little by little, and then when I had children, of course.

Just a moment!<eos> Can't you read?<eos> !<eos> The police chief is here, right?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - We just saw him.<eos> Let us in.<eos> Please observe this.<eos> What happens from this point on, is what is most relevant to your case.<eos> It seems almost alive.

Strindberg's fight with the evil forces get on my nerves.<eos> It's tearing me apart."<eos> Then he begins thinking of the Gråvik legend spending hours at the lake.<eos> "You get the feeling that there are violent currents deep down.<eos> Tempting undertows that could pull you ahead of your conscience.<eos> Tempt you to take one blissful jump into the horrible."<eos> Like standing at a diver's rock.<eos> "August 8.<eos> Down at the lake. A strange unrest has taken hold of me.<eos> It followed me all the way and got stronger on the way home.
Did you forget what day it is?<eos> It's Tuesday.<eos> Aunt Alicia!<eos> Well, I'd better run.<eos> You cannot go to your Aunt Alicia's looking like that.<eos> Put your coat on.<eos> Let me comb your hair.<eos> Yes, Grandmama.<eos> I hate this coat.<eos> It makes my legs feel so long.
We took the liberty of opening it.<eos> I shall read it to you.<eos> "Dear Madge," it starts, "I miss you very much, but it is almost worth it.<eos> "The book is coming along marvelously.<eos> "I hope to finish it by tonight, but whether I do or not, "I can't stand being away from you any longer, "so I'm going to start back first thing in the morning.<eos> "In fact, I may reach you before this letter does.<eos> "Longing to see you, darling.<eos> Your own Paul. "<eos> It's from a little place across the French border.<eos> If only it could have arrived sooner.
"You're going to have to kill me, "because if you don't, I'm going to kill you. "<eos> Those were her exact words.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> Poor Candy.<eos> I can't forget the way she looked at me.<eos> It was so abnormal.<eos> I hope it's nothing permanent.<eos> Of course, she's only a child. These two things coming together.<eos> She was beginning to accept the first.<eos> If only there'd been a letter, it would have helped.
Hello, Candy.<eos> I thought it was the inspector.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's on his way.<eos> I sent for him as soon as I found the letter.<eos> Letter?<eos> Yes, Candy, from your mummy.<eos> At last I can show you how wrong you've been about me all this time.<eos> It explains everything.<eos> Where is it?

No, I don't think so.<eos> Well, then you'll be able to tell her all about it at breakfast.<eos> In the sitting room.<eos> Come in, Candy.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Where's the letter?<eos> Right here.<eos> Sit on the settee, I'll read it to you.<eos> I found it behind the cushions.<eos> It must have slipped down.
There's also the possibility that it might be a type of throwback toward the prehistoric and unknown.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I guess I frightened it as much as it frightened me.<eos> But its claw was so strangely hot.<eos> I beg your pardon, but you must be...<eos> - A strange animal has escaped.<eos> - Like something you've never seen?<eos> Like something no one has seen before.<eos> It broke out of its cage and grabbed me by the arm.

Hello, "almost-a-doctor."<eos> This creature, tell me about it.<eos> Well, first it was this high.<eos> Then this high.<eos> Now it is tall, nearly as tall as a man.<eos> Is that the normal rate of growth?<eos> No, not as far as I know.<eos> The only data we have is in Dr. Sharman's notes.<eos> - Where's the animal now?<eos> - It fled into the woods.

Signor commissario, please wait.<eos> That is my position.<eos> The safety of the people in this district is my affair my primary affair.<eos> It may be, you can have me replaced.<eos> That, of course, is your privilege.<eos> Until then, I intend to function as commissario.<eos> You are an efficient man, signore.<eos> A man of sincerity.<eos> There will be no thought of replacing you.<eos> Then I must say that at daybreak, I intend to use all means at my disposal to destroy that creature before it kills someone.
We're taking over a load of sulphur to feed our prisoner when we capture him.<eos> If the commissario doesn't catch it first.<eos> Doc, this is like a parachute.<eos> It's got to work the first time.<eos> Right.<eos> All right, men.<eos> Load up. Let's go.<eos> Let's use the back road.<eos> There's a waterfall.<eos> We've spotted the animal, it's by those sulphur beds.

"The rocket, with its complement of 17 men... "...had landed on the planet Venus."<eos> - Venus?<eos> - The planet Venus?<eos> "...had landed on the planet Venus and was on the return to Earth when the ship... "...plunged into the sea."<eos> There was one survivor:<eos> Colonel Calder, seated beside me.<eos> Commander of the expedition.<eos> Some of you may have heard the story of a monster now confined in Rome's zoo.<eos> That beast is from Venus.<eos> It is an essential object of scientific study if man is to survive the atmosphere on Venus, poisonous to humans.
- There, Colonel.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And, General, we need some firepower, quick!<eos> All right.<eos> As soon as I do, I'll get there.<eos> Stay with the beast but get reports back to me if you can.<eos> Right, sir.<eos> The creature?<eos> On the rampage!<eos> If it isn't stopped, it'll kill hundreds, maybe thousands!

You can go home and sleep some more.<eos> - Oh, that was quick!<eos> - Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Let me introduce the girls to you.<eos> From your left, Osome, Otetsu, Oyoshi and Oume... And may we offer...<eos> Enough formality!<eos> Let's go to the banquet room.<eos> Sophistication isn't our thing at all.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Time is money and it's ticking away!
I'll go with you.<eos> Don't go so far away.<eos> Have a happy life here with me.<eos> Oh, happiness is what I dread.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Besides, going back and forth between here and America sounds too much.<eos> Stop joking around!<eos> Grifter, dear, I promise myself to you in this letter.<eos> Me too!<eos> I wrote it myself, it's genuine.
Yes.<eos> Dealer takes three.<eos> The Inspector thinks the world of Charlie.<eos> You can see that.<eos> Why not?<eos> He's a brilliant man.<eos> Yes.<eos> Your bet, Bill.<eos> As I was saying, we always have been very friendly with the Popes... but I must confess I was truly surprised... when we got the mailed invitation to their home for their anniversary dinner.<eos> -I'm sure it will be wonderful.
It was Hindenburg!<eos> That does it !<eos> This isn't the proper way to lead an investigation.<eos> He's making everything up!<eos> You should catch him in his own trap.<eos> He's quite stubborn in public.<eos> I'll talk to him alone, later. When we'll make a plaster cast of his head at the museum.<eos> The perfect occasion to grill him again.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Unless this case is rock solid, it won't be of no use to me.
- Thank you.<eos> - Well, come in.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> So you really are Dr. Holden?<eos> All scientists don't wear thick glasses.<eos> I apologize for bothering you on the plane.<eos> What was all that writing about anyway?<eos> Letters to my pupils about my trip to America.<eos> I'm a kindergarten teacher.<eos> I'm sorry it ended so tragically for you.
We'll meet tomorrow evening. Bring it to me and I'll deliver it to him<eos> - Really?<eos> - Afriend can do a favour can't he?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here you are.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - The letter.<eos> But this is written...<eos> Did you already have it?<eos> Yes, but it's exactly like the one you wrote.
I wouldn't have believed you thought of such things.<eos> - I said nothing!<eos> - You thought it all the same!<eos> Me at 12 years old.<eos> Already?<eos> Time passes quickly with you.<eos> Really?<eos> She grew right before our eyes.<eos> You've got to keep an eye on her!<eos> My first ball gown. It's always the same one.
Oh, won't you come in.<eos> We have need of eggs.<eos> It would pleasure me, sir, for sure.<eos> Did you hear that, Ena?<eos> Sounds authentic.<eos> May I present Great Grandmother Cratcher, just come from Virginny to take the pilgrimage.<eos> Of course, these people aren't born yet, but they don't know it.<eos> Now I know why my grandfather fell in love with her.<eos> It's that dress.<eos> It's so quaint and charming.
I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Five days pay for you. 1,200 yen.<eos> Please don't become too haggard.<eos> You are for sale.<eos> You owe me 1,500 yen.<eos> Remember?<eos> I'm flat broke.<eos> Then I'll take this ring.<eos> It cost me 1,000 yen. I made 500 yen. Thanks.
Good night.<eos> Burt, please don't come back any more.<eos> Well...<eos> - I mean it!<eos> Find a girl your own age.<eos> There must be plenty, it's a big city<eos> Listen...<eos> You're just lonesome.<eos> All right, I'm lonesome too.<eos> But we can't have loneliness push us together, it won't keep us together.
Goodbye.<eos> Milly?<eos> Milly?<eos> Course you did right.<eos> You can't play tick-tack-toe with your feelings.<eos> An earthquake for the nervous system<eos> That's the problem of a sheltered life - you react like a schoolgirl.<eos> Then you make a fool of yourself and at my age that is not very becoming.<eos> You've got your whole future ahead of you.<eos> The only trouble with a future is it comes so much sooner than it used to.
'Help me! '<eos> Where you been?<eos> I've been waiting all day and half the night.<eos> I was walking.<eos> A fine time to be walking.<eos> It came.<eos> A letter from Burt.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Milly, what's wrong?<eos> It isn't from Burt, it's from the sanitarium.
I did make it up.<eos> - There, of course.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Do you know what name I was born with? Smith.<eos> Smith, for the love of Mike.<eos> Smith.<eos> Now, what kind of a name is that for a fellow like me?<eos> I need a name with the whole sky in it and the power of a man.<eos> Starbuck.<eos> - Now, there's a name and it's mine.
Hold it.<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Do what I tell you, and be quick about it.<eos> Now, McKeever, that's what I call love talk.<eos> - Mark, where's the stuff?<eos> - In Mr. Snell's office.<eos> - Where's Snell?<eos> - Down in the auditorium... at the meeting.<eos> It must be due to start any minute.
Gentlemen, take hold or I promise you I will replace you all!<eos> With all your titles and decorations and batons!<eos> I'll go and pick the first soldiers I find who are not drunk and put them in your place!<eos> I warn you, gentlemen, I cannot sit here much longer, watching my army decay.<eos> Close the windows, someone!<eos> Already the wild geese are flying south.<eos> What if we are trapped here through winter?<eos> Time and patience, patience and time.<eos> The grand army's wounded, but is it mortally wounded?<eos> An apple should not be plucked while it's green.
We're not going to think about that.<eos> You're right, Laura.<eos> I just... get all excited and I just burn with shame.<eos> In 52 years, Laura... it was the only time I really lost my head.<eos> Makes you wonder sometimes how far you might let yourself go.<eos> Hello.<eos> Yes, this is Mr. Crabtree.<eos> Yes, I answered the advertisement.<eos> I have been considering your letter of application, Mr. Crabtree.<eos> I must say I found it to be an excellent one.
Not yet.<eos> Why?<eos> No reason, but...<eos> I should think you'd be afraid to stay alone... so much of the night the way you do.<eos> Both of those other women's husbands were on night shifts, too.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> You're a big help.<eos> I'll come by and see you later, keep you company.<eos> Window doesn't help much, does it?<eos> It doesn't help these eggs, that's for sure.
With the diary found, hope returned to our hearts.<eos> Without this good fortune our diary would have missed the end of the story.<eos> We walked through the mazes of the Carboniferous and our final journey was ahead.<eos> We were entering the Silurian Period.<eos> The Silurian. Nothing but rock and stone. As if the whole world was petrified.<eos> Not a leaf of grass, nor a bush, bug, nothing.<eos> Nothing could live in this world.<eos> The sea!<eos> We saw it for the first time.<eos> It was wide, infinite.
We won't accept this decision!<eos> You will be punished if you disobey.<eos> We remain faithful to our Order.<eos> We defy the Provincial Government!<eos> The Temple has thousands of peasants in its domain we won't let them die of hunger!<eos> Your arguments are just. But the decision remains.<eos> This decision was taken by the retired Emperor.<eos> But, in reality it is from here that Japan is governed.<eos> We ask the Emperor Tobu to dismiss this decree!<eos> It is of little value to you, Prime Minister.
Why don't you sell them, make a lot of money?<eos> Never thought of it.<eos> I guess I'll just have to think about it.<eos> And that song.<eos> You sing it so beautifully.<eos> You wrote it yourself?<eos> What do you want to borrow?<eos> I think people need encouragement sometimes, don't you, Mr Marlowe?<eos> - How'd you know my name?<eos> - It's on the pictures, isn't it?
G, a' s<eos> Heres a morsel or you?<eos> Eh. There.<eos> Go on, get him.<eos> Get him!<eos> Well, good bye.<eos> Good bye.<eos> Condemned, to all those years of loneliness, now trembling in the apprehension of seeing another human.<eos> How mad men are possessed by fear.<eos> I even scattered my 10 cattle so it won't betray my presence.
All dead, you mean!<eos> Don't sign with him, mates.<eos> You can't buy off the monster with double wages and a bonus.<eos> You'll never get back to Frisco to collect your pay.<eos> I got a man here that sailed on the Golden Arrow and lived to tell about it.<eos> Come on, Billy.<eos> Tell 'em what you saw.<eos> It was the monster, all right.<eos> A cable's length long from beak to tail.<eos> And it came a-bellerin' out of the night, with one big eye like a lighthouse.
I know you were deeply touched by Ned's gesture, but you are ashamed to admit it.<eos> You cannot tolerate a faith in humanity, because if you do, all this, the structure of your very existence, which you built on hate and vengeance, all this will collapse around the naked lie of your life.<eos> You are a beaten man, at war with the dictates of his heart.<eos> And you are a very gullible man, Professor.<eos> Gullible?<eos> Yes, you're too easily swayed by sentiment... individual good deeds over bad, the crude extremes.<eos> The world is more complex than that, and good must not be measured on a scale as small as Mr Land's brash heroics.<eos> What he would do one day, he would gladly undo the next.<eos> To be of benefit, goodness must be constant, forever building.<eos> It must have strength.
-I've been following you ever since.<eos> -Why?<eos> I was hoping sooner or later I might catch you at something... -...and be able to--<eos> -Blackmail me?<eos> Influence you.<eos> After a couple of weeks, I got to know your routine...<eos> -...and that made it a lot easier.<eos> -Rather dour work. To begin with, yes.<eos> But you know how it is.<eos> You take up a hobby. And the more you get to know it, the more fascinating it becomes.
You'll see the suitcase here.<eos> It contains clothes of mine for the cleaners.<eos> Open it and tip the clothes out onto the floor.<eos> Then fill it with a cigarette box and some of these cups.<eos> Close the lid, but don't snap the locks.<eos> Then leave the suitcase there, just as it is now.<eos> As if I'd left in a hurry.<eos> That's the idea.<eos> Now, the window....<eos> If it's locked, unlock it and leave it open.
Drive fast, turn left at the gates.<eos> Your accomplices haven't a chance.<eos> They'll be intercepted within half an hour.<eos> Half an hour?<eos> Then you've time for a glass of sherry.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Or perhaps a glass of milk?<eos> The milkman seems to have left rather a lot today.<eos> Do sit down.<eos> My abode is simple, but it is at your service.
But I don't understand why you've come here, inspector?<eos> Like a lot of young these women who get into various kinds of trouble, she used more than one name.<eos> But her original name, her real name was Eva Smith.<eos> - Eva Smith?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Do you remember her, mister Berling?<eos> - No.<eos> But I seem to remember having heard that name somewhere.<eos> Eva Smith.<eos> But it doesn't convey anything to me.
I was too frightened, I was too hungry.<eos> I was willing to do anything!<eos> Shall we take a taxi?<eos> Oh... If you don't mind, let's walk.<eos> Let's walk then.<eos> A little more or less won't matter...<eos> It's here.<eos> - Is someone there?<eos> - Don't be silly, it's the radio.<eos> It's company for Tarzan.
I wanted to see you.<eos> You've had a lot to talk about for two years.<eos> Thanks. I've got one too.<eos> I know some details that weren't included.<eos> You seem like a boy full of life.<eos> - Thanks, Doc.<eos> - You should remain so.<eos> I'm not asking for more.<eos> So how did you get involved in the Van Zelten affair?<eos> Because it's mine.
Well, I want these women to know that you're married to me.<eos> I'm tired of pretending to be déclassé, when I am not.<eos> - You know it's better for the act to... that's nonsense.<eos> You are well enough established now, and the act is good enough to stand on its own.<eos> You don't have to dangle yourself in front of these women.<eos> From now on, I am telling everybody that we are married.<eos> Look, I am wearing it, and I'm going to go on wearing it... my nice, big, fat golden band.<eos> And you will wear yours.<eos> It has been a secret long enough.<eos> You thought I didn't know where it was.
She's enchanting.<eos> But this one, the creativeness is his.<eos> He has a talent for improvisation that I've never seen before.<eos> It's close to genius.<eos> You've hit on a new career, Berthalet, that'll outstrip anything you could've done as a dancer.<eos> But you must know this, or you wouldn't have given up your dancing for it.<eos> I didn't give up anything.<eos> I became a puppeteer because it was the only way I could earn enough to feed myself.<eos> You see, a dancer grows conscious of his body.<eos> When it'll no longer do what he wants it to do, he grows to hate it.
– Sadko!<eos> – My precious one!<eos> My darling.<eos> Where's Sadko?<eos> Sadko's no more.<eos> Why no more?<eos> Here I am!<eos> – Have you found happiness?<eos> – I have!<eos> Where is it?
It may sound heartless to say so, but I rather wish he had died fiirst.<eos> If Kyoko marries, he'll be left all alone.<eos> I guess so.<eos> We could have looked after Mother in Tokyo.<eos> Kyoko, did Mother still have her gray summer sash?<eos> I'd like it for a keepsake.<eos> Is that all right with you?<eos> And that linen kimono she used to wear in summer?<eos> I want that too.<eos> You know where it is?
The only agricultural exploitation of this town, which we will call San Jeronimito... located on the coast of the state of Guerrero, are coconut trees.<eos> Oil is extracted from the white coconut pith... which is then used by several industries.<eos> The occupants of these humble dwellings are almost all wealthy... owners of several hundred palm trees.<eos> The people of the coast maintain, with their exaggerated charm... that a coconut tree yields as much as a milk cow.<eos> There is no church in the village.<eos> Thus, the inhabitants preserve... their tradition of celebrating weddings with a trip... to a heavenly island situated one mile off the coast.<eos> Spending the night on this deserted island... consecrates the newlywed's union... who must then be forgiven by the bride's mother before embarking on the trip.<eos> Let's see the daily arrival of the vehicle... that brings news from the world to this isolated corner.<eos> Careful, don't touch that garment.<eos> It has to be white.
I'll wake you up.<eos> - Let's go to Petatlan together.<eos> - Stay and take care of mother.<eos> What if something happens?<eos> Nothing will happen, I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> - Oliverio.<eos> - What?<eos> Take my mirror.<eos> Don't break it, it's bad luck.<eos> - It's safe here.
I'm very good at fixing up rooms.<eos> I've never been able to afford much rent, so I've had to do the best with what I had.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's a nice room.<eos> I like it.<eos> I like big closets.<eos> Easier to keep things in order.<eos> This is nice, too.<eos> This coat... it's an army coat.<eos> It was my husband's.
You'd better lock yourself inside.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> He can't have gone far.<eos> You've got to find him, you've got to!<eos> All right, but how about you?<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> Just find him.<eos> Mrs. Gordon?<eos> I'm sorry to be so long in getting my coat.<eos> It was in your bedroom closet with a sheet over it.
You repaired my coat.<eos> - Just tell me what you need.<eos> - Well, you see...<eos> This coat is still in good condition.<eos> There's a tear, but it's a small job.<eos> And then it needs some invisible mending.<eos> It was an accident. You know, women...<eos> There was a woman and...<eos> - There's nothing to mend here.<eos> - I know, it's in good condition.
My coat!<eos> Stop, thief!<eos> Help!<eos> Police!<eos> Police!<eos> Help!<eos> Stop, thief!<eos> - My coat was stolen!<eos> - Really?<eos> It was new, with a fur trim.
Same again.<eos> This fortunate and ceremonious day underlines a decision that will bring our city<eos> new and unexpected prosperity.<eos> But there are other reasons for our happiness.<eos> Material values are worth much less than the immortal values of art and of the people!<eos> Ever since the day when Professor Filippi published his eminent passage, everyone in the world has looked to our dear city.<eos> And its aims, that I... as speaker for this city,<eos> express to you in this moment, as its humble speaker.<eos> We want to revive, we want beauty, we want to give back...<eos> Who could class such an enterprise as unproductive, when it has the support of all citizens?
And God save you.<eos> We ride to Ashby. Which crossroad do we take?<eos> The right will take you to Ashby.<eos> - Shall we get there by nightfall?<eos> - By nightfall tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> Can you show us the way to a roof for the night?<eos> I know of a roof nearby, but perhaps you would scorn it.<eos> Why?<eos> Is it humble?

So am I.<eos> I started this business recently.<eos> Because you hit it, I met my old corporal.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I'm really glad.<eos> How's business?<eos> Looks good.<eos> It's so-so.<eos> But... I think it'll slow down before long
- Over there. Aren't you?<eos> Don't bother.<eos> The house is closed<eos> Very funny<eos> I'm not joking<eos> I'll go with you if you like, but I assure you it's closed<eos> There are sailors outside<eos> You, upstairs!<eos> You see?<eos> It's closed.
- It's not worth it<eos> The men shouting are English.<eos> They're used to fights<eos> In their country, it's like fencing<eos> Look<eos> - It's Tourneveau<eos> - Of course, it's Saturday<eos> My dear friend, I have some sad news<eos> - We've just been to the house<eos> - It's closed, I know
Or, aren't we allowed to know?<eos> There have been no further decodings.<eos> And now, there will be no further messages to decode.<eos> You must shut down your transmitter.<eos> Shut it down, you're not serious.<eos> I've got to clamp the lid on this business.<eos> Stop these communications.<eos> Well, I suppose that lies within your power,<eos> Mr. President, you can declare a national emergency.<eos> I don't have to declare it. It's here.
What has happened?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Emiliano, I want to know.<eos> - What?<eos> What is happening?<eos> - Are the hens beginning to crow?<eos> Every night I have the same thought.<eos> My heart says to me:<eos> "Now for the first time, you have your husband alone sometimes without fighting, running, hiding. "<eos> But it also says soon you will be dead, and I have never known you in peace.
Long the Tsar sat lonely, brooding.<eos> But he, too, was only human.<eos> Tears for one sad year he shed...<eos> And another woman wed.<eos> She (if one be strictly truthful) Was a born Tsaritsa youthful<eos> Slim, tall, fair to look upon, Clever, witty and so on<eos> But she was in equal measure Stubborn, haughty, wilful, jealous.<eos> In her dowry rich and vast Was a little looking-glass.<eos> It had this unique distinction:<eos> It could speak with perfect diction.
What do you mean, alone? He's with us.<eos> Oh, of course, Antoine.<eos> He's our very, very good friend.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - And we'll share and share alike.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Stanley, open the skylight so we can get some of that good sea air.<eos> You know what?<eos> You need glasses. It's already open.
But it's tightness that does not come from the lack of comfidence<eos> Its the presure of the last waiting Here in a place where the walls are so close A man can barely moves his body around<eos> If only the fight was on Then everything else will not be so bad Not really bad at all<eos> Bobby James is the man he's going to be fighting in one hour<eos> Walter has never seen him before But when the fight is over They will know a lot about each other<eos> Bobby has been on the ring with many of the top middlewieghts And has never been counted out<eos> That's something to think about At a time like this<eos> It's almost as if the brothers were going into the ring together<eos> Time is a strange thing<eos> When you have a little of it And you want it to last It scatters away in all directions and you never know where it's gone 24 years are a long time
Not for Boot anyhow.<eos> As of now, I'm not working with the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin.<eos> - Neither are you.<eos> We quit.<eos> - Both of us?<eos> - Hope it's all right with you.<eos> - Sure, Chuck.<eos> There isn't anything you could do wrong as far as I'm concerned.<eos> But I don't get it.<eos> Quit in the middle of a story right when it's snowballing like this?
four o'clock of a fine spring morning... and all's well!<eos> four o'clock of a fine spring morning... and all's...<eos> Kate has broken off with me.<eos> She's left for our house in the county.<eos> If she could understand you better, she wouldn't be afraid.<eos> If only you could tell her about the future.<eos> Tell me, Peter, I want to see ahead as you do.<eos> I dream about it so.<eos> It's better to dream than really know.<eos> If I had known the past as it actually is-
Rain of spring Is this of the tears?<eos> Rain of petals World of regrets<eos> Hello Mrs..<eos> Thank you for inviting us to this magnificent concert.<eos> I am delighted you came.<eos> Thank you for the other day.<eos> The whole pleasure was for me.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You saw my act.<eos> It must have looked bizarre to you, no?
?<eos> Even though I had wanted... to erase the picture of this sister, it was impossible.<eos> There is not any doubt...<eos> I am here instead of her.<eos> It is not true.<eos> I came to like you... and I like all of you.<eos> Think about the beautiful child who unites us.<eos> I would have liked so much... that you belonged to me entirely.<eos> If you like, Oyu's kimono... help me put it on.<eos> As it is heavy... it is too heavy for me.
Pasteur?<eos> He came from everywhere.<eos> Again.<eos> I came for refuge in your place, Mrs. Tiberghen? Do you mind?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Father, it's seven o'clock and dinner is served. Thank you, my daughter.<eos> You're welcome, father.<eos> It's at night That it gets awful.<eos> I don't come home anymore until the last possible minute.<eos> And it's the radio that saves us, because it keeps us from talking.
I would accept. -<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'll go hear you on that day.<eos> Aubanel getting an assassin convicted.<eos> Unless at the last minute, losing my head, or making a mistake, I come to his defense.<eos> You love assassins and thieves so much as that?<eos> Less than the public.<eos> If newspapers didn't report the crimes that were committed the day before, they'd lose at least half their readers.<eos> And yet killing is vile.<eos> Yes, but it keeps so many people alive.
Yes.<eos> Oh, hiya.<eos> Yeah, where's the little woman?<eos> - Well, where you from, Blanche? - Why, I...<eos> I live in Auriol. In Auriol. Auriol, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> That's not my territory.<eos> Man, liquor goes fast in the hot weather.<eos> - You want a shot?<eos> - No, I rarely touch it. Well, there's some people that rarely touch it, but it touches them often.
You gorgeous exciting woman, you!<eos> I pass.<eos> Aw, isn't he cute?<eos> Darling, why don't you sit down here.<eos> Oh, yes, you sit down, too, baby. Well, you sit down on my lap.<eos> You'll be more comfortable there.<eos> All right.<eos> You sit there, darling.<eos> This chair is more comfortable.<eos> Oh, but if it's so comfortable, I want you to have it.
I'll knock you out!<eos> Will you calm down?<eos> I hate scenes.<eos> Of course.<eos> Police?<eos> The Poets' Cafe.<eos> There's a brawl.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Your cafe amuses me.<eos> It thinks it's the center of the universe.
Yes, Bruno, that's right, you'll be footman tonight.<eos> Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.<eos> Well, well, hop in, my dear.<eos> We can't waste time.<eos> - But, uh...<eos> - No, don't try to thank me.<eos> Oh, I wasn't...<eos> I mean, I do, but...<eos> - But, don't you think my dress...<eos> - Yes, it's lovely, dear, Love...
What's the matter?<eos> You afraid I'll shoot too low?<eos> That concludes the performance for this evening.<eos> We thank you very much for your very kind attention.<eos> The show's going on out on the midway.<eos> We suggest you have fun and spend your money.<eos> Here's the money, and here's the ring.<eos> - Take good care of it, won't you?<eos> - No, no, I....<eos> I don't think it would fit me.
I'm sorry about tonight.<eos> It'll never happen again.<eos> I shouldn't have hit Mel, shouldn't have picked up the telephone....<eos> Cigarette?<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> I put it in my jewel box.<eos> You should never take it off your finger.<eos> Put it on.<eos> Not now.<eos> - Where is it?
-We can't be sure that Henry got that far.<eos> -No. We'll inquire of other tribes, of course, but we've got to go to the Kaluana.<eos> It is the only place we know Curtis was trying to reach.<eos> -How long will it take?<eos> -Weeks.<eos> Months, perhaps.<eos> I don't know. I've never taken a woman on safari with me before.<eos> Have I been a handicap?<eos> Why, no, Mrs. Curtis, but the fun hasn't started yet.<eos> When it does, I'm sure we'll all enjoy it.
A film set?<eos> One doesn't know anymore.<eos> On a street.<eos> We're in Vienna.<eos> It's 1900.<eos> Let's change our costume.<eos> 1900.<eos> We're in the past.<eos> I adore the past.<eos> It's so much more peaceful than the present... and so much more certain than the future.
After all, this is an important matter.<eos> It is not the prestige of a particular department that is involved... but men's lives.<eos> If the Reeve's gun is accepted, sooner or later men will have to fight with it.<eos> If we've been too optimistic, they'll be the sufferers. We shan't.<eos> Well, well, Mr. Chairman. No one wants to hide anything.<eos> If Colonel Holland would like Mr. Rice's views, I have no objection at all.<eos> Well, Mr. Rice?<eos> I agree with Professor Mair that the idea is excellent.<eos> And the weapon?<eos> I don't think it's right yet.
- Lieutenant, the newspapermen are here.<eos> - Okay. I'm comin'.<eos> - Getting any fingerprints, Nick?<eos> - Nothing good so far.<eos> Fragmentary print smudges.<eos> That's all.<eos> Looks to me like a heavy case.<eos> A heavy case.<eos> An investigation for murder is now underway.<eos> It will advance methodically, by trial and error... by asking a thousand questions to get one answer... by brain work and legwork.
Thanks.<eos> Anything else for me to do?<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> Get the phone calls, Maggie, and order me a company car For this afternoon.<eos> MAGGIE (INTERCOM): Yes, sir.<eos> Good bye, Mac.<eos> Good bye, friend.<eos> Is anybody home?<eos> Hello? Anybody home?<eos> You want beer, it's in the icebox.
Once on the ground, we open our eyes and look around.<eos> Blow our noses, too.<eos> Believe it or not, I knew a fellow... who could smell gold like a jackass can smell water.<eos> What's all that about?<eos> We're going into country very wild and dangerous.<eos> Have to cut through jungles... and climb mountains so high they rise above the clouds.<eos> Tigers so strong they can climb trees with burros in their mouths. Good.<eos> Glad to hear such tall tales 'cause it means few outsiders have set foot there.<eos> Well, let's get going.<eos> If there was gold in them mountains, how long would it have been there?
Remember what you said back in Tampico... about having to pack that old man on our backs?<eos> That was when I took him for an ordinary human being... not part goat.<eos> Look at him climb, will you?<eos> What gets me is how he can go all day in the sun without any water.<eos> Maybe he's part camel, too.<eos> If I'd known what prospecting meant... I'd have stayed in Tampico and waited for another job to turn up.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - Look.<eos> Look at it glitter.<eos> It's yellow, too, like...
It's not that rich. Here ain't the place to dig.<eos> It comes from someplace further up.<eos> Up there. Up there's where we've got to go.<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - That's it, all right.<eos> Gold, I mean.<eos> Sure don't look like I thought it would.<eos> - Not much different from sand.<eos> - Yeah. It's just like plain sand.<eos> It don't glitter. I thought it would.
- What about it, Waldron?<eos> - What about what?<eos> She's lying.<eos> - What about leaving town?<eos> - I wanted to leave town.<eos> - A little sudden, wasn't it? - No.<eos> I wasn't working.<eos> I offered to get him a job with me in the café.<eos> I didn't get out of the army to start pearl diving in a crummy café.<eos> Crummy? Ask him how crummy it was!
I'll go see what your uncle Mark wants.<eos> You'll be all right?<eos> In this room it isn't so bad...<eos> When the door's closed and I know that no one's looking at me.<eos> I don't like eyes looking at me.<eos> That's when I get frightened.<eos> Then- I can't explain.<eos> It's as if everything went dark.<eos> As if something were closing in on me, a dark cloud.<eos> And I want to run and run and run, but it keeps following me.
Take me<eos> All that I ask is this<eos> Give me love for love<eos> Nothing more<eos> Nothing less<eos> Don't promise me the moon<eos> Leave the stars<eos> Where they are<eos> Give me just your heart<eos> Say it's mine
The storm clouds have passed us.<eos> Over Jersey now.<eos> Statistics tell us we'll see the stars again.<eos> Golly, the misery that walks around in this pretty, quiet night.<eos> June.<eos> The logic you're looking for. And the logic is that there is no logic.<eos> The horror and terror you feel my dear, comes from being alive.<eos> Die and there is no trouble.<eos> Live and you struggle.<eos> At your age, I think it's beautiful to struggle for the human possibilities. Not to say I hate the sun because it don't light my cigarette.
You are twenty-three, June.<eos> Believe in love and its possibilities the way I do at fifty-three.<eos> What's wrong here?<eos> This man bothering you?<eos> He's the only man in four years in New York who hasn't.<eos> No place to park.<eos> Let's face it, Val.<eos> After all, you and I are partners in a $42,000 investment.<eos> That's why I called you, Val.<eos> You own a 20 percent piece of my show. But if it doesn't open Tuesday, you own a piece of dirt.
- Yes, Pa?<eos> You water the stock and look to Whiteface. She's freshening.<eos> Yes, Pa.<eos> Tibby, is Obadiah Brown likely to come mooning around again tonight?<eos> Oh, Pa, I'm sure I have no notion of his plans.<eos> Well, if he does turn up, be sure and sit on the steps... where your ma can keep an eye on you.<eos> Although I must say that Ob is a steady lad... and you, praise be, are not the flighty kind.<eos> - Thank you, Pa.<eos> - Now about this letter.<eos> I'd see no reason to discuss it if it wasn't that your Ma acts like it was important.
Why doesn't he like your father?<eos> Because Papa doesn't like him either.<eos> Why not?<eos> Papa never says why not.<eos> Oh, here they come!<eos> What brings you to our kermis, Dr. Turner?<eos> Are you expecting an epidemic of minor injuries?<eos> You never can tell, Mr. Van Ryn.<eos> This chair came from Holland with the first patron.<eos> It represents, among other things... over 200 years of extreme discomfort.
What are you doing here at this time of night?<eos> - The patron and I are discussing flowers.<eos> - Flowers?<eos> While we're on the subject, I suppose you've thanked him for the lovely plant in your room?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> Is it as pretty as the plant in your late wife's bedroom the night she died?<eos> Aren't you letting the discussion become rather morbid, Dr. Turner?<eos> I was never able to forget that plant.<eos> At first I thought it was beautiful.

- You smoke too much. I've noticed.<eos> Only frustrated people smoke too much and only lonely people are frustrated.<eos> - Well, aren't you cute? - Cute?<eos> Me?<eos> Awfully cute.<eos> I think I'm gonna like you.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - Nothing personal, I hope.<eos> No, I was just tossing away my frustration.<eos> And it landed right on me.
You'll believe anything...<eos> I don't need any investigation...<eos> She's a wonderful girl, such sweetness!<eos> She prefers a pebble to gemstones...<eos> So?<eos> - You let her choose?<eos> - No, but I gave her a ring and it was stolen.<eos> Beyond that, your suspicions are foolish.<eos> They're not just suspicions, I can even tell you where your ring is.<eos> It's in the hands of a man named Victor Ménard...or Loiselle...or Martignac...
- Except I'm married.<eos> - Oh, I'm so happy. - Unhappily. - What?<eos> - Married.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Oh, it's all right.<eos> All the more reason we should meet again.<eos> - I see. Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy that they have to be carried by three.<eos> - Do you speak from experience? Or from observation?<eos> - Observation.<eos> It has saved me from the experience.
She needs all the sleep she can get.<eos> No right to be out on a day like that.<eos> They must have been having trouble with the sail Long before it happened.<eos> I put in a call to the coast guard.<eos> Did you see which one of them was handling the boat?<eos> How could i?<eos> I couldn't tell them apart anyways.<eos> Talk low.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> When you got to them, were you able to see the body of the other one, Or was it under the boat?
- Exactly.<eos> Look at the wood-louses.<eos> - I hope they do not fall into the well.<eos> - They probably will.<eos> - There is an earthworm.<eos> - It might also fall into the well.<eos> But you will see much worse sights.<eos> - Let us close the well again.<eos> - Yes. Let us look at the cover itself.<eos> - It is a little worn.
Jambalaya- that mama wished for in paris and couldn't get? Oh, i want some. Oh, heavy stuff, you'll ruin your breakfast at begue's.<eos> You know i have the appetite of a dock worker. Quick cupid, tell the man a heaping plate for madame la comtesse.<eos> For who? You heard!<eos> For madame la comtesse. Who else, stupid?<eos> Hey, you. A dish of this stuff for madame la comtesse.<eos> For whom?<eos> For madame la comtesse.<eos> Who else? But certainly.<eos> Certainement.<eos> Is it as good as they've told me in france?
Same straight back, same long legs, same nose.<eos> I suppose you've got the same sanctimonious disposition.<eos> Well, are you sanctimonious?<eos> I don't know what the word means.<eos> Let's hope you never will.<eos> Come here.<eos> Listen to me, listen carefully.<eos> This is a bachelor establishment.<eos> Do you know what that word means?<eos> Yes, it means that you're not married.
- Mommy.<eos> - Yes, darling.<eos> - Did you ever make a wish?<eos> - Lots of times.<eos> - Did your wishes ever come true?<eos> - Sometimes.<eos> I made a wish today, and it came true, just like Edward said it would.<eos> - Where did you get this ring?<eos> - That's what I wished on.<eos> - Edward says it's a wishing ring, and it is.
No, I don't know them, but I've heard about them.<eos> - Are they nice?<eos> - I really don't know.<eos> But I do know that you must return the ring.<eos> Get Edward to take you there and give it back to the old lady.<eos> Well, the mother or daughter, whichever one gave it you.<eos> But ask Edward to go with you.<eos> I'll take it back.<eos> I got my wish anyway.<eos> You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
She creeps into the room.<eos> - She lives here.<eos> - Who is she?<eos> That woman is an impostor.<eos> She's a liar and a cheat.<eos> - How do you like your tea?<eos> - Sometimes I get a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.<eos> Good.<eos> It's almost as if there were a curse on us.<eos> I wouldn't care if it were on me, but it seems to be directed against Amy.
There's a present you haven't opened yet.<eos> That's from her.<eos> That woman.<eos> Well, let's see what we have here.<eos> In my time, I've had a great many presents.<eos> Christmas and otherwise.<eos> The king of Spain gave me that ring.<eos> Oh, a ring.<eos> A beautiful ring.<eos> See how it shines.
I'm not going to have it all dug up again for nothing.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> You had no right to go through that file.<eos> - Budge had no right to let you get at it.<eos> - Sorry, General.<eos> - Mr. Cameron is your assistant... - Then it's his job to assist me... not go digging into 10-year-old cases on wild suspicions of his own.<eos> - Now then, Budge, you get along.<eos> - Very good, General.<eos> What's your interest in this case, anyway?<eos> It was rather a famous case... and it impressed me very much at the time.
You can't open his desk.<eos> No. You have no right to.<eos> Whoever you are, you have no right to!<eos> He'll know. He'll think that I...<eos> What should I say to him?<eos> You won't have to say anything.<eos> Perhaps it's a good thing I came tonight.<eos> I was right.<eos> There was a letter.<eos> - And it was from Sergis Bauer. - What was that?
Papa!<eos> What's going on around here, anyway?<eos> - It's about 25 miles.<eos> - I'm going to die before we get there.<eos> There's nothing to be nervous about.<eos> There's a justice of the peace.<eos> - You got the uniform?<eos> - It's in the back.<eos> - And the ring?<eos> - It's in the uniform.
I wonder how soon we can get cleaners and painters in?<eos> You'll go back to London, of course, while I stay here.<eos> What, rolled up in a blanket like a squaw?<eos> At the inn, idiot, until you ship me the furniture.<eos> Did the old boy tell you why it was locked?<eos> I never thought to ask him.<eos> Well, now we know.<eos> It's the one ugly room in the house.<eos> Oh, it's not so bad.<eos> But that window, it's like a cucumber frame.
What?<eos> It was like a mist... a crawling mist.<eos> You imagined it, just because you heard the house was haunted.<eos> I heard nothing of the sort, Mr. Roderick.<eos> Holy saints, are you tellin' me it is?<eos> For heavens sake, Rick, what is it?<eos> Oh, Lizzie's dreamed up a ghost for herself.<eos> Come along, Lizzie.<eos> Oh, darling Lizzie.<eos> I had just come upstairs to turn down the beds, And there it stood by the studio door, looking down at me.
Nobody understands.<eos> You don't know what it means to be tormented this way.<eos> - Tormented?<eos> Why?<eos> - I couldn't rest.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body.<eos> Broken, mangled.<eos> I saw it day and night.<eos> It was waiting everywhere I turned.
But... Why, it must be someone's initials.<eos> Well, I've been rooked.<eos> The jeweller rooked me. - Oh, it doesn't matter.<eos> Really.<eos> - Give it back.<eos> I'll have it taken off.<eos> No, No.<eos> I like it this way.<eos> Someone else was probably happy with this ring.<eos> Oh, it's perfect the way it is.
That's the sidereal time, specially perfected for you aboard our gondolas.<eos> What is Man's biggest grief?<eos> Is it Death?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's old age!<eos> Gods were immortal but what good would have immortality been to them if they didn't have eternal youth as well.<eos> Never to grow old is our common dream... a dream that you'll be able to live at last when you travel with us!<eos> So, go, go and travel through time.<eos> Here, time is ruining you.<eos> Up there, it keeps you fit!
Nevertheless, we will proceed with our operations according to plan.<eos> I cannot impress upon you too strongly the importance of tonight's task.<eos> Our success depends upon the precision with which each man carries out his assignment.<eos> What we have done up to now is only the beginning of our campaign.<eos> We have laid the groundwork for their disruption and disintegration.<eos> But now we must destroy their confidence.<eos> And we can only accomplish this by an action as daring and as bold as the one planned for tonight.<eos> We must not fail.<eos> Now, the vessel will sail at 4:27.<eos> It will proceed from the Brooklyn Navy Yard at a speed of four knots to a point in the Narrows opposite Fort Hamilton.
I'll wait.<eos> I'm way behind in my loafing anyway.<eos> Do so many men pass through here that you can afford to ice me?<eos> or maybe you're saving yourself up for old fuzzy-face down on the pier.<eos> That's better.<eos> He looks as though he'd been waiting a long time for something.<eos> He's waiting for my fiancé.<eos> Fiancé?<eos> Well, competition. I like that.<eos> It makes me look better.
Poor devils.<eos> You're right, Ugarte.<eos> I am a little more impressed with you.<eos> - Hello, Rick.<eos> - Hello, Ferrari.<eos> How's business at the Blue Parrot?<eos> - Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.<eos> - It's not for sale.<eos> - You haven't heard my offer.<eos> - It's not for sale at any price.
I'm taking the car to give it a wash and polish.<eos> - All right.<eos> Thank you, Parry.<eos> Uncle, dear, I'm so sorry to be late.<eos> - Hello, Charlotte.<eos> - You'd better be sorry.<eos> - I couldn't help it.<eos> I've been shopping.<eos> - I don't like that dress.<eos> It's short.
That's what we're trying to do, Craig, isn't it?<eos> You and I.<eos> What?<eos> Start another fire.<eos> That's what we want of each other, isn't it?<eos> That's all we want.<eos> I'd like to think of it as something more. Something in itself.<eos> - Permanent.<eos> - Oh, don't use that word, Craig.<eos> It frightens me.
Goodbye, my love.<eos> Here is the ox.<eos> - And here is the donkey.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You've already hung up Saint Nicolas's ring?<eos> Only to get a sense of the general effect.<eos> A wonderful evening star humble nativity scene.<eos> - We'll put it away later on.<eos> - That would be wise.<eos> It's worth at least 300,000 francs.
- Have the police arrived?<eos> - No...<eos> From the north, they went south to reach the east<eos> Now they are in the west.<eos> In search of a passable road.<eos> But in one leap, they are closer by 3 km.<eos> Gentlemen, you may leave.<eos> Who put the ring in my sign?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But it is in my sign!
- Demonstrator's model.<eos> I've been trying to make up my mind for years whether to buy this car or not.<eos> My man will be along shortly.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> I had that seat built below window level.<eos> Makes me safe from bullets.<eos> How ingenious.<eos> - Take my seat.<eos> It's more comfortable.
Now, now, Wilmer.<eos> We can't have any of that.<eos> You shouldn't attach such importance to these things.<eos> Tell him to lay off me then.<eos> Now, Wilmer...<eos> Your plan is, not at all satisfactory, sir.<eos> Let's not say anything more about it.<eos> All right.<eos> I've got another suggestion.<eos> Maybe not as good as the first, but it's better than nothing.
Gold Dragon King has asked me to drink with him tonight<eos> Then you should go.<eos> That's right.<eos> You should prepare the golden eyed beast for grandpa.<eos> I will.<eos> You should drink a little less tonight.<eos> Otherwise I won't be able to wake you up.<eos> It's terrible, grandpa's golden eyed beast has disappeared!<eos> Are you all deaf and blind?<eos> How could it just disappear?
No. No privacy.<eos> - Wouldn't go in the river if you can't swim.<eos> - Oh. Why didn't I stay in the gutter where I was well-off?<eos> That's right!<eos> Would I go under the ground?<eos> No, there's no future in it!<eos> - Miss Frenchy, honey, you know that blue dress?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, you can't wear it no more. It's got beer on it.<eos> - All right, you can have it, if it fits you. - It does.
Wait a minute, now.<eos> Nobody drink.<eos> I always make it a point to drink to somethin'.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Now, let me think.<eos> Don't think too hard, Robert.<eos> You might hurt yourself.<eos> - Oh... - Why, Pa!<eos> Let's see now, uh...<eos> Here's to our house, through sunshine or showers, be it ever so humble, by golly, it's ours.
In the casino reigns a god called Luck.<eos> In the palace reigns a prince... well-guarded by a little army, as charming as can be.<eos> You see the little army about 11 a.m.<eos> It leaves the palace... for the changing of the guard.<eos> I like to imagine how much more amusing... this scene would be... if the Monegasque soldiers... strictly in rhythm... having marched a few steps forward... suddenly took exactly the same number of steps backwards.<eos> To reach the palace, all the roads go up.<eos> To the casino, they go down.<eos> To be more precise, they lead you there.<eos> The casino!<eos> It looks like a sugar-cane masterpiece... like a station selling tickets to unknown destinations only.

You get yourself a lot of nice things, and stand by for a two-minute notice.<eos> - Oh, my darling.<eos> - Oh, sweetie.<eos> I shouldn't have left you out in that car so long. My poor little Linda with her little runny nose.<eos> You'll catch my cold.<eos> Who, me?<eos> I never caught a cold in my life.<eos> Why, you've got a cold, V.S., and on such a nice morning, it must be maddening.<eos> Perfectly all right.<eos> It's worth a million dollars.
Dr. Hans Frank, Reichs Minister of Justice and later Governor General of occupied Poland<eos> As the Leader of the German legal service...<eos> I can say that, clearly, the basis of the National Socialist State... is the Nationalist Socialist Law Code.<eos> And for us our highest leader is also the highest judge. !<eos> We know how sacred the principles of these laws are to our Führer.<eos> These Reich laws can assure you, National Comrades... that your life and existence is safe in this National Socialist State of Order, Freedom and Law.<eos> Dr. Josef Goebbels, Reich Minister of People Enlightenment and Propaganda, Gauleiter of Berlin... and later General Plenipotentiary for Total War<eos> May the bright flame of our enthusiasm never be extinguished.<eos> It alone gives light and warmth... to the creative art of modern political propaganda.<eos> This comes from the depths of the People... and from these depths of the people... it must always again find its roots and its strength.
May I drink to this delightful household?<eos> I believe that is one of your customs, is it not?<eos> It is, Your Highness, and for myself and my guests, I thank you.<eos> Oh, no, allow me.<eos> Your Highness.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To this household, to life, and to all brave illusion.<eos> Yes, wait a minute.<eos> Ah, I think I shall enjoy your wine.<eos> It goes pleasantly in my veins.
- "Stunt"?<eos> - Yes, landing on the lawn in an autogyro.<eos> Oh. Oh, yes.<eos> Yes, I heard.<eos> Yes, personally, I think it's silly too.<eos> You look lovely, child.<eos> Are you pleased with the gown?<eos> - Ellie? - Hmm?<eos> Oh, the gown.<eos> Yes, it's nice, isn't it?
You needn't worry about Fanny and Joe.<eos> He won't be able to come back.<eos> He's...<eos> Dead.<eos> Oh, your ladyship.<eos> Oh, milady.<eos> Why are we here in Geneva?<eos> To bear witness to the truth that if the world war is to be crowned by peace, the world must disarm.<eos> All efforts to appoint this paramount...<eos> You talk of disarmament, but where is it?
Now, be a good girl, run along and get your hat and keep what I told you under it.<eos> All righty.<eos> Is there a baritone in the house?<eos> CROWD: No!<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> There isn't a baritone in the house.<eos> Oh, yes, there is.<eos> I'm a baritone.<eos> There it is.<eos> You search for happiness, and all the time it's right behind the bar.
My analysis of this soul, the human psyche... leads me to believe that man is not truly one... but truly two.<eos> One of him strives for the nobilities of life.<eos> This we call his good self.<eos> The other seeks an expression of impulses... that bind him to some dim animal relation with the earth.<eos> This, we may call the bad.<eos> These two carry out an eternal struggle in the nature of man... yet they are chained together.<eos> And that chain spells repression to the evil.<eos> Remorse to the good.<eos> Now, if these two selves could be separated from each other... how much freer the good in us would be.<eos> What heights it might scale.
But there's one thing about him.<eos> He certainly notices things.<eos> Don't you notice anything?<eos> Yes, you're chewing gum again.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Well, now...<eos> I got a new dress on.<eos> Oh, so you have.<eos> It's the one you wanted me to get.<eos> It is, isn't it?
Don't you notice anything?<eos> Yes, you're chewing gum again.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Well, now...<eos> I got a new dress on.<eos> Oh, so you have.<eos> It's the one you wanted me to get.<eos> It is, isn't it?<eos> Suits you very well too.<eos> Let me know how much it cost and I'll give you a check for it.
Not quite.<eos> I go.<eos> Over to the regimetnal battle HQ.<eos> Children, let's go down to the dug-outs.<eos> - What's wrong, August?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Corporal Richter.<eos> - Yes?<eos> What's happening with the message?<eos> It's still not ready.
