What did he look like?<eos> He was Arab-Iookin', like one of the hijackers.<eos> - Like one of the 9/ 11 hijackers?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We've come full circle.<eos> Has the witness identified the type of vehicle driven?<eos> Sir, I cannot go into any details specific to what the witness did or did not see.<eos> Did he see the vehicle?<eos> When I have more information, I will release it.
He was always trying to toss it.<eos> When I came home, I found it on the floor.<eos> I thought he'd put it there.<eos> I found it in the hall closet, in the garage.<eos> I even found it in the car once.<eos> It was like a game for us.<eos> Look, I came to you.<eos> You guys have been giving me the runaround for over a week.<eos> Could you tell us what you kept in this box?<eos> We inherited a coin collection, and we figured... we'd save it for a rainy day.
You act as if they have some moral code.<eos> They have no conscience, only their precious logic.<eos> They'll do anything to drive us off this planet.<eos> TARAH: We should never have agreed to negotiate.<eos> You're not happy with the way I've handled this situation?<eos> TARAH: Of course I am, sir.<eos> SOLDIER: The Sector Two report, sir.<eos> Put all our positions on alert.<eos> I want Soval and the pinkskin brought to me alive.<eos> If they're looking for an excuse to attack, we won't give it to them.
They reached a settlement with Casseon.<eos> It was from the Post.<eos> They have a source.<eos> You can work with C.J. 's office to run down the source, I guess.<eos> You're saying I can do this?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hang on. How's it going so far?<eos> - Good, thanks.<eos> If I had a few questions for Leo McGarry do I go straight to his office or do I run it by you?
I don't know them well enough to write their name down, but I don't know.<eos> I mean, the feast was so great today, and then coming here, it's, like, it sucks.<eos> Here's how the individual immunity works in terms of assigning it to someone.<eos> It's a little unusual tonight.<eos> Lill and Burton, as a result of resurrecting themselves back into this game, were given immunity simply to give them a chance to reintegrate back into this game.<eos> Burton then goes and wins individual immunity today.<eos> That immunity is assignable, meaning you can give it to somebody else here tonight and protect them.<eos> Typically, that would make you, yourself, vulnerable.<eos> Tonight, you won't be.<eos> You have nothing to lose by giving it to somebody.
But first, a little background on the mad world of the tweeker.<eos> Methedrine was first distilled by a Japanese scientist before WWII.<eos> Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a good thing when they saw it.<eos> This guy is so tweeked he thinks he can survive this without a scratch.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> By some estimates, 2%of the Japanese had a meth problem after the war.<eos> Factory workers, soldiers, pilots.<eos> That's why it took two bombs to get them to surrender.<eos> A nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweeker.<eos> In the '50s, the housewives got ahold of it.
(# City Of Prague Orchestra:<eos> Robinson Crusoe)<eos> (Shaun) I was stranded on a desert island with no shelter nor companionship.<eos> Every day I kept watch for rescue but no-one came.<eos> My only distraction was to write lyrics for my forthcoming album.<eos> But then I thought why the fuck should I?<eos> Very good. Very good.<eos> So, Nathan...<eos> the tape, the music, where is it?<eos> Shaun's kidnapped it.
No.<eos> Good night, David.<eos> Good night, Vi.<eos> You look familiar.<eos> Oh, I have a newspaper column.<eos> (Matt) The Sun, right?<eos> The Trib, wrong.<eos> (Matt) Right.<eos> (Kryla) This cake is very good.<eos> The wife bakes it herself.
-You're bad.<eos> -We gotta do something.<eos> -Stay here or jump for that rope.<eos> Either way, we die.<eos> I guess we're going for the rope.<eos> Get out of there!<eos> Pretty good, 1 1 37.<eos> But not good enough.<eos> Drop it!<eos> I said, drop it!
- I assume you have guns in the house.<eos> - Indeed I do. Bad guys, take notice.<eos> So you have them for protection? - Yeah, sure.<eos> - Have you ever been a victim of crime?<eos> No.<eos> - Never been assaulted or...? - No. No violence toward you, but you have guns in the house.<eos> - Loaded.<eos> - They're loaded?<eos> Well... if you really need a weapon for self-defense, you need it loaded.<eos> - OK, but why do you need it for self-defense?
That's true, Your Honor.<eos> But it was badly placed.<eos> So it's all the fault of whoever put it there.<eos> Perhaps... it could partly be seen like that, Your Honor.<eos> Counsel, this is the third time we've heard this case.<eos> What is the compensation being demanded?<eos> - 8, 000 pesetas, Your Honor.<eos> - 8, 000 pesetas.<eos> 8, 000.<eos> How can I pay it?

Sergio, where's my beer?<eos> -So you haven't seen her.<eos> -Who?<eos> -Rosana.<eos> -No. Why all the interest in her?<eos> -I don't know...<eos> -You don't think that she and Jose...<eos> Jose?<eos> Well, I don't know. I doubt it.<eos> -I opened it myself, Daddy.
- Yeah, you might need a little extra there.<eos> - We do have a community outreach program, and the money we could pay you wouldn't even fold,<eos> - but it would be a couple of days a week.<eos> - Are you asking me to be a counsellor?<eos> We have a guidance counsellor, but the kids could use someone...<eos> - closer to their age who still...<eos> - l'm in.<eos> What, you're serious?<eos> You did hear the part about the money, right?<eos> Yeah, I heard. My schedule might be a little fun-tastic, but I'll work it out.
In return, he would be given dominion over all humanity.<eos> Hades tricked my mother into opening the gates of Olympus to the Titans.<eos> There was a battle of which the muses still sing.<eos> The gods fought back and eventually prevailed.<eos> As punishment for his treachery, Zeus cast Hades into the Pit of Tartarus where he would rule over the dead for all eternity.<eos> And for her unwitting role in Hades' plot my mother was charged with guarding the gateway to the underworld.<eos> To ensure the gate could never be unlocked, its only key was broken and scattered across the globe.<eos> Mother told me she kept one of the pieces in the temple as a daily reminder of her eternal shame.<eos> Then these relics we've been gathering are parts of the key?<eos> But why would Faust want it?
Well, what are the steaks for?<eos> They're for today's training.<eos> We're gonna teach the dogs to cook?<eos> You're gonna teach the dogs self-control.<eos> Now, it's of primary importance that your dog's attention at all times remains focused on you, even when tempted with those things that, as a dog, they love.<eos> Like raw fucking meat.<eos> Or cats or other dogs, anything.<eos> So, the two of you head on over there.<eos> This is fucking unbelievable.<eos> You know, I haven't seen a steak in six years, and now you're gonna put it on the floor, so a dog won't eat it?
Scent pads?<eos> Canine voodoo.<eos> A dog's sense of smell is about 40 times more acute than a human's.<eos> A dog's nose is packed with dense rolls of membranes that absorb odor.<eos> Stretched out, these membranes extend about a third the length of a dog's body.<eos> The membranes of the human nose about the size of a postage stamp.<eos> - Looks like a giant Dustbuster.<eos> - Similar.<eos> You place absorbent pads into the chamber then run the machine over the suspected item.<eos> Then you take the pad seal it in an envelope and freeze it.
Paris appointed herself as director.<eos> - Nice. What part are you playing?<eos> - Don't know yet.<eos> She's still mulling over the screen tests.<eos> We'll find out tomorrow.<eos> - Screen tests?<eos> - Twenty-four takes.<eos> - I so want a copy.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> Sell it on the Internet.
He says there's a legion of roman soldiers coming through.<eos> All this movement, back towards Rome.<eos> I guess this new emperor's really serious about waging peace, huh?<eos> Well, thanks to you.<eos> Eve's the one who set him on the road to peace.<eos> Let's try the next place.<eos> Well, whoever it was, I'm just glad there's an end to the fighting.<eos> Amazons... Hundreds...<eos> No amazon tribe is that big.<eos> Well, I saw it.
Can you believe that?<eos> Popcorn. There's popcorn in this pan. This camp just gets better and better every minute.<eos> JEFF V.: I don't know about this chicken pop feed, whatever. I just...<eos> ALICIA: Do you love it?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That just, we-- forget it. We are now addicted.<eos> It's so good.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> ALICIA: And we now have, like, chicken popcorn.<eos> We wake up in the morning, we make it.

They eat salad.<eos> In America?<eos> No, here.<eos> Here?<eos> Salad with oil?<eos> Yes, with oil. And a bit of garlic, and salt.<eos> And with bread?<eos> Sure, with bread.<eos> As a child, I've always eaten that.<eos> Ah, you have eaten it?
Just read it.<eos> Step aside.<eos> Step aside.<eos> Zhang Mingxian, let him read!<eos> Read it!<eos> "I feel very sad.<eos> "Two days ago, Zhang Huike...." Hey, she wrote about me, too.<eos> "Zhang Huike was causing trouble and knocked over a desk.<eos> "A box of chalk fell on the floor.<eos> "Teacher Wei told him to pick it up, but Zhang Huike wouldn't listen!
Hi, daddy.<eos> Are you busy?<eos> - Yes, very busy.<eos> What is this?<eos> - A book ...<eos> Has he found at the flea market.<eos> I am at the flea market.<eos> This is the house where I ...<eos> I have a new recipe for cake.<eos> JYou will do just the yolks. It is true the protein and makes it later.
Good night!<eos> You're right. I'm sorry.<eos> Good night.<eos> Hello.<eos> Just want to return a spoon.<eos> - Debra?<eos> - Robert.<eos> - Problem?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I was just returning this spoon. And I didn't know where your mother kept it, so I was just looking around.
Go.<eos> Why?<eos> Do I need a reason in my own restaurant?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I don't like your face, that's why.<eos> Just go.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> Why did I do what?<eos> The flowers. Why did you move it like that?
Answer me!<eos> You think there's any chance?<eos> We keep digging till we find her!<eos> Any luck?<eos> They won't help.<eos> What? They warned me not to dig here.<eos> Look, if she's not down too far, we can find her.<eos> Oh, we will.<eos> Look, we need some rope and something like a shovel.<eos> If they won't give it to us, we'll take it.
-Okay.<eos> -What's that note?<eos> -C. -C?<eos> No, that's not a C, sweetie.<eos> Does it have a line running through it?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Well then, how can that be a C?<eos> -F-A-C-E, 'face' are the ones in the spaces.<eos> -Right.<eos> And E-G-B-D, dear, are the ones with the line running through it.
Take him over there.<eos> All right?<eos> It's really nice of you to walk me down here personally.<eos> -Excuse me?<eos> -Do you like my rock?<eos> Have you seen Xena?<eos> She... She's tall.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> She... piercing blue eyes... Swings a mean right hook.<eos> It looks like she might have swung it already.
Nobody calls me Lampshade.<eos> You give me the gun.<eos> Nice shot.<eos> Hey... I can see right through him.<eos> What's all this?<eos> You liar.<eos> Stop!<eos> Let's settle this.<eos> Tokens for the ride of your life.<eos> You have all earned it.
I heard you get up.<eos> Do you want to be alone?<eos> I couldn't sleep either.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Nothin' good.<eos> Your folks' place is 530 miles from here.<eos> We can make it in a day if we drive straight through.<eos> We should take my truck.<eos> It's got four-wheel drive.<eos> You never know if we're gonna need it or not.
Look, you lied, you trespassed, and you endangered yourselves.<eos> You are in it a lot deeper than you were in that septic tank.<eos> George, I am very sorry.<eos> Yeah, but believe me, the punishment will fit the crime.<eos> But bear in mind, their behavior was wrong, but their spirit is right.<eos> They're two good guys.<eos> Pulling for you.<eos> Oh, uh, Mr. Feeny?<eos> Your key.<eos> Thought you might need it when you sell the place.
But no fingerprints, no serial numbers on the piece.<eos> - Could it be the same shooter?<eos> - Could be.<eos> We're checking our hot list for military vets.<eos> This guy knows his way around hardware.<eos> Detective.<eos> What are those?<eos> These seeds were found at the crime scenes.<eos> Police lab said they come from this pod that hangs from a rare plant called a scarlet posidium.<eos> The murderer left it as his calling card?
# So I take a deep breath This time I get my way<eos> # Say, please, don't make me say it twice<eos> # 'Cause I'll get you as mad as hell Let's try to be nice<eos> # Be nice<eos> # Be nice<eos> # 'Cause I'm a good-ass mother-liker<eos> # Get home to my bitch She been waiting all alone<eos> # I put water in a bowl And I give her a bone<eos> # Neighbours come calling Holding out a cup<eos> # So I get out the sugar And I fill it right up
I may not be a doctor, but I'm giving Mom a grandchild.<eos> Yeah, just what she wants. She'll be thrilled.<eos> An OB is gonna do an ultrasound. Then you'll shop for baby stuff.<eos> Shop till I drop.<eos> Cool.<eos> - I shouldn't eat ice cream.<eos> - You should've taken insulin today.<eos> - And yesterday and the day before.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> You took it, Sam, didn't you?
What did I say?<eos> That thing about honesty being something of something...<eos> It was pro-honesty.<eos> Being the cornerstone of a good relationship?<eos> Right. That really stuck in my mind.<eos> - I haven't been honest with you.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> When we get married, I want us to have a clean slate, sweetheart.<eos> I hope you can forgive me for this, but a few months ago, I had a slip.<eos> It was two slips, but they were simultaneous, so I'm counting it as one.
I called his parole officer. He hadn't seen Tarbush in weeks.<eos> But I asked for a description, exact match to the kidnapper.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> Bobby Bigmouth.<eos> Now, what in the blazes is a Bobby Bigmouth?<eos> Bobby.<eos> If it ain't the two lovebirds.<eos> - Did you tell him?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I got it from his ticket broker.
I was very young when I got married.<eos> And I was very drunk.<eos> So where's the cool guy who is ready to leave home and bag some babes?<eos> Right here.<eos> Please, you can't even bag your own wife.<eos> I can bag her, but it doesn't do me any good, I remember what she looks like.<eos> Marcie, fruit.<eos> Peggy, this basket is a gift for Bud.<eos> It's very thoughtful.<eos> But I'm sure he wouldn't want it if I touched it.
Bring it down.<eos> Ramana?<eos> Ramana?<eos> Koreto, have you seen Ramana?<eos> Look what I brought her.<eos> You know where she is.<eos> When the morning star<eos> Is two hands above the horizon in midsummer, that's due west.<eos> They knew the currents far out at sea?<eos> They'd strip, jump into the water and feel it with their
- Half the list?<eos> This half?<eos> - That's right.<eos> That half.<eos> - But that piece.<eos> - The eighth piece.<eos> That she held back.<eos> I didn't know that existed till a couple of months ago.<eos> When she died.<eos> I got it from her sister.
Only 25 hours left.<eos> One P.P. Is going public.<eos> We're notifying hospital ERs and OB departments now.<eos> Press conference in half an hour, get Annika's face on the morning news.<eos> Why are we going public when Lester looks like our perp?<eos> Department isn't prepared to call him a suspect yet. They've got a better theory?<eos> Annika was abducted by somebody desperate for a baby.<eos> We considered that.<eos> We thought it was a stranger kidnap before we knew Lester had a $1 million motive to get rid of his baby.<eos> The minute you get me proof he's guilty, I'll take it to the brass. (Benson) Who's gonna cry for the cameras?
I know guys who know guys.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Now be straight with me, and I'll let you go.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Do you have the globe?<eos> - I sold it. I had to.<eos> - Sold it to who?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Some guys.<eos> I took some pictures of it, passed it around, you know.
Psycho Dad's on.<eos> Yeah, and my wife and kids are just figments of Stephen King's imagination.<eos> No, really.<eos> It's on the news.<eos> He's holding a press conference.<eos> He is? He is.<eos> I knew he wouldn't take this lying down.<eos> - Hey, I bet he got my letter.<eos> - You wrote Psycho Dad a letter?<eos> Not actually a letter, but I cut out some letters from the newspaper and taped it in, you know.
It's a bit of a mess.<eos> My husband built this house.<eos> He's an engineer.<eos> As you can see, we're still living out of boxes. But,... but at least the kitchen's done.<eos> We only just moved in a few weeks ago.<eos> Very empty.<eos> Very beautiful.<eos> Yes.<eos> My husband loves like this.<eos> He could have this way, he would keep it like this all the time.
What about the insult?<eos> OK.<eos> You're a fat, bearded git.<eos> Take the lot.<eos> Rimmer, what is wrong with you?<eos> Relax.<eos> You said yourself, no one can hurt us.<eos> Besides, you're forgetting... (AMERICAN ACCENT) I'm Dangerous Dan McGrew, barefist fighter extraordinaire.<eos> Lola, all my valuables are in this box.<eos> You can have it for a bottle of mind-rotter.
These hearings are now reconvened.<eos> - Without going into details,<eos> - No problem, no problem.<eos> I would like to make a comment on the... unfortunate incident that we all just witnessed.<eos> Now, this body...<eos> Well, indeed our whole... system of government is imperfect.<eos> It's imperfect because it depends on people.<eos> Human beings who make mistakes, act in haste, misinterpret things...<eos> Yeah, and do things like buy 10,000 copies of your autobiography.<eos> Which by the way is not a crime, unless you make people read it.
Oh, my goodness.<eos> Someone has switched our luggage and given us many erotic forms of punishment.<eos> But rather than hold these good people up, we'll be glad to pay the duty.<eos> Do you have anything to declare?<eos> Yes.<eos> My husband is an idiot.<eos> - Come on, kids.<eos> - Mom, what happened to Dad?<eos> He got caught stealing a hotel towel.<eos> Like he'll ever use it.
Richard and I worked together for the week... and we managed to do 1 1/2 questions... which we felt very proud of.<eos> Gordon refused all assistance... and managed to do one all by himself.<eos> Stephen, as always, hadn't even started... but the next morning, he went up to his rooms at 9:00... and we came back about 12:00, maybe five past 12:00... and down came Stephen, and we were in the college gateway, the lodge.<eos> "Ah, Hawking," I said, "how many have you managed to do, then?"<eos> "Well," he said, "I've only had time to do the first ten."<eos> I think at that point we realized that it's not just we weren't in the same street. We weren't on the same planet.<eos> I once calculated... that I did about 1,000 hours' work... in the three years I was at Oxford... an average of an hour a day.<eos> I am not proud of this lack of work.<eos> I am just describing my attitude at the time... an attitude that nothing was worth making an effort for.<eos> He used to produce his work every week for tutorial... and, as he never kept any notes... or papers or that sort of thing... on leaving my room, he would normally throw it in my wastepaper basket.
Hey, I've got a secret.<eos> I've got my bra on backwards.<eos> Big deal.<eos> So does Willie.<eos> Tattletale. No good.<eos> No damn good!<eos> You were right.<eos> We should have dropped him off in the snow. Why don't you read us that nice letter we just got from Lynnie?<eos> Because it came three years ago.<eos> And I've read it to you 500 times.
Look. Every picture, she gets cuter and cuter.<eos> - Did I tell you what Mary said last year?<eos> - Only until May. I'm gonna get a drink, then we can start on June.<eos> I did some of the work myself.<eos> - This bookcase is from a farm.<eos> - Where? - What did you say your name was?<eos> - Allisia. I'm Peter.<eos> The farm was in Vermont.<eos> It's old, from the 18th century.<eos> I like it. When are you gonna paint it?
COLUMBO: Well, you're half right, Justin.<eos> It is the murder weapon, but it is not Dominic Doyle's car.<eos> It's my wife's.<eos> And this is my wife's niece, Annette.<eos> She's 14.<eos> That's our dog.<eos> And that was taken in Griffith Park.<eos> The description of the car, the license number, and the name of the bar.<eos> Nobody had that information except you two.<eos> COLUMBO: And after I gave it to you, nobody could have planted that gun but you two.
It's a riddle.<eos> Do you know any riddles, Stiles?<eos> A few.<eos> What gets bigger the more you take away?<eos> A hole.<eos> What gets wetter the more it dries?<eos> A towel. (sniffling)<eos> When is a door not a door?<eos> When it's ajar.<eos> Everyone has it, But no one can lose it.

So then she starts talking about phosphors and the key having chemicals on it, right?<eos> And so that made me think of the chemistry closet and the fact that someone had to let Barrow in...<eos> It's gone.<eos> Okay, it doesn't matter though.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I've still got the key.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I had it...<eos> I had it here.<eos> I had it here this morning, I swear to God, I had it this morning.
It's gone.<eos> Okay, it doesn't matter though.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I've still got the key.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I had it...<eos> I had it here.<eos> I had it here this morning, I swear to God, I had it this morning.<eos> The key you were talking about last night?<eos> Yeah, I showed it to you, right?

What are you doing over there?<eos> There's still a lot of weapons here.<eos> I thought your new code was about protecting.<eos> Most of them are non-lethal.<eos> This looks pretty lethal to me.<eos> But maybe you should keep them.<eos> There's still a few of us out there who aren't quite so non-lethal.<eos> Like the twins.<eos> I thought we were going to give them a second chance.<eos> They don't deserve it.
I got to go.<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> Everything okay, McGee?<eos> Delilah wants to stop by.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> I think so, too.<eos> Ever since the Parsa takedown, she's wanted to come by and thank everyone personally.<eos> Well, so what's the problem?<eos> The wheelchair.<eos> She's uncomfortable being seen in it.
Yeah.<eos> Er, right. Since you've been in Kirk's office, I'll need your fingerprints for elimination purposes.<eos> Look, if there's any possibility at all, I'd love to be able to see Ziggy.<eos> I know, obviously, at the moment...<eos> You'll have to ask the nursing staff at the hospital.<eos> Give them a call.<eos> I need to take your fingerprints, so just give me a sec and I'll bring the kit.<eos> I've been through Ziggy's deleted text messages.<eos> Hannah sent her that photo two minutes after their argument.<eos> She told me she sent it while they were still in the toilet.
OK, do you know what?<eos> I tell you what.<eos> Think about what we've just asked you.<eos> You can have a chat and then we'll come back in and we'll talk a little bit more about it but I think we need to have a break.<eos> Jack?<eos> Look at this.<eos> Search team have got something at Laurie's house.<eos> Yeah?<eos> A T-shirt.<eos> Where'd we find it?
I don't have much time, Hiccup.<eos> You have to let Gustav take my place.<eos> Gustav is not taking your place.<eos> - He's not ready.<eos> - Well, train me anyway.<eos> Isn't that what you do here?<eos> I thought this was a Dragon training academy.<eos> Well, Gustav, this academy<eos> - was born out of timing and necessity...<eos> - I thought Stoick gave it to us and said it was "just some dragon training academy."
Case closed, right?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> The guy who took your truck wound up murdered.<eos> Oh. Well, that's terrible, but what does that have to do with me?<eos> You threatened him with a knife.<eos> I-I lost my temper, but...<eos> And you sell drugs.<eos> What?<eos> Lost your truck, lost your stash, right?<eos> Yeah, maybe Benny found it, threatened to turn you in.
You a cop?<eos> Do I look like a cop?<eos> I'd have believed you if you said you were.<eos> What you got back there?<eos> Somebody asleep on the job. Yeah.<eos> Well, good help's hard to find.<eos> Think I changed my mind.<eos> I'll have that drink. Rum and Coke.<eos> You got it.<eos> I'll get it for you when I come back.
Blunt force trauma and the attenuating brain injuries.<eos> Time of death, somewhere between midnight and 3:00 a.m.<eos> Any thoughts on a weapon?<eos> The margins are irregular and jagged, so nothing with a blade or sharp edge.<eos> And this cut on her knee?<eos> Pre-mortem or post?<eos> Well, let's have a look.<eos> There's some sort of paper fiber stuck to it.<eos> Probably bathroom tissue.<eos> Maybe somebody dabbed at it to stop the bleeding.
Several of them said that the bartender was only outside for a minute-- long enough to dump out the trash-- then he came running back in, looking for Madam Suzanne.<eos> So if we believe the girls, Rex isn't the killer.<eos> Well, we still need to find the murder weapon.<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> Shoe impression.<eos> Looks fairly fresh.<eos> Pointed, like the toe of a boot.<eos> Or a high-heel.<eos> Plenty of those in there.<eos> Or... the killer left it behind when they were getting rid of this.
After all the money I gave you...<eos> Quiet.<eos> People will hear.<eos> Good!<eos> Let them.<eos> I'm so sorry it had to come to this.<eos> You are not sorry.<eos> You are nothing but a liar and a thief, and it's time everybody knew.<eos> [Horse screaming] I fought hard for this life.<eos> I'm not going to give it up now.
No, we realize that, Father, but we're dealing with more than illegal immigration here.<eos> Detectives, please, is it a crime to want a better life?<eos> In this case, it is, yes.<eos> We know about your expired visa and your illegal status.<eos> That's why you asked the priest for sanctuary for a few days, isn't it?<eos> So we're guessing you're waiting for a new passport, maybe under a new name, that will safely get you out of the country.<eos> I know what I did was wrong, but I just want to go to my family, to go home.<eos> Mm-hmm, home to Esperanza.<eos> We checked with the local authorities, and we know you were born there.<eos> We know you owned a home there until last year when you sold it to come to this country.
We are new.<eos> Good for you guys.<eos> Solid.<eos> I need to tell you you got to let me go.<eos> I don't know why I'm here but I'm supposed to be watching my friends newsstand, okay?<eos> It's probably being robbed right now.<eos> You are not going anywhere until you tell us how did you know where to find that camera.<eos> Shaky Hands.<eos> Shaky Hands...<eos> He stashed it.
She's had it in for me from the start.<eos> Nit-picking every single line.<eos> She says I don't know how to write for young people.<eos> Or women.<eos> She says I'm sexist.<eos> Me!<eos> Sexist!<eos> Stupid cow.<eos> According to your posts, Lexi's signed up for the sequel.<eos> On one condition - you don't write it.
My spies tell me that in order to starve the rebels out... we must cut them off from the farming village of Wuchang.<eos> I am sending horse soldiers to that position.<eos> Jingim... blood of my blood, will lead the assault on Wuchang.<eos> Jingim... educated in Chinese ways.<eos> Who better to lead an attack on the Chinese?<eos> Older brother... if this is a call to war... you will have my horse and bow.<eos> I will lead our Golden Horde down from the north... and into battle with my nephew.<eos> We will crush Wuchang, then take the Walled City.<eos> And by the blood of Genghis...<eos> I will cut their leader's head off and tie it to the mane of my horse!
What's that?<eos> Said, "Are you busy?"<eos> Got a request for your attendance.<eos> Can it wait?<eos> I just ate an omelet.<eos> Waiting for it to digest.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What kind?<eos> Well, it was mushrooms and cheese.<eos> - Sally make it?
Uh, oh, a blood and sand. What's that?<eos> Scotch and blood orange.<eos> That's the one.<eos> All right.<eos> I sit down and-- Oh, miss, can we have some more sparkling water?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Um, anyways... so I say, "Hi, I'm Dr. Michaelson.<eos> Nice to meet you," and everything.<eos> And I get ready to give him the novocaine shot.<eos> Stick it in my own finger.
So many faces to look at.<eos> I won a radio contest, And I'm so excited to be here tonight To sell you all of these cool, old, greek things.<eos> Our first item up for bid is lot number 344.<eos> It is this old "vase," "vahs" if you're nasty.<eos> It was made in the year... Five<eos> And depicts the classic greek fable:<eos> Boy meets girl, boy has goat legs.<eos> And on the back, just a whole bunch of wheat.<eos> So let's start the bidding at $10.<eos> Okay, started it way too low.
I was there.<eos> - It was like...<eos> - Nirvana?<eos> You know, when I came to the Warehouse, I didn't think that I'd ever find peace.<eos> Just... so much chaos, you know?<eos> - But...<eos> - You found it.<eos> No.<eos> No, it was given to me.<eos> The Warehouse showed it to me.
Your mother's blood is our blood.<eos> I practice my father's religion.<eos> As do you.<eos> Mary's presence here will cost you your firstborn.<eos> I will stake my claim on England and I will marry your son, but not Francis, Bash.<eos> Legitimize him and make him the next King of France.<eos> You end up with a king and three kingdoms under your rule, and I lose everything!<eos> Imprison her.<eos> I never wanted my brother's crown.<eos> So will you take it to save his life?
Aren't you guys listening?<eos> We weren't talking!<eos> Young man, I need you to calm down.<eos> [Sighing] I should have talked to her.<eos> We're just trying to help you.<eos> I don't know where she was going.<eos> [Lucas]: Her phone was destroyed in the fire.<eos> [Groaning] Maybe she used the cloud to back things up.<eos> And you know about the cloud?<eos> Manny keeps trying to get me to use it.
Okay, but at the ceremony, I'm not gonna root around in your pocket for the ring.<eos> And, Jennifer, you'll be my maid of honor?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's like I'm not even here.<eos> Sweet.<eos> I love straight weddings.<eos> A bunch of drunk bridesmaids crying because they don't have a man.<eos> It's like eating fish in a barrel.<eos> So, where are we gonna have the ceremony?<eos> Why don't we just have it here at our place?
No.<eos> I thought I saved him.<eos> Sir, the clone CT-5385 has died.<eos> Such a tragedy.<eos> I recommend we do further tests on this tumor at the Jedi Temple to see if it is the cause of the problem.<eos> Or even better, have the tumor sent to the Grand Republic Medical Facility here on Coruscant.<eos> - The Jedi Council requested the clone.<eos> - I think the Chancellor is correct.<eos> The Grand Medical Facility is state-of-the-art.<eos> If we are to find an answer to this puzzle, we will find it there.
And she's gonna get me the practice back.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You've been trying this for a year, and Brick hasn't budged.<eos> Well, he hasn't faced my publicity machine yet.<eos> She's gonna get the people of bluebell to see how dedicated I am to them.<eos> And they're gonna demand that Brick let me back in.<eos> They already know that!<eos> Bup, bup, bup, bup! Even if I don't get the practice back, my mother has scheduled a strategy meeting with me this morning, and she only has strategy meetings with her top clients.<eos> So, win-win.<eos> You know, some people, um, they-they grab the door, and they just gently close it behind them.
- Wow. Thanks.<eos> No, I mean, you look better than when you were dying.<eos> Swinging and a-missing, Ward.<eos> It's great to see you... better.<eos> It was so stupid to go in there alone.<eos> Hey. There's no point in doing that now.<eos> You were brave.<eos> Thanks to you, every S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the country knows Mike Peterson's alive.<eos> - It's all about his magic leg?<eos> - I didn't call it that, but yes.
Okay, got it.<eos> I don't have a name, but I can confirm she was in New Mexico, fighting with Thor and his mates.<eos> She's on our side.<eos> Stand down. She's a friendly.<eos> - You are of S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I am Lady Sif of Asgard.<eos> Your world is in grave danger.<eos> She's a warrior.<eos> I saw her fight in New Mexico with Thor ... climbed a giant metal killing machine, speared it with her double-bladed sword.
I'm not saying you were weak.<eos> I'm saying all men are weak.<eos> Sir.<eos> I understand why you had to punch me.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> Can I get a moment alone with Skye, please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know that face, and something gives me a feeling I should be sitting down for this.<eos> I've been looking for a way to tell you this, looking around for some answers, something to help... explain but I don't have any.<eos> So... the drug, the one that saved us both ... when we found it, I discovered something else.
When I found the "Worcestershire sauce" being sold in a store, I was surprised at first.<eos> I had no idea that it was widely used throughout society.<eos> I initially thought that we were responsible for the trend.<eos> Really?<eos> Yup.<eos> So it doesn't even have soy sauce in it?<eos> Probably not.<eos> I realized even much later that our sauce was the impostor.<eos> It's a completely different sauce if it has a soy sauce taste.<eos> It's not like I ever said I invented it or anything.
Cosmic rays can rip through DNA.<eos> Without our magnetic field, the rate of mutation in living organisms would be much higher.<eos> Fortunately, most of this cosmic shrapnel gets trapped in the Van Allen belts, donut-shaped zones of charged particles corralled by our magnetic shield.<eos> Knowing that the Earth itself is like a giant bar magnet explains one of the most beautiful sights in the sky, the aurora.<eos> Charged particles from the Sun, the solar wind, are constantly bombarding the Earth.<eos> You can think of the solar wind as a kind of electric current.<eos> Our planet's magnetic field channels that current towards the North and South Poles.<eos> When it hits our atmosphere, the oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the air glow like giant fluorescent lightbulbs.<eos> When Faraday pursued his last and most profound discovery, the poverty of his childhood stymied him as it never had before.<eos> He needed help and found it in one who had come from another world.
If there is enough dark matter, its gravity would eventually bring the expansion to a stop, and the universe would then fall back on itself.<eos> In that case, everything would eventually collapse in a big crunch.<eos> On the other hand, if the universe had less dark matter, the expansion would continue forever, just getting slower and slower.<eos> Two competing teams of astronomers were observing those supernovas in distant galaxies.<eos> It turned out to be another one of those "that's funny" moments.<eos> In 1998, both teams independently came to the same conclusion. The expansion isn't slowing down at all... it's speeding up.<eos> This means the universe will continue to expand forever.<eos> There seems to be a mysterious force in the universe, one that overwhelms gravity on the grandest scale to push the cosmos apart.<eos> Most of the energy of the universe is bound up in this unknown force.<eos> We call it "dark energy,"
The leader keeps referring to himself as "noqa" for "I"<eos> and "noqanchik" for "us as a group".<eos> Obviously.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've repeatedly heard the word "puriy" and "purinchik"<eos> to describe an action that's occurred throughout the time that we've been with them.<eos> It translates as "walk" and "we walk".<eos> Making friends, are we?<eos> That word, "yawar".<eos> They used it when they fed us the llama milk mixed with blood.
I give you my word.<eos> And what good is your word when I'm burnt for heresy?<eos> Here it is.<eos> Study it quickly.<eos> The Sword of Osman Gazi.<eos> Gallant leader of the Turks.<eos> Founder of the Ottoman Empire.<eos> In Constantinople, they mislead their people by proudly displaying a counterfeit sword in their palace.<eos> This is the original.<eos> I've studied it at length.
This is it.<eos> Well, you'll have to forgive me if I'm a little wary, Agent Landon.<eos> Our recent experiences with the FBI are less than desirable, I know.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> I know about your father.<eos> That's one of the reasons I came to you with this.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Look, I'm FBI.<eos> I love the agency, I'm fiercely loyal to it.<eos> But that doesn't mean that I'm blind to the leaks and corruption that plague it.
No, his other brother Patrick told me.<eos> Patrick?<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> He's not in the book.<eos> He isn't.<eos> He's reluctant.<eos> He's also my "in," so I want to do whatever I can to protect him.<eos> But who is protecting you?<eos> Well, I haven't needed protection in the past.<eos> I don't need it now.
You gotta get your stuff and clear out of here.<eos> It won't be long before FSB ties you to your brother.<eos> Aw, Pete.<eos> What's gonna happen to him?<eos> Same thing that's gonna happen to you if you don't disappear.<eos> Patrick, listen to me-- you don't have much time.<eos> They're gonna track you down and they're gonna think that you're the one that got away with the gem.<eos> Me?<eos> What about the other guy?<eos> The guy who actually took it?
What about you?<eos> Where do you go from here?<eos> Well, let's just say that I have a bone to pick with the person that recommended me for this gig.<eos> Good luck, Patrick.<eos> You, too, Mara.<eos> Wait, if you didn't get the gem, then who did?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - How do you not know?<eos> You were undercover, that's why you were there.<eos> I mean, the Russians certainly don't have it.
Excuse me.<eos> Hi. Can you play somewhere else, please?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Somewhere Else, Somewhere Else.<eos> I'm not really familiar with that one, but if you hum a couple of bars, I might be able to blag my way through it.<eos> No, I mean could you please leave?<eos> You're disturbing my customers.<eos> Come on, mate, I'm just trying to express myself<eos> That's great. Can I see your busking licence?<eos> Oh, I must have left it at home.
Hey.<eos> Wanna stop by?<eos> Let's have some tea or something and talk.<eos> We just became friends, after all.<eos> I guess so.<eos> I've been to choco la vie. Eh? Really?<eos> - It was really delicious.<eos> And the shop's interior is pretty fancy. It even has a chandelier.<eos> That chandelier was a present from one of the staff's father.<eos> He used to have it in his own shop in the past, but he can't use it anymore, apparently.
You've got me at a really bad time.<eos> All right, I'll go.<eos> No, I'll go.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I have to go, Carsten.<eos> Keep trying till you find someone.<eos> - I'll call you later.<eos> - Right.<eos> - What happened to your bike?<eos> - Someone broke it.
It's disappointing, I know.<eos> I checked the firearms register and guess who owns a.45-calibre?<eos> Right.<eos> I'll drive this time.<eos> I'm an excellent driver.<eos> No, you're not!<eos> This is practically harassment.<eos> We appreciate your co-operation.<eos> Never even use the damn thing.<eos> Then why keep it?
A man has a right to protect his own property.<eos> Does that include his wife?<eos> There you go.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> It's gone.<eos> What?<eos> It's not there.<eos> I can't understand.<eos> It was...it was here.<eos> When was the last time you saw it?
Knock yourself out.<eos> It's gone.<eos> What?<eos> It's not there.<eos> I can't understand.<eos> It was...it was here.<eos> When was the last time you saw it?<eos> I cleaned it a week ago.<eos> Did you lock the safe afterwards?<eos> Of course I locked it.
Look, when he found out about the affair he was livid.<eos> He said that he was going to deal with Carlton and he meant it.<eos> I had to do something.<eos> So, I took the gun.<eos> I don't know if I was protecting Carlton from Marc.<eos> Or Marc from himself.<eos> I went round to Carlton's.<eos> I told him that Marc knew and that he should take the gun just in case something happened.<eos> And what did Carlton say?<eos> He didn't want it.

Oh, boy.<eos> Tough few days, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, about the passport check...<eos> You were doing your job.<eos> Sorry about Lauren.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I wish I could help her.<eos> Yes, it's a pity we can't find the gun.<eos> She said she left it at the villa.
I have to fly to Houston.<eos> There's been a problem there,<eos> - and they need me to, uh...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> ...fix it.<eos> Now, Richard, you are being very, very boring.<eos> Right?<eos> Now, this gallery opening is very important.<eos> It's a once-in-a-lifetime... experience.<eos> And I need you to share it with me.
Despite all evidence to the contrary, you cling to the delusion that you will prevail.<eos> Don't tell me you still believe in that God of yours.<eos> So where is He?<eos> Why has He done nothing?<eos> Face the truth.<eos> He is nothing but a figment of your imagination.<eos> Your arrest report says you were apprehended with an antique sword.<eos> - Is it Sardu's?<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> I will give it back to your Master in due time.
- No.<eos> So sorry to hear that.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> How sad.<eos> How tragic.<eos> How many women shot by husbands and boyfriends come through ER every year?<eos> It's infuriating!<eos> We'll come back once we cauterized the rest of the bleeders.<eos> Mel, don't tar all gun owners with the same brush.<eos> Hang another bag of blood; we're gonna need it.
I get a letter a week from some crackpot.<eos> Really?<eos> Have you, uh, received any recently?<eos> You know, I did receive an odd missive when I first arrived at the hotel.<eos> I didn't think twice about it.<eos> What kind of missive?<eos> It was a note wishing me well, wrapped around a chess piece.<eos> Um, it was sort of, mm... handmade.<eos> It was a bishop.<eos> Do you still have it?
- It's Cray-eeg. Cray-eeg... The MeetMeyer website.<eos> These are the opening times for Sea World.<eos> You know, this is good. If things work all the time, it means we can't make them better.<eos> We have a saying here at Clovis.<eos> Dare to fail.<eos> Then that's a job well done.<eos> Stop playing ping-pong here and go have a great time somewhere else.<eos> Look, if we don't go with this Chung torture story, someone else will.<eos> We just don't know the facts.<eos> Okay. We put it out there, and then something will arrive that backs it up.
Seems these two weren't the only ones looking for the beach house tonight.<eos> What do you think's going on in there?<eos> She's mauling her.<eos> I'm kidding, it's fine.<eos> Then why are you clutching the tranq gun like it's your best friend?<eos> I'm sorry, Tess, I never should've arrested her.<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Tess, your favorite cheesecake in the fridge.<eos> Maggie made it last night.
Elihas, you are on the verge of bringing us all down.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Did I hurt you?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I can still spew out insults.<eos> - What did Fury say'?<eos> - People want to put you away, for life.<eos> No less than I deserve.<eos> When my family was murdered in front of me, I made myself into a weapon of single-minded destruction.<eos> I needed revenge, and I took it!
How nice to see you again!<eos> Almost as pretty as me, when I was young.<eos> Ren.<eos> Hello, Frank!<eos> Leviathan, huh?<eos> I didn't know Cain and his men were associated with those traffickers.<eos> Well, they are. And I figure the Leviathan auction will be held anytime.<eos> Tell me where and when.<eos> It's the Leviathan auction.<eos> Come on, don't tell me you haven't heard of it.
That's a five.<eos> Tell my assistant I fell asleep with a condom on again, and to bring scissors to my trailer.<eos> All right, guys, before we begin today, I want to introduce our newest staff writer, Brian Griffin.<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> Yes, I am that Brian Griffin.<eos> You probably have my novel, but just so you know, in here, I'm just one of the guys, all right?<eos> You have my novel, right?<eos> Nope?<eos> No?<eos> You got it, though. Nope?

- Yes papaji<eos> Come here...<eos> A few of my shirts and trousers are lying outside the cupboard, take them to the washerwoman and get them ironed nicely.<eos> And don't come back till they're all done, even if takes an hour.<eos> But Shah Rukh's film on TV...<eos> Hey, don't talk nonsense with me... till the job is not done, stay with the washerwoman.<eos> What can I say...<eos> I'm missing the film...<eos> There's always so much work around here...<eos> Have yöu seen it?
Good night, gentlemen.<eos> You've done the right thing.<eos> No, all I've done is take a difficult task and made it impossible.<eos> You know, Ben.<eos> Just don't let me wait to get Abe's letter to Washington.<eos> - But you've gotta be all for it.<eos> - The letter?<eos> - Scott burned the letter.<eos> - So you rewrite it.<eos> And then we smuggle it in.
- So you rewrite it.<eos> And then we smuggle it in.<eos> - Smuggle it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> - I mean, come on, you saw yourself.<eos> Scott only reads the first page of a scout's report<eos> - before passing it on, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So we get Abe's letter and we fold it into a report, yeah?
Hold on!<eos> Did they say it was a whale?<eos> A whale?<eos> If it wrecked a ship, it's gotta be<eos> Right!<eos> Yl Seong-gye is going crazy 'cause a whale ate the Royal Seal<eos> So, you're saying we'll get rich if we just catch the whale?<eos> We could retire for life!<eos> A whale, huh?<eos> Do we catch it with a net?
She was chasing whales like a fisherman, Commander<eos> Right before she caught it, I turned her into whale bait<eos> I'll offer you tributes-twice as much as before<eos> How much is your life worth?<eos> Since I rule the seas...<eos> The price of a whale<eos> If you catch it, you'll live If you don't, you'll die<eos> A whale, sir?<eos> I'm taking over this ship<eos> You catch the whale and I'll gut it. Got it?
I'm not going down with you!<eos> Go ahead and try!<eos> You don't have the nerve!<eos> Think you're man enough?<eos> The dragon is resurrected!<eos> Sis...<eos> Let's go home<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Guard the whale!<eos> Don't lose it!
Officer down!<eos> Elena's gone.<eos> Either she killed him and fled...<eos> Or someone else did and they grabbed her.<eos> If they took Elena, that means Beckett's cover's blown.<eos> She's as good as dead.<eos> Dear Rick, I don't know how much time I have, even to write this letter.<eos> What I do know now is that I'm in this, and the only way I'm gonna make it out alive is to see this through.<eos> I'm sure everyone is looking for me, and if they figure out I was here,<eos> CSU's gonna search this house. They're gonna look for blood, and they will find it, which will lead them to this letter.
- I can't tell you or anyone else.<eos> If I do, it won't come true.<eos> It's like making a wish.<eos> No, no, no. Don't worry.<eos> I'm not gonna ruin that.<eos> But, hey, can you give me a little hint?<eos> I'm asking Santa... for the one thing I want more than anything in the world.<eos> Well, hey, I got an idea.<eos> There's a mailbox right over there.<eos> Why don't you give me the letter, and then I'll run it out there?
Hey!<eos> - Honey?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Honey, that's a Harrison.<eos> - The Talking Bear.<eos> Yeah, I know. Like, you handed them out at the tree lighting.<eos> But wasn't Harrison what you asked for in your letter to Santa?<eos> Dad, you said you wouldn't show anyone my letter except Santa.<eos> Yeah....<eos> Santa Claus dropped it the other night, and Victor come along and picked it up.
And once the osteomyeltis clears up, she'll have a better chance of waking up.<eos> It's our anniversary tomorrow.<eos> 32 years of marriage.<eos> These last three weeks are the longest...<eos> I've gone without hearing her voice.<eos> I had a patient in July with a-a similar condition, and, um, he managed to make a full recovery.<eos> Well, I should get back to this.<eos> "Yolanda tried to fight the feelings bubbling up" "inside her like a volcano threatening..." "To engulf her, to swallow her whole."<eos> We spent every penny we earned trying to make that house our dream home, and now we have to sell it because he can't afford to buy me out.<eos> Why don't you keep it and buy him out?
Well, I have a bullet and I have a gun, but I have no way to fire it to make a comparison, because the gun barrel is split like a banana peel.<eos> The expansive mortar got in it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I've tried something different.<eos> I've Microsiled the inside of the barrel.<eos> That works?<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> It's a match.<eos> We've got our murder weapon.<eos> The killer left it in the vic's hand.
Friend said Claire didn't give her any details, but, Morgan, you found trace of paint on Claire's shoes, right?<eos> It could be that Claire had contact with this artiste around the time of her death.<eos> Anything that can help solve Claire's case can help solve Ana's.<eos> Where was the photo taken?<eos> Henry just analyzed the metadata.<eos> Picture was snapped at a house in Henderson.<eos> Want to check it out?<eos> LVPD!<eos> Elderly homeowner leases out the guesthouse to a guy.<eos> Uses it as his studio, pays cash.
I should have acted like an MX.<eos> They love those things.<eos> John, the stuff they said your father did... could it be true?<eos> When I was a kid, my dad patrolled downtown, a real tough beat, gang controlled.<eos> Lot of cops were on the take.<eos> One day, his unit takes down this dealer, a real heavy hitter.<eos> They find seven million dollars in cash under the floorboards.<eos> Now, the task force leader tells everybody to take a cut.<eos> My dad refused.<eos> So, the guy takes a scatter gun, puts it to his head and says if he doesn't take a cut and get his hands dirty like everyone else, then, he's gonna blow his brains out.
- Option three.<eos> Ugh! I should have seen that coming.<eos> Well, Stormfly and I are gonna prove we're not the problem by working with you.<eos> Not as well as we're gonna work with you!<eos> Right, Hookfang?<eos> I wouldn't believe it if I wasn't seeing it<eos> - with my own two eyes.<eos> - I guess my Dad was right.<eos> Then again, I did put my own Hiccup spin on it.<eos> That's what all great leaders do, Fishlegs, they take an idea, then they shape it.
Not like this one.<eos> - Dragon root.<eos> - Not dragon root!<eos> - That is terrible.<eos> - You don't actually know what dragon root is, do you?<eos> Not even slightly.<eos> Not even the faintest.<eos> I mean, I think I know what "dragon" means.<eos> Dragon root is like dragon nip, only more powerful.<eos> Dragons crave it, but instead of making them happy and calm... it makes them...
You know, I had one more verse I wanted to do for you, though.<eos> Okay.<eos> * When I say dirty, you say sex *<eos> * Dirty!<eos> ... * (Feedback squeals)<eos> Sergeant Hill!<eos> That's...<eos> Ugh, I hate beer.<eos> -It's the worst.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Why do we always drink it?
Look, the point is, I realize now that I took advantage of you, and that was not cool.<eos> And?<eos> And it'll never happen again.<eos> And?<eos> And I will never ask you to run my errands just because you're sitting at home, doing nothing.<eos> I'm writing a novel.<eos> Of course.<eos> So, uh... do you think my iPhone still works?<eos> Oh, it works.<eos> I took a picture of my dick and sent it to everyone in your contact list.
I was kidding.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You don't want a landlady who can't take a joke.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I... Don't know.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I think you sabotaged me 'cause you didn't want to lose your frittata-cookin' man servant.<eos> Sabotage you?<eos> I've been letting you sleep on my couch for a month.<eos> I had a chance to start over, and you killed it!
- Okay.<eos> You're a young man.<eos> - This is a much deeper problem. - Okay, hold on, hold on.<eos> - Aah! - Got one arm out. I don't think we should try to fix it tonight.<eos> Now, have you ever done yoga before?<eos> No, but I've always wanted to.<eos> Okay, well welcome to the first day of the rest of your life/quest.<eos> Now, on your knees, please.<eos> - Okay, I like this, okay.<eos> - And what we're gonna do is a lovely move called cat cow where you flex your spine up, and then you release it down.
Okay, Will.<eos> Okay... ooh, mom,<eos> - I think you're falling. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, yep.<eos> Yeah, I just waxed the car. All right?<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Oh, bloody good job!<eos> Why aren't we leaving?<eos> Let's just give it a few minutes, make sure he's good.<eos> Mm. Listen, you didn't ruin poker night, okay?<eos> I ruined it.
Clock's ticking.<eos> Briefcase.<eos> - Is it okay?<eos> - No... no!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Man, look at this place.<eos> It's packed. It's like a Swedish furniture refugee camp.<eos> Do you really need a desk?<eos> I mean, can't you just use the kitchen table?<eos> - We never use it to eat.
- You bet.<eos> Sweet!<eos> Wrapping paper.<eos> Yeah, wrapping...<eos> Uncle Glen, you're going about this the wrong way.<eos> - Give me your phone. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Folks, this is my cousin Carly.<eos> Cute, huh?<eos> Born with two left feet.<eos> Couldn't kick a soccer ball if you glued it to her leg.
Well, i got this other thing, but i can move it.<eos> Hilarious.<eos> Keep walking.<eos> Keep walking.<eos> Don't look back.<eos> And we're walking.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Don't you dare wave.<eos> You should've seen her face when i left her at the door.<eos> I didn't see it, but i bet it was awesome.
I've come to offer you a deal.<eos> If you'll say that you and my wife have been having an affair, I'll show mercy.<eos> Instead of death, your punishment will be exile from France.<eos> Is that so bad?<eos> You can pretend to tell fortunes in<eos> Germany or Spain.<eos> I think not.<eos> Well, there you are.<eos> Loyalty's an odd thing.<eos> Heaven knows how you engender it, my dear.
- So?<eos> - It was very late.<eos> If you're back with him, I think it's a mistake.<eos> I know the château you claim to stay at in Angers where you ran into Francis.<eos> It burned down last year.<eos> I don't know what happened between the two of you, but I can guess, so please don't counsel me on mistakes.<eos> Come along, girls, be of service to your queen.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Why are you singing that song?<eos> I was told to sing it near you.
Trudge, trudge, trudge.<eos> If you ask me, there's nothing more boring than land travel.<eos> I'll take my tail in the ocean any day.<eos> That's one thing we can agree on... minus the tail, of course.<eos> You won't be bored for much longer.<eos> Our destination is just past this rise.<eos> Then it won't be long until I'm reunited...<eos> Here.<eos> Allow me.<eos> You've ripped it!
Ladies always leave and enter a room without being heard, so excellent time to practice now.<eos> Oh, no. It can't be gone.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Is it your doll?<eos> She is really beautiful.<eos> My mother gave it to me.<eos> It's the only thing I have from her.<eos> Don't tell Lacey I told you, but...<eos> I heard her telling Sissy Towers to steal your doll and hide it in the third-floor storage closet.
I hand you over alive to the governor of Carolina.<eos> Not to William Jagger in Jamaica?<eos> No.<eos> Am I permitted to ask why not?<eos> Jagger's deranged.<eos> In exchange for your hide, the governor of Carolina will see to it that William Jagger is sent far away to some minor governorship off the Barbary Coast.<eos> Of course, they'll hang me.<eos> I expect so, and that's unfortunate, though not unjust.<eos> However, the island will be safe.<eos> William Jagger will tear this island down and burn it, no matter if I am hanged and no matter if he's governor.
She said there was a person on the island who might wish her ill.<eos> Did she said whom?<eos> No.<eos> But someone broke into Rose's lodgings last night.<eos> And you think he was hunting for the letter?<eos> Did he find it?<eos> He didn't.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Nelly, you're safe here.<eos> She said give it to the Commodore, but the Commodore is indisposed, and the lady of the house won't take visitors.
You should be able to get out easily enough.<eos> While you struggle why don't you have a think about what you want to do next.<eos> As Camus says, "Life is the sum of all your choices."<eos> Choose your next move carefully, Katie.<eos> Gibson.<eos> - 'It's Larkin, ma'am.'<eos> - Yes?<eos> 'We've heard from the Recording Officer at the labs.'<eos> 'They've managed to lift a partial print from the scissors.<eos> We've run it through the system and found a match.'
- Just the once.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> We'd missed some sessions.<eos> He was worried.<eos> What happened during that visit?<eos> We talked.<eos> I showed him my son's room.<eos> Why?<eos> At first, after I lost Daniel, I wasn't able to go in there, but then I did.<eos> I wanted Paul to see it.
I think I found your missus.<eos> - Where?<eos> - On the Esplanade in Bangor.<eos> She just went into one of the houses.<eos> Hold on.<eos> It's number 92.<eos> If it wasn't her...<eos> The Benedetto girl is still refusing to see her mother.<eos> An Appropriate Adult should be here by nine.<eos> She's been advised that she is entitled to legal advice but has declined to obtain it.
But I did.<eos> Out of all the people in the world, Julian, I love you.<eos> And I want you to understand.<eos> I see now why I shouldn't have done it.<eos> Taken the drug.<eos> I'm limited.<eos> I'm not good enough.<eos> I'll never get to where I need to be, it's true.<eos> And I can see that now.<eos> That's why you didn't want me to take it.
- Excuse me?<eos> Liam thinks I'm a lesbian.<eos> Let's elect them Homecoming Queens!<eos> Maybe we should see how this plays out.<eos> We're not gay.<eos> Way to sell it. ♪ No relief ♪ ♪ We endlessly creep ♪<eos> She's not my girlfriend. ♪ No sleep ♪ ♪ I like the belief ♪<eos> What the are you doing in my room?<eos> Measuring.<eos> Turns out it's 37 square feet bigger than mine, which means I want it.
Wow. Thanks.<eos> You seem uncomfortable.<eos> Yeah, I don't really come from a family of huggers.<eos> Oh, you poor thing.<eos> Just relax and enjoy.<eos> I'm humiliated.<eos> Everybody is staring at me.<eos> Wow, they're being so discreet, you can't even tell.<eos> Tommy asked me to sext him, so I sent a photo of me in my bra.<eos> I know everybody's seen it.
More so if you weren't stinking up the place.<eos> - Oh... - Where ever did you learn such a thing?<eos> There weren't many women at medical school, so I spent a lot of time with the boys. Ooooh!<eos> - The fire needs more wood.<eos> - I'll help you.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> I could have sworn there was an axe on the chopping block when we arrived.<eos> - Well, you must be mistaken.<eos> - Cedric must have left it somewhere.<eos> - We'll find it in the morning.

I don't know.<eos> Maybe what happens in the cave stays in the cave.<eos> Nobody's seen Jennifer.<eos> One of the firemen, a half hour ago, he said he spoke to Audrey.<eos> Okay, how is Mara pretending to be Audrey?<eos> She has all of Audrey's memories.<eos> Ah, perfect.<eos> Fireman also said she was asking about Jennifer.<eos> I mean, if the door's gone, what does Mara need Jennifer for?<eos> Mara called it "that door."
Which is exactly what I'm gonna do.<eos> No, Vincent, wait.<eos> Why, Catherine?<eos> They're after me, not JT.<eos> Yeah, but they don't know it's you for sure.<eos> Otherwise they wouldn't have sent an e-mail to everyone.<eos> They want a beast, okay, and that is me!<eos> Okay, but why would they lure you if they didn't know they could already handle you?<eos> The gem.<eos> They've obviously got it.
I've only been gone for less than a week.<eos> 1 week or 1 year isn't the point.<eos> It's like you live day to day.<eos> Do you ever think about our future?<eos> If I don't think about it why would I take this job so far away?<eos> A job? You call that a job?<eos> You're not even a fulltime teacher yet.<eos> Next year you don't even know if you still have a job.<eos> And my motorcycle?<eos> How could you let someone else ride it?
H-e-l-l-o<eos> Muek, your poop is stuck in your butt.<eos> Hey Mr. No-Water-To-Wash-Your-Butt!<eos> Hey Mr. Didn't-wash-your-hands.<eos> Your poop stinks.<eos> Muek.<eos> Muek.<eos> Uncle Boonmee gave you a letter, right?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Why did you leave it in the toilet?
Hey Mr. No-Water-To-Wash-Your-Butt!<eos> Hey Mr. Didn't-wash-your-hands.<eos> Your poop stinks.<eos> Muek.<eos> Muek.<eos> Uncle Boonmee gave you a letter, right?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Why did you leave it in the toilet?<eos> I dropped it in the toilet.<eos> But I opened and read it already.
Be good.<eos> Ann... let's go.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> This is yours right?<eos> You left it on your table.<eos> Hello Mr. Song.<eos> We still didn't get to meet.<eos> But the kids will be very happy to see you again.<eos> The school hasn't changed much since you were here last.<eos> The wall in the kitchen that you built I redecorated it.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.<eos> Actually, it does.<eos> Death is inherently sad.<eos> I'm sad.<eos> I'm not in the mood for a party.<eos> Sook.<eos> Sook!<eos> Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?<eos> About how this house was feeling so empty?<eos> That's why we're gonna fill it up, so we can say "fuck you," to death and "hello," to life.
- No. - No?<eos> - She's the antidote, Eric.<eos> She can heal you.<eos> This isn't about capture and kill anymore.<eos> - This is about capture and--<eos> - Capture and exploit.<eos> You're a capitalist, yes?<eos> I have a business proposition for you.<eos> All right, we're listenin.<eos> Together we track down Ms. Newlin we capture her and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product: New Blood.
Nobody can know about it.<eos> How do you two know each other?<eos> Uh, she's just another fangbanger.<eos> Why are you protecting her?<eos> Bill, wake up.<eos> There's a cure.<eos> I gotta hop on a flight to Dallas, Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone, Mr. Northman.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want the blood.<eos> What the fuck do you mean you don't want it?
Listen to me, sweetie.<eos> I had never seen her before and I don't have any idea who she is, and that's the truth-- I don't know.<eos> I'm sitting up with Jason at Merlotte's or Bellefleur's-- whatever the hell it is they call it now, and he tells me that her maker's dying of Hep-V.<eos> Okay, so you don't know her, but you do know her maker?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, he's the first vampire that I ever met.<eos> And he's always been really good to me and he had a super interesting life.<eos> The man is dying.<eos> I wanted to help out.<eos> So I went to the clinic, I gave my blood, I took it over there so he'd have something to eat, and that's the truth, and that's it.
I'm sorry, Brigette.<eos> Jessica.<eos> You wanna tell me what's going on?<eos> Bill released me tonight.<eos> Jesus, I'm sorry. Why?<eos> There's a cure... but he wouldn't drink it.<eos> - I'm confused.<eos> - Yeah, so am I.<eos> Because it was right there.<eos> Salvation was right there and he wouldn't take it.
Gone.<eos> Are you healed?<eos> Well, I can't tell you how but I came looking for you because I wanted you to know I'm gonna be okay.<eos> Bill's sick.<eos> What?<eos> Hep-V.<eos> He has it.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Is there something you're not understanding?<eos> If there's a cure, he needs it.
Listen, Bubba.<eos> Brigette.<eos> We ain't gonna have sex tonight.<eos> I'm gonna teach you how not to have sex with someone.<eos> You say we're royalty, but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, I can't think of a single advantage in being what we are.<eos> Where'd you go Sam?<eos> Sookie.<eos> Sam's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> We track down Miss Newlin, and we synthesize her blood and distribute it worldwide as a product- - New Blood.
Legally speaking, with your grandmother not fit and all, you're my eldest remaining heir.<eos> We're family, remember?<eos> You and I.<eos> I remember.<eos> When I found out I was unwell, I went to see an attorney, see if I could will my home to Jessica.<eos> It's kind of a long story, but it turns out that I can't, which means that when I die, this house will pass over to you.<eos> Well, I--<eos> I can't accept this house.<eos> For all kinds of reasons.<eos> I'm asking if you will rent it to Jessica and Hoyt for the sum of $1 a month.
Yeah, thanks for the home base, Simon.<eos> Where do you keep your snacks?<eos> Way on the other side of the office.<eos> Out of sight, out of mind.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bye!<eos> Molly, bring the beer!<eos> We don't want anyone to take it.
which is highly unlikely... it's just gonna be a flatbed of green Post-its.<eos> Or is it a magical green snake that was driven out of Ireland?<eos> No, we're screwed.<eos> And we're almost out of Post-its.<eos> Oh, how'd it go?<eos> !<eos> - Got fired.<eos> - What?<eos> I mean, didn't you use my candy technique?<eos> Oh, she used it and used it and used it.
Do you mind canceling my reservation?<eos> - Sure, I'll take care of it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Oh, Andrew, guess what?<eos> I got us reservations at Joe Port's.<eos> All you can eat shrimp buffet.<eos> Splash.<eos> Did you just... take my reservation?<eos> Is that okay?<eos> It's just, you didn't want it, so I kind of just swooped in.
How did the vote go?<eos> It was a tie.<eos> What... how is that possible?<eos> There are nine board members.<eos> Mm, I guess I'm the deciding vote. (short laugh)<eos> And you know how much I hate being the center of attention.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> You gonna side with the man who stole your youth or go with the non-threatening gay guy who always tells you how young you look?<eos> Mom, you have to leave personal stuff out...<eos> I'm saying this to the woman that fought for the beach house in the divorce and then sold it for a dollar just to piss my dad off.
Uh, where are the groceries?<eos> All over the floor of aisle six of Zippy Mart.<eos> Wow, you're both doing a hell of a job handling Joe's old duties.<eos> Look, I was paying for groceries when a guy pulled out a gun.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Well, turns out it was a toy gun.<eos> Nobody knew that at the time.<eos> Still, that's so scary.<eos> Hey, I had to use an iron that could get very hot.<eos> If you turned it on.
Hey, Ryder, first day of school.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - I'm not going.<eos> That's the spirit...<eos> wait, what?<eos> Yeah, I've gone viral.<eos> Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.<eos> You're a boy.<eos> We didn't think you needed that shot.<eos> No, no, my news interview, someone turned it into some kind of auto-tune video.
Oh, thanks, Bruce.<eos> I-I got a beer.<eos> Where in the world did you find that?<eos> - In the refrigerator. - Huh.<eos> Must have been left by one of the Mexicans.<eos> A gift from Paramount.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> The new movie opens soon, doesn't it?<eos> Mm. Next month.<eos> - You seen it?
Yeah?<eos> Mr. Renard, there is a woman here to see you.<eos> Her name is Adalind Schade.<eos> Renard admitted to trying to kill my sister?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And he had the key.<eos> - How did he get the key?<eos> - I hid it in my desk thinking that the safest place to keep it would be the middle of a police station.<eos> That was before I knew who he was.<eos> And did you get it back?

Have you got Natasha's bank records?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> Ha!<eos> There!<eos> 10,000 euros?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why is he so much in debt?<eos> It might be something to do with his life-style.<eos> He wears an elastic band around his wrist, it's a classic addicts' device.<eos> They ping it whenever they get a craving, to remind them they're trying to quit.
Based on the injuries to the hamate and the triquetral bones, we have evidence of a struggle, but nothing on the bones that indicates a weapon.<eos> No, that's not true, Dr. Edison.<eos> There is a scratch on the spinal process of the C-7.<eos> It doesn't appear in your notes though.<eos> Well, I guess I missed that.<eos> It was obscured by the discoloration from the victim's leukemia medication.<eos> There appears to be slight hemorrhagic staining.<eos> Yes.<eos> Perimortem-- has to be related to his death.<eos> Question is: what caused it?
I can't believe I was just briefly attracted to Boyle. Ugh. Ugh!<eos> A Mr. brain Jensen here to see you, sir.<eos> It's Brian.<eos> Mm, not according to this note I wrote on my hand very quickly: "Brain."<eos> Captain holt, we recently met at the African-American gay and lesbian New York City policeman's association.<eos> Uh, yes, that name is quite a mouthful.<eos> Just call it the "aaglnycpa."<eos> Your organization has meant so much to me.<eos> Uh, well, it's not my organization.<eos> I mean, I did found it and I've been president for the last 25 years and I oversee every detail, but really, it's our organization.
Probably.<eos> That's great.<eos> All right, let's go over our disguise<eos> I am Herbert goffleman from San Diego.<eos> I came here to stand in the cold outside the today show, holding a sign with a misspelled word on it.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> You win.<eos> That neon green Fanny pack screams, "gullible tourist."<eos> It's mine.<eos> I brought it from home.
Thank you.<eos> Can you make it a work emergency, not a bathroom one?<eos> I kinda wanna make IA.<eos> Sarge, you made your point.<eos> We messed up.<eos> But this is a big case, and Hitchcock and Scully are gonna screw it up.<eos> I'm sure they can handle it.<eos> They have a combined 50 years of experience.<eos> This morning I found Scully's gun in the freezer, in the frozen yogurt.<eos> I think he was using it as a spoon.
I'm not really a baby.<eos> You're a super grownup.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Oh, my...<eos> - What?<eos> I have a picture of Mom wearing the backpack at her sign language class graduation.<eos> - Oh. - You have to see this.<eos> - No.<eos> - It's amazing.<eos> I have it in a photo album.
Oh, please, I was doing you a favor. Why did you have to open your big mouth?<eos> I just said what everybody else was thinking.<eos> Oh, you know what I'm thinking... why did I bring you to that event? Oh, I made you look good.<eos> I'm an asset. It's pronounced "ass hat."<eos> What did I do that was so wrong?<eos> All I did was tell the truth.<eos> The truth is taking a stand on this issue right now could end my State Senate campaign before it even begins.<eos> I understand how important votes are in your business.<eos> But even you yourself said that concert hall is about to fall down.<eos> So is my mom's face, but I'm not gonna yank it off myself.
If you're so cool with it, you try!<eos> Hey! If this is your stop, please get off!<eos> Hang on!<eos> Nobody is taking any of our calls<eos> Something must have happened<eos> There's no-one on the streets The only thing here is our minibus<eos> I don't know what's going on<eos> How about trying the radio?<eos> Good idea!<eos> Don't break it, buddy... This ain't my minibus
No, that's just the drugs<eos> He was already like that... when he got on the minibus in Mong Kok<eos> He's obviously pretty tough<eos> We'd better let him get on<eos> What's with the outfits?<eos> Are you okay, Mr Blind Fai?<eos> I'm fine<eos> Should I help you take out the cleaver?<eos> No, the blade stops the bleeding<eos> If you take it out... I'm afraid blood will drench the bus
Impersonate Adam Peer to suggest that Dr. Granger falsified his results.<eos> Then murder him, stage it as a suicide, simultaneously removing the one man who could defend his work, and legitimizing the accusations of fraud.<eos> Once the divorce was finalized and the company was out of your wife's reach, well, Barry's work would be vindicated.<eos> The company's value would skyrocket, and you would be able to keep your millions.<eos> Your company's value was gonna rebound too quickly.<eos> You were still dead set against sharing anything with your wife, so you went to plan B, you killed her.<eos> Realizing that as the estranged husband, you would inevitably be the prime suspect, you hatched another devious plan.<eos> You framed yourself for a murder you actually committed.<eos> The other day, we told you that we thought someone was targeting you.<eos> You took that idea and ran with it.
I should've run it past you first.<eos> But we were running out of time and I wanted to at least test the waters.<eos> But before he would agree, he wanted to have a sit-down, face-to-face, so he can look you in the eye<eos> - and know if you were sincere.<eos> - They'll never let Lavar in here.<eos> No, we don't do it here.<eos> Do it at our house.<eos> You were granted a furlough for my wedding.<eos> Right.<eos> What if we moved it to tomorrow?
Yeah.<eos> Changed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bath?<eos> Done.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Carrie.<eos> You've still got the beard.<eos> Quinn told me you shaved it off.
I never forget a pretty face.<eos> Don't say I never did anything for you.<eos> _<eos> Aayan.<eos> Is your father here?<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Do you have the bag I gave you?<eos> Kiran?<eos> Kiran, do you have the bag?<eos> Baba found it.
No, it's okay.<eos> Do you have the bag I gave you?<eos> Kiran?<eos> Kiran, do you have the bag?<eos> Baba found it.<eos> Kiran, can I...?<eos> I need the bag, please.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Kiran, tell me.<eos> He destroyed it.
I'm her London Bureau Chief.<eos> Let me go, please.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Please!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Hold on.<eos> No, I thought I heard somebody.<eos> Listen, Aayan.<eos> You are part of an important story.<eos> I want to be the one to tell it.
Plus, it's like, we already got the greatest kid in the world.<eos> I guess we just enjoy being parents to Hope and wait until the time is right.<eos> Yeah, and, you know, like, I'm not not into practicing as much as we possibly can until that time comes.<eos> So, do you want to go to the pharmacy and not not pick up condoms?<eos> I don't not not want to do that.<eos> You guys are not not grossing me out.<eos> Barney didn't get his pants on the Wall Of Excellence, but he did find a place for them where they could do some good.<eos> Even though Barney lied to us, I'm still glad we went to Handles.<eos> Me, too.<eos> The detox was hard, but now that we're past it, I'm really glad we're making smarter food choices.
Oh, yeah.His face was plastered on bus benches all over the Island, right?<eos> "When you're ready to buy, call Guy.<eos> I'll be there to welcome you home".<eos> In this case, literally.<eos> Fingerprints confirm our victim is indeed Guy Ingram.<eos> 44 years old, single.<eos> He moved here two years ago from the mainland.<eos> His relatives in Cleveland have been notified.<eos> The bullet that killed him was a .22 caliber round shot in close proximity.<eos> I already sent it to Ballistics.
I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, I was doing a little digging on the chain of custody of our missing weapon.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Well, I'll tell you where it's not.<eos> Melted into scrap metal, which is what was supposed to happen seven months ago when the prosecuting attorney's office put through the order.<eos> Duke had no idea because the P.A.'s office misfiled the paperwork.<eos> Okay, so somewhere between the evidence room and the metalworks, that .22 just disappeared.<eos> And whoever got their hands on it killed Guy Ingram.
What does it fix if I turn off that machine?<eos> You've got a lot of healing to do, and we can't start wrestling with the real issues until you say good-bye.<eos> I don't know if I'm ready for that.<eos> Is it because you're afraid you'll never get the answers you need?<eos> It's because it's my fault.<eos> That's what he told me in the note.<eos> You told everyone he didn't leave a note.<eos> The police...<eos> Me.<eos> Oh, well, he didn't leave it for you.
You weren't born Paul Curtis, were you...<eos> - Oliver? - Hmm.<eos> When I got saved, I decided to take a name from the Bible.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Was my husband making sense when he wrote you that check?<eos> Don't... don't answer that.<eos> I don't want you to worry about that.<eos> I want you to keep that money.<eos> Just pretend you won the lottery, except this prize, it comes with a string, and if you don't stay the hell away from my husband,<eos> I will pull that string, and I will use it... To strangle you.
Good morning.<eos> Frankly, Mr. Gallagher, your son's behavior has been among the most egregious I've seen at this school. And I've been here a long time.<eos> Don't look a day over 90.<eos> He terrorizes these students to the point that they move through my halls in fear.<eos> School should not be a palace of terror.<eos> It should be a temple of learning.<eos> If children do not feel safe, how can they learn?<eos> - They can't.<eos> - She's asking me, Chipwich.<eos> The only way to get through to Carl is have him face the truth of what he's done and let him absorb it in a meaningful way.
Yeah?<eos> More... pills.<eos> - My family lives in there.<eos> - The supermarket?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, 'cause that would suck.<eos> In the van.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Van. We move it twice a day, 'cause if we get towed, we're screwed.
You hated her?<eos> Try spending three days in five different cars with her waiting for a ransom to be delivered.<eos> Yeah, it must have been a real trauma for you, Wayne.<eos> But he was very nice.<eos> He never hurt her.<eos> And he let her go at Fillmore's ice cream shop.<eos> Yeah, like that girl needed any more ice cream.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You weren't the guy that stabbed Fillmore, were you?<eos> Hey, in my defense, I wanted a second taste of cookies and cream and he would not give it to me.
The AC won't turn off no matter what the damn switch says.<eos> "Heat" is cold. "Off" is cold.<eos> Smacking the thing with a hammer-- even more cold.<eos> - Maybe you should call Darrin.<eos> - I did.<eos> He'll be here sometime Friday between 8:00 and 5:00.<eos> Oh, the long window.<eos> I bet that's the first thing they teach him.<eos> How are you doing, Sue?<eos> There was a cousin clothes box out front, and Brick hid it in the laundry room!
He lied.<eos> He's a criminal.<eos> You know, maybe you should've run his name through your computer before you told us he was out of the system.<eos> - Clean it up.<eos> - And if I say no?<eos> Well, then we will throw you to your own people for stealing a gun out of evidence.<eos> You can't prove it.<eos> No?<eos> You took a gun from evidence.<eos> You handed it to me.
I was alone.<eos> I went to the "N" train. The street was quiet, but then I heard two men behind me laughing.<eos> I thought I was being paranoid.<eos> When you're a Muslim woman in a hijab, sometimes people make fun of you.<eos> Okay, what happened next?<eos> I slowed down so they'd pass me by.<eos> But they grabbed me, pulled me over the stone wall and into the Park.<eos> Okay, well, did you scream?<eos> Cry for help?<eos> I tried. But they tore my hijab, held it over my mouth.
Elias slapped me and told me to shut up.<eos> Then they forced me on my hands and knees.<eos> And between the two of them, they took turns sodomizing me and raping me.<eos> I am sorry to ask, but the medical report shows that you were a virgin when this occurred.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was very painful.<eos> They just laughed and high-fived each other.<eos> When they were done, I... I asked Elias if I could have my hijab back.<eos> So he... he wiped himself off with it and threw it in the trash.
Oh, my God!<eos> Playing possum, the one thing that absolutely everyone knows possums do.<eos> Ha, ha! I got you!<eos> I was playing possum on you by pretending --<eos> Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Don't even.<eos> No, my God.<eos> Mom's not even here until 5:00.<eos> And you ate our only power bar.<eos> Well, that's probably what attracted it!
Dan?<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> It's your anniversary!<eos> Go home!<eos> Oh, god.<eos> This isn't happening.<eos> No, no.<eos> She's -- she's crazy.<eos> I mean, I saw her attack the vending machine.<eos> That's the only way it works since Dennis broke it.
Beckett?<eos> Just like the one Anita drew.<eos> Dwight, what does that symbol mean? I...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know. It's just been stuck in my head lately.<eos> But what difference does that make?<eos> - I... I shot a guy!<eos> - We know. Now, can you take a close look at these pictures and tell me if you recognize that man?<eos> No, but the van looks familiar.<eos> You've seen it before? Where?
- Um, the jacket with the roses.<eos> The cool Fiorucci one?<eos> Have fun, then.<eos> - Okay.<eos> See you tomorrow at school.<eos> - See you then.<eos> Bye, Ist.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Lucrezia, have you seen my jacket?<eos> I'm wearing it, it's my colour.
Is your mother home?<eos> Mum!<eos> Mum, it's for you!<eos> A registered letter, miss.<eos> Addressed to you and Mr. Guido Bernadotte, do you accept?<eos> Sign here, please.<eos> Thank you, have a nice day.<eos> You're under arrest, Miss.<eos> In this letter from a one Manuel Ginori in Bolivia, there's cocaine.<eos> The dogs sniffed it out.

In this letter from a one Manuel Ginori in Bolivia, there's cocaine.<eos> The dogs sniffed it out.<eos> Follow us.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Who sent it?<eos> Who's this Ginori?<eos> What do you mean, who's Ginori?<eos> You signed for the letter.<eos> Why, when a letter shows up do you send it back?<eos> They sent it to Bernadotte, too, who's not my partner anymore.
Yvonne, you can't send her to a boarding school. What do you mean?<eos> What does her father say?<eos> She's your daughter, how can you be so heartless?<eos> She's nine years old!<eos> It's not what she did to you, it's what you've done to her!<eos> I told you, you'll walk again.<eos> You're already getting better.<eos> I'm not afraid of dying, you know.<eos> My mum is dead, too.<eos> Get rid of the curtain, I don't want it.
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> When we face our deepest fears, our true courage comes out.<eos> When you used the hilt of your sword to vanquish your fears...<eos> - She took it.
That's not necessarily a gift.<eos> He's been through a lot of tough stuff.<eos> And some good stuff.<eos> Either way, it's our best bet.<eos> She's right.<eos> I know.<eos> Let's find it.<eos> A rose.<eos> How lovely.<eos> Have you earned it?
Everything.<eos> How did Zelena cast the curse?<eos> She didn't, Emma.<eos> We did.<eos> You cursed yourselves?<eos> Zelena's weakness is light magic.<eos> I mean, it's clear now, more than ever, you are the only one who can defeat her.<eos> That's why we paid the price of Regina's curse... to find you.<eos> The price of the curse is the heart of the thing you love most.<eos> If one of you cast it... how are you both still here?
Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Ow. What kind of person says they're in love with someone they barely know?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It just slipped out.<eos> Look, I just got out of a marriage.<eos> The word "love" is confusing to me right now.<eos> It's scary, terrifying.<eos> It's a horrible, horrible word.<eos> I'll never use it again.
Wait, Anna, Anna.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> Tell me, what did she say?<eos> Did she mention me?<eos> What does it matter?<eos> Nothing matters, right?<eos> I don't even know who you are anymore.<eos> Look, everything I do puts me right back on my arse.<eos> I have no idea if my letter got to Ben or if he got it to Washington or if any of it meant a damn thing.
What have we got here?<eos> Pretty woman.<eos> Plenty of room to stretch out. Didn't help her any.<eos> No purse, no I.D., but she is wearing a concert wristband.<eos> You think that's important?<eos> Maybe.<eos> According to Sunburst Limo, the owner of this ridiculous 24-seater, a rock band rented it last night.
So, maybe our pretty woman's a fan.<eos> Who's the band?<eos> Limo company said they didn't get a name.<eos> Band paid cash.<eos> Owner said they were flying under the radar.<eos> The driver?<eos> At Desert Palm Hospital getting his stomach pumped.<eos> Alcohol poisoning, maybe from partying with the band.<eos> All we got out of him was that the band stole this limo when he wasn't looking.<eos> He pinged it, found it parked in an alley, tried to drive it back.
Although, if she was a working girl, it was probably one-sided.<eos> Torn up pieces of paper in his wallet.<eos> Must've meant something to him.<eos> That looks like a lyric sheet, handwritten.<eos> "'Long Road Home,' A song by Lex Young."<eos> He scribbled a dedication underneath.<eos> "For Tangerine."<eos> I doubt Mr. Young tore up his own song.<eos> It's bad for him, good for us.<eos> Yeah, 'cause if Tangerine tore it up, that means she touched it.
But you were determined to get revenge, and you did.<eos> - You're a lunatic.<eos> - Faking me out...<eos> This is insubordination!<eos> ...right under my nose.<eos> If you need anything further, call any time.<eos> I'll leave you my card.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Then, faking out the entire precinct.<eos> You took Deedee's sample from me and switched it with your own, knowing it would test positive for mercury.
- Lester. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I need a location.<eos> Okay...<eos> He took... he took my car.<eos> They called me, told me it was impounded in Duluth.<eos> So he's probably...<eos> I got a picture...<eos> There's a picture of him.<eos> Picture of him up here.<eos> Law enforcement, he had it.
You look so like your mother.<eos> It's uncanny.<eos> - Don't you think?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So, Orianne. What is going on?<eos> Nikola found our night watchman dead at home.<eos> Do you have an explanation for me?<eos> An explanation for what?<eos> You should know what your workers are up to.<eos> Vibert was already in the company when we bought it.
You're not just a simple fraudster, are you, Atom?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Your boss is dead.<eos> His son Levani Jordania was shot at in his car today.<eos> lossif Vissarionovitch was not my boss.<eos> He was like a father to me, and to all of us.<eos> As for Jordania that's an occupational hazard.<eos> You don't seem very close to him.<eos> Yet you gave him the coke I intercepted for you.<eos> You didn't intercept it for me, but to pay for Bambesi's delivery. Remember?
I'm not talking money, you idiot.<eos> I'm talking about your life. - Our life, us!<eos> - There can't be an "us".<eos> It's impossible.<eos> You have to understand that.<eos> As for the war, I'll be okay.<eos> If there can be no "us", why should I care what becomes of you?<eos> First you request a transfer for Vanderbeke to the VIP wing and now you want a surveillance van and a phone tap.<eos> A transfer for Vanderbeke? Yes...<eos> Lieutenant Delgado submitted it in your name.
Why would he come looking for us?<eos> That's where you come into it, Atom Paradjanov.<eos> You're going to kidnap Salomé and her son.<eos> Vor v zakones do no attack the family of another vor.<eos> The end justifies the means, Atom.<eos> If you keep your word, you'll prove your loyalty.<eos> Unreservedly.<eos> - It will be done.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> In Russian, we say. If you've given your word, you keep it.

Stop reminiscing about what you didn't do.<eos> You need to start thinking about what you're gonna do now. Well, as long as you're here,<eos> I suggest you stay away from the windows.<eos> The fewer people who know you're here, the better. Oh... shh, shh, shh. How'd you get here, anyway?<eos> In a plane.<eos> No, I don't mean Portland.<eos> I mean here, my place.<eos> In a truck.<eos> Where did you get a truck?<eos> Nick's mom stole it when we landed.
Nick, you gotta tell me, is this safe?<eos> It's pretty safe. It's not perfect, but it'll do.<eos> You know, under different circumstances, we might have killed each other.<eos> You tried to kill my sister.<eos> She was a Grimm.<eos> And she had a key.<eos> Now, if I had known then what I know now, might have approached things a little differently.<eos> But you got the key.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Nick says you gave it back.
It's their turn.<eos> We have to decide now.<eos> We can cancel the performance today.<eos> We should go to the hospital first.<eos> Let's get to the hospital!<eos> I have to settle some things here first.<eos> I'll follow after.<eos> We have to sing.<eos> We... have to sing without him.<eos> The song written by Ji Ha.. We're going to sing it loud so that he'd hear it also.
I'll follow after.<eos> We have to sing.<eos> We... have to sing without him.<eos> The song written by Ji Ha.. We're going to sing it loud so that he'd hear it also.<eos> After that we'll ask him if we sang it well.<eos> "Everyone loved your song"<eos> Ji Ha...<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> There are so many people right now waiting for us to sing your song.<eos> You made this song, and I will sing it with all my heart.
Now, do you know where your brother was last night?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Him and Rick went out drinking.<eos> - Anyone else with them?<eos> - Not that I know.<eos> Do you know where your brother's truck is?<eos> A 2004 Chevy Silverado...<eos> I know what it is.<eos> It's not here.<eos> He drove it last night.
Dinner here?<eos> I know, it felt like the right thing to do.<eos> You know?<eos> Smooth things over.<eos> Well, do you think this idea could really compromise what you've done?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you have to do whatever you can to change his mind.<eos> Even if that means inviting him into our home.<eos> It's your machine, Gordon.<eos> Don't let him ruin it.
I don't know what these researchers did, but...<eos> Or it could be what William Boudreaux said.<eos> It could be the Curse of the Blackbriar Swamp.<eos> God knows this swamp has taken enough out of our family.<eos> Carly, we'll find our boy.<eos> We'll find Chris.<eos> We gotta get rid of these things, and we gotta make a run for it.<eos> All right, I'll take some of the dynamite with us, and you take the flare gun.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -Keep it in the bag, all right?
I'm just here to see your mom.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why, you want to do her?<eos> Yeah, loser, you gonna-- Wait.<eos> He's not really gonna have sex with our ma, is he?<eos> He better not.<eos> Nobody's--<eos> Goddamn it, get off the guy.<eos> And quit shooting up the lawn sign.<eos> Never gonna sell this place, you keep filling it with arrows.
What's this then?<eos> - Our suspect.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Security camera caught him kidnapping' the naked fella.<eos> - Kidnapped him naked?<eos> - No, dressed.<eos> Phil McCormick.<eos> Our perp cut his clothes off in the parking garage.<eos> No kiddin'.<eos> Yeah, so here's the thing, I took the photo and I showed it to Lester.
He said he found the body at about 7am this morning.<eos> He shot himself in the chest and the gun's on the floor where he dropped it. Is there a note?<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> "..the shame I brought to my office, to my family,<eos> "the only honourable action I can take is to end my life."<eos> His handwriting?<eos> Looks that way.<eos> And this is the gun?<eos> Interesting - the serial number's been filed off, this is an illegal gun.<eos> I wonder where he got it from?
Who are Burwick Trading?<eos> They're a local company with no apparent income, no head office, no staff - but they do have one owner.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Jacob Doran - our recently-deceased Minister for Commerce.<eos> It looks like he's been illegally importing goods from South Africa.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Great work, guys.<eos> What's he importing?<eos> We don't know, sir, but the next delivery to Burwick Trading arrives in port today.<eos> And when we impound it, we'll finally find out what this case is really all about.
Whoa. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.<eos> - It's just scrap metal.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm talking about this mace.<eos> Whoa. Hey, mace. You wanna come home with me, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do, Tuffnut.<eos> I want to needlessly destroy other people's property with you.<eos> Oh, Macey.<eos> You get me.<eos> I see you are a gentleman that recognizes quality when he sees it.
No one cares.<eos> The universe is infinite and chaotic and cold.<eos> And there has never been a plan.<eos> At least not till now.<eos> You wanna know what the plan was the day they died?<eos> The plan was for someone to make $15 million.<eos> An executive at a big bank wanted them dead, so he wired the money to someone with the skills, resources, and moral depravity to make that happen.<eos> And that someone was me.<eos> And the punch line is that your machine keeps telling me to save Cyrus.<eos> How badly did you have to break it to make it care about people so much?
Little suckers went looking for a new host.<eos> And found us.<eos> Which is why these operations are usually done in a lab in a controlled environment.<eos> My memories... did they go anywhere?<eos> No.<eos> They weren't recorded.<eos> - What about...<eos> - The one in my head?<eos> I dug it out.<eos> And destroyed it.
Beautiful.<eos> I can't do this, but I know that I have to.<eos> You should see the stuff the doctor has given to try and keep me calm.<eos> Oh, it's great gear, but... useless.<eos> Jess, I think Paul is around.<eos> I went to his mate's place.<eos> You saw him?<eos> No, but the bike was tucked away well out of sight.<eos> The bike isn't enough.<eos> Ariel Baxter could say that they've been riding it.
- No, Sebastian.<eos> Alone.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Something wrong, sir?<eos> I received an anonymous correspondence.<eos> About?<eos> Type "ICC scandal" into your computer.<eos> The story just broke.<eos> We've traced it back to a source within the Italian Police Services.
And where was her laptop kept?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It wasn't...<eos> Did she know someone who would threaten to make those videos public?<eos> - Your...<eos> The other cop, is she...<eos> She is not telling Amélie's mother any of this.<eos> God knows she's had a rough enough time.<eos> I'm going to take that laptop.<eos> We'll have someone analyze it.
My parents, they made him go all the way to Germany for summer camp.<eos> He was alone in a strange country, and all he wanted was to be their friend.<eos> They were the popular kids there, and they let him think that they liked him, they let him hang out with them.<eos> He was a fat, pimply-faced boy who never had any friends, and they made him feel like he was special that summer.<eos> Amélie even pretended to be into him romantically, and he actually believed her.<eos> He sent letters home that summer, about how he had fallen in love.<eos> In love!<eos> She played him perfectly.<eos> She even let him hold her hand, and they took pictures of that, a pathetic nobody holding the hand of the prettiest girl he had ever seen, and that's where Stefan came in, the worst of them all.<eos> Peter couldn't see her face when the picture was taken, but he did later, when Stefan posted it all over the internet, his naked body displayed for the joke.
Maybe to cause its holder to betray his deepest loyalties.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I may have heard of a coin like that.<eos> Then elaborate, please.<eos> Slow down, Shakespeare.<eos> My information's not for free.<eos> We're not paying for it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, how about you guys take me along, then?<eos> I help you find this coin, keep it for my troubles, everybody wins.
So, maybe by tarnishing souls,<eos> Henry's trying to build his own empire here.<eos> One soldier at a time.<eos> David!<eos> Did you get the McNeal order filled?<eos> _<eos> Hello Sleepy Hollow.<eos> Time to wake up.<eos> I fear the flower shop bombing was also the work of the Tyrian shekel.<eos> The gentleman who carried it out, is he in custody?
Mr. Crane.<eos> I really do believe I was clear... stay away from police work.<eos> Sheriff Reyes, I have tried to cooperate, but this country was founded by men who fought for nothing if not individual liberty, forged by the blood of men who refused to bow to a tyrant's will.<eos> And as I stand in this public house of law and order, built to defend that very liberty, I declare... I'm well within my rights to be here.<eos> Do you?<eos> Because I can't find any records you even exist.<eos> And as the person responsible for the safety, and therefore liberty, of this town, that's a problem.<eos> Well, that's one that's easily solved.<eos> My identification is at home.<eos> I'll provide it when next we meet.
After Benedict Arnold's treason and his escape from capture, he fought for the British for another year.<eos> We encountered one another a final time... old friends, now on opposite sides of the battle.<eos> I knew, in one look... that if he could turn back the pages to a time before the seeds of his darkness had taken hold, and everything he loved was lost to him, he would have made that choice in a heartbeat.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Ow! Hey, hey!<eos> Whoa. No need for that.<eos> - Looking for you guys.<eos> - Where's the coin you stole?<eos> Have you sold it already?
Yo, Pride and Prejudice, you mind not touching anything in there?<eos> Some of it goes boom.<eos> It was dark out, so I didn't really get a good look at him, but yeah, he took that kid.<eos> I was out on a job when I saw the girl, and then he attacked me.<eos> He's pretty fast with a knife.<eos> Assuming money's the reason you're out here, did the Lancasters hire you to find Miss Sara?<eos> I'm searching for a flute.<eos> It's made of bone.<eos> Hollow, covered in holes.<eos> Maybe you've seen it?
- before he kills them.<eos> - Yeah, they die of exposure or starvation.<eos> It's not really a fairy tale ending.<eos> It's been less than 36 hours.<eos> We still have a shot at saving Sara, but we don't know enough about what we're facing.<eos> So we need all the help we can get. Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.<eos> Just be careful with that thing, okay?<eos> Wrap it in a soft cloth or something.<eos> Lieutenant, need I remind you that this man stole the Judas coin from our very grasp.<eos> I think you mean I'm keeping it safe.
- Okay.<eos> Even through all that pain, she kept fighting.<eos> And left you a fitting legacy.<eos> Jenny...<eos> Forgot how beautiful she was.<eos> Captain.<eos> Frank, what are you doing out here?<eos> Police call it "escaping."<eos> Whatever happened back there with your mom gave me an opportunity.<eos> I took it.
You'll see them again.<eos> And we're gonna find a way to reclaim your soul, but first, we have to get you to safety.<eos> You really think anywhere is safe anymore?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have to.<eos> As far as I can tell, Irving and Jenny are still okay for now.<eos> You find anything here?<eos> In the Book of Enoch, there is the legend of Methuselah.<eos> He was given a sword with the power to kill any being on Earth.<eos> He used it to take down a thousand demons.
!<eos> She tripped on a root and she fell, and she must have hit her head on the way down, because...<eos> Then she was just gone.<eos> No, Mary, no.<eos> She never left.<eos> She died here.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> A tragedy that cost her life.<eos> And the letter?<eos> You wrote it, didn't you?
He's got the only lighting system in town!<eos> He's the only one who understands the light board!<eos> We have to get Tom Long!<eos> We have to find Tom Long!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I disagree.<eos> I think my life is very complete.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Well, that's odd because you spent the entire weekend listening to Don Todd's biography on tape, after the previous weekend in which you read it to yourself.<eos> Well, it is a different story when the man himself reads it to you.
Oh, sorry, honeybun!<eos> I didn't mean to hit it so far.<eos> Now you'll have to get it.<eos> It's no big deal... - Ow, ow...<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> Boy, does that hurt!<eos> I sprained a mandible or twisted an antenna...<eos> Legs... paralyzed!<eos> Oh, you've gotta get that acorn!<eos> But... you shot it really far out there.
Boy, does that hurt!<eos> I sprained a mandible or twisted an antenna...<eos> Legs... paralyzed!<eos> Oh, you've gotta get that acorn!<eos> But... you shot it really far out there.<eos> You! Valiant friend!<eos> Don't abandon us. You're our only hope.<eos> We can play with something else.<eos> Never! It came from my great-grandmother!<eos> Didn't you say you found it in the forest?
I was afraid that you'd think I was caring too much.<eos> No, I think you're being a good friend.<eos> Uh, you have a picture of this girl, right?<eos> Off that site?<eos> Yeah, miss deep thoughts.<eos> (Laughs) Well, you can do a reverse image search.<eos> See if her photo pops up anywhere else.<eos> - A reverse what?<eos> - A reverse image search.<eos> I used it once when I met this girl on spring break in Mazatlan.
We're gonna get you out of this lease, you move back in with us.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine, okay?<eos> Okay, now find her picture. (Beeps) (Cellphone chimes)<eos> Ha! I'm not gonna be blackballed.<eos> - Thank God. - Ohh.<eos> Honestly, I was a little worried.<eos> A bunch of the guys in my pledge class kind of freaked out about the whole thing.<eos> And I was afraid if they took a vote, it'd be close.<eos> What, seriously?<eos> Here, now you take her picture... and you drag it.
Hey, wa-- Sarah, wait.<eos> Don't cry no matter what happens in there.<eos> Just don't--don't cry, 'cause... The work that you did... Was phenomenal.<eos> You should be proud of it.<eos> I'm proud of you. So, no matter what happens, just know that.<eos> d I don't know who to blame d d I don't know if it's all the same d d but I think you love me too d d 'cause you say that you do d Don't even think about putting that guitar down.<eos> You're embarrassing.<eos> Drew, you have to play me that song right now.<eos> - I'm not playing you anything.<eos> - It's been in my head ever since I heard it the other day.
- Buy you some time.<eos> Well, I guess I should say thank you, but I take it you had a gun to your head.<eos> So I bought us both time, sue me.<eos> The point is I suggested they<eos> - get a hotel while I track down Darryl Crowe.<eos> - You need my help.<eos> - Speed up the process.<eos> - So, let me get this straight.<eos> You take me off the hook.<eos> Then you call me up, and you put me right back on it.
- soft... I'm set free of my anger.<eos> - Uh, okay!<eos> I ain't gonna lie to you.<eos> Dewey Crowe's future ain't what it once was.<eos> - I'm leaving.<eos> - Again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I'm here for my necklace and my turtle dog.<eos> Oh. The ... the turtle thing?<eos> I think I have it. Where do I have it?
- Oh, second time that's happened.<eos> I meant to get it fixed.<eos> - Is this genuine?<eos> - Some of them are.<eos> Hey, you don't think...<eos> - Well, we'll see.<eos> - You have to hit it directly in the heart.<eos> - My dad said these would look after me.<eos> - If that works, I'll eat my head.<eos> - Well, if it doesn't work, the skin-walker will eat it for you.
Hand me that shotgun.<eos> Marie?<eos> - Jesus, Wade what happened to your neck?<eos> - We're gonna all be having them tonight.<eos> Ain't over yet.<eos> - Return to hell.<eos> Bastard's dead but it won't lie down.<eos> - Try this.<eos> - White ash?<eos> - You seen it before?
I already have, Ashley's on her way up.<eos> OK.<eos> Oh, uh, one last thing.<eos> Who copped to the affair?<eos> Was that Samantha or Ashley?<eos> Neither.<eos> Neither of them... confessed.<eos> So how'd you guys figure that out?<eos> Well through a series of deductions, face reading, uh, body language.<eos> Look, I... I'm still struggling to understand your technique here so I'm wondering if you'd just walk me through it.
I go, "So what happened, Frankie?<eos> "So they broke into my locker at school, and they took my iPhone,<eos> "they took my friend's iPhone,<eos> "and if we go to the school right now, we can fill out a report.<eos> "We know exactly who did it.<eos> Can we go to the school right now?"<eos> I go, "Listen, Frankie, I'd love to, "but I'm really tired. I just got off a flight<eos> "and, you know, I'm really, really tired.<eos> "I promise you tomorrow morning, I'll take you early.<eos> "I'll help you fill out the report and we'll turn it in."
"You can sit on the right.<eos> Oh, my God!"<eos> So the date was set eight months later, and unfortunately for me, - my mom died before I got that opportunity. - Aw!<eos> The only bright side to the picture, is that I got a photo from my brother...<eos> It's a black-and-white picture, 8x10.<eos> It's a picture of my mom and my dad the night they met at a bar in Tijuana when my dad was performing.<eos> It's a picture of him in his mariachi outfit, right?<eos> And he's got the microphone, and my mom is sitting front row center with a white miniskirt on.<eos> And she's got her hand like this, and she's looking at my dad, and she has this look on her face like, "We're going to make a Fluffy."<eos> I never framed it.

Get in here." "Why is my mom crying?"<eos> "I'm going to tell you why your mom's crying.<eos> Have a seat."<eos> "I'm in trouble, huh?" "Frankie, you're not in trouble."<eos> "I didn't do it. "Whatever it is, you did it.<eos> Sit down."<eos> So he sits down.<eos> I got these office chairs with the little wheels, right?<eos> And so I sit down.<eos> He sits in front of me, and I sit his mom down next to me, and I grab his chair, and I pull it right up to mine.
They don't have the stake.<eos> Well, then who the hell does?<eos> Tonight, it doesn't matter.<eos> Because tonight we're going on a wolf hunt.<eos> We have the Guerreras where we want them, we have them waiting, we have them worried, and now we know they're an army with no defenses against an original.<eos> We don't know that for certain.<eos> I'm willing to gamble.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> The stake didn't just disappear.<eos> Someone has it.
Uh, thank you all--ahem, excuse me, thank you for coming.<eos> Five months ago, this city was under siege.<eos> And the SCPD rallied behind a man in a hood.<eos> Well, I ended up with a captain's rank, and he didn't even get a thank you.<eos> But today, he does.<eos> 'Cause today, the Starling City police department is formally recognizing the individual known as the Arrow.<eos> And I'm using my new position to disband the anti-vigilante task force charged with capturing him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now make no mistake-- vigilantism will never be tolerated.<eos> But I refuse to hunt, in the name of this city, the hero who saved it.
"Whoa"?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> What's it look like?<eos> In my bed?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Jerk.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Get a room, you two.<eos> Had a room till you two soiled it.
Oh, I see! So, the customer appreciates quality disease-free products.<eos> You know what that reminds me of:<eos> Prohibition, slowly Jack up the prices.<eos> This is food, man! You can go without whiskey.<eos> You cannot go without your bread.<eos> That's a good point! You know what occurred to me?<eos> This disease, this virus is what makes us kings.<eos> That is pure profiteering.<eos> Where is your conscience?<eos> - I think I left it inside.
And that woman that you drew from?<eos> You almost killed her!<eos> How's your back, Nora?<eos> It's been, what, like, 5, 6 months since the surgery?<eos> Head nurse strung out on pain pills.<eos> It's not exactly protocol, is it?<eos> You really ought to take better care of yourself.<eos> I know Lynette worries.<eos> Don't talk about my mother! Oops! One of the nurses found our blood.<eos> She put it in the bank.
Aidan, shut up!<eos> I'm gonna replace your stash.<eos> By tomorrow, I will have all of the blood, plus a little extra.<eos> Nobody else was slow this week.<eos> Marcus, no one's talking to you!<eos> Wipe that grin off your face!<eos> You look like the kid about to eat everyone at Christmas.<eos> Wipe it off! Ok, so let me get this straight.<eos> You were giving away blood at your place for me...<eos> Well, I didn't exactly give it... (Aidan grunting)
- Oh my g-- - open this door!<eos> - There's gotta be some way we can snap him out of this!<eos> It's aidan! - He's in some kind of trance!<eos> - I think it's what kenny did.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> - Open this door!<eos> - He's gonna break down the goddamn door!<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> - No, I sealed it for now.
- There's gotta be some way we can snap him out of this!<eos> It's aidan! - He's in some kind of trance!<eos> - I think it's what kenny did.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> - Open this door!<eos> - He's gonna break down the goddamn door!<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> - No, I sealed it for now.<eos> I sealed it, but, josh, he's not gonna stop until he kills you.
Because vampires don't get doors.<eos> No happy endings for us!<eos> I am afraid to die!<eos> - You're not a vampire anymore.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> Listen to what you're saying!<eos> You really think that a blip of humanity Is gonna wipe the slate clean after centuries of monstrosity?<eos> No!<eos> So I saw my chance, and I took it!
Looks like it came into the account the day before at 8:34 in the morning. And then Hector transferred it out.<eos> A secret $25-million transfer that got him killed.<eos> What the hell was Cordero into?<eos> All right.<eos> - Any luck?<eos> - No. I just talked to the head of Suisse Federal Bank.<eos> Given international banking regulations, there's no way to tell where that money came from or where it went.<eos> Or if the money is even Cordero's.<eos> He could've been moving it for someone else.<eos> Sir, if this transaction was somehow responsible for Cordero's death and we can't track it, then we may never be able to find his killer.
We need to find Armando Garcia.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, it's a pretty common name.<eos> There are hundreds of Armando Garcias in the US alone.<eos> It's gonna be hard to narrow it down.<eos> Unless we can find out who he was calling.<eos> At 9:25, Peter would've been at work.<eos> He would've made those phone calls from his desk phone.<eos> If we can get those phone records, they could tell us what he was involved in.<eos> I'll put in for a warrant.<eos> Hopefully we'll get it by morning.
Fine, I did. I made a mistake.<eos> You know, I didn't call you to argue.<eos> We gotta figure out what we're gonna do about our daughter.<eos> The therapy isn't working and I don't know what else to do.<eos> When she came over, she had this spooky-looking doll with her.<eos> Yeah, and she won't go anywhere without it.<eos> She happened to mention that Kathy brought her a new one?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> She brought her a new doll.<eos> I found it underneath her bed torn apart.
Okay, assuming that it does work, and this doll can transfer the child's worries to itself, could it work the other way around?<eos> I mean, could the doll transfer something to the child?<eos> Look, Alyson, if your daughter's having issues,<eos> I'm really not the right person.<eos> Okay, just look at something.<eos> This happened the other night.<eos> I picked it up. I was trying to get rid of it, and now Claire has a bruise in the exact same place on her arm.<eos> - It's not a voodoo doll.<eos> - I know it's not.<eos> But I took this doll that night and put it in a Dumpster, and the very next morning, it was back.
Just keep it up front for me, okay?<eos> Sure.<eos> And there's another thing.<eos> It's about Zachary Orcutt.<eos> That's a lot of blood.<eos> Yeah, looks like our victim was killed up here, then dragged down to the desk.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, but Professor Carranza was a friend of mine, and I'm wondering if anyone has found a doll.<eos> A doll?<eos> Yeah, I came by, I dropped it off with her yesterday.
- Are we too late?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> But I don't think we have much time either.<eos> Well, how about if we get her to a doctor?<eos> There's gotta be someone who could do something.<eos> It's very important that we handle this in a specific way.<eos> So it is possible to break the bond. I don't know.<eos> I thought if we got your daughter far away that it would free her, but I was wrong.<eos> The doll still has a hold on her.<eos> Then I'll destroy it.

Does she have any idea why her son might do something like this?<eos> No.<eos> She talked to Brass.<eos> She's still in shock.<eos> Said she doesn't even own a gun.<eos> Has no clue how her son would be able to get his hands on an arsenal like this.<eos> Who's processing their house?<eos> Morgan.<eos> And she also told Brass that the kid used the family van.<eos> Patrol found it a couple of blocks from here.
- I didn't set this new course.<eos> I swear!<eos> - Don't lie to me! The plane just turned around for God's sakes!<eos> How is this happening then?<eos> HQ can override automated control of the avionics. Take us anywhere they want.<eos> Let me check the instrument panel - and I'll be able to... - No way!<eos> You're not going anywhere till you explain what...<eos> It's not me!<eos> Why did you have an encrypted hardline?<eos> And tried to shoot me when we found it!
Seriously.<eos> You were...this small..<eos> Keep this jacket.<eos> This is your jacket.<eos> Wear it and go to the church.<eos> Wear it, it's a nice color.<eos> It'll suit you.<eos> Yes, it will suit me.<eos> Everything suits me, but you wear it.<eos> I said wear it, now wear it.
All two pages of it.<eos> I told you, Eli, I could only report on what I could clearly confirm.<eos> You're hurting Peter with these games.<eos> This is not a game, Eli.<eos> You stonewalled me.<eos> - I can't write a report...<eos> - Peter needs you to clear him.<eos> Jim Moody acted alone.<eos> That's what you heard.<eos> Peter never saw this tape until you showed it to him.
Well, when Mr. Bishop was here last week, um, who was in the meeting?<eos> No.<eos> We've reviewed our memories, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> We only mentioned Mr. Bishop's February 26 location once,<eos> - and that was in the meeting with your firm.<eos> - No.<eos> It had to have been someone else, someone from your crew.<eos> (chuckling): No.<eos> Mr. Bishop kept his location private.<eos> But he did share it with your firm in case there was trouble.
The shock of your recent bereavement means that I will ignore that comment.<eos> The Blighty ticket.<eos> Of course I kept it.<eos> Why would I get rid of something so invaluably damning?<eos> And now I give it to you... ..as a lesson in the true value and meaning of loyalty.<eos> Colonel Brett is very lucky to have you.<eos> And you're very lucky to have me.<eos> I meant what I said.<eos> I will not challenge you again.<eos> I want my share when you sell it.
Guns everywhere.<eos> I spent my childhood... ..unloading his guns and trying to hide the bullets from him.<eos> Of course, the inevitable happened... ..and I spent a long time blaming myself for his death.<eos> So, you feel compelled to save everybody else.<eos> Was it your father in the regiment?<eos> No.<eos> Are you ready now?<eos> I don't even know which direction I'm facing.<eos> You know, I still think you have a question for me.<eos> If you do, you need to ask it now.
We're building a weapon.<eos> It's not like any weapon the world's ever seen.<eos> It draws its energy from a fast-neutron chain reaction.<eos> It releases the power of an ancient star.<eos> If it works, and it's going to work, it'll be more destructive than all the bombs dropped in all the wars in history put together.<eos> It'll bring armies to their knees.<eos> Cities will disappear in the blink of an eye.<eos> The world will be united in peace by the most just and noble country in the history of mankind.<eos> Or it will burn to the ground.<eos> Whoever builds it first, that's the endgame.
This is probably what Liber8 was after.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No.<eos> But we'll figure it out.<eos> I don't recognize it from 2077.<eos> It did a real number on my gear, and my CMR is still glitching.<eos> This technology could be from a different time line.<eos> Different future.<eos> We'll keep it safe.<eos> Who had it?
We've got a mule out there with a tank full of a neurotoxin!<eos> Just find him!<eos> All right, look.<eos> We know that the guy's got mad tech skills, right?<eos> And in the first call, he thought Gabriel was an athlete.<eos> It often takes one to know one.<eos> Okay, so he was an athlete before he was incapacitated, and he's a technology expert.<eos> That's good.<eos> So what else do we know?<eos> It's not just the technology. It's how he uses it.
Ingest DMT, it's inactivated in the intestine by, uh, by certain enzymes.<eos> So in order to get the DMT to be activated and to be able to be absorbed, they had to combine it with other plants.<eos> HANCOCK: Ayahuasca contains a mixture of two plants.<eos> There's actually quite subtle and sophisticated knowledge of plants goes into the preparation, 'cause these two things separately will not work.<eos> You have to mix them together and let's not forget that there's 150,000 different species of plants and trees in the Amazon.<eos> It's really quite an amazing achievement of ancient chemistry to bring these two plants together to produce a highly psychoactive visionary brew.<eos> NARRATOR: But how did ancient people living in the jungles of<eos> Peru over 3,000 years ago, with tens of thousands of plants to choose from, figure out that combining these two particular plants would produce these powerful visions?<eos> According to the mythology of the Achuar people of the Amazon, their ancestors didn't discover this on their own, but were guided by extraterrestrial beings. HEAVEN:<eos> The shamans communicated with their spirits, and were told to go into the jungle and turn two corners, as the myth goes, and then they would find this plant, and they brought that back to the village, prepared it in the appropriate way. The oral tradition says that ayahuasca is a linkage to the upper world.
Just leave the phone when you're done.<eos> Wait. What is this?<eos> Another test?<eos> Am I being set up?<eos> Let's just say you have a friend.<eos> So tired! Aren't you?<eos> Ugh, exhausted.<eos> Where'd you go earlier?<eos> Oh, I, um, I was so tired, I skipped a test booklet.<eos> They had me take it again.
- Doing what?<eos> - Financing a bunch of rebels.<eos> Well, I'm trying to create change.<eos> To do that, I need the embryos.<eos> What do you want to do with them?<eos> Reshape the future.<eos> Give man a chance to get it right this time around.<eos> If you're gonna take a swing, you might as take a big one, right?<eos> Every invention involves from those that came before and all I try to do is add to that stream of innovation.<eos> This island... I purchased it last year.
It does 70?<eos> 70mph, and if you get all your mates in the back, you can wheelie as well, at 70mph.<eos> Actually, my best friend is a chap called Nin, he's Indian, and he insists on driving to make it look more authentic.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When you're in London, I gather you've now got a bicycle. Yeah.<eos> Why do you have a bicycle?<eos> It's much, much faster and it's good exercise.<eos> You can lose a paunch with a bicycle.<eos> I've got a bicycle, and look what it's done to me. Literally.<eos> You're not supposed to eat it.
What about them?<eos> Have you looked at them?<eos> You have to do something with these.<eos> You're right.<eos> Let me see them.<eos> Even money.<eos> All we can do is try our best to prevent it from spreading.<eos> We'll only be like 15 minutes late.<eos> Oh, we wouldn't be late at all if you just put the key on the hook.<eos> I put it by the door so you would always know where it is.
Look, unspoken rule, people... surgeon stays home, patient suffers, as well as the doctors who have to cover for you.<eos> You don't stay home.<eos> You push through.<eos> All right.<eos> Wilson, pit.<eos> Edwards, neuro.<eos> Murphy, you're with me and Grey.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> If it's an unspoken rule, then why did he just tell us about it?
I think he's dangerous, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> He's supposed to be.<eos> He had two brothers, both of them younger than you, Weston.<eos> Both of them enlisted.<eos> One of them's missing, the other one's dead.<eos> Do you know what the wager I had with Lieutenant Cohen was?<eos> He bet me I couldn't take this rabble and turn it into a team.<eos> I told him he owed me a bottle of whisky.<eos> I can't give it back to him now, so we'd better be damn sure I don't break my bet.
Chas, what are you doing?<eos> You took my photo from him?<eos> It were next to the letter.<eos> What letter?<eos> His letter back to you.<eos> It was like the one I'd written home.<eos> The one that, if I died, I hoped would have been delivered.<eos> Not stuck in the ground with me.<eos> No man wants to think that his last words wouldn't make it home.<eos> So I carried it.

This is all that were left.<eos> Oh, no...<eos> It wasn't...<eos> there was a fire in MY tank.<eos> He wasn't burnt -<eos> I don't know how he died, but he wasn't burnt.<eos> I shouldn't...<eos> I haven't offered you tea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your house isn't as I imagined it.
- I can talk to someone.<eos> - No, they'll just put me in solitary.<eos> I'd kill myself in solitary.<eos> - This is the dorm here.<eos> - Mr. Grant's dorm?<eos> Yes.<eos> And the body was discovered here.<eos> Now, you found that Mr. Grant's card key had logged him in at 7:49 p.m., but the murder didn't happen until 9:15.<eos> - How do you explain this?<eos> - This door here, it's a fire exit, but students keep it propped open with a chair.
- in the fine copy.<eos> - And... I will be taping this interview, also.<eos> Good.<eos> So, then, we're... all ready?<eos> We seem to be.<eos> Okay. Did you discuss your voluntary deposition with anyone before today?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Who?<eos> Eli Gold, my husband, Governor Peter Florrick, and my lawyer, Cary Agos.<eos> Did you discuss it with Will Gardner, too?
There are over 200 in the city alone.<eos> What are you planning on doing with all of them?<eos> Well, it's not what I plan on doing.<eos> It's what you are going to do.<eos> You, Stephen, will lead them all, someday, to a place known as The Refuge.<eos> You must wonder how I lost sight of the horrors happening under my own nose.<eos> Even committing some of them against my own blood.<eos> The answer, Stephen... is this.<eos> The machine.<eos> I thought my father destroyed it.
You get naked in front of her.<eos> Yes, but those are different things.<eos> When you're naked, you're powerful and it's glorious.<eos> When you're changing, you're hunched over and cowering, like an animal.<eos> Animals don't wear clothes, Nick.<eos> All I'm saying is I need my space.<eos> True intimacy.<eos> Embrace that.<eos> Abby and I, we have one sponge.<eos> And we use it for everything.
- Just reading.<eos> - Yeah. You know what I'm gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna sleep with my head over there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, that's...<eos> That's gonna be better for me.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna get some water.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> - My room looks totally different.<eos> Turned it into a workout space.
At this moment, the Agency has no intel.<eos> Another reason why we should have taken care of this in-house.<eos> Our teams are nearly online.<eos> CIA kills Casey because they think he's a traitor.<eos> Northern Lights stays protected.<eos> If Casey would have done his job and we had access to Northern Lights, we could find him in a heartbeat.<eos> Or anyone else, for that matter.<eos> All due respect, ma'am.<eos> We might not be in this situation if we hadn't killed Nathan Ingram.<eos> Who better to provide unfettered access to the source than the man who built it?
I mean, once you start dressing for comfort, before you know it, you'll be eating for pleasure.<eos> I always eat for pleasure.<eos> Well, I haven't done that since the '80s.<eos> I can honestly say I have never met a woman like you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, when you go to Hollywood, you're gonna meet a lot of people like me.<eos> I'd never leave Cleveland.<eos> My memories with my late wife are here.<eos> This movie is my last love letter to her.<eos> That must be why it touched me so when I read it.
Bad enough to bomb his own show?<eos> Hey, Abby. What's...?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> That's great news.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I'll be... I'll be right there.<eos> Okay, thanks. Bye.<eos> So, you may not know this, but...<eos> Tell me on the way.<eos> A fingerprint's ridge-- if you put it on this little plastic box...
I agree. I'm sorry.<eos> It's late I'd better be off.<eos> People gossip a lot in this town.<eos> Please be careful.<eos> I'm begging YOU-<eos> When P, H, and P are well combined, you'll see more than 2 of linear relations.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I want to try it on.<eos> But people don't take off a wedding ring for good.<eos> I saw you taking it off when you did the laundry.
- She was stabbed multiple times in the abdomen.<eos> We'll know more when we get the autopsy results.<eos> - This isn't her car, is it?<eos> - No.<eos> The car belongs to a...<eos> Jason Varden.<eos> No relation to the victim as far as we can tell, but we're still looking for him.<eos> Well, these parking tickets date back a week, so the car must have been here when the body was dumped.<eos> Murder weapon was a broken bottle.<eos> We found it in a trash can.
Hunter.<eos> Yes, you fool.<eos> Have I offended you?<eos> What kind of a fool can't recognize a boar trap?<eos> The embarrassed kind?<eos> If you were such a tracker, didn't you think it strange that there were leaves on a patch of snow surrounded by evergreens?<eos> Who's this then?<eos> Bash, my brother Carrick.<eos> Bash tried to ruin my boar trap.<eos> I would have seen it.
You're right.<eos> But, you know, I wasn't going to go, but then everyone from the department was going.<eos> It would have looked strange if I wasn't there.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't think getting stuck in his trash chute with a piece of fish in your hair looks more strange than not going to a party? Mnh-mnh. How did this happen?<eos> Well, you know, he ignored me all night, which maybe I'm-I'm used to because that's how we are in public.<eos> But after a while, I just... I couldn't take it anymore.<eos> So, I grabbed my coat and made a break for the door, but just as I was about to leave, he called my name, and I stopped because... finally.<eos> But all he did was ask if I'd mind throwing out the trash on my way out.<eos> And I didn't know what to say, so I-I-I took the bag, the big, smelly trash bag, and I tossed it in the chute.
No!<eos> She's got the tattoo.<eos> She's from the Willoughby camp.<eos> You didn't recognize her?<eos> I wasn't looking at her face.<eos> Hey!<eos> What if I told you this is not what it looks like?<eos> You're Sebastian Monroe.<eos> You drop the gun.<eos> I said drop it!
- You don't scare me ! Don't talk to me that way or I'll smash a plate in your face.<eos> If you come with me you won't be able to come back here.<eos> I want to be with you, I don't want to stay here.<eos> Have some more.<eos> Aren't you eating 7<eos> I picked the name Thea for my daughter.<eos> It's the female version of the word "God".<eos> She is technically and spiritually my life...<eos> The figures represent black women doing an African dance.<eos> I ordered it for a Nigerian man, he was murdered.
All right, show yourselves in the name of this book!<eos> D'oh! Oh.<eos> The power of Chrysler compels you!<eos> What are you, cavemen?<eos> Turn on the lights!<eos> Hey!<eos> A little respect!<eos> Take a picture-- it'll last longer, man.<eos> Hey, if you're Homer Simpson, show me your driver's license!<eos> Well, I traded it to a kid for a bite of his sandwich.
- I'm in the middle of a really important job.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I really need to print these things.<eos> It's not-- Max, you can't print right now.<eos> Max, listen to me.<eos> I have a fair solution.<eos> I have a fair solution.<eos> Okay. What is it?<eos> I will use the printer for one hour, and you get it for one hour.
Call me Dr. Control, Viku.<eos> Darn! Missed!<eos> Now, this will be one high powered meeting.<eos> Greetings, Your Highness!<eos> Welcome, Prince.<eos> This is Dr. Mili, dad's physiotherapist.<eos> And he's Suraj..<eos> - Hi.<eos> ...Maan Singh. - Your house is really beautiful.<eos> My family's been looking after it for 600 years now.
Prince..<eos> What would you choose between a beautiful doctor and a business deal?<eos> I will wait.<eos> Does this prince trouble you?<eos> He is a snob, but he is not so bad.<eos> I've heard, there used to be 300 queens living here once upon a time.<eos> Not queens, mistresses.<eos> That king is very intelligent.<eos> True.<eos> He called me for a meeting, but avoided it altogether.
She's good.<eos> - Zander.<eos> - Surprise.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was really hoping for,<eos> "hey, have you been working out?"<eos> 'Cause I have.<eos> Wait... what... you have class in 10 minutes.<eos> In Vermont.<eos> You know, I think you're going to miss it.
After last night, no one's going to believe you.<eos> You'll look like a resentful woman caught in a lie about a pregnancy that never existed.<eos> Then I guess you both got what you wanted.<eos> Oh, I just love the opera.<eos> You never know what performance you're going to get.<eos> Did you leak the medical records?<eos> No.<eos> The timing was curious.<eos> I love you, Daniel.<eos> And I simply saw an opportunity to help you, and I took it, but I'm still keeping my eye on Ms. Thorne.
My son is on the precipice.<eos> His life is at risk, and the blame rests squarely on your narrow shoulders, Mr. Ross.<eos> I'm not sure how much longer I'll be.<eos> Come on in.<eos> It's open.<eos> Right.<eos> No matter what I decide to do with Grayson Manor, I'm prepared to force an eviction.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> I got a call from my realtor today.<eos> Seems the house I was about to lose is now mine if I want it.
You got the city council on your side, right?<eos> Well, they're no match for her legal acrobatics.<eos> To think that when she and Conrad were together, she was nothing but a socialite enjoying the high life.<eos> What changed her?<eos> I did.<eos> After Conrad left her for me, it must've been a wake-up call.<eos> But if she thinks that I'm going to tolerate her insolence, she's wrong.<eos> There are other ways to deal with her.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> That if I created this beast, don't you think it's time I slay it?
Hmm. Mike, smell this.<eos> I'm not smelling that.<eos> I swear I've been through everything in here, and the stench is not coming from the fridge.<eos> Hey, Brick, did you go through your backpack?<eos> Are you sure you don't have a yogurt or something in there from last year?<eos> Unh-unh. I lost my backpack.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Well, where did you last have it?
But we never talked, and, instead, she gave me this and said it explains us, but I have no clue what it means, and you got to help me, 'cause I'm losing my mind.<eos> Am I with this girl or not?<eos> Well, look, that's a girl, and that's probably a guy.<eos> And -- oh, you see how they're all entwined in the same tree?<eos> You're definitely together.<eos> No, they're not even facing each other.<eos> I think it might be over.<eos> You know, I once broke up with my boyfriend with a sculpture.<eos> Did he understand it?<eos> Well, I threw it at him, so I'm pretty sure he got the message.
All right.<eos> Hey, Mike.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> No.<eos> You haven't even heard it yet.<eos> I'm writing a letter to Rita Glossner.<eos> Exactly.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not a regular letter.<eos> It's on nice stationery, and I'm dropping it off with a box of candy.
Or it could take 10 years.<eos> We don't stop.<eos> I don't stop.<eos> So I wanted to give you the chance to tell me what happened.<eos> I didn't kill Tom.<eos> I had no reason to kill Tom.<eos> How many times did you sleep with Jess Murphy?<eos> 'Cause I know of at least one.<eos> And I can estimate fairly accurately when that was.<eos> See, the DNA sample that you gave us, we tested it against Tom's, and the probability of paternity is 99.9%.
No, there's got to be another place.<eos> Hey, we've been working with guys since we started in C.F.D.<eos> Yeah, we had to prove ourselves every day and let plenty of stuff roll off our backs, but I can handle that.<eos> This place is different.<eos> I know you felt it too.<eos> It's stone age.<eos> Shay.<eos> You just say the word, and I will kick her ass.<eos> Looks like somebody else already did.<eos> My truck broke down for the umpteenth time, and they towed it off with my cell phone inside.
Yeah, I get it, Richard.<eos> You changed a lot.<eos> Just give me the basics and I can roll with it.<eos> I need to know what I'm presenting here.<eos> I don't think I have time to explain it all.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> Richard? Is this the right build?<eos> I can't find the mobile suite here.<eos> Uh, it is nowhere.<eos> I deleted it.
Yes, they are!<eos> Oh, you're joking!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> They say I have been highly requested, highly requested, to be immortalised in wax.<eos> You sure that doesn't say immersed in wax?<eos> No, immortalised in wax.<eos> How are they going to immortalise you in wax?<eos> Where are they going to get all the wax?<eos> Presumably they'll have to melt down everything else in Madame Tussauds, to make one massive hideous wax dummy... of a hideous dummy.<eos> It's easy, they just get a very big candle, they light it, let it drip down the edges for a couple of hours, then just draw a face on it with felt tip.
Oh, no!<eos> They say I have been highly requested, highly requested, to be immortalised in wax.<eos> You sure that doesn't say immersed in wax?<eos> No, immortalised in wax.<eos> How are they going to immortalise you in wax?<eos> Where are they going to get all the wax?<eos> Presumably they'll have to melt down everything else in Madame Tussauds, to make one massive hideous wax dummy... of a hideous dummy.<eos> It's easy, they just get a very big candle, they light it, let it drip down the edges for a couple of hours, then just draw a face on it with felt tip.<eos> That would look a bit like him.<eos> What are they going to do with it when they've got it?
So when you're doing your gigs now, presumably your mum doesn't take you around.<eos> No - the best thing about this latest tour, it's the biggest one I've done, and I'm going to be in a tour bus, which is amazing.<eos> Cos the worst thing, I find, about doing a tour when you're in a car is having to use petrol station toilets, cos the lock on a petrol station toilet door is always broken.<eos> They're always bust, then you have to do that thing which we all do, which I call "lavatory yoga"<eos> where you work out how to keep the door with a broken lock shut.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's three main schools of it - you've got the Tom Daley, where you lean forward with the arms like that.<eos> Use the fingertips. Yeah.<eos> But I can't BLEEP unless I'm playing Candy Crush, so that doesn't work.<eos> Then you've got the Bowing Monk, where you put your head forward and just use it as a doorstop.
That's not true, Lois.<eos> She told me not to say.<eos> Look, she's at a specialist about her skin.<eos> D'you know, it's gotten so bad recently.<eos> She should just use some cream or something, like... something with steroids in it.<eos> I think she uses something already...<eos> Yeah, well she should stop using so much foundation, too.<eos> I know she wants to hide her skin, but it doesn't.<eos> And it makes it worse.<eos> Pretty soon, she's going to be putting it on with a trowel.
Actually, Stacey.<eos> I'm apologising for not doing this sooner.<eos> Doing what sooner?<eos> Telling you to piss off.<eos> I had to gather my evidence first.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, on Wednesday, you said of Vicky, and I quote,<eos> "She needs to stop putting so much foundation on.<eos> "I know she wants to hide her skin, but it doesn't, it just makes it worse.<eos> "Pretty soon she'll be putting it on with a trowel.
Look around.<eos> The bloom of youth.<eos> Like flowers on the sunset of an eagle's poetry.<eos> - Andy, I hate teenagers.<eos> - If you give this a chance, you're gonna love it, I promise.<eos> It's like the movie Expendables 2.<eos> Firsttime,hatedit.<eos> Second time, hated it.<eos> Third time, it was okay.<eos> But then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth time I watched it,
Previously on Believe...<eos> Bo is a very special little girl.<eos> She is starting to become the person she is going to be.<eos> We still have a leak, and that angers me.<eos> When I find the traitor, I'll make them beg for mercy, but I will not grant it.
What man?<eos> Have we stopped trusting each other?<eos> Nelson Dubeck.<eos> Office of Public Integrity.<eos> They're pursuing a case against... the governor.<eos> The ballot box?<eos> Why you and not me?<eos> There's a surveillance tape.<eos> Smoking gun.<eos> I took it to Peter Florrick.
No, I bought 5,000 of whatever that is is.<eos> The Guzzle Buddy!<eos> At first, I said, "Chug Buddy," and then you said, "Guzzle Chug,"<eos> [Laughs] And then I mated those two into "Guzzle Buddy"!<eos> Oh, are you calling the news?<eos> No, I just told Bobby he was the dumbest person I know, so I have to call and apologize.<eos> So, Andy's investment talk was all [Mockingly] funds and percentages and mutual hedgehogs.<eos> But then I hit him with this.<eos> Is that a piece from a meth lab?<eos> The Guzzle Buddy takes your wine bottle and turns it into... your wine glass.
Wish I would have had a jump suit made out of this material in juvie.<eos> Hey, Tom. What do you think?<eos> Still the best torso in Gulfhaven.<eos> Best in town? [ Chuckles ] Thanks.<eos> But I meant the new Gray's Pub.<eos> Check it out.<eos> New communal computer.<eos> Password is "grays."<eos> And digital jukebox.<eos> The second a hip song comes out, we got it. [ Dubstep music plays loudly ]
Ugh. Fine.<eos> LOUISE: No... no, no!<eos> TAMMY: Why isn't it falling?<eos> Because of your big mouth, Tammy!<eos> Someone's gotta notice I'm missing.<eos> This is my party.<eos> The theme is me.<eos> What are you planning to do with this stupid head after today anyway?<eos> Um, hello?<eos> I'm gonna donate it to charity.
Jump till this thing breaks open!<eos> Go! You got it!<eos> LOUISE: Oh, my little legs!<eos> Justin, it's time for your ladies choice dance with Tammy.<eos> But since she's still taking Tammy time, we found you another partner and it is me.<eos> Um, but...<eos> Can't talk... there's a schedule.<eos> Hey!<eos> This burger isn't cooked!<eos> You want this food cooked, you go put it in a sink and run it under hot water.
- I thought you were...<eos> - Dead?<eos> Well...<eos> Far from it, actually.<eos> Time for redemption, Mr. Woodhull.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> No, wait, wait.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you have a grievance with me, I suggest that we settle this lawfully with Major Hewlett, all right?<eos> We'll settle it now.
A few drops where I found the slices.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> What are you not telling me Kiera?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There is nothing to tell.<eos> This is good news.<eos> I'm one step closer to getting home, right?<eos> You hold onto it.<eos> You still have the missing piece?<eos> Yeah, I'll get it to you.
I want in too.<eos> I know I don't look the part, but I know everything about wine, and I will prove it.<eos> My name is Craig Middlebrooks, and this is my debit rewards card.<eos> Well, why wouldn't you run this by me first, dad?<eos> Whatever.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just weird family business.<eos> Sounds private.<eos> No need to discuss it with me.<eos> My parents had this small little vacation house on Lake Hubbard, and now they've sold it without telling the rest of us.
Mr. Ron Dunn,<eos> I have something I'm very angry about, but other Ron, he's not helping me with it.<eos> Can you help?<eos> Well, I can tell by the indigo on your chiclets that you've been drinking blueberry wine.<eos> That's a good start.<eos> The Wamapoke called it mattapiqua.<eos> They believed it had mystical powers.<eos> Yeah, it also tastes like jelly.<eos> So what's got your goat there, friend?<eos> My parents, they had this lake house, and they sold it without telling me.
You don't know that.<eos> Do some sniffing around first.<eos> All right?<eos> One of 'em might hate politics.<eos> I mean, maybe the other ones had plans.<eos> I know I do.<eos> I got 72 hours to squeeze in mountain bike riding, skydiving, rock climbing and a bunch of other stuff that guys like to do in erectile dysfunction commercials.<eos> If I can't eliminate some of these people, it's gonna get ugly.<eos> You know my family.<eos> There's one piece of pizza left and we'd... Get into a big fight and throw that piece of pizza on the ground and stomp on it so nobody can have it.
I know there's as much evidence against them as there is against my client.<eos> That's why you're pointing me there, because they're not your client.<eos> You know, nothing's gonna bring Mr. Foreman back.<eos> Just like there's nothing that's gonna bring my parents back.<eos> This is the best way I can see to get your client compensation.<eos> If you think you're doing the right thing, you're wrong.<eos> I'm trying to help, but I'm not gonna sell my client out.<eos> It's a half measure.<eos> All right, then here's the other half.<eos> I pointed out your achilles' heel when I found that photo, and I found it on Facebook.
Oh, so I guess you didn't catch all the other times then.<eos> I did, just trying to let you off the hook.<eos> Rachel...<eos> This is perfect.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Now it is.<eos> So where's the chair?<eos> No.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Professor Gerard's legal ethics class--you take it?
- Yeah.<eos> Your Honor, please instruct the witness<eos> - to sing his part of the song.<eos> - Objection.<eos> Counsel is making a mockery of these proceedings.<eos> - I like the song.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The witness will sing.<eos> Who wrote "Eye of the Hurricane"?<eos> Liam and I wrote it together.
The Masseur was wearing brown shoes and a black belt.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I...<eos> I thought I'd keep an eye on her while I was going over the footage.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So smart, Juju.<eos> Let's play the tape.<eos> You know what?<eos> I already did.<eos> And I watched it from the top, and no one stole anything.
He's got me!<eos> Son a bitch, that's my watch!<eos> Doug had most of your stolen items in his van, which was also stolen.<eos> We also found this.<eos> I knew you took it.<eos> We stopped be here first so he could apologize to you in person.<eos> And obviously, you want to press charges.<eos> Marcus, my friend.<eos> Once I found that van full of your stolen stuff,<eos> I knew if I drove it over here, it would look bad.
He holds the kids to a ridiculously high standard.<eos> I like this guy.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.<eos> Hard-ass, high standards... that's looking back at me every time I look at the mirror.<eos> Okay, well, your hero's gonna keep me out of West Point.<eos> If he gets tough, honey, you just get tougher.<eos> Yeah, but it's all or nothing with this guy, dad.<eos> You do all the right things to solve a math problem, but if you make one tiny mistake at the end, he marks the whole thing wrong.<eos> What? !<eos> If you get a wrong answer, he marks it wrong?
Bye.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes, fine.<eos> Never better.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Going to the retirement home?<eos> Of course! Of course!<eos> OK, so, the kitchen prepared two room service meals yesterday, both chicken curry.<eos> And Sylvaine took one of them to Judith Musgrove in her room, and the other she delivered to Emma Redding.<eos> Sylvaine doesn't think anyone could have tampered with the food while she was delivering it, and as at least one other guest had the same meal, it couldn't have been tampered with in the kitchen.
ALL: You can't.<eos> How can you take any trace of the pills out of the curry after it's been eaten?<eos> ALL: You can't do that either.<eos> Yet if the only explanation is that someone did, then that's what must have happened.<eos> He must be still drunk.<eos> I heard that, Dwayne.<eos> Unless it's different.<eos> What if the door isn't the door, or at least not the door that we thought it was?<eos> What if the curry wasn't the curry?<eos> CAMILLE: 'Sylvaine doesn't think anyone could have tampered with her food whilst she was delivering it.'
All right, gang, Diet Day Four.<eos> How's everyone holding up?<eos> Honestly, I'm going to last forever.<eos> You hear that, bitches?<eos> I'm doing great.<eos> This morning the homeless guy on my stoop said my skin looked dope.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why do you all have matching bags?<eos> We're doing a diet together.<eos> My wife found it.

If you're gonna bag evidence like a five-year-old, you should have the proper tools.<eos> It's a "My First Police Kit."<eos> The walkie-talkie blows bubbles.<eos> Hope you can handle it.<eos> He mislabeled the weapon, like an idiot.<eos> And it almost got filed with the wrong case.<eos> He could've blown months of work!<eos> You humiliated Officer Deetmore in front of his peers.<eos> He submitted an official complaint against you.<eos> Did he fill it out in crayon?
My father took me there when I was just a little ghoul.<eos> And that's where my father lived when I was under construction.<eos> She must have taken the Heart there.<eos> We have to go find it!<eos> Next stop, New Goreleans!<eos> And I'm going with you.<eos> Really?<eos> That'd be totes appreciated.<eos> Mom and Dad would shed their fur if I didn't keep an eye on you ghouls.<eos> Besides, this will make a great story someday and I'm gonna write it!
You're a bit jumpy today, aren't you?<eos> If you don't mind, I got a meeting.<eos> My main concern is differentiating this from the other PC compatibles.<eos> Press will want to lump it in with all the others.<eos> Well, Cameron's operating system is unlike anything else on the market.<eos> Cameron?<eos> Uh, yeah, it's interactive.<eos> Um, I can just show it to you.<eos> You're barking up the wrong tree.<eos> No, you want this machine to stand out from every other machine on the floor, you gotta stop talking about the machine and you gotta start talking about the people that made it.
They'll be in stores by Christmas.<eos> My heart goes out to you.<eos> I know how painful this must be.<eos> But when two paths converge, intentionally or not, they don't always continue on together.<eos> One peels off, the other dead-ends.<eos> Let's skip the "Two Roads in a Wood" bullshit.<eos> You're not Robert Frost.<eos> You're pawnshop hacks selling my dream under a cheap plastic mask.<eos> I heard you were touchy.<eos> That LCD screen, where did you find it, a Taiwanese barge?
The truth is that I can't trust him.<eos> Hey, you have worked too hard and risked too much to get here. We both have.<eos> Nothing can be allowed to jeopardize that.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I think you know what I'm saying.<eos> I've got three teams running diagnostics on the 3B5, checking to see if you've corrupted it in any way.<eos> Also got guys checking the network itself to see if it's damaged.<eos> Come on, Eli.<eos> You're not that dumb.<eos> You know the network can transmit way faster than we're letting it.
No, it was the BQE.<eos> Okay, whatever.<eos> And then the cops pulled them over.<eos> So he leans in, and he's like, "yo, I got a piece in the car."<eos> Why did he have a gun?<eos> For protection.<eos> You know how the hood was.<eos> It was in the glove compartment.<eos> As the cop's walking up,<eos> I take it out, put it in my purse.
I'll call her back.<eos> What's she like?<eos> Well, Tasha is...<eos> Not you. Hmm? Oh, good, I'm glad you're here.<eos> Do you mind if I borrow your black leather jacket?<eos> What?<eos> It's Tuesday, laundry day.<eos> Should I have called first?<eos> Why start now?<eos> No smoking in it, okay?
Time was you might have walked out of here No sort of comment on it.<eos> Time was.<eos> Time will be again, eh?<eos> Once we have declared the truth And must no longer hide ourselves.<eos> We have agreed, Bennet.<eos> It must be done right.<eos> For it to be right, Rose, it must be done.<eos> He's not your lookout.<eos> He is mine.<eos> Mr. Drake, open this door or I shall put my foot through it!
He's not dead.<eos> Mr. Drake.<eos> Mr. Drake, you look at him.<eos> Repeat the doctor's prognosis.<eos> He is not dead.<eos> He... is not... dead.<eos> This man now lies here because his sense of duty is greater than any other he holds.<eos> You, may argue the toss of such wisdom, but the fact remains,<eos> Men, women, children, they need justice.<eos> And he sees to it that they get it.
I was worried about mom.<eos> P... people are saying she was arrested.<eos> Mom was taken into custody this morning.<eos> What?<eos> Dad, th... th... that... that's crazy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> These lawyers are here to help her.<eos> We're doing everything that we can.<eos> Dad, where's the computer?<eos> The police took it.
Dad, th... th... that... that's crazy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> These lawyers are here to help her.<eos> We're doing everything that we can.<eos> Dad, where's the computer?<eos> The police took it.<eos> Jake's been working on a mobile app for almost a year.<eos> All his coding is on the computer.<eos> Is the computer Susan's?<eos> Well, she bought it, but we all use it.
I'll tell I.T. not to worry about recovery and let them focus on figuring out who hacked us.<eos> Okay.<eos> All I want is my own room where me and my babies can sleep.<eos> And we promise that you and each of your siblings will get your very own special room that's unique to your personality.<eos> Your Honor, as evidenced by the video, there was an oral contract between the producers of "Ultimate Home Do-over"<eos> and the Bowen children.<eos> On behalf of the producers of the show, I agree with Ms. Kaswell's statement.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We promised each of those kids their own bedroom and each one of them got it, but then the Biltmans kicked them out.
Mother did all that for you to achieve greatness.<eos> Not long ago, I was a lot like you.<eos> I wanted to kill someone who wronged me, and I failed.<eos> Had I killed Snow White, I wouldn't be in this world.<eos> I wouldn't be with these people, and...<eos> I wouldn't have my son, Henry.<eos> So, no, Zelena, I won't kill you.<eos> Instead, I'm gonna give you what I got.<eos> I'm gonna give you a second chance.<eos> What if I don't want it?
____<eos> - This black box, how do I get it?
That's all they've given you.<eos> I knew they would do this.<eos> That's what they want to see.<eos> Oh, mom.<eos> My oldest...<eos> Caleb... I lost him on my very first box.<eos> Just flat-out refused to play.<eos> I didn't think they'd actually do it.<eos> Next day, overnight delivery shows up, big old box.<eos> The second I saw it, I just knew.
Kim: Did you lose the key in two minutes?<eos> - Tyler:<eos> No. Hey.<eos> - Russ: Hey.<eos> Tyler: No, I think I gave it to you in the lobby.<eos> - Kim: No, you did not!<eos> - Tyler: I'm pretty sure I did, though.<eos> - Kim:<eos> No.<eos> Look. - Remember, the guy gave it to me...
Mock?<eos> Does not a man's coat usually fall just to the knee?<eos> Yes.<eos> And did I ask you for anything different than that?<eos> Well, no, not explicitly, but, um, I just thought<eos> That my legs should be hidden?<eos> That I have something to be ashamed of?<eos> I would never presume.<eos> My Laird... please.<eos> You make me a standard frock coat and have it back to me by tomorrow.
Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, "What ails her?"<eos> "What ails her?"<eos> Oh. Who knows?<eos> Come on, anything can happen.<eos> We can push him down the stairs!<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming to hang out.<eos> No problem. How's your mom feeling?<eos> Okay, but she'd feel better if she took her medicine.<eos> You know, when Cinnamon won't take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.
You'd never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.<eos> Uh, since you're paying for dinner, I'll let that slide.<eos> Open yours.<eos> Have you ever paid for a meal?<eos> Not with money.<eos> Read.<eos> "Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you."<eos> Oh, try again.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> So, he kills this girl's father, cuts off the guy's face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.
I haven't seen this one yet.<eos> But it's all true?<eos> Some people have kind of a monster within.<eos> And Nick can see them, Trubel can see them, and your dad could see them.<eos> Josh, just 'cause you can't see them now, doesn't mean you won't some day.<eos> Hit me pretty late, too.<eos> Well, at least I'll know it's real.<eos> Sort of.<eos> I can't find this key.<eos> Have you ever seen it?
What's important for them is to survive at least as a population.<eos> As a population, they can guarantee that they're gonna survive by having some cells do one thing and some cells do something else and hoping that at least part of the population does the right thing at the right time.<eos> So any strategy which all the cells do the same thing is very, very risky.<eos> It's a little bit like going to the horse races and saying you're gonna put all your money on one horse.<eos> It may pay off very well, but it also could have a very big downside and wipe you out.<eos> So it can be much more advantageous to spread the risk across many different strategies.<eos> It seems... life is not just following the logical instructions of its genetic software.<eos> Randomness is built into nature's program.<eos> Luck and chance are not just real.<eos> Life as we know it really wouldn't function without them.
Another couple of fists, we'd have beat him.<eos> Seems to me you pick on a man's children, you ain't got the right to beat him.<eos> How could you do that to your overseer?<eos> He won't be my overseer for long.<eos> Master William's seen something in me he likes.<eos> First time he clapped eyes on me, I was standing up to that union man.<eos> And as soon as I get the hang of the mule room, he wants me to be the overseer.<eos> After one week!<eos> Everything I told you about working hard, refusing hand-outs, it was true.<eos> We came looking for a better life and we found it.
Will this take long?<eos> When you were a boy, don't you remember how exciting it was getting news from home?<eos> I don't remember our lessons being interrupted for it.<eos> Here he is now.<eos> Come in, Peter.<eos> I've a letter from your mother.<eos> I wonder if she's heard yet...?<eos> No!<eos> Thank you, Mrs Greg.<eos> A friend will read it to me later.
I wish I could, but there's nowt I can do.<eos> Get wise, George.<eos> He's shown his true colours.<eos> Got bubbles or bum fluff and the union's not interested.<eos> Your children missed you.<eos> I try to do the right thing.<eos> But sometimes...<eos> I'll try harder.<eos> I'll never raise my hand to you again, I promise.<eos> I'll cut it off first.
The Dragoons and Grenadier Guards are only down the road.<eos> Maybe it's time to give up.<eos> We've come too far now.<eos> If you start something, you finish it.<eos> No matter how long it takes.<eos> If we surrender now, Joshua Bibby died for nothing.<eos> Do you think his widow and sons want us to give up? MAN:<eos> No.<eos> There isn't a family in all of England who want the charter more than they do.<eos> Because when we get it, and Parliament is controlled by the working class, never again will an aristocrat's lackey or a man in uniform get away with murdering a poor man for the crime of trying to feed his family.
What is it, white man?<eos> What ails you?<eos> Let go of me.<eos> Let... go.<eos> Peter, you're drunk.<eos> Go home.<eos> Is this about Miriam?<eos> One day, my grandfather was too ill to work. And he was flogged to death.<eos> My father raised his voice and they cut off his head.<eos> They stuck it on a pike in the market square.
Don't tell me I killed Kenya for nothing.<eos> She's not dead!<eos> Very well.<eos> If you're right, we'll find an empty grave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I buried her body just over this next rise.<eos> Marked her grave.<eos> Planted a small patch of flowers. Oh. These flowers of yours, they weren't lavender by any chance, were they?<eos> How can Kenya Rosewater possibly be alive?<eos> You assured me she'd been killed when the Votanis Collective raided my facility and burned it to the ground.
You assured me she'd been killed when the Votanis Collective raided my facility and burned it to the ground.<eos> I was told there were no survivors.<eos> Obviously, someone recognized her value as a hostage.<eos> I couldn't have predicted this.<eos> All the same, you better fix it.<eos> There's nothing to fix.<eos> Right now, we need to focus on not getting caught.<eos> I refuse to accept that.<eos> You need to stop thinking like a human and accept what is real.<eos> If Joshua Nolan figures out what you did to Amanda, he will take his great big gun and stuff it in your mouth and pull the trigger, evacuating the contents of your sick little head.
- Yes. - Leslie is a spy.<eos> - No.<eos> Tom has something wrong with his butt.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> Did you hear that? They need an encore.<eos> Honey, they want--the kids want an encore, I'm sorry.<eos> What song should we do?<eos> You wanna do Toots?<eos> I hope you don't mind, but I noticed that your right rear tire was a little flat, so I patched it, and I inflated it for you.
The diaphragm appears to be the key.<eos> - If it vibrates too much... - I blow up.<eos> I understand that.<eos> The question is, what are you gonna do to make that not the case?<eos> Get this thing off me. Sir, I'm afraid I can't.<eos> If I disconnect the wrong wire...<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Sir, what about a blanket? A blanket?<eos> Yes, we'll bring a heavy blanket up to you on a crane.<eos> If we wrap it around, it may dampen the sound.
Give me!<eos> - Zohar Ben Ari closer to victory...<eos> - Do not you tired of this nonsense?<eos> Frame?<eos> About the Tehillim. I gave it all today business completely.<eos> You can test it tomorrow, and, if all goes well, then... tomorrow, actually, I'm leaving.<eos> Tomorrow morning will come to my office, and we will solve .<eos> It sounds ridiculous to you?<eos> You told me to bring the stain.<eos> I removed it.
What are we doing up here?<eos> - We are gonna listen in On everything slash and the newtralizer say.<eos> While I was wrestling with slash, I slipped a spy-roach on him.<eos> We'll be able to hear everything they say through my t-phone.<eos> [laughs] I know, awesome, right?<eos> I'm smart.<eos> - Nice, and here I thought you were just getting beat up.<eos> - Yeah, well, uh, I was multitasking.<eos> - The kraang orb revealed a new weapon.<eos> They're testing it on the docks at midnight.
They will be voting members.<eos> You are a born-again christian, who I presume is pro-life.<eos> That's right.<eos> Will your children be taught that people who are pro-choice go to hell or their pro-choice father is going to hell or their grandmother?<eos> - Wait. - Whoa!<eos> I-I don't think anyone is going to hell.<eos> I-I-it's so much more complicated than that.<eos> Will they stop supporting medical institutions that perform abortions or provide information about abortions like, for example, this hospital?<eos> Will they vote to stop supporting stem-cell research?<eos> We'd all like to think that the problem at the table is the meddling mother-in-law who didn't get to walk her son down the aisle, but I have built a massive institution with my blood and my sweat, and you will inherit it.
Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb and eliminate your Elastigirl theory.<eos> Hey, doc?<eos> I got a round blood drop on the floor here.<eos> And no way that's splatter from Toby Warren, right?<eos> That definitely didn't come from Toby's wounds.<eos> I don't know where the second bullet is, but it looks like it hit someone.<eos> Well, what if the tissue that you found under Lily's fingernails were from her fighting the killer?<eos> It could be that's how she ended up with the gun.<eos> Jane, this one's smeared.<eos> Looks like they stepped in it.
How about the gun?<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> Mr Vasquez, I want to make sure the record reflects that although my client is making this statement against the advice of counsel... Mr Wagner, we've been over this.<eos> Counsel nonetheless expects the state to take his voluntary cooperation into account during charging and sentencing phases.<eos> Noted.<eos> Kendal, please, continue.<eos> I asked where you got the gun.<eos> It was my uncle Danny's.<eos> Figured he'd want me to have it now that he wasn't gonna be around to protect me.<eos> Why did you bring it with you?
You need another shell.<eos> I keep telling you, diversify.<eos> We're moving to Trousdale, kids are going to private school.<eos> Trousdale?<eos> What is this, 1966 and you're Nancy fucking Sinatra?<eos> Hey.<eos> George Hamilton called...<eos> he wants his bag back.<eos> The office just got a call from a woman at Peet's who said your father had applied for a job there and they want his address.<eos> Did you give it to 'em?
I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> But I'm worried.<eos> I did what you asked.<eos> Now, what else do I have to be worried about?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What was Japan like?<eos> Mostly I saw the hotel.<eos> Japanese kids knew the English words to my song.<eos> Wrote it in Compton and they're singing it in Tokyo.
Akira!<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> You got my condolences.<eos> Paz and Section 9 are on the scene.<eos> Your attacker was a pro, even if he did screw up.<eos> It's unclear if this attack was tied to the bombings or not, but to be safe, we'll be giving you police protection.<eos> I don't need it. How is Akira?
He was flying into town, and he asked if he can have a small box shipped here.<eos> Well, if it was small, why didn't he just take it with him on the plane?<eos> He didn't want to deal with TSA because he said they always gave him a hard time.<eos> What was in the box?<eos> Um, his... skateboard tools and stuff.<eos> At least, that's what he said.<eos> But you didn't believe him.<eos> It's just, when he came to get it, he acted kind of strange.<eos> He noticed some tape had come loose on the box, and... he freaked out.<eos> He made me swear I hadn't opened it.
Castle.<eos> Hey, buddy. How's it going?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Well, as your close friend, now I have to ask.<eos> Did she beat you at scrabble again?<eos> Can we just talk about the case, please?<eos> Sure. You bet.<eos> So, the canvass to narrow down where Logan went with his duffel last night came up empty.<eos> But, uh, you remember the key that we found on him?<eos> Well, CSU, they traced it back to a 24-hour gym, and it turns out that Logan was there between 3:00 and 4:00 A.M. the night he was murdered.
And... he's also a motocross rider.<eos> Just like our killer.<eos> So, I went to the gym. So what?<eos> At 3:40 A.M.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> The big deal, Mr. Wexland, is that you used Logan Moore's I.D. card when he had just been killed nearby.<eos> Ain't hard to figure out where you got it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He loaned it to me the day before so I could work out.
What office?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was on the roof.<eos> He cut in through the window, went in, and then sent up the gear with the bag.<eos> That was the last I saw him.<eos> The plan was for me to disappear with the gear and then stash the bag at the gym.<eos> Did he have a camcorder with him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... I mean, there was one in the bag.<eos> But it wasn't there when he sent it back.
I know why Logan bought the camera.<eos> He didn't intend to record something.<eos> He wanted to play an old cassette tape.<eos> You think that's why he broke into the law offices... to get a HI8 tape?<eos> Jay was killed six years ago.<eos> If there was evidence of his death, it's possible it could be on a format like this.<eos> Yeah, but we still don't have it.<eos> Or do we?<eos> Look.<eos> The tape must have torn when the killer ripped it out.
I think I figured it out.<eos> Check every shelf in that house for a wooden box.<eos> What's in the box?<eos> The answer to this case.<eos> So I had Blake search that house for that ice pick in a box, and then I presented that box to you.<eos> Is that coming back to you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> We found it in Joe's bedroom.
Mm-hmm. [sighs] Oh, come on.<eos> You can't be that busy.<eos> [telephone rings] There he is.<eos> You ought to be ashamed.<eos> Chelsea, don't yell at him.<eos> He's doing his best.<eos> No.<eos> Nova, you're sweet.<eos> But you're a pushover, and you won't say this, so I will.<eos> She's sick, and you keep jerking her around, scheduling her surgery, then canceling it, scheduling and canceling.
You need to get caught up on the commodity futures markets.<eos> Fortunately for you, I have already written the definitive guide on that very complicated subject.<eos> Learn it.<eos> Study it.<eos> Worship it.<eos> This is your Bible now.<eos> Way ahead of you, sir.<eos> I read it, studied it, and corrected it.<eos> You don't correct the Bible.<eos> It's why they call it the Bible.
Then never mind.<eos> What the hell happened to my jade plant while I was gone?<eos> I believe the plant lady takes care of those, and she was fired.<eos> Well, then, call down to the ground floor and have them send up a new plant lady.<eos> I'm the new plant lady.<eos> The hell are you doing?<eos> I'm starting at the bottom, and I'd go deeper if I could.<eos> I would go as deep into that bottom as humanly possible.<eos> Wish you had that sentence back?<eos> Also wish I wasn't wearing these gloves when I said it.
Mags, this baby hates me.<eos> And she hates my face.<eos> Oh, I found it, I found it!<eos> Good, good, good.<eos> I got it! Oh.<eos> Why is this covered in poop?<eos> You are supposed to wash that.<eos> I meant to.<eos> But I need it to get away from me.<eos> So I just shoved it into a bomb and put it under the dresser.
- Yeah.<eos> You just need to get out there and find out who you are.<eos> You know, right now,<eos> I am taking this great dance class.<eos> I actually found it by mistake.<eos> I was super hungry and I saw this place called the salsa house.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> You would not believe who I just talked to.<eos> So remember, Emma, the guy always leads.<eos> And if his hand slips any lower than your back, call me and I'll break it.
Sometimes it doesn't.<eos> Make a wish.<eos> And we're back. All good?<eos> Um, great, fine! Yeah.<eos> So it's two, three, cha cha cha.<eos> Two, three, cha cha cha.<eos> Two, three, nah nah nah.<eos> Two, three, cha cha cha.<eos> I'm just trying to feel the music.<eos> Well, that's not where I keep it.
So this guy, um he really remembers everything, like everything everything?<eos> People born with eidetic recall remember each moment of their lives as clearly as any other.<eos> They remember what day of the week they met someone ten years ago.<eos> They remember what they were wearing the last Wednesday of each month.<eos> He's also incredibly detail-oriented.<eos> Eidetics tend to be perfectionists.<eos> The two trades go hand in hand.<eos> That's means if Jessie says that there is zero chance that Marcel ingested peanut residue in his kitchen accidentally, then...<eos> Then it's safe to assume that the exposure was intentional.<eos> Someone knew about his allergy and used it to poison him.
How anyone can misuse utensils like that is beyond me.<eos> - What else?<eos> - A woman visiting the studio wore the strangest hat.<eos> The next morning at 8:00 a.m. I unpacked a semi-final ingredient.<eos> That was a surprise.<eos> - 45 minutes later...<eos> - Wait, wait go back.<eos> The semi-final ingredient, - black truffle?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> I didn't even know what it looked like until I saw it
Did they come?<eos> Are they here?<eos> Sandy sent her regrets.<eos> Come on, it's starting.<eos> Welcome to the very special finale of Five-Star Chef.<eos> Before we start the show, let's take a moment to acknowledge the untimely death of Marcel Beaumont.<eos> Marcel was a marvelous cook...<eos> We need to somehow prove that Gustav planted that oil in Gabriella's dressing room.<eos> Gabriella said that she threw the bottle out.<eos> Yeah Forensics was looking for it but I don't think they're going to find any fingerprints.
Let's go visit Miss Fisher.<eos> Did you give Chloe the cocaine?<eos> Not really.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> There was a couple down from Seattle for the weekend.<eos> They were staying in a suite, spending lots of money.<eos> They asked me if I could get them some coke.<eos> Chloe was working that day, so I asked her if she knew where I could get some.<eos> But she took so long, the couple had gone. So I gave it back to her.<eos> And where did Chloe get it from?
How your parents holding up?<eos> They watch TV and fight.<eos> Pretty normal, just more so.<eos> Want to go back to my place?<eos> The police found the coke.<eos> What?<eos> They were searching the house.<eos> - What'd you tell them?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Where do they think you got it?
Let's ride!<eos> Where, Randy? Where we gonna ride to?<eos> Specifics, please.<eos> - There you go.<eos> You see these unit coins on the wall?<eos> That gap where one's missing?<eos> Sully earned his coin for bravery holding the perimeter at pusan.<eos> He carried that coin with him for two tours.<eos> But one night, he got a little too friendly with the wrong marine's girlfriend.<eos> The guy got P.O.'D, but he didn't have the guts to tango with Sully, so he ripped his unit coin off the wall, put it between his butt cheeks, and took it to the marine bar down the coast.

Was it a place of honor?<eos> He defiled it. We have to get it back.<eos> Do we, though?<eos> - How about a brand new coin?<eos> Has it been washed?<eos> It was Sully's dying wish to get that coin back!<eos> We didn't think you'd understand.<eos> You see this?<eos> This belonged to our dad.<eos> He made me promise to give it back to him when he came home from the Gulf.

I think I'm gonna take a walk, be alone for awhile.<eos> Thanks, Jack, for putting my mind at ease.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I mean, I'm supposed to believe my father tripped and fell?<eos> What was he doing with Conrad, anyway?<eos> Margaux, we'll get answers.<eos> I promise.<eos> But right now, you just...<eos> I mean, years of wanting a relationship with him, and it was there.<eos> We were having it.
And they were competing moonshine runners.<eos> Which started a family feud.<eos> Did it ever.<eos> An exceptionally bloody one.<eos> Cousins, spouses, children.<eos> No one was spared.<eos> How long did the violence last?<eos> Until the passage of the 21st amendment.<eos> Once firewater became legal, they lost their bloodthirstiness-ness.<eos> Until Clark Matthias brought it back.
The security guard is a liar.<eos> You know why we're in here, Todd?<eos> 'Cause the only real thing about your story is a severed human hand.<eos> Whose hand is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You killed somebody.<eos> You took their hand to fake a story, to make yourself look like a hero.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't hurt anyone.<eos> He gave it to me.

He had the only treasure map.<eos> Explains why Sam Bishop's fingerprint was on it.<eos> It was one of his photos.<eos> Question is:<eos> how did Roger Mathers get it?<eos> Sam, these were your photos.<eos> That's why your fingerprint's on the fragment that we found near Roger Mathers' car.<eos> Did you give him this photograph?<eos> No.<eos> And I have no idea how he got it.
No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, I took the old man's money.<eos> I'd just been fired, I had a little girl to raise.<eos> But I never gave a damn about any missing loot, any treasure.<eos> It was a chance to find Scotty.<eos> Sam, we need the photo that Roger Mathers had last night.<eos> Where are the negatives?<eos> There it is.<eos> The photograph that Roger Mathers was carrying the night he was murdered.<eos> what's so damn special about it that got him killed?
He has before.<eos> That's close enough.<eos> I've gone to great lengths to keep alive.<eos> I'd like to stay that way.<eos> And yet, you came back.<eos> Well, I can survive in the shadows.<eos> I just don't want to live there forever.<eos> You need to take Bracken down... same as we do.<eos> There has to be a way.<eos> Yes, and I thought I'd found it.
How can you possibly know that?<eos> Castle, when I first met him, he was saying things about my mother's murder, things that I... I didn't understand at the time.<eos> But he specifically mentioned a cassette recording.<eos> And Smith said that the person who made that recording was a former associate of Bracken's.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It adds up.<eos> Okay, but if Montgomery did have that kind of evidence, why wouldn't he have just given it to Smith?<eos> I think he gave it to my mom.<eos> He asked if I had been through her belongings, if I came across a cassette.<eos> Kate, if he gave her the tape, you would've found it.
- He won't sign?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> He'll sign, but he wants me to do something first.<eos> What kind of thing?<eos> He wants me to break into his ex-girlfriend's truck and steal a garage-door opener.<eos> O... kay. Why?<eos> Apparently, after they broke up, his ex-girlfriend took a few of his things, and he wants them back.<eos> And he needs the garage-door opener to get into her place?<eos> Her... mom's place, but yeah.<eos> But given his record, why doesn't he just steal it himself?
I did everything that I could, but there was just too much damage.<eos> Kate...<eos> The dress it's gone!<eos> It's only a dress.<eos> It's not the end of the world.<eos> Then why does it feel like it is?<eos> Our wedding was supposed to be magical.<eos> It was supposed to be our perfect day.<eos> And now it's just... falling apart.<eos> So we'll put it back together.
Do you live here?<eos> Um, do you mind getting off on my floor and carrying that to my apartment?<eos> What's your name?<eos> So, what you're telling me is that, in your entire retirement home, there isn't a single 85-year-old blind guy that I could just rent out for the night?<eos> Okay, Carol, what if I keep him?<eos> Well, may... all right.<eos> Just gonna hang up.<eos> We'll see if I retire there.<eos> This is all your fault.<eos> Look, every time I give you an amazing idea on how to get Nicki, you shoot it down like skeet.
I mean, we're all leaders, you know?<eos> No, Bursk.<eos> There's just the two leaders.<eos> Me and Justin.<eos> Buzz and Woody, huh?<eos> And you know what my favorite part about "Toy Story" is?<eos> Yeah, Buzz Lightyear is way more handsome than Woody, but deep down, he knows that every day he spends with Woody makes him a better friend.<eos> Uh, thanks, man.<eos> You want a beer?<eos> I wouldn't miss it.
There's no more talking, no more running, no more lying or fighting, killing.<eos> I think it all just stops.<eos> It gets really quiet, and there's only silence.<eos> At least I hope that's what it is.<eos> Let's do another sweep around the inn, make sure no one's watching.<eos> Put the gun down!<eos> You can't go in there.<eos> Put it down now!<eos> This church belongs to Joe Carroll.<eos> If anyone tries to enter, we'll burn it to the ground.
Of course I had to hit you.<eos> You're a creepy stranger in my house at night.<eos> You meet all the qualifications of someone I should hit.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm not a stranger.<eos> I'm the guy who watches your sex tape.<eos> Hey!<eos> I mean, I mean, my wife and I, we found your sex tape.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> You hid it in an old clown doll which we ended up finding.
Raise a dog and live with you in our own house.<eos> That's it?<eos> Fine.<eos> You got your wish.<eos> Really?<eos> Ever seen me lie before?<eos> Of course.<eos> This is for real.<eos> I found our house.<eos> You'll really buy it?
- Tank, listen...<eos> - Honestly, thank you... for pushing me and challenging me.<eos> I feel like dating you has totally changed me.<eos> I know this sounds kind of cheesy, but, um... I'm psyched to see how else I'm gonna be changed with you.<eos> Me too.<eos> Kathryn this is fantastic.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Oh, wow. Well, did you have a good day?<eos> Did you get your window fixed?<eos> Angelo fixed it.
I got a gift.<eos> I opened it.<eos> The chat box went away, and I could talk to her.<eos> No more typing.<eos> Hands-free, so to speak.<eos> How long did this honeymoon last?<eos> A week.<eos> Ten days.<eos> Then it ended.<eos> I ended it.
Nick processed on site.<eos> Berman's hands were positive for GSR.<eos> I know, but the stria don't match.<eos> Berman have a carry permit?<eos> I checked.<eos> He is a regular member of the Gun Club off Blue Diamond.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> GSR on guns is like paint-- it sticks around.<eos> Maybe long enough to transfer to his hands when he handled it last night.<eos> If the gun wasn't the murder weapon, though, why did Berman have it in the first place?
Go!<eos> Figured I'd find you out here.<eos> Hey, you saved all those men's lives today.<eos> Unfortunately, the evidence didn't fair so well.<eos> We lost DNA, prints.<eos> All the hardware was incinerated.<eos> Oh. Is that right, D.B.?<eos> Well, yes, Avery, it is.<eos> I found a photo of Susan's house on her phone.<eos> She never posted it to Friend Agenda.
You're confused.<eos> Susan is real, Kitty is not.<eos> I created Kitty.<eos> I made her.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> Is that a .45?<eos> I guarantee you it's never been fired.<eos> I've had bigger guns pointed at my face.<eos> Wait till you see my other gun.<eos> I saw it.
I believe in justice being done.<eos> You spend years helping people get through a corrupt system, you begin caring how it affects their lives.<eos> He called you two dozen times in 24 hours.<eos> What was so important?<eos> Tony feared for his life.<eos> Who was he so afraid of?<eos> A man by the name of Jacob Sims.<eos> He's the head of the Northsiders.<eos> While Tony was in prison,<eos> Sims took over his salvage yard and used it to traffic in stolen cars.
Here you go.<eos> Don't drink too much.<eos> Weird.<eos> What's that?<eos> They sent new instruction for the fishing inspectors.<eos> They're very strict now.<eos> Why did you come back from town?<eos> Kids have to go to school, there hasn't been one here for a long time.<eos> I have to sell the house.<eos> When I sell it, we're leaving.
You're gonna have to be more specific.<eos> Welcome, welcome.<eos> Wipe your feet on the way out.<eos> Deke, I'm warning you right now,<eos> I am not in a partying mood.<eos> Ain't no party like a Caroline party, 'cause a Caroline party don't start.<eos> I'm heavy with guilt, and that cheese omelet we just split.<eos> We're not partying, but I did snatch back the weed, 'cause I's perfect.<eos> Good.<eos> I got it from Earl, and he says it knocks you out so hard, he once used it and faked death to cash in a life insurance policy.
Julie.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Our date was weird, and I wanted to apologize.<eos> Yeah, it was weird.<eos> You were all jumpy and nervous and the sex conversation was really bizarre.<eos> Well, there was a reason why I was acting so weird, and it's difficult to talk about, but I need to be completely honest.<eos> I have chlamydia.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'm not even sure who I got it from.
I'll call Pearl.<eos> Ooh. Who's Pearl?<eos> She sounds young and hip.<eos> - She's our babysitter.<eos> - Oh! Where are we going?<eos> Nowhere because we are not going anywhere.<eos> I'm taking Debbie out to the city to a very special place, and it's a big surprise.<eos> You're really not gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> He's locked his lips with a key.<eos> And he's throwing it down the sink.
I couldn't.<eos> It were dirty.<eos> So?<eos> This flat's dirty.<eos> You're dirty.<eos> And if she stayed there she'd end up as a prossie.<eos> Or a miner.<eos> Or maybe both.<eos> Yeah, but... what's the alternative?<eos> You're looking at it.
If it were me, I'd open it up.<eos> Come on, man, be sociable about it.<eos> I don't want to be sociable when I'm reading... or shitting.<eos> That's the wrong attitude, dude.<eos> This isn't your average in-and-out shit house.<eos> This is an executive gentleman's toilet.<eos> What do you reckon, G man?<eos> Does the job, doesn't it?<eos> Grumio, where did you get that apple?<eos> Found it on the side there.

Hygeia, be praised.<eos> You not going to splash her face, as well?<eos> No, just yours.<eos> Right, that'll do.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> You can't just burst in here blowing out candles like it's your bloody birthday.<eos> I bought the medicine.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> I suggest you just take it before you do yourselves some real damage.
What are you doing?<eos> Just having a cheeky bid.<eos> What for?<eos> He can look after the horses while I'm at work.<eos> 65 with you, madam.<eos> How can we afford it?<eos> I'll remind you that you can pay in one lump sum or bite-size monthly instalments Bite-size monthly instalments.<eos> Back with you, sir, at 70.<eos> Ow! It's another of your impulse purchases.<eos> You already bought the aubergine. We'll eat it!
I'm extremely robust.<eos> Uh, yeah, sure.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> You're welcome very much.<eos> Just...<eos> Right. Hai-ya! Hai-ya!<eos> All right? Hey, guys. Can you give me a hand?<eos> Metella's left the key inside.<eos> I left the key inside with you.<eos> Then I left it inside on its own.
He's a bloody loony!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Shut your dirty mouths!<eos> Just leave them.<eos> Leave them, sirs, and they'll go away.<eos> Go away, as in die?<eos> In time, yes.<eos> You don't need them, sir.<eos> You don't need anyone - you've got me now. Where's the key?<eos> I swallowed it.
Tell him about the donations.<eos> All right, look, every friday, I put cash into a duffel bag and bring it to Wint community center, room 265, and they mark it down as a charitable donation in their account book.<eos> Ergo, laundering.<eos> So why should we believe you?<eos> I don't care who you believe.<eos> Just know I hate those dudes now.<eos> They carved up my territory so bad, I had to quit selling drugs, and I love selling drugs.<eos> It was my dream job.<eos> Sir, I filled out a warrant request to search the community center for the account book.<eos> I need you to sign it before I can take it to a judge.
That makes me happy.<eos> It's something we agree on.<eos> - I really want my kids to beg for it.<eos> - What?<eos> 'Cause if you force a kid into school, he's gonna hate it.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> If you make a kid work and sit in the yard and grind and grind<eos> - and grind...<eos> - What? eventually, that little kid is gonna beg for education.<eos> Then you hand it to them
- Bye.<eos> - If she gets arrested, are we gonna go to Pennsylvania to bail her out?<eos> - She's not gonna get arrested.<eos> - Yes, she is.<eos> You're late, so go.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> You met with a woman from our organization.<eos> She taught you that signal.<eos> That if someone said it, that meant you could trust them.
Doug.<eos> Ten feet away.<eos> It took him a whole year to notice me.<eos> Oh. "Oh"? No, I just...<eos> I'm sorry about what happened to him, to you.<eos> I just found out he cheated on me.<eos> I cheated on my wife.<eos> Why?<eos> Is there a good answer to that question?<eos> Hmm. I think I just heard it.
Okay, throw a horizontal mattress stitch, but careful with her tissues.<eos> They're extremely friable, so soft hands.<eos> You're on the right side of the table.<eos> You have one chance, or else you could rip through the aorta, which is essential to connecting the new heart when it arrives.<eos> Nope.<eos> Just take a breath, just throw the stitch.<eos> You can do this.<eos> I've never put a horizontal mattress in an aorta before... only in a bowel.<eos> From this side, I'll just tear through her native aorta.<eos> - Well, what if I tear through it?
Wait, Penny the school nurse is 30?<eos> That's why she got clingy.<eos> You know, I can't mess around like that.<eos> It's just... It's not me.<eos> I'm not that kind of girl.<eos> Well, you know, I feel like you and I never even got to figure out what we even had.<eos> It was just, like, over before it even started.<eos> And now there's this... obvious chemistry that I don't know what to do with.<eos> Oh, it's not up for discussion, Sam.<eos> You asked me a question and I answered it.
♪ Oh... ♪<eos> ♪ Someday maybe ♪<eos> ♪ If I stick it long enough ♪<eos> ♪ I may get to strut my stuff ♪<eos> ♪ Working for a nice man ♪<eos> ♪ Like a Ziegfeld or a Weissman ♪<eos> ♪ In a great big ♪ ♪ Broadway ♪ ♪ Show... ♪<eos> Excellent performance.<eos> Or it would've been, had the assignment been a duet.<eos> Apparently, you both feel that you are above this class and all that governs it.
My office, now.<eos> You could sit, you know.<eos> How's everything going with you? Hmm? What's this about, Sarge?<eos> You got a thing for your partner?<eos> No.<eos> 'Cause when I rolled up on that domestic today you were acting like a guy defending his girlfriend, not a police officer defending his partner.<eos> And the difference between the two could get you killed.<eos> He had knocked my partner to the ground.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> What I would've done is head over there and give her a hand if she needed it.
It means the American Dream is still alive.<eos> If a humble schoolteacher like Molly can achieve success, there's hope for a struggling artist like me.<eos> Yeah, top me off, Picasso.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> This inspires me to keep pursuing my dream of becoming a famous stand-up comedian with my own TV show.<eos> On cable, of course.<eos> That's where all the good stuff is done.<eos> Hopefully you'll be able to fill a comedy club better than you can a coffee mug.<eos> You really think I left Senegal in the wheel well of a cargo jet to serve you losers crappy food?<eos> He changes the story about how he got to America every time he tells it.
Don't buy the cow, if you can get a lactating stripper to give you the milk for free!<eos> Come on, Barry. Let's go.<eos> You know who would play me and you in the movie?<eos> Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.<eos> I'll be either one.<eos> Hey, Charlie.<eos> It's me, Walden.<eos> We never met, but I'm the guy who took your place.<eos> Thanks for giving up your house.<eos> I guess you didn't give it up.
Hold, please.<eos> - Patrick.<eos> - Yes, ma'am?<eos> Could you push my lunch?<eos> You've pushed it twice already.<eos> Don't make me do it again.<eos> I don't like your attitude.<eos> You're fired.<eos> Good.<eos> And just so you know, every time you made me run down the street to get your skinny latte, I put whole milk in it and stirred it with my finger.
A suite would be hunky-dory, my mint julep.<eos> Well, we have a lovely suite that overlooks the water.<eos> It has a great view.<eos> Perfect.<eos> My husband adores a great view.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Well, does a gator float on his belly in the bayou in the moon... all right, we'll see you later, darlin'.<eos> Bye, now.<eos> Tell me you saved that can.<eos> Crushed it and put it in my pocket.
Oh, he wants blood, But has recused himself.<eos> Now, as far as the press is concerned, He's going through a routine medical procedure. The good news is we've managed<eos> To keep a lid on the kidnapping so far.<eos> So what do we know about this woman?<eos> She's one of five significant warlords in the territory.<eos> Now, we don't know her place of origin, Date of birth or if Ulrika's even her real name,<eos> But we do know that she trusts no man Except for her right hand, Grigori Babishkova.<eos> Their base of operations is a former Soviet prison.<eos> It's a virtual fortress.<eos> The locals call it "the Citadel."
Give it back!<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> It's Lorna fucking Monroe!<eos> Are you crying?<eos> She was the year above me in high school.<eos> What?<eos> Your dad's going out with your high school girlfriend?<eos> Hoh! Hoh! She was never my girlfriend.<eos> I had a photo of her on my bedroom wall.<eos> Every day, I'd come home and look at it and I'd tug one off.
You already are one.<eos> Mom wanted to tell dad she dropped out, but after their impromptu hydrotherapy session, she was rethinking that choice.<eos> Can you hand me the toenail clippers?<eos> Okay, our time's up. Speaking as Mr. Barr's new attorney,<eos> I feel that your client's lawsuit is frivolous.<eos> Dad left mom's tub a new man, for better or for worse.<eos> Yes, I heard you were threatening to file a countersuit?<eos> It isn't a threat if we've already done it.<eos> Tell him, Mel. Drop the bomb.<eos> Yeah, actually, Richard, I didn't file it.
All right.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> That was my publisher.<eos> Uh, Juliette Barnes wants to meet with me tonight to discuss co-writes for her new album.<eos> Why are you saying that like it's a bad thing?<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Because I saw her and Jeff Fordham sneak out of the screening room at the BMI party last night.<eos> So, they watched a movie?<eos> Yeah, only it was NC-17, and they were both starring in it.
Keep it up.<eos> And have fun with this, you two.<eos> Great.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> And remember, just do whatever you'd ordinarily do.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay, roll camera.<eos> Are you ready to be your sweet self?<eos> Yep.<eos> And to kick this thing off on the right foot, I've got a brand-new song for my brand-new wife, who came into my life at just the right moment and changed it for the better.
You want to see inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, it's, you know, it's on the small side, but... Hey, you know, there's an office upstairs.<eos> I mean, it's got a lot of light, you know, and that's good for an art studio, right?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> I mean, I could fix it up a little bit.<eos> I mean, give me a project.<eos> I mean, the whole place needs a coat of paint.<eos> How'd you find it?
I guess you were never really onboard after all.<eos> What?<eos> I did the paperwork for Beck.<eos> I'm not talking about Beck.<eos> I'm talking about Jonathan Sidwell.<eos> Michigan Court of Appeals sound familiar?<eos> Harvey, he was gonna fire Louis.<eos> If that's the advice he was looking for from Louis, he'd have fired him anyway.<eos> And Jonathan would've found that loophole anyway.<eos> But instead he got it from you.
My advice is hold on tight and enjoy the ride.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> You said there was no way to stop what you did.<eos> This isn't a legal solution.<eos> It's a business solution.<eos> One where everybody wins.<eos> Everybody wins?<eos> That's what you said about Beck.<eos> So you want me to spin off my own company, I run it, he owns it?
Hands!<eos> Drop the wood.<eos> Walk.<eos> Walk!<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Don't look at me like that!<eos> I didn't start it.<eos> You force me to do all these things.<eos> And then, when it's finally over, you take the last thing that I give you and use it to kill my brothers.
"Hi, I'm Dr. Michaelson." You know, the whole drill.<eos> Oh, honey, could we get some more sparkling water?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I put my mask on.<eos> Tawny hands me the number two needle.<eos> I start to give the guy a novocaine shot.<eos> Well, I stick the needle in my own finger.<eos> And, yeah.<eos> And it hurt, but I didn't wanna look dumb, so I try it again.<eos> Next time I stick it in my thumb.
Thank you.<eos> I put my mask on.<eos> Tawny hands me the number two needle.<eos> I start to give the guy a novocaine shot.<eos> Well, I stick the needle in my own finger.<eos> And, yeah.<eos> And it hurt, but I didn't wanna look dumb, so I try it again.<eos> Next time I stick it in my thumb.<eos> Now I'm so flustered that I go to take my mask off.<eos> But I'm still holding the needle, jab it right in my face.
So, every time she finds a bullet hole, she's putting a cotton bud in there.<eos> And he's got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 bullet holes at least in his back.<eos> But as we discovered, when it comes to the favelas of Rio, the drug dealers aren't the only possible suspects.<eos> The government has only pacified about 20% of Rio's favelas, those surrounding the tourist sites and wealthy neighborhoods.<eos> Many of the remaining favelas are left to the mercy of militias.<eos> These Mafialike gangs made up of corrupt ex- and current policemen keep their areas in line and drug free through extortion, excising their own tax on residents, for things like electricity and water, and many times, through unrestrained violence.<eos> We had the chance to speak with one militia leader about Rio's drug and murder problem if we agreed to hide both his identity and the favela he controls.<eos> So, is it fair to say that the state is taking control of the favelas closest to the middle class areas, the rich areas, and the tourist areas, and they're leaving the rest to you and the traffickers?<eos> So, what would happen if you caught me selling marijuana in this neighborhood?<eos> And when you've taken an area, how do you keep control of it?
And I...<eos> - What happened?<eos> I think that-that Gabe turned him in.<eos> Vincent's been arrested for murder and Gabe turned him in?<eos> I broke up with him last night to be with Vincent, and now...<eos> You broke up last night?<eos> Can you stop repeating everything?<eos> Vincent needs the gem. Where is it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Think about where he might have hidden it.
I need to get into intake.<eos> Sorry, lady, no badge, no budge.<eos> Can I help you, ma'am?<eos> This is Lowan.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You got the wrong number.<eos> No, I don't have the wrong number, Gabe.<eos> We're supposed to be looking for the gem.<eos> It's not here.<eos> He buried it somewhere.
- What you saw wasn't real.<eos> He's not here.<eos> Meanwhile, it's a Harrison Ford movie over there.<eos> The good news is, only one guard saw him as a beast, and I think I put that genie back in the bottle, so...<eos> So, what about security cameras?<eos> What about flashing banners running across every TV screen shouting,<eos> "War Hero Turned Murderer now Fugitive"?<eos> - JT. I just don't understand.<eos> I tied that gem to him so tight, I thought he was gonna lose circulation.<eos> I think Vincent took it off on purpose.
- All of it?<eos> Yes, Withers, are you deaf?<eos> All of it!<eos> Not the caviar, obviously.<eos> I'll have that for lunch.<eos> I think Tilling will be very good for our drawing, Georgie.<eos> We were doing nothing but trees and clouds in Riseholme and they needn't be straight.<eos> Well, I've got the crooked chimney, the one beyond your house. - Yes.<eos> - Yes, I think I'll straighten it.<eos> Otherwise people might think I've drawn it crooked by accident.
Au reservoir.<eos> It's the deceitfulness that I find so objectionable.<eos> She practically kidnapped my poor guru outside of Twistevants, by all accounts, and frog-marched him up to Mallards.<eos> Serves you out for pinching him from me in the first place.<eos> She's interred the poor man in the spare room so that she alone can run him and be the High Priestess of all things mystic in Tilling.<eos> As you yourself wanted to be.<eos> Face it, Elizabeth, you just can't stand her winning.<eos> Everyone knows you sent her picture back out of spite.<eos> I did no such thing!<eos> You could tell she was a real artist as soon as you saw it and you were green with envy.
It's evident you haven't grasped the situation at all.<eos> Georgie...<eos> Oo not cwoss wiv poor Lucia?<eos> I was rather, but never mind that now.<eos> What am I to do?<eos> Che faro, in fact.<eos> For goodness' sake, don't talk Italian - it's that we're trying to avoid.<eos> It's odd we've got to break the habit of doing something - we can't actually do.<eos> - You're right, you can't have influenza as well.<eos> If we both had it as the Contessa arrived, that Mapp might easily put two and two together.
I can't.<eos> Arrivederci!<eos> Arrivederci!<eos> Ciao!<eos> - Ciao!<eos> - All right.<eos> Ciao, ciao!<eos> It all worked without a hitch.<eos> And it was Mrs. Brocklebank's letter that really clapped the lid on Elizabeth.<eos> I copied it out very carelessly, as though I scribbled it off without a thought.
Tim, this is the best image you've got?<eos> No other images exist of the address Cassie provided.<eos> Seems to be in some imaging dead zone.<eos> It's the same technology the CIA uses to keep you from snooping on Langley.<eos> So we're gunning for a paranormal supervillain holed up in his secret hideout with government-grade defenses?<eos> Hallelujah.<eos> Don't forget the place will be swarming with his personal guards.<eos> All ex-military.<eos> But first we have to get inside and the only way past the perimeter is with a lock coded to his DNA.<eos> - Meaning yours will unlock it?
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> I'm powerless.<eos> Regina's got my pendant.<eos> Want to meet your new uncle?<eos> I saw Regina take your dagger.<eos> - She gave it to Belle.
The M.E. just sent some preliminary findings.<eos> A small, torn plastic bag was found in the victim's digestive tract.<eos> Lab work on the bag found traces of powderized anthrax.<eos> Well, I guess we know how he got exposed.<eos> And why he died so quickly.<eos> Once that bag ruptured, the anthrax would have gone directly into the mucosal tissues of his GI system.<eos> Well, the question is, where did he get it?<eos> I didn't see anything about any terrorist ties in his criminal history.<eos> It's more likely he acquired the bag from one of his marks, assumed the powder was cocaine.<eos> And once the police gave chase, he swallowed it.
You said he came to the farm around 3:00 a.m.?<eos> The perimeter alarm went off.<eos> Uh, I got out of bed, grabbed my rifle, went out to take a look around.<eos> I found Eugene in the barn.<eos> He was wearing goggles.<eos> He had a mask over his mouth, like, uh, doctors wear.<eos> And he was dumping some kind of powder into the cattle feed.<eos> And I knew it was that anthrax you told me about.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> He wanted to infect the cows so that their milk would infect anyone who drank it.
I'm sorry he's gone, but his relapsing doesn't change a thing for you;<eos> not one single thing.<eos> You woke up today, you didn't use drugs, just like yesterday.<eos> You know what you have to do tomorrow?<eos> Wake up and not use drugs.<eos> That is just how it is; that is how it's going to be.<eos> Thank you. Are you quite finished telling me things I already know?<eos> Are you ready to start acting like you know them?<eos> I've decided I'm quite ashamed of my behavior over the last few days, all right?<eos> I took the passing of a dear friend, and I twisted it into an indulgence in narcissism.
Hmm. Your mother's not the only person succumbing to anthrax hysteria.<eos> According to the news, people all over the city are discarding their dairy products, whether or not they originated at the MacIntoshes' farm.<eos> Seriously?<eos> These expired a few days ago.<eos> Her text just reminded me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I feel sorry for that Bart MacIntosh.<eos> He said his farm was already on the ropes and it wasn't doing well, and now this.<eos> How unwell was it?<eos> He said the only thing keeping it afloat was subsidies from the government.
No.<eos> Do you mind if we take a picture?<eos> A picture?<eos> Have I done something wrong?<eos> Ok.<eos> Dennis.<eos> Ok. We good? Yeah, it's a good one.<eos> If you ever want to talk, uh,<eos> You can feel free to call me, night or day.<eos> Why don't you fucking mail it to me?
I postponed my wedding for 3 years because of what she needs.<eos> But she snuck off in the middle of the fucking night So she could be with them!<eos> And she needs them!<eos> The fucking ghosts!<eos> What the fuck are you talkin' about, man?<eos> What, dennis?<eos> Hey, chief, I found the truck.<eos> Where?<eos> It's, uh, in your driveway.<eos> Saw it when I was driving by,
Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuuuu-uuck!<eos> It's gonna be ok.<eos> How?<eos> Wayne told me.<eos> Howdy.<eos> Well, you gonna invite me in?<eos> What's your pickup truck doing in my driveway?<eos> I heard you were looking for it.
- No, no, you should go.<eos> I heard you doing your vocal exercises.<eos> You're in good voice tonight.<eos> The people deserve to hear you sing.<eos> Sriracha!<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you very, very much.<eos> Uh, we're gonna slow it down a little now.<eos> This song is for a special friend.<eos> Uh, we sang it once together.
What are we eating?<eos> Don't ask me.<eos> You guys seem to come and go whenever you want.<eos> Just have some cereal or something.<eos> Fuck that shit.<eos> I want an egg; I didn't do anything bad.<eos> Mom's on strike or something.<eos> Nice of you stop by, Ray.<eos> I put in a bid on that house.<eos> You think we'll get it?
You do that for me, and I'll let it lie.<eos> Ma'am, $275 is the-the lowest I can go.<eos> I-I mean, the prices are on the handlebars.<eos> There are cheaper bikes on Craigslist.<eos> Hey.<eos> If you could have any bike, what kind would you want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, tell me about your lifestyle.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> Well, where you gonna be riding it, hmm? Dirt, gravel?
Do we have to?<eos> Husband, let's go over the facts again to make sure that we're doing the right thing.<eos> Plus, it's smart to catch up those two Tim Allen fans who accidentally tuned in.<eos> Of course.<eos> We're barely on speaking terms with the Weavers.<eos> The community turned against me in favor of my brother, who convinced our 10-year-old genius to move to Boston so he can attend Harvard, and then gave our teenage son a pill to enable him to turn human.<eos> Where is it?<eos> ! Where's my pill?<eos> !<eos> I know you hid it, father.
Ah, but I have a plan.<eos> Dick.<eos> You wanted to see me, brother?<eos> As the youngest Zabvronian,<eos> Dick was born with a heightened sense of smell.<eos> You follow?<eos> No, but this is the kind of stuff I'm gonna miss.<eos> Dick, the pill was last inside this box.<eos> Actually, I'm pretty busy applying for Harvard, so... Ooh! Got it.<eos> He'll find it.
You especially today.<eos> Well, I don't think Joe wants me anywhere near this church today.<eos> Joe is not the only one who's lost someone.<eos> They're about to start and Joe isn't here.<eos> He can't miss his own sister's funeral.<eos> I'll find him.<eos> Hey, kiddo.<eos> Everybody's waiting for you back at the church.<eos> I'm looking for her bracelet.<eos> She always wore it.

In which case, I can see why you'd be upset because Deb never challenged you.<eos> Deb also never went to law school, yet here she is calling the shots.<eos> I'm trying to help a grieving man move on with his life.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> We are not here to be his shrink or to advise him on how to grieve.<eos> Have you ever considered that Seth might want to date again one day?<eos> And is his future girlfriend really gonna want his wife's dead body buried in the backyard?<eos> It is not healthy.<eos> Jane, you know I keep a photo of Deb in my office, right? Yes.<eos> Even when I was dating other women, I never took it down.

Come on, we'll put it in neutral and push it out.<eos> We can't.<eos> It's locked.<eos> Why would you lock it?<eos> Because I want to keep it.<eos> Okay, okay, we need to focus.<eos> How about we drive through the fence, across the neighbor's yard and out onto Sycamore Street?<eos> That's great except for the pool in the neighbor's yard.<eos> They have a pool?<eos> Why don't we use it?
As for right now, Director-- while there is some very dense forest in that area,<eos> I will request immediately that search plans are dispatched for recovery.<eos> Not recovery... rescue.<eos> Of course.<eos> If there are survivors, I can assure you, help is on its way.<eos> So, please, as you might say, gentlemen, sit tight.<eos> Sit tight?<eos> Just hung up with NSA.<eos> They're combing the airwaves.<eos> If that helo puts out a signal, someone will hear it.
Pepper, I'll call you back in 10.<eos> We need to talk, Agent Hill. May-<eos> A phone call would've done it, but I appreciate the discretion.<eos> Thought you'd like the night off.<eos> They must hate that you're going to work for Stark.<eos> Most of the intelligence community would like to drop me into a dark hole. But even they can't mess with Tony's army of lawyers.<eos> So, for now, we're privatizing global security.<eos> Wanna join?<eos> Coulson needs help.<eos> And he won't take it from me anymore.
There is no backup.<eos> It's over.<eos> There is no s.H.I.E.L.D. anymore.<eos> Grant Ward?<eos> My name's John Garrett.<eos> The quartermaster at your military school's an old buddy of mine.<eos> He told me about a pissed-off young cadet with off-the-chart eye-hand coordination who went awol, stole a car, drove over a thousand miles home only to try and burn the place down.<eos> I must say, I find a young man like that intriguing.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> Did you know your brother was in the house when you set it on fire?
I'm not drunk!<eos> The traffic was bad.<eos> That's why I'm late.<eos> - Where's my dressing room?<eos> - You're not going anywhere.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> - He wrote this song for me!<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> He wrote it for me!
Careful.<eos> Promise is a serious thing in this country.<eos> Mine too.<eos> Later tonight, all the fighting men of the Mackenzie clan would gather in the hall and make their oaths of allegiance to Colum.<eos> No one would be watching the stables.<eos> I was almost ready.<eos> Tonight would be my one and only chance to escape Leoch and return to Craigh Na Dun.<eos> I knew how I might dodge my shadows.<eos> I had my mount and my provisions.<eos> Now all I lacked was a weapon, should I need it.
Oskar and his brother, Jacob.<eos> They said it was just going to be a security team from the van company that would be following.<eos> And that there would be more money.<eos> That's why we weren't handing it over until we get more.<eos> Hand what over?<eos> The bloody shirt.<eos> The evidence bag.<eos> We told Oskar that he needed to come up with 200k or we were dropping it to the nearest police station.<eos> Where's the bag right now?<eos> My buddy Christian's got it.
- Hey. We're not doing that again.<eos> _<eos> Rubel.<eos> Hey, found some interesting stuff on Weston Steward.<eos> Last call he made was to a number in Rotterdam...<eos> GQR Industries. We know what the connection is?<eos> Working on it.<eos> They also found Steward's car parked a block away from Burkhardt's house, packed suitcase inside.<eos> Where's the suitcase?<eos> They just brought it in.
When the symptoms progress more... there will be a respiratory problem.<eos> In order to keep living, you will be required to be on a ventilator.<eos> Without a ventilator... in most cases, in three to five years from the onset of symptoms... patients will have paralyzed respiratory muscles and die.<eos> ALS.<eos> Yes.<eos> Correct, the name of the disease is ALS.<eos> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<eos> It's named as one of the most intractable diseases.<eos> I'm sure you are gravely scared.<eos> But it is important for you to understand the disease correctly... and accept it.
It's been a while...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you doing well?<eos> Yeah, how about you, Takuto?<eos> I'm doing fine.<eos> I'm sorry for calling you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I wanted to end...<eos> our relationship properly.<eos> I think I can end it now.
Did I miss my date?<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Well, a couple years ago, I went through a survivalist phase and I bought a manual and built a booby trap.<eos> No, how did you wind up in it?<eos> Same way you did.<eos> Were you drinking?<eos> Almost.<eos> Truth is, after Mae agreed to have dinner with me, all this pressure hit me like a tsunami.<eos> I could barely breathe.<eos> So I picked up a bottle, brought it home.
Were you drinking?<eos> Almost.<eos> Truth is, after Mae agreed to have dinner with me, all this pressure hit me like a tsunami.<eos> I could barely breathe.<eos> So I picked up a bottle, brought it home.<eos> But before I took a drink, I remembered what you said.<eos> How I have a lot to offer.<eos> How I didn't want to mess that up.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> So I poured it out, took a walk to clear my head and, bam, fell down a hole, stone-cold sober.
We've had all sorts stay here, including three presidents:<eos> Teddy Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, and Jefferson Davis.<eos> Not one had a complaint!<eos> - Jefferson Davis?<eos> - It's OK, Jackson.<eos> Really.<eos> He was just messing around. Weren't you, Vic?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just very proud of my heritage.<eos> Families really tamed this land, they made it into something.
- What's that?<eos> - It's the family vintage.<eos> See, like this brew, Hobb Springs is a testament to family.<eos> It's a place for our folk to gather from far and wide.<eos> With them came others.<eos> Like your friends came with you.<eos> And they bring temptation to stray.<eos> Weakened our family, muddied our blood.<eos> See, how do you preserve family strength?<eos> How do you keep it pure?
You can't keep following Adam down these terrible paths.<eos> Let me, let me help you find a real job.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, what would Adam do?<eos> We've always been partners.<eos> Well, maybe when he sees you've given up on the idea, he'll realize it's awful, too.<eos> Oh, come on, it wasn't the worst idea in the world.<eos> And no matter what you say, our food wasn't that bad.<eos> Hey, Deb. Uh, you know all that old food from the restaurant we tossed out back?<eos> I think the raccoons might've gotten to it, because I just found it all in a neat pile on the doorstep.
Then it won't be there.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> Fine... I'll do the bomb.<eos> Ooh! When we get back, let's eat the rest of that meat.<eos> No more barbecues!<eos> That's an order from the fire safety officer.<eos> But we've still got three-quarters of our goat left, and it's no' that nice raw.<eos> I don't care!<eos> No more barbecues!<eos> What if... we didn't cook it on a barbecue...
And at the worst possible time.<eos> Just when Decima is determined to make Samaritan operational.<eos> Maybe the timing's not a coincidence.<eos> I fear that it may be connected.<eos> These are strange times, and the threat of Samaritan should not be underestimated.<eos> How do you know it's not already up and running?<eos> Because we'd be dead, Mr. Reese.<eos> The machine is a shield.<eos> It protects lives.<eos> I designed it with safeguards to prevent it being abused as an agent of destruction.

No one's made an attempt on his life yet.<eos> The congressman doesn't even know the danger he's in.<eos> He knows now.<eos> Drive, Finch.<eos> I have to tell you, Mr. Reese,<eos> I don't approve of this strategy.<eos> You're the one who said you couldn't make an alias that would pass secret service muster.<eos> I said I didn't have time.<eos> I didn't know you were gonna steal the identity of an actual secret service agent.<eos> I'm just borrowing it.
How many?<eos> A lot.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I never dreamt it would come to this.<eos> Well, it has.<eos> Your machine... It sees something coming...<eos> Something bad... And it wants us to stop it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine, but you built it, and I trust you.
You know we've gotten dozens of results already.<eos> Any one of these guys is practically gift-wrapped.<eos> And we'll deliver.<eos> But not until after we've located Harold Finch.<eos> Where are we on that?<eos> Samaritan couldn't find a lead, sir.<eos> He may have skipped town.<eos> Should we consider turning on its higher, more cognitive functions?<eos> This thing has a mind.<eos> Why don't we use it?
Hold here until the light changes.<eos> The camera angle switches with oncoming traffic.<eos> Come on!<eos> John.<eos> When that light switches, we're screwed!<eos> We can't worry about irrelevant numbers now.<eos> What is it thinking...? Telling us to lay low then handing us a new number?<eos> - There's no time!<eos> - This is a life.<eos> And Finch would tell us to save it.
Mm-hmm, whining and crying.<eos> Took you, like, a week to clean it all up.<eos> Getting partial custody's done you good, Jess.<eos> Every other weekend and a day each week.<eos> Frankie doesn't have to hear his ma and me hollering at each other.<eos> Can't complain.<eos> And you're dry.<eos> Get my two-year chip in... three weeks.<eos> You coming to the meeting?<eos> Wouldn't miss it.
- We had evidence--<eos> - You had nothing!<eos> You locked him up under some loophole until it destroyed him!<eos> He lost his job, he lost his family.<eos> Innuendo turned out to be just as damaging as a conviction.<eos> He could never be cleared... because the government never pressed charges.<eos> Innocent people don't kill themselves, Mr. Brandt.<eos> No, people without hope do.<eos> And you robbed him of that.<eos> You took the wrong information and you twisted it.
- Ow. That l-looked like it hurt.<eos> - It's not funny, Bob!<eos> Check, please.<eos> I know that sounds like I'm saying, "Check, please,"<eos> but I actually should be going. So check, please.<eos> Uh-oh. My wallet is missing.<eos> Better start washing dishes.<eos> I hope I didn't lose it.<eos> I'd hate to have my identity stolen.<eos> I'm sure they'd give it right back.
the Little Boy Bandit.<eos> The Little Boy Bandit from the news.<eos> You've got to be kidding.<eos> Mom is a police psychic!<eos> Narc!<eos> I gotta go lay down.<eos> So you want me to help you catch the Little Boy Bandit?<eos> That's a big case.<eos> It's huge.<eos> And I don't want your help, I need it.
Yeah, he, he kept moving his lips like he wanted to talk.<eos> I was right over him, and he was staring up at me, and he kept... opening his mouth.<eos> I don't know, maybe he didn't see me there.<eos> I don't know.<eos> If I start making sense, will you tell me?<eos> You're making sense.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And he... reached up.<eos> He could still move his hand, and he grabbed mine.<eos> I asked him if he was all right, and he just kept holding my hand, kept squeezing it, while we were waiting for the paramedics to arrive.
But you are ill.<eos> You could do harm to yourself, to France.<eos> I have headaches.<eos> They come and go, but... My mind is sharper than it's ever been before.<eos> And the queen of the bean is nearly my Favorite event of the year.<eos> It will proceed, as usual.<eos> So any servant can become queen for the day?<eos> I don't remember this tradition.<eos> It's 'cause we were children.<eos> I think my mother hid it from us for a while.
Are you all right?<eos> What happened?<eos> Henry can be such a monster.<eos> Heartless and cruel.<eos> At least he had the courage to be cruel to my face.<eos> The rest of court sniggers Behind my back, as if I can't hear.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But thank you For what you've done for lola.<eos> I know it can't be easy.<eos> I had my chance, and I threw it away.
You're correct. Here's a suture line.<eos> Also a fracture.<eos> That's probably an expansion fracture caused by the heat during cremation.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> This is not an expansion fracture.<eos> It was caused by trauma.<eos> Trauma to the occipital could be cause of death.<eos> We'll need more of the bone before we can say that with certainty.<eos> Like finding a drop of water in a creek.<eos> But I'll find it.
How we've dreamt of this day.<eos> You didn't even know what it was till an hour ago.<eos> Is an hour's dream not a dream? Schneeberger is bad news.<eos> You don't want to work with that guy.<eos> No, you don't want to work with him, Sergeant! And you probably got some really good reasons we haven't heard yet.<eos> Why did we make him spokesman? - Because I get results.<eos> If that's okay with Pete.<eos> Can't you go talk to Schneeberger?<eos> - He is a weasel, guys.<eos> He dangles the spider in front of you, and then yanks it away so I have to go kiss his butt. Great.
Anyway... it's for non-lethal crowd control, blah, blah, blah.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Oh, I can't wait to see Sergeant Hill's face when he realizes he begged for this.<eos> And when he poops his pants. Wait, you're gonna be down there with them?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Alpha Company, in a moment a flag will appear.<eos> Your objective is to capture that flag.<eos> If you can.<eos> Is he warming it up for us?<eos> Are you warming it up for us, sir?
[Oliver]: Or homicidal.<eos> Wait. What date was that?<eos> Last year.<eos> I think this month...<eos> Oh... wow. Oliver.<eos> It happened a year ago on the 26th.<eos> I need a Yoo-hoo.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Norman, don't you get it?<eos> Charlie was with Kelly that day, all day, and he dropped his wallet, so whoever picked it up probably shot the Baker.
Anything else?<eos> Cavities, a real sweet tooth this gentleman.<eos> Thanks, Anchorena.<eos> - What are you looking at?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I brought the statement.<eos> Very kind of you.<eos> And I wanted to give you something,<eos> I realized later I'd left with it.
Acknowledge Cobalt Four Five.<eos> Cobalt Four Five, roger.<eos> Nothing further to report. Out.<eos> Emerald Seven Nine, SITREP.<eos> Nothing significant since last engagement at zero one hundred.<eos> Critical request for three fifty battery re-sup. Over.<eos> Requests at the end of the show.<eos> Up on the roof Bronze seven seven. Over.<eos> Go straight to RC South, Spud.<eos> When I want your opinion I'll fucking give it to you, Prosser.
That's diamond.<eos> I'm gonna fucking go all out.<eos> Aye?<eos> I... I haven't been legless since February.<eos> You don't need to fucking worry about that anymore, do you, Barlow?<eos> I'm gonna be fucking legless every night, now.<eos> Ken Barlow.<eos> Hey, lads.<eos> I just realised, we don't need to worry about the third mine anymore.<eos> Good old Ken's fucking found it for us.
We've been through this.<eos> They wrote grant proposals together.<eos> She was helping him raise money.<eos> You know, on our warrant, we were able to look not only at your husband's personal e-mails on his computer but also CryoNova's.<eos> Yeah, there are eight e-mails here where your husband asked Madeline if they could meet privately.<eos> My husband and I are very much in love.<eos> Really? Because on these two here, he asked to meet her at a motel.<eos> And they're all dated four months ago.<eos> When Madeline disappeared, they worked together closely, they were falling in love.<eos> You saw an opportunity and you took it.
Huh. Thank you.<eos> Guess we should take a closer look at Mrs. Daniels.<eos> I guess you're right.<eos> You are so wrong about the lyrics.<eos> No, I've heard that song a bajillion times.<eos> My mom loves that song.<eos> It's "crystal ball."<eos> I know what I'm talking about.<eos> Yeah, well, my mom loved it, too.<eos> Her and my dad used to put it on and get tipsy.
You want me to do a draft of your remarks for the service?<eos> You ask me every time, Garrett.<eos> And I'm gonna keep asking.<eos> Some things you can't delegate, even a piece of.<eos> But you could take a look at it when I'm done.<eos> Castillo?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Last night Sergeant Gormley went to collect Steve Tomlin's things, but somebody got there first.<eos> Locker was completely empty.<eos> Someone sanitized it.
She jumped out of the way, and he ran over her bike.<eos> Didn't even stop.<eos> I scraped my knee.<eos> At that point, we decided to take matters into our own hands.<eos> I... rented a cement mixer, and Michael and I installed speed bumps.<eos> The cars slowed down, but then one of the DWP employees complained to the city, who removed the bumps.<eos> Then the city sent us a bill for their cleanup work.<eos> $75,000.<eos> We don't have that kind of money.<eos> Our home has been in the Maxwell family for three generations, and now the city's saying they're gonna take it from us if we don't pay up.
It doesn't sound silly to me.<eos> For months, I've been bullied by the squad... mostly the head cheerleader, Ally Roth.<eos> And since I'm the new girl, I figured there'd be some hazing, but...<eos> It's been far worse than I ever imagined.<eos> - How so?<eos> - Well, for starters,<eos> Ally's always harshing on my body.<eos> When I skipped a voluntary practice, she left me a message promising to...<eos> "Whip my fat ass into shape."<eos> And then, the other day, I was eating a cookie, and she grabbed it out of my hand and shoved it down my pants... said it was going straight to my hips anyway.
Okay, then.<eos> Let's go inside and pledge our allegiance to the Democratic Republic of Maxwell.<eos> Chelsea, how were you treated when you joined the Breaker girls?<eos> Like an outsider.<eos> Ally and the others picked on me as soon as I arrived.<eos> Really?<eos> How so?<eos> If I sat at their table, Ally would get up, and the rest of the squad would follow.<eos> They made fun of my makeup, my clothes.<eos> Ally even told me the wrong time for the annual picture so I'd miss it.
Ah, did you give them the old Jane Bingum staredown?<eos> No, I get them the Deb Dobkins hair flip.<eos> Trust me, they're scared.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I thought you went cold turkey on the baby clothes.<eos> No.<eos> That deal's over because Owen couldn't keep his promise.<eos> He's not wearing the fit clip?<eos> Worse.<eos> He gave it to Paul.
I am so sorry.<eos> Sam, with your permission, I would like to try and go back to court.<eos> We won't let you say our son has a mental disorder.<eos> No, we're dropping that argument.<eos> I never should have used it to begin with.<eos> I want the judge to hear from Sam.<eos> In your own words.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> I had...<eos> I bound her wrists, and I tied her up tight, and then I grabbed a pillow, and I... held it over her face for two, maybe, uh, three minutes until...
There's, uh, good blood flow to the liver, and the other bleeding has stopped.<eos> She's got a long road ahead of her, but, uh, it's looking good.<eos> Where the fire department is still working hard to clean up the mess left by a bomb that went off at 8 o'clock this morning, leaving 18 dead...<eos> How many survivors they pull out?<eos> I just heard over two dozen.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Chicago will bounce back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She always does.<eos> We'll give you more information as we get it.
Hey, lass, if you're still able to walk, Jamie isna doing his duty by ye!<eos> If she's worn ye out already, Jamie, I'll be more than happy to fill your place.<eos> Bit of a curse and give us peace.<eos> Better go back inside, Sassenach.<eos> Until they've had their fun, they'll no leave us alone.<eos> Oh, Jamie, how was your first time?<eos> Did ye bleed?<eos> No, but you will, you bugger, ye dinna haud yer wheesht.<eos> Hey, while you're filling your face, maybe I'll go upstairs and fill mine, hey?<eos> Maybe-- maybe I'll fill it with my fist, huh?

I controlled it.<eos> Okay, I'm not gonna lie.<eos> It is scary, worrying about what the person you love is doing while you're a million miles away, but it's worth the risk.<eos> And Sam respects me.<eos> And if that makes me a romantic and not a realist, well, that's the way that I'm choosing to live my life.<eos> Look, guys, I'm committed to Mercedes, okay?<eos> She's the one.<eos> I'm not gonna screw it up.<eos> Look, being in love is amazing, and when you have it, it's terrifying to let it go, but sometimes the best chance you have of staying together is by being apart for a while.<eos> Rachel's one of those people that, when she sets a goal, she doesn't stop until she gets it.
Crispin, do you hear me?<eos> Where is Mom?<eos> NO!<eos> NO! NO!<eos> First, do no harm.<eos> Things have changed.<eos> Have they?<eos> Take a remote village, say 200 years ago.<eos> Residents are manifesting strange symptoms.<eos> Dying, fear and superstition rule the day, and a curse is blamed until someone like you or me shows up and, through a scientific process of elimination, traces the disease to a source and destroys it.
We haven't flown in two years.<eos> Miles are meaningless.<eos> They're obviously not meaningless.<eos> - Yes, they are.<eos> - Why do you keep saying that?<eos> OK, then.<eos> Just wait. Oh...<eos> Can you pull my wallet from the front?<eos> - I got it, I got it.<eos> I did, I did, I did. - You got it?
Statements from the Moonies.<eos> I didn't check the spelling.<eos> Oh, Dennis has your priest in the war room.<eos> Gonna give him your confession?<eos> Hey, Matt.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> So... where were you two nights ago?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, according to the hospital, you had a rock thrown at you a couple months ago, one aimed at the G.R.<eos> Then they repaid your generosity by buying up your church out from under you, and they painted it white.
You go ahead and hold on to all of that, OK?<eos> You should be hearing from one of our field guys soon.<eos> In how long?<eos> Uh, 4 to 6 weeks.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Or, if you want, we could just eliminate the infestation.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I can have 3 vans full of armed agents there by the end of the week.<eos> They pay a visit to whatever compound these fucks call home, and they get you the results you're lookin' for.<eos> Chief... this shit spreads if you let it.
Yeah, I'll believe that when he flies.<eos> JOYCE: Listen, as long as my name's on the deed, my parasites have a home.<eos> Uh, I'm your husband. I don't have a say in this?<eos> Second husband.<eos> Our real daddy is in heaven.<eos> Oh, I am so sorry.<eos> It was 25 years ago, move your hand.<eos> Ooh, very protective of the younger, sexy sister.<eos> Interesting.<eos> You know, even a strong man, you sit him in front of a piece of cake long enough, he's gonna eat it.
I need to borrow $135,000.<eos> What?<eos> They're gonna sell the church.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know it's a lot of money, but it'd just be a loan.<eos> Things are changing, people are ready to come back.<eos> I just performed a baptism this morning.<eos> I hate coming to you, but this is our family church, Mom and Dad's...<eos> No, Matt, it's your church.<eos> They left it to both of us.

The same way he walked into Carlos' store to exchange the muffler.<eos> And for some reason, he feels the need to interact with his victims in the hours before they die. Aah! Aah!<eos> It's not an emergency, really.<eos> I just want to file a complaint against some kids in the neighborhood.<eos> Hold on, ma'am.<eos> I'm transferring you.<eos> Ok.<eos> Uh-huh. These kids are how old?<eos> And can you tell me the nature of the note?<eos> Can you read it to me?
Come on, man, give me the stuff.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Here you go.<eos> No, no!<eos> We just went through the preacher's house.<eos> No one's in there.<eos> But I did find cocaine in a hidden compartment.<eos> How much?<eos> A kilo.<eos> With that amount, he's not just using it, he's selling it, too.
We were hoping that he wrote the song for someone he fell in love with.<eos> I've never heard that song.<eos> - Could I listen to it?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> We can't.<eos> Well, could you tell me... was it...<eos> Beautiful?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> - It was so beautiful.<eos> Whoever he wrote it for, he loved her very much.
Maybe this was one of those things.<eos> Hey, would you like to hear it?<eos> Sure. Why not?<eos> I had a second cousin that could only communicate using words to songs by Barry Manilow.<eos> I'm afraid I don't remember who that is, either.<eos> - ♪ the days that broke ♪<eos> - Stop. Stop. Turn it off.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> I didn't write that song.<eos> I've... I've never heard it before.
The new Denver branch supervisor, Glynis Rucker.<eos> You people are hard to find.<eos> I mean, so far from everything.<eos> Who would've thought?<eos> You must be Rita.<eos> I've heard so much about you!<eos> My name is Kimmi.<eos> Kimmi Cooper!<eos> Anyway, I have a letter.<eos> This guy on my route found it, but the address is mostly missing, so.
It was the same place where Ellie's grandparents got married.<eos> It had lights hanging from the rafters.<eos> As we danced, our guests threw flowers.<eos> Ellie, she thought it sounded magical.<eos> If Ellie wanted a wedding just like yours, with lights and flowers...<eos> Then maybe...<eos> Is there someone we can call to see if she's up there?<eos> No.<eos> It's just an old barn.<eos> There's no record of a marriage license being granted, but if they just submitted it, it wouldn't be in the system yet.
Pardon.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Weather's turning.<eos> No, no.<eos> My cousins... will look after you.<eos> I've sent them word.<eos> Start a new life.<eos> And be happy.<eos> A letter of credit has come from your father to the bank where I work.<eos> With your word, I'll sign it, and your dowry will be moved to your husband's accounts.
I think we need to go to a sweat lodge.<eos> We need to purge of this toxic crap.<eos> I say she needs to buy things, you dirty hippie.<eos> Here's the upside.<eos> It's over with Jake. You know you can move on.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> I mean, Jake's angry because...<eos> - Screw that.<eos> Why aren't you exploring?<eos> Use your sexual amnesty while you have it.
I got Frankie setting up a line search.<eos> - Anything else?<eos> - I've got footprints heading up the hill.<eos> - Yeah, two sets.<eos> - And we have blood drops.<eos> Okay, so... he was shot and then took off running with someone chasing him.<eos> - .30-30.<eos> Who leaves a murder weapon where we can find it?<eos> Somebody who thinks it doesn't matter.<eos> I'll get CSRU to process it.
- Did he say "life coach"?<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> I found someone who worked with Ulrich six years ago.<eos> He said he was a good guy but kept to himself.<eos> Did he know what he'd been doing since he lost his job?<eos> Someone on the plant floor said that they saw him go into a soup kitchen near the steelyard awhile back.<eos> Word was he lost his house and was living out of a storage unit.<eos> - Did you check it out?<eos> - The unit was empty.<eos> Manager said he'd cleaned it out two days ago.
- We got a hit on the rifle.<eos> It belongs to John Brooks, a 39-year-old white male with a record of drunk and disorderly conduct and assault.<eos> - We have a current address?<eos> - Yeah, D street in Southie.<eos> I guess lunch will have to wait.<eos> Guess again.<eos> - That's the best reuben I've ever had.<eos> - Also is with the meat.<eos> O'Malley's cures their own corned beef.<eos> Why do they call it corned beef?
Where did you meet him?<eos> Bayview diner in Southie.<eos> - Frankie's looking for us.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thank you very much, Steve.<eos> So, what did this guy do?<eos> Well, let's just say you're lucky this is the one job you didn't get.<eos> I sent the photo to the local sheriff where the farm was located.<eos> He remembers the family that owned the place, the Danielsons.<eos> According to bankruptcy records, the dad, Harry, lost it to the bank in 1984.
There is love here, Mrs. Woodhull.<eos> I know because I know what its absence feels like.<eos> - Is the owner here?<eos> DeJong?<eos> - No, but I can get him.<eos> - Whatever they said I did, it's not true.<eos> - That's enough out of you.<eos> Tell him we're taking his cellar as a temporary jail.<eos> Orders of the major.<eos> I need you to open it.
You mean the mercy of the rebels like the one they've got locked up down below.<eos> Figures that it's a Brewster.<eos> I'm married to a Brewster.<eos> Moses?<eos> Moses, do you still have it?<eos> - What?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> The petition.<eos> You do, don't you?<eos> Well, I suggest you put it to the fire and run while you can.
But I suspect there are others who will prove of more interest to you.<eos> - The petition?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It seems we finally have the means to capture the rest of the cabal.<eos> Arrest every name on this list if they are still in town.<eos> Order Appleton to start building gallows for 10.<eos> And arrest Mr. Paine.<eos> But I brought you this information of my own free will.<eos> No doubt to save your own skin.<eos> If you'd have brought it earlier, you could've saved another life.
♪ They call me Katie Cruel... ♪ Open!<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> But laws, in their more confined sense, denote the rules.<eos> Not of action in general, but of human action or conduct.<eos> That is the precepts by which man, the noblest of all sublunary beings... a creature of both reason and free will... ♪ Ooh... ♪ Has no rule to pursue, but such as he prescribes to himself.<eos> These men betrayed our trust.<eos> These men plotted murder.<eos> These men conspired.<eos> Now, what is the nature of conspiracy?<eos> What defines it?
You preach against me in my own church?<eos> Well, then repent.<eos> Just repent and silence me.<eos> - How dare you, boy?<eos> - I dare because I'm the son of the man that you almost killed.<eos> You were well-equipped for the task as well, weren't you?<eos> I remember the war stories you told when I was a boy.<eos> His years fighting the French and the Iroquois.<eos> This is your musket, is it not?<eos> I don't deny the weapon's mine, but I deny I used it against your father or any man.
Oh... so that's why you've been MIA.<eos> I was worried things were weird or something.<eos> No, why would anything be weird?<eos> Well, we've gotta toast to your mom and keep toasting.<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Scott.<eos> How fun would it be for you to buy me another round with your magical ID?<eos> Whoa... lots.<eos> If you have it with me.
But screw it, it's the 4th, and I'm gonna make Ian take me out.<eos> There she is.<eos> Goddamnit.<eos> Ian, I'm sorry I'm late, I...<eos> Even though you're leaving, I admire the commitment to your job.<eos> I'm not... I'm not leaving.<eos> I lost the scholarship.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My, uh... your dad revoked it.
Are you kidding me?<eos> Jared never did representational work, never mind portraits.<eos> He thought it was just a bullshit way to immortalize rich people.<eos> One last thing... do you know where Jared was last night?<eos> At home playing Xbox with me.<eos> I can show you the time stamps on his Assassin's Creed" scores.<eos> If I'd have known he was gonna die, I would have let him win.<eos> Kaos couldn't have been the thief if he was at home with his girlfriend.<eos> So whoever hired him must have stolen the painting.<eos> And maybe forged it, too.
-What did you do with "the Reclining Muse"?<eos> - Can I go?<eos> No.<eos> You forged a painting that was used in a federal crime.<eos> That crime led to two murders.<eos> Yeah, that's mine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's start at the beginning.<eos> Why did you forge the painting?<eos> The guy wanted it.
So where is it now?<eos> I burned it.<eos> - Daniel.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Close the door.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about Teddy Brennan?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He's in custody at the FBI.<eos> He just confessed to stealing the painting.<eos> He says he brought it to you.
He's protecting you.<eos> From what?<eos> Come on.<eos> Agent... Agent Moretti is smart.<eos> She's gonna... she's gonna figure out what I just did.<eos> I mean, right now, she's probably giving Teddy a polygraph.<eos> If it shows up that... that he's That he's telling the truth about bringing you the painting but lying about burning it, she's gonna show up here with a search warrant.<eos> There's no way I can help you unless you're honest with me.<eos> Okay, Teddy did come here.<eos> He did try and give me the painting, but I didn't take it.
Is there a chance we ran into you guys and it was a coincidence?<eos> Well, of course.<eos> You might be spies that Talos sent.<eos> I have no idea, so I would just rather not talk to you at all.<eos> I understand that.<eos> Are you guys soldiers?<eos> Let me put it this way:<eos> We're not spies.<eos> You're gonna have to trust me sometime.<eos> Give me a straight answer, you'll earn it.
Open your eyes, and see your future.<eos> ALBS Arachnoid Class Land Battleship.<eos> Serial number, 000.<eos> System initiating.<eos> Incredible.<eos> It's sad you don't understand the reason why you were made.<eos> Engine ignition begun.<eos> All personnel should evacuate main chamber.<eos> Engine ignition begun.<eos> You created a city and named it Olympus... believing that would make you all gods.
It gets you VIP access to places you wouldn't normally get to go to, like early entrance to the Barney's Warehouse Sale.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> And 20 bucks a day until we find it a permanent home.<eos> I can get money from Allen any time I need it.<eos> Then what do you want?<eos> How well can you forge Allen's signature?<eos> Better than he can.<eos> Fine.<eos> Sign it on the bottom of that blank piece of paper.<eos> What are you gonna use it for?
Oh, boy... I poked a hornet's nest, didn't I?<eos> Am I the only professional here?<eos> Well, this bladder seems to be intact, which means I'll be able to run a tox screen.<eos> Has Dr. Hodgins returned from the crime scene?<eos> I need these wounds swabbed.<eos> He's still there, looking for fingernails and any other particulates<eos> - that'll tell us who this victim is.<eos> - The skull is intact.<eos> So how long do you think it'll take you to get an I.D.?<eos> As soon as Brennan gives it to me, I can...
So there was an electrochemical reaction that fused the coins to the bone.<eos> These will be difficult to remove without damaging the bones. Ooh.<eos> The tissue on the femur, Cam.<eos> According to the locals, this area hosts family picnics by day and underage drinking by night.<eos> Your booties. Booties.<eos> How considerate. So how do you even know this is a murder?<eos> The deceased could've been sitting on the edge, fallen in after drinking too much.<eos> A test?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, there are drag marks that go all the way from the trail all the way over to the well here. And if you look at the grate, it shows signs of stress, as if someone stomped it in.
You still going to keep all this from him?<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Well, there's perimortem fractures on the eighth and ninth ribs and to the sternum.<eos> No remodeling.<eos> So it happened just before he died.<eos> I've seen similar fracture patterns caused by aggressive CPR.<eos> Why would a killer try and revive someone they wanted dead?<eos> Quite simple: Torture.<eos> They wanted information, but they accidentally killed him.<eos> And if it's still on that nipple ring, he clearly didn't give it to 'em.
And hold fire until ordered!<eos> - Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> - Yes?<eos> The magistrate is requesting access into the camp.<eos> Richard, you shouldn't be here.<eos> Have you seen my son?<eos> Is he in the town?<eos> Let's get you inside. Hey. Will you burn your hometown now, Tallmadge?<eos> It's the king's men who are burning it, but take heart, we'll have them out soon enough.
What I wanted?<eos> I didn't wanna give you my opinion at all, but you forced it out of me, and then you told me that you were gonna take the job.<eos> Okay, Rachel--<eos> No, and now you come in here, and you tell me you're gonna stay a fraud.<eos> - A lawyer.<eos> - A fraud.<eos> What happened to accepting me for who I am?<eos> What happened to you taking the job?<eos> It was a way out.<eos> You said you were afraid if you told me your opinion, I'd hold it against you, but now that I'm not doing what you told me to, you're holding it against me.
I never wanted to work for you.<eos> I wanted to be you.<eos> The best thing that ever happened to me was you walking away from our wedding.<eos> It made me stand on my own two feet.<eos> I am better for it.<eos> You are better for it.<eos> - Will you just hold...<eos> - So why bring me here?<eos> Why offer me a job you know I can't resist?<eos> You gonna dangle the carrot, and I'm supposed to chase at it until you snatch it away?
My son, if you truly believe that of your own father, then go to the general court and denounce me.<eos> Even if they believed you, there isn't a single man who'd condemn me for doing God's will in clearing the wilderness for his chosen people.<eos> And how are you preserving our independence?<eos> By never challenging Charles Stuart, and never asking him for anything.<eos> Even in the war when the savages were massacring us by the hundreds, burning our towns, we never asked for his help.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because we don't want English troops in Massachusetts.<eos> He'd use them to crush us the way he did your friends in Oxford.<eos> I need some fresh air.<eos> The Indians burned our town, because we agreed to share the land and then we took it from them.
We're seeing a lot of each other, Eli.<eos> Are you sleeping with Finn Polmar?<eos> Ask me another question.<eos> I don't have any other questions.<eos> Then go to hell.<eos> There is a photo of Finn leaving your apartment.<eos> Where?<eos> - Outside your apartment.<eos> - No. Where's the photo?<eos> Peter had it.
I was gonna have you drug-tested.<eos> A drug test?<eos> That would make sense, Holly.<eos> If we can prove that you were drugged...<eos> You can prove I'm not a liar?<eos> No one thinks you're lying.<eos> So now this woman knows about it.<eos> And soon the entire Navy will know about it?<eos> I would never tell a soul.<eos> If we found a drug in you, Farrell, we might have traced it to whoever attacked you.
I gave you a civil opportunity to meet me at the Star Inn to discuss matters.<eos> ~ But my son, he... ~ I do not have time for game playing.<eos> The King's life depends on it.<eos> So you say. Perhaps if you had told me the truth from the start, instead of inventing Edward Wickes...<eos> And allow you to warn Lord Hanford that we were observing him?<eos> I think not.<eos> Now that you've had time to calm yourself, I trust you will see sense.<eos> Hanford's visitor carries a box with him at all times.<eos> It's red and about so big.<eos> I need you to get it for me.
Sarah!<eos> David, come on!<eos> Run, Hannah!<eos> Hanford's visitor carries a box with him at all times.<eos> It's red.<eos> I need you to get it for me.
Think I'll survive. Let's hope so.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> I don't want anything to do with you.<eos> You don't have a choice, vince.<eos> You and I need to talk.<eos> We have to work this out... Together.<eos> I'll see you at 8:00.<eos> That was a long run. Where were you? My mom just called me.<eos> What's this picture they're showing around?<eos> Why haven't we seen it? Well, we have seen it.

I love my work, and I'm sharing it with you because I love you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> The rod that holds up the shower curtain just broke out of the wall.<eos> - Well, maybe Norman can hold it up for me while I fix it.<eos> Okay.<eos> So how did you... How did you break the curtain rod, Sheriff?<eos> Well, one of those rings was stuck in here, and I just... I jiggled it a little too hard.
One way or another, we're doing what Rick does.<eos> We're not splitting up again.<eos> What he said.<eos> We want to roll with you, but...<eos> what she said.<eos> How'd you survive here for so long?<eos> Where did your supplies come from?<eos> Luck.<eos> Our annual canned food drive.<eos> Things fell apart right after we finished it.
I'm fine now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I- - I panicked.<eos> - I told you I--<eos> - You knew her when she was alive?<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> You only tell your sins to God.<eos> Do you miss the sword?<eos> Wasn't really mine in the first place.<eos> Found it in the very beginning.
What did you just do?<eos> I saved our integrity.<eos> No, no.<eos> You ruined my chance to make a name for myself.<eos> And meet hot Maxim girls at Maxim parties.<eos> I guess the only upside to any of this is I'll never have to see you again.<eos> Well, I don't care if we're never famous.<eos> I'd rather sit home with my cat and scrapbook horse pictures with my head held high.<eos> You know what?<eos> If your life wasn't already such a complete train wreck, I would ruin it.
His way, he's gonna be too full when he's making love to the hooker.<eos> Good answer, Wayne.<eos> To a much scarier question.<eos> No, no.<eos> Gene was still operating under a prison mentality.<eos> Didn't anybody counsel you before you got out?<eos> Some guy in the weight room told me to stay hydrated.<eos> Has anybody ever talked to you guys about the frustrations of dealing with society after you get out?<eos> Only once.<eos> And by the way, we don't call it society in here.

Why are you doing this?<eos> Are you trying to avoid property taxes?<eos> You know, I should have died and left it to you in my will.<eos> It would have been a lot more pleasant than this.<eos> Dr. Pierce?<eos> Uh, Agent Moretti called.<eos> She needs you down at the FBI as soon as possible.<eos> You know what, Dad?<eos> Keep your house.<eos> I don't want it.
- He's okay.<eos> The thief let him go, but he's only 12.<eos> His mother says he has something called Williams syndrome.<eos> Yeah, it's a chromosomal disorder... causes learning disabilities, lower I.Q., visuospatial impairments, but it's often accompanied by striking musical and verbal abilities.<eos> Yeah, this kid's really friendly.<eos> I just hope he doesn't make you uncomfortable.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> A brain doctor! Whoa!<eos> I like your scarf.<eos> Why do you wear it inside?
- How...<eos> - I promise you... nobody's gonna sell this house faster than I can.<eos> I can already think of several clients who'd be very interested.<eos> Okay, look, I-I'm busy, okay?<eos> So if you... if you want to sell the house, go talk to my father.<eos> In the meantime, please get the hell out of here.<eos> Just think it over, okay?<eos> Your hardwood floors are lovely, by the way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you don't want your father's house, why don't you sell it and donate the money to charity?
Marine, put the camera down.<eos> ♪ NCIS 11x22 ♪ Shooter Original Air Date on April 29, 2014<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> This is the photo taken last September by Marine photojournalist Staff Sergeant Martin Roe.<eos> He's known as Shooter.<eos> He was assigned to a joint Army/Marine task force in Farah Province.<eos> I saw the photo in the Post.<eos> How did it get out?<eos> Roe gave it to the task force commander.

- I'm Pedro.<eos> - Walter.<eos> Well, since this is your first time, you must let me buy you a drink in this great tavern in town.<eos> Well, it has been a long walk.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Great.<eos> I've never actually waited for an autopsy before.<eos> Are they usually this long?<eos> I'm sure they can take longer.<eos> If it wasn't for you, Campo wouldn't have ordered it immediately.
- What do you mean?<eos> Well, they got into the security room and fried all the surveillance footage from inside the system.<eos> All right, so we got no cameras inside, but what about footage from street cameras?<eos> We are collecting that now.<eos> Are you looking for something in particular?<eos> Well, if all three victims were shot in the middle of the store, why didn't it attract the attention of anyone out there?<eos> - Maybe they blocked the window.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Major, there's something else.<eos> The safe is back there, but it appears they left it alone.
Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Whose experience on the front lines confirmed his belief that the survival of the nation depends on a powerful military.<eos> MacArthur, as Chief of Staff of the Army, believed that the Army needed to be strong, and MacArthur, not for the first time, nor for the last time, took issue with the position of his Commander-in-Chief.<eos> Mr. President... the budget discussions are over.<eos> If you look particularly at Franklin Roosevelt and Douglas MacArthur, those are two very big egos... like tectonic plates moving.<eos> One is a hugely self-confident General trying to do what he thinks is right, and then you've got a President who has turf that he wants to protect.<eos> There will be a next war, Mr. President, and when we lose it and our American boys are lying in the mud with an enemy bayonet through their belly, I want the last name they curse, the last name to pass from their dying lips, to be Roosevelt.
The, uh, Tomorrow People. John and Cara.<eos> I assume you're still in contact.<eos> The only reason I ask is I want to formalize our ceasefire.<eos> The shadow war between Ultra and all paranormals is over.<eos> Okay, uh... I'll let them know.<eos> I'd prefer to meet with them myself.<eos> Convince them of my intentions.<eos> Yeah, that would be nice, but the last time John was in Ultra, you tortured him.<eos> And John murdered your father.<eos> War is a nasty business, Stephen, and the quicker we put an end to it, the better.
Only when they are independent are they free to ask the right questions.<eos> Research is the same, that's what we're fighting for.<eos> That's why Liber8 finds a sympathetic ear.<eos> The answers that you're looking for, they're right over there.<eos> He has something to tell you.<eos> I found the gun.<eos> I thought I'd hold onto it, maybe sell it.<eos> Rebecca told me I had to get rid of it.<eos> Did you?<eos> He brought it to me.
I thought I'd hold onto it, maybe sell it.<eos> Rebecca told me I had to get rid of it.<eos> Did you?<eos> He brought it to me.<eos> I dumped it here, called the police, tipped them off and waited for them to arrive.<eos> Look, I know you two had history.<eos> Rebecca wasn't bad, she was an idealist, and now she's a dead terrorist.<eos> She only gets to be that one thing.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> The gun didn't find it's way under that boy's pillow until they put it there.
You invite...!<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> What's up with your lips?<eos> You been sucking face with a clown?<eos> Don't you have bigger fish to fry?<eos> Why didn't you call us?<eos> I can't bother you two with every little thing that pops up.<eos> Since when?<eos> You call Mike every time the milk smells funny.<eos> I bought it at that Asian market.
It reminds me of being back in Senegal.<eos> They used to send us these tapes for free. ♪ Elvira. ♪ (doorbell rings)<eos> What?<eos> Mike's only had the car one day.<eos> Somebody's got to get me to church.<eos> Apparently I've been banned from the senior shuttle.<eos> Palsy or not, you play footsie with me, your cane's going out the window.<eos> So, you walked eight blocks here instead of six blocks towards the church in the other direction?<eos> I'm surprised you know where the church is.<eos> I'm surprised they don't move it so you don't.
Hi. Can you please get Jenny some free birth control samples?<eos> I think I can do that.<eos> And let's teach her that rhyme to remember to take the birth control pill.<eos> (Both) "When I need to take the pill, I look upon the windowsill."<eos> Oh, my God, I haven't taken my birth control in, like, two weeks.<eos> Well, luckily for you, someone's been grinding it up and putting it in your coffee.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Bye.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> Get someone to grind up your birth control and put it in your coffee.
Things are starting to happen, Lizzie.<eos> I need someone who can look the other way sometimes.<eos> And you can stop the other work too, Lizzie.<eos> All of it this time.<eos> No exceptions.<eos> Eight o'clock, Monday morning, the upstairs office.<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Newmarket was profitable.<eos> Arthur told me how you left your message.<eos> And when I asked him where his medicine was, he said you poured it away.
Suck it, Gary!<eos> Suck it!<eos> What? !<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> You might see that on ESPN.<eos> I won, I won, I won!<eos> But remember, buddy, losing is just as good as winning.<eos> Aren't those the lyrics to the Canadian national anthem?<eos> If he can ride a sheep, he can ride a bike.<eos> Yeah, but the good thing about a bike... it doesn't die if you leave it in the garage all winter.
Oh. [Chuckles nervously]<eos> [Harness clicking] - Okay. - How's that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nobody puts baby in a corner.<eos> - I carried a watermelon!<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, that's what she says in the movie.<eos> What movie?<eos> Dirty Dancing.<eos> Oh. Never seen it.
Order has been restored.<eos> God, I want to believe that.<eos> And have faith that'll carry me for a while.<eos> Eventually the doubt will creep in and I'll wonder if I did everything I could.<eos> Don't you want to know?<eos> Of course.<eos> But I don't need proof.<eos> We aren't supposed to know, not for certain, and I think that's the point.<eos> This will send a signal.<eos> If nobody hears it, nothing happens.
Last year we measured nine meters.<eos> Nine meters.<eos> Nine meters of melting, so that's, you know, like, 27 feet of ice melt.<eos> You know, the size of a house is this, this is how much it's...<eos> In one year.<eos> So Dr. Box is going to put the pole down into the ice.<eos> So if you can see all the way up to there, that's how much ice from this shelf is melting.<eos> Every year.<eos> Dr. Box's method to track ice melt here is actually really simple.<eos> After drilling down into the ice, he places a long 30-foot pole into the ice shelf and leaves it there.
No.<eos> I'm talking about the black Beretta with the taped grip you got tucked beside your water bottle.<eos> You mean this.<eos> My new jammie.<eos> It's a nice one.<eos> What are you planning on doing with it?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> Right now it's just for protection.<eos> Figure, I'm gonna be a detective, I need a piece.<eos> Where'd you get it?
Don't know what I would've done without Avril last night.<eos> She's the perfect marvel.<eos> How did you come by this scar on your tummy?<eos> I had an operation.<eos> At the Countess of Irby?<eos> Helped me with my monthlies.<eos> Were you in pain?<eos> No.<eos> They said it would help them to stay regular.<eos> I had it when I had the operation on my head.
"Please forgive me for this long period of silence,<eos> "but my circumstances..."<eos> "my...<eos> "...circumstances did not allow me to fulfill<eos> "my role as a mother."<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means that you're not...<eos> I want her to read me the letter.<eos> - Want me to read it? - No.<eos> I've read it.
The authorities will be arriving any minute.<eos> Then I won't waste my energy throwing you out.<eos> Though I am surprised that you haven't gassed up a gulfstream and gone on the lam.<eos> Oh, running would be undignified.<eos> Particularly after suffering the humiliation of being sold out by your very own daughter.<eos> Oh, that mis-born wretch is yours alone.<eos> Though I gather she was an unwitting participant.<eos> Charlotte was as surprised as I to discover we were being broadcast.<eos> Given you bowed out of the press conference at the 11th hour, I'm guessing you knew I was walking into a trap.<eos> Question is... Did you set it?
- Yeah.<eos> But don't tell Charlie.<eos> He doesn't like it when his girlfriends mix with his girl friends.<eos> That is so strange because just the other night, we were talking about inviting one of my girlfriends over...<eos> That's a completely different thing.<eos> Boy, it's a good thing Lacey lets me have a key.<eos> Otherwise we couldn't redo her apartment.<eos> When you say, "lets you have,"<eos> does that mean, "doesn't know you have"?<eos> Hey, if she didn't want me to have her key, why would she let me take it out of her hand and make a copy of it while she was passed out drunk in the hallway?
But if the twisted bastard'd done it successfully, there wouldn't be, would there?<eos> You think the press'd know that and we wouldn't?<eos> It wouldn't be t'first time.<eos> We will get him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know how many... tossers in uniform have said that to her over t'last three weeks?<eos> Did you make an appointment with the psychologist?<eos> She told her to put all her troubles in little envelopes.<eos> And to put the little envelopes into a little box.<eos> And to put it in the attic till she felt strong enough to open it up again.
And worse?<eos> Everyone but me seems to be okay with it.<eos> No one else seems to care.<eos> And I'm the weird one?<eos> Does anyone care how I feel?<eos> I care, okay?<eos> And I'm crazy sorry.<eos> Okay, I wish I could go back and not have sex with your mom.<eos> She's a great lady, and I really respect her, but it was just... it was all kinds of wrong.<eos> And the fact that I took our friendship and just crashed it into a pole kills me.
When I tasted the smoked duck he made...<eos> Okay, "hmm, smokey and ducky."<eos> So, um, how are you gonna fake your way through that photo shoot on Sunday?<eos> Oh, is that magazine guy coming here on Sunday? !<eos> Um, that's what it says.<eos> It says, "'Toledo Living' is looking forward to taking a peek into Councilwoman Mel Burke's beautiful home to get to know her unique sense of style."<eos> Boy, you know the timing of this is pretty funny.<eos> In a sad, un-funny way.<eos> Ugh! The chair!<eos> Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks if you set it on fire.

He's okay.<eos> And I am... not okay.<eos> I'm not okay.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> I'm falling apart.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I'm on Schmidt's anti-anxiety medicine.<eos> What? !<eos> Yeah, I stole it from his drawer.
We need to get every one of those out.<eos> - Blood pressure and pulse ox are dropping.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Massive right heart strain.<eos> Piece of the bullet must have embolized.<eos> Uh, B.P.'s down to 40.<eos> We need to get that bullet out of the lung now!<eos> Jordan?<eos> I just talked to one of the paramedics, and he said this guy came in with a "do not treat" bracelet on his wrist,<eos> - and that you ignored it.
You hold on, okay?<eos> You were at the Alamo.<eos> You were shot.<eos> He's incompetent, right?<eos> He's still too out of it from the anesthesia for me to make a diagnosis.<eos> I just thought I'd check since Jordan had paged me three times.<eos> What's going on?<eos> He's a Christian scientist.<eos> He came in with a "Do not treat" bracelet.<eos> - Jordan cut it off.
What?<eos> You looking for me, Sarge?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The DA's office filed a complaint against you.<eos> For what?<eos> Harassing their investigators.<eos> Come on, that's B.S., Sarge.<eos> Yeah, well, they made it official and pressed the complaint.<eos> What? Can I see this complaint?<eos> I don't have it.
You've lost someone, yes?<eos> Someones.<eos> And you believe that you will always feel that pain.<eos> And if it starts to slip away, you... you seek it out again, don't you?<eos> You won't let it kill you, but you won't... kill yourself.<eos> For whoever is joined with all of the living, there is hope.<eos> Surely, a live dog is better than a dead lion.<eos> Hope.<eos> It's your weakness.<eos> You want it gone because you don't deserve it.
Coming from the countryside, the overnight bus was pretty tiresome<eos> That makes sense<eos> Yeah, so we will head directly to the hotel<eos> How do we get to Higashi-Ginza from here?<eos> Big Sis, we can't do that<eos> Why?<eos> Cause we don't have money<eos> Big Sis?<eos> You took a pic?<eos> Gonna send it to little sis
If I went back again, he'd be fine.<eos> We're about to find out.<eos> You forgot the bag of feed.<eos> I'd better get back to my round.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Don't be like that.<eos> Archie!<eos> We've written a letter to the planning committee.<eos> It's our vision for the zoo - what we're doing, and how we're doing it.<eos> I'll deliver it personally.
Did you bring the list of people who may have accessed his computer?<eos> There.<eos> Now tell me what you kn...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This is kidnapping.<eos> Before your journey into unconsciousness, you asked my brother and I what we knew.<eos> We know all.<eos> We've known it since before we called you and asked you to meet us here.<eos> You murdered Norman.<eos> Then you assembled his list of clients and you took it to market.
So, Peter Gregory, big fan of you.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - He invited you to his toga party, right?<eos> That's a big deal.<eos> Flo Rida's gonna be there.<eos> - You like Flo Rida?<eos> - Should be fun.<eos> - Yeah, I went to a lot...<eos> - See this guitar?<eos> Sergei and Larry from Google signed it.
Because I look absurd.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, ok.<eos> - So what are you going to say?<eos> - Fuck, I don't know.<eos> Today's user wants access to all of their files from all their devices instantly.<eos> That's why cloud-based is the holy grail.<eos> Now Dropbox is winning, but when it comes to audio and video files, they might as well be called Dripbox.<eos> Using our platform, Pied Piper users would be able to compress all their files to the point where they truly can access them instantly.<eos> We control the pipe, they just use it.
Oh, go... just... just... go and spend some time with your sister.<eos> - Catch up.<eos> - She's catching up with Ty.<eos> The last thing she needs is me butting in.<eos> Well, you could put Katie to bed.<eos> Oh!<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> So...<eos> I gave you a lead in out there and you didn't take it.
What are you-- What's happening?<eos> Just trying to check to make sure we don't have a Mrs. Doubtfire situation.<eos> Ah, I see.<eos> - That's fair, right?<eos> - Yeah, that's fair.<eos> You just saw that movie.<eos> That's great.<eos> - I loved it!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Have you seen it? - Uh-huh.
You're not gonna run.<eos> Nah, not a chance.<eos> Oh, Ryder, hey.<eos> You remember when you brought home that bad math test and I bit your head off.<eos> It was like a little over 28 days ago...<eos> Yeah, you mean that time you got irrationally angry, and cried, and threw chocolate at me.<eos> I was aiming for your mouth.<eos> But, yeah, that's the day.<eos> Can you check your calendar?<eos> I need to know the exact date because I usually put it in my calendar like every month.
Erich told you that he didn't even know Cindy was pregnant until he read about it after the autopsy.<eos> The prosecution has not been able to produce one speck of evidence to the contrary.<eos> But that's a problem for Mr. Siletti.<eos> Mr. Siletti needs a motive for a crime we can't be sure... ever happened.<eos> If Cindy fell down her stairs, and we know she wasn't sober...<eos> Poor girl. That's... that's a terrible accident.<eos> But that doesn't advance careers in the D.A.'s Office.<eos> This case with this defendant has made Mr. Siletti famous.<eos> His boss, D.A. Perez, is now a brand name, in the news, day after day, night after night.<eos> They've told their version of the story so often, they might even believe it themselves.
You can transfer it to her, and she'll be removed from the game.<eos> No strings, bro.<eos> How do I know that's the truth?<eos> There's one thing that's no joke.<eos> It is their rules.<eos> They stick to it like a tattoo on a fat chick.<eos> Heh. That's what makes it so exhilarating.<eos> This black box...<eos> - What?<eos> - How do I get it?
____ It's Trevor.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> What?<eos> This black box, how do I get it?
Not my problem!<eos> Now get out of here or I will empty this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, wait. Hold on, wait.<eos> The gun.<eos> Leave your gun.<eos> I saw it in your waistband.<eos> Slow.<eos> I'm just gonna set it down, all right?
I didn't muscle in.<eos> The town turned to me.<eos> People who wouldn't normally even think about religion, they asked me to speak.<eos> They needed me.<eos> And do you know why they came?<eos> Because there was a fear that you couldn't address, a need that you only made worse because all you have is suspicion.<eos> Now, you can accuse me.<eos> You can take DNA samples.<eos> You can ridicule who I was in the past, but you don't get to belittle my faith just because you're too shut down to comprehend it.<eos> People need hope right now, and they are certainly not getting it from you.
He deserved to see it, and it could help us.<eos> - I promised her.<eos> - Well, you shouldn't have.<eos> We need everything out now.<eos> We need to cut through what's linked to Danny and what isn't.<eos> These are people's lives you're screwing with.<eos> I should file a complaint.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Add it to the list.<eos> I'll sign it.
- Nah, j... just open it.<eos> You try anything funny, there'll be a hole where your brain used to be.<eos> Get up.<eos> Take this.<eos> Take it as a gift.<eos> Let it not be said that the Solanos don't know<eos> - how to treat their guests.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This is good shit. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> You take that coke, and you sell it.
Shall we?<eos> The unmasking of Batman.<eos> We should have the press here.<eos> Any last words, before we find out who you really are, Batman?<eos> Turn it off!<eos> Turn it off!<eos> Fine.<eos> Let him keep his Halloween costume.<eos> In here, that suit's a bull's-eye.<eos> Get used to this cell, because I'm gonna make sure you never leave it.
As well you should.<eos> Who could blame you?<eos> I have some loose ends to tie up first.<eos> Oh, Harvey...<eos> I like this new side of you.<eos> You've been saying some very unkind things about me, Ms. Kilroy.<eos> Dent?<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> (Scoffs) Lost it?<eos> On the contrary, I feel like I've finally found it.
All right. No, don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna put most of this stuff in storage.<eos> Oh, except this jammer.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Have you ever seen a more beautifully cut blazer in your entire life?<eos> Wow, get up close like Project Runway.<eos> This was personally made for me by a woman at the Xiangyang Road Market who literally had not a tooth.<eos> Well, those are the ones who are best with their fingers.<eos> You know what?<eos> She secretly shadowed me every day for two months just to see how I would use it, then she tailor fit it to me the way they made the old samurai swords.
But can I be frank?<eos> Can I speak Mano a Mano to you, Mary Pat?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Well, this human garbage here, he came out of somewhere, right?<eos> You know where he came out of?<eos> You.<eos> It's your garbage.<eos> You're responsible for it, and you got to get it off the street.<eos> I don't mean to go all Giuliani on you, but you got to get this garbage off the street!<eos> Well, I don't want it.
I'm an amazing friend, okay?<eos> The second I realized that you were into Nicki,<eos> I backed off.<eos> Justin, that is textbook bros before hos.<eos> Okay. You know what?<eos> He's right.<eos> And I'll tell you one more thing I'm gonna do...<eos> I'm gonna toss you an apology.<eos> But I should warn you, my sister and I come from the same fiery Sicilian bloodline, okay?<eos> So if I toss you this apology, and you don't accept it, It's a-gonna be a problem, eh?
Morning, gentlemen.<eos> You'll be happy to know that former bubble boy Braden Morris had his first follow-up with his pediatrician.<eos> He is healthy as a horse.<eos> Uh, I have a consult, if you'll excuse me.<eos> Ah, you can stay.<eos> You should...<eos> What's up?<eos> Disappointing news, actually.<eos> The foundation cut our budget, so we are unable to continue funding your genome lab.<eos> Oh, well, who's gonna fund it, then?
No, I challenged some dick to a guitar duel.<eos> Now get out of here, I need to practice.<eos> Go play in your attic if you don't want an audience.<eos> (groans) Stairs.<eos> All right, how hard could this be?<eos> The shape is pretty self-explanatory.<eos> Roger, I-I thought you knew how to play the guitar.<eos> I used to.<eos> But you know the part of your brain that deals with music?<eos> I took some PCP and just destroyed it.
It is the modern home of the socialist-slash-communist movement in America.<eos> This bill is Green on the outside and inside it's deep communist Red.<eos> The further down the road somebody gets in terms of their commitment behaviorally and ideologically with a social group, a tribe--<eos> "Our tribe doubts climate change.<eos> That's what we do."<eos> Whether you care or not, your tribe believes a bunch of other things that you also believe, so you buy the package.<eos> I am Michael Shermer, director of The Skeptic Society.<eos> We investigate the paranormal, pseudoscience and cults and claims of all kinds between.<eos> Some people call us debunkers but there's a lot of bunk that needs debunking and that's part of our job.<eos> When I say, "Where's the spacecraft?" You say, "They hid it."
But, obviously, you're desperate, too.<eos> No.<eos> Not that desperate.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Agent Landon didn't say why she thought you might be able to help me, other than you're supposedly good at tracking people, and close combat.<eos> What I do know is that I'm agent Mallory's only hope.<eos> And I'm your only hope, too.<eos> Please, I'm running out of time here.<eos> I want the exoneration in writing first.<eos> I don't have it in writing.
Did Agent Mallory...?<eos> Yes, she's, uh, safe.<eos> I mean, she's a bit shaken up, of course, but she'll be okay.<eos> And the UN caught the last terrorist, too.<eos> I'm more than grateful.<eos> By saving Agent Mallory, you saved other undercovers from being exposed and their operations.<eos> You... you really came through.<eos> I'm sensing a "but."<eos> Where's the exoneration?<eos> They rescinded it.
Heading in.<eos> Enjoying the view?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I'm your plus-one.<eos> You didn't think we'd trust you to do this alone.<eos> You envy these people?<eos> Little bit.<eos> Trust me, this life gets old.<eos> How would you know?<eos> Once upon a time, I lived it.
Nice try, Jim.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're gonna go about your day thinking I'm responsible for the explosion, that's, you know...<eos> Just be ready for whatever... madness Phil has planned next.<eos> Phil?<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> Just making sure the place is secure.<eos> Is there food in there?<eos> We weren't using this room.<eos> Maybe someone moved it.
- How could you do that?<eos> - It's just as risky to do nothing. So that was...<eos> That was good?<eos> The truth is Ethan is in an undiscovered country right now. Neither of us knows what's going on there.<eos> The truth?<eos> How about you wanna find out what Ethan knows about what happened to Molly?<eos> I do, but I didn't put him at risk. Taking him to the island put him at risk.<eos> You didn't even tell me you were going.<eos> We built him together, John.<eos> From coding to body-mapping, through every stage of development. And then every big decision that needs to be made, you just make it.
And you don't trust me?<eos> The Machine is being relocated.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the Founder's afraid.<eos> Of what?<eos> Jedikiah.<eos> He thinks he wants to destroy it.<eos> Hillary, you didn't tell him about my father, did you?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Do you know where he's taking it?
Not here, not in school.<eos> In Rosewood.<eos> Recuperating.<eos> You didn't know that part?<eos> No.<eos> Don't you want to sign the card?<eos> I think that you should, for the sake of appearances.<eos> We all have to be careful how others see us.<eos> I heard you were floating around with this.<eos> Are you going to give it to him?
Nah, leave her.<eos> I've got to get this phone over to Ashley at t'farm.<eos> What?<eos> Do you know what you just said?<eos> Shit!<eos> She couldn't hear me.<eos> She had t'bag on, she were whimpering.<eos> She won't have heard owt.<eos> I am not going back inside cos of a shit-for-brains little twat like you.<eos> So, you just think, every time, every time, before you open your mouth down there in future, or I'll rip your cock off and shove it up your arse.
You did the division that fast?<eos> Yeah, cliche buster.<eos> I'm good at math. Please tell me you're not softening your position on this.<eos> - My position hasn't softened at all.<eos> - Smartest person in the room.<eos> - There's no question we have to do the story.<eos> - She is an idiot savant.<eos> - When did you change your mind?<eos> - I didn't change my mind.<eos> I've known we had to do the story the second he showed it to us.
If you want to speak to me on the record, I'm happy to listen, but I'm not taking what I overheard to my senior producer.<eos> I am willing to trade you another story for the promise that you won't use my candid remarks about the president.<eos> I have no intention of using your candid remarks or even your on-the-record remarks which were meant for someone else.<eos> I just don't understand.<eos> I don't know how to make it any clearer than that.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I think you're freaking him out.<eos> How's your boss gonna feel about you passing on a story?<eos> And then another story?<eos> Whatever the second story is, I'm not going to blackmail him into giving it to me.
- It's been a week.<eos> We promised some people we'd hold a moment.<eos> - The government.<eos> - We have to work with them on national security.<eos> They're gonna tell you everything is national security.<eos> Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.<eos> If I don't see the story on your air by Wednesday,<eos> - I'm uploading it myself.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> I'll just dump it on Gwyneth Paltrow's blog.
I'll bring that up at our next staff meeting.<eos> - No.<eos> - It got voted down.<eos> Listen, no kidding around, you need to disable the app until we can figure this out,<eos> - 'cause it's a little not what we do.<eos> - What's not what you do?<eos> Giving deranged people with access to semiautomatic weapons the locations of their targets while simultaneously turning the rest of our brains into Wheatena.<eos> That app's driving a lot of traffic.<eos> I don't care if it's driving in the Grand Prix of Monaco.<eos> I need you to temporarily take it down.

- Did you put her up to it?<eos> - Nobody put me up to anything.<eos> What did you think you were doing?<eos> - You saw the questions she was gonna ask?<eos> - 'Course I saw the questions.<eos> I was doing the interview the only way that made sense to me.<eos> You were openly insubordinate!<eos> I was told to do this interview.<eos> You knew what I was looking for!<eos> I did and I didn't like it, but I did it anyway.
Doing it in installments will keep him honest.<eos> Installments.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I-I was looking for one big withdrawal from Lonnie's accounts, but... what if she's been paying someone off in installments?<eos> Ryan.<eos> I've spent all night going through my dad's bank accounts, his transactions, everything I could get my hands on.<eos> Okay...<eos> Sure.<eos> I've seen this account.<eos> Your father included it in the trust, if that's what you're worried about.
You sent that photo to my dad.<eos> You know about that?<eos> You ruined my relationship with him.<eos> You baited him and covered your tracks.<eos> You lined everything up that day so he'd die!<eos> Ryan, how could I have known... any of that was gonna happen?<eos> The car?<eos> The accident?<eos> What, so you just messed with my life for no reason?<eos> I sent it because I was afraid.
Hey!<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Hey!<eos> You got me, Ryan.<eos> How you been?<eos> Bruce?<eos> You look different.<eos> I did a cleanse.<eos> I feel fantastic.<eos> I don't want to gross you out with all the details, but they take this huge hose and they snake it right up...
No! I'm never going back!<eos> Yes, you are!<eos> Mom, go inside. Please.<eos> That's nice, Mom. Yeah.<eos> Real mature!<eos> Is it so horrible that she'd find someone after all these years?<eos> She's obviously not well, and Dr. Cahill knows that.<eos> So either he's criminally taking advantage of her, or he's just as insane as she is.<eos> So, you're prepared to throw away your whole relationship with Mom?<eos> She's the one throwing it away!
Jordan. That's a real pretty name for a real pretty woman.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You're not so bad yourself.<eos> Despite the fact that you nearly beat three men to death with your bare hands. Wow.<eos> What happened there?<eos> I was just workin' at the marina.<eos> I restore boats as a hobby.<eos> Working with your hands and... faded jeans.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, I'm too much of a gentleman to tell you what those thugs did to my girl, but... after I was done with them I... ripped my shirt off and used it as a pillow under my lady's head.
It's me.<eos> Investigate Choi Jin Sang, who used to be in our hospital's general surgery, and check what his relationship is with Director Yoon.<eos> Here.<eos> Let's go in.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Our house.<eos> The house where you and I will become a family and live together.<eos> A house that has our future in it.<eos> Ji Woon.<eos> I asked them to build it using only good wood and good stones.
Let's go in.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Our house.<eos> The house where you and I will become a family and live together.<eos> A house that has our future in it.<eos> Ji Woon.<eos> I asked them to build it using only good wood and good stones.<eos> With a wide and big windows.<eos> I asked them to put in a skylights so that you and the kids could fall asleep watching the stars.<eos> And I asked them to build it so that we can camp out on the balcony.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, Ji Woon.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Why is he like this?<eos> He can't even breathe because of a sudden pain in his heart...<eos> Does he suffer from angina?<eos> Yes.<eos> He does have angina.<eos> Then he must have nitroglycerin that he's been prescribed.<eos> - I don't have it now.
What the hell is that?<eos> ! Nail polish.<eos> No.<eos> The foot.<eos> It's a child's foot, Joe.<eos> Wha...<eos> I-I don't... you-you were crippled when you were an adult.<eos> How the hell did...? Yeah.<eos> A few months back, I got really drunk and was playing around with an elastic band.<eos> I wrapped it around my thigh and forgot about it for a week or two and uh, yeah, so, that's my left foot now.
That's your bar!<eos> ? Oh, shame on you!<eos> This is good.<eos> This is constructive.<eos> The talking bear was so bad,<eos> Seth MacFarlane quit voicing him after season two.<eos> It's hard to make a talking bear funny.<eos> It worked out okay in movie form.<eos> What was supposed to be the show's audience?<eos> Who did you make it for?
No way.<eos> Besides the people in this room, who else knows the note exists?<eos> No one.<eos> Just us.<eos> Did you log the suicide note as evidence?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Should we?<eos> Well, we should, only if we think it's real.<eos> It was typed into a blank word document.<eos> - And he didn't e-mail it to anyone?
Well, I was mostly upstairs in the bedroom.<eos> He was, uh, downstairs watching sports in the basement.<eos> So, even though you believe you were in the house together the entire night, it's possible he might have left the house for a period of time after dinner and before the movie, is it not?<eos> No. No, I would have known.<eos> We have an alarm system.<eos> Was it armed?<eos> Yes.<eos> I arm it myself every night.<eos> Couldn't he have disarmed it without you knowing?<eos> No, no, because it beeps when you... when you arm or disarm it. I-I would have heard.
You see this?<eos> See this little guy?<eos> That's your fingerprint.<eos> Found it on Strauss' laptop.<eos> You know, when you were typing out that bullshit suicide note.<eos> We felt for sure we were gonna have to sweep your office for prints, but it turned out the FBI database had your digits on file from a drug bust in college, so that was a nice surprise.<eos> Anyway, the hair and the prints basically just prove that you were at Strauss' apartment sometime in the recent past, which is why my partner spent half the day digging up this.<eos> That's security footage from the liquor store right next door to Strauss' apartment.<eos> Now, the camera hasn't been maintained well.<eos> The wind blew it off target, but we were able to get a corner of Strauss' apartment, so we have images of you and Strauss entering the apartment two nights ago, and of you exiting his apartment by yourself.
~ Fuck off.<eos> No!<eos> Categorical.<eos> Fucking ridiculous.<eos> Mr Solomons.<eos> Your distillery provides one-tenth of your income.<eos> Protection is another 10%.<eos> And the rest you make from the race tracks.<eos> I know you keep a gun in the drawer.<eos> I know you keep it beside the whiskey.
And the decorators doing The Garrison want paying.<eos> Arthur forgot and pulled a gun when they asked, so... they've stopped and everything's green.<eos> All right, well, just pay it.<eos> Oh, and we need to put an advert in the Mail -<eos> "Garrison:<eos> Grand Reopening."<eos> Oh, and you said there's a letter that had to go today.<eos> Special delivery.<eos> I wrote it in the diary.<eos> Yes... I haven't written it out yet.

- It's a goat.<eos> -Yeah, and we're gonna sacrifice it. Tonight.<eos> That's part of the reason why we have to shut the doors as well.<eos> But this year we thought we'd give the fucking goat a name.<eos> - You've named it?<eos> -We fucking did, yeah.<eos> - They named the fucking goat.<eos> -The evil fucking Egyptian pharaoh,<eos> -the fucking enemy.<eos> -That's right. - You know what we called it?
You got a little copper in there.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Let's go up to the roof and just see what it looks like.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No one is in here.<eos> Some birds.<eos> Are those birds?<eos> This is a nice-ass load, man.<eos> So someone came up here, obviously...<eos> So someone came up here and made their own load, planning to scrap, but I'm taking it.
So, we sent Thomas Morton to meet with the Kurdish militia, known as the People's Protection Units, or the YPG, to see what's happening on the front lines of the other civil war that is raging in northern Syria.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's Thomas.<eos> I'm in the Kurdish part of Syria with the fighters of the YPG, who are doing their best to make this Kurdish land a Kurdish country.<eos> _<eos> The Kurds are an ethnic group from the Middle East who set themselves apart from the Arab majority by being into progressive politics, women's rights, and trying to turn their own country, Kurdistan, into a secular, pro-Western democracy.<eos> Unfortunately, the Kurds don't have their own country... at least not yet, because if they did, it would be right here.<eos> The Western part of the Kurdish homeland is in Syria... where 3 years of civil war left over 100,000 dead and 7 million displaced from their homes.<eos> What started as a populist uprising by the Free Syrian Army against the oppressive Assad regime has devolved into an increasingly messy and complex fight, drawing in new factions from across Syria and the entire Middle East.<eos> While the rest of the country falls apart, Syria's Kurds have taken control of their part and made it into an island of relative stability and independence.
Some crazy lady called and said you were getting married.<eos> Well, actually, what she said was,<eos> "Gretchen, pretty, pretty brid""<eos> followed by two minutes of intense vomiting.<eos> Pretty sure that was her. Boo-ya!<eos> Gretchen, I know I made some horrible mistakes.<eos> I drank too much, I wrecked your truck, I cheated on you with your best friend.<eos> In your truck.<eos> While I was drunk.<eos> Which is why I wrecked it.
I mean, he escaped again.<eos> No.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Beth still thinks that Gabe is a reliable source.<eos> Can you just please, tell her what he did to you?<eos> I told you.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I just called to check on him and the guard says he's not there.<eos> Heather...<eos> You were supposed to make this the most amazing night of my life, and now, you've completely ruined it!
I'm not here as a reporter anymore, okay?<eos> I... I actually really care about Heather.<eos> In fact, I've known her a little longer than you.<eos> Okay, it's not a competition.<eos> And don't even pretend like you're not gonna leap at her with questions the second she comes out of that bathroom.<eos> - You're the one who made her cry.<eos> - This is neither of your faults.<eos> Heather.<eos> No, I shouldn't even have had this party.<eos> You know why I had it now?
♪ Something smells fishy, la, la, la... ♪<eos> Stop it!<eos> I don't like degrading nicknames!<eos> Now, if you'll allow me to introduce you to my dirty, flirty, little squeeze thing,<eos> Fanny, the 29-year-old girlfriend that I have.<eos> I just bought seven bras!<eos> Wow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bob, I have a proposition for you.<eos> No. You haven't heard it yet. How would you like...
Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> Easy peasy.<eos> You think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Aw, look at you, humble little burger man deciding the fate of the whole town.<eos> I'm not little.<eos> Little burger boy wonder.<eos> Ooh, I'm gonna make you a T-shirt that says that.<eos> I won't wear it.
No!<eos> Stop interpreting!<eos> This whole date has been about you, not me!<eos> Jimmy Jr., I don't know if you can understand me, but this is the date I wanted.<eos> We'd watch a movie...<eos> probably 27 Dresses... then we'd walk along the beach at low tide and find a cozy place to sit in the kelp and kiss.<eos> I heard every word, Tina.<eos> That's the same date I wanted, too.<eos> Except that movie...<eos> I've seen it three times.
Come on, baby!<eos> Stop teasing him!<eos> I can't help it.<eos> He's incapable of doing anything right on his own.<eos> Stop saying that!<eos> I'm sick of it!<eos> Calvin...<eos> Calvin, I've lived too long in your stupid, weird shadow to just shoot you.<eos> You're going to die slowly, tied to the pier you love so much.<eos> I-I don't love it.
I wonder what his text was supposed to be.<eos> What if it was something that would make us all LOL?<eos> Well, let's figure it out.<eos> Should be easy.<eos> Dad doesn't know that many words.<eos> We got to get that phone.<eos> I'll try to get it with my foot.<eos> Oh, look at those nimble, hairy little toe-men go.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> I think I took a picture, and I think I sent it.
Something like that, yeah.<eos> Your small town have a barbed wire fence around it?<eos> We didn't even have a traffic light.<eos> You come from good people.<eos> You'll get a chance to see the world.<eos> All you got to do is wait.<eos> It's Private Dunlavey, right?<eos> Don't pretend you know anything about me just because you put a bullet through my dad's mathematician.<eos> All right, the camera.<eos> You didn't turn it on?
The camera broke because you insisted on performing an illegal test when we could have easily waited a week.<eos> I'm not walking anymore.<eos> When they come and rescue us, I'll see to it that they know the truth.<eos> You're not fit for leadership.<eos> You're fit for a straightjacket and a padded cell.<eos> No one's coming to save us.<eos> It'll be dark soon.<eos> If we get separated, just stick to the road.<eos> You can at least leave me my gun.<eos> If I give it back to you, you'll be thrown in the brig for violating orders.

Either you do this, Or there will be a vx nerve gas attack. In los angeles within the hour.<eos> There'll be another attack, and then another attack, Until I'm set free.<eos> Alert first responders.<eos> Get jttf on the line.<eos> I need to call the director.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, you forgot your bag!<eos> A man left this.<eos> He just got off the bus.<eos> Yeah, just a minute. Leave it there. And I'll drop it off at the terminal.
We could leave right now, before the sun comes up.<eos> Unless you changed your mind...<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> Then let's go.<eos> Right now.<eos> I can't right now.<eos> It doesn't feel right.<eos> That rich kid, you should have seen the way he was looking at the twins.<eos> And that second clown-- do you think you would recognize his voice if you heard it?
We're already at 12 feet.<eos> They are special bulbs from Holland.<eos> Please do not question me.<eos> The body will decompose down there and give life to these flowers.<eos> In spring, we will look down at the blanket of color and say,<eos> "She did not die in vain."<eos> I'm sorry I killed Dora, Mother.<eos> I hate to have put you out like this.<eos> You have the sickness like your father had before you.<eos> He stifled it the only way he could.
Just can't take the shame of it no more... being... what I am.<eos> A freak.<eos> As it turns out, yeah.<eos> I swear to Christ, Ethel, I don't know how you and the others manage it.<eos> We manage it because we have to.<eos> We wear our shame on the outside.<eos> There's no hiding it.<eos> It's just who we are.<eos> Now, you... you carry your shame on the inside.<eos> You keep it trapped in there.
I didn't have parents.<eos> Not really.<eos> I had to fend for myself, and... well, Stanley fed me, kept me out of the rain.<eos> And he never laid a finger on me.<eos> So you all are criminals?<eos> What could you possibly want with a bunch of freaks like us?<eos> We're fleecing your customers.<eos> When the lights go down, we pick their pockets.<eos> Oh, you all came down here to Jupiter, Florida, to pick a bunch of pockets?<eos> I wasn't born on a farm, but I do know bullshit when I smell it, and I gotta say... that is some bullshit.
Not to mention her cat.<eos> She left her cat?<eos> You wanna know why?<eos> Because it has one eye and wears a diaper?<eos> No.<eos> Because she wants a reason to come back.<eos> - She does?<eos> - Yeah, she left a door open.<eos> A little kitty door.<eos> I'm gonna push her through it.
Peekaboo!<eos> Peekaboo!<eos> Did you do that?<eos> Peekaboo!<eos> Call me as soon as Mr. Godfrey is out of prep.<eos> - What the hell did you do now?<eos> - I've done many things.<eos> - Could you be more specific?<eos> - Maybe you could tell me why that Barbie doll you whipped up downstairs is pretending to be my daughter!<eos> I replicated Shelley's consciousness and transferred it to a perfect host.
For the wedding, M'Lady.<eos> No. He's not trying to get out of it?<eos> No.<eos> But there's no hurry.<eos> We don't have to rush into it.<eos> By the way, would you do me the greatest possible favour?<eos> I will if I can. Would you hide this in the cottage?<eos> You mean the thing.<eos> Well, I can't leave it here.<eos> Suppose Mrs Hughes found it.
This one says she heard Mr Green talking just before he fell.<eos> Sergeant Willis was asking if he'd quarrelled with anyone when he was at Downton.<eos> Why?<eos> Mr Green had told the people he worked with that he'd been treated badly while he was here.<eos> HE was treated badly? !<eos> I know.<eos> But... ..we have to be on our guard.<eos> I mean, I'm sure Mr Bates never knew it was him but if they find out what Mr Green did, then...<eos> There can't be any evidence against Bates.<eos> They'd have found it by now.
I'd abandoned everything I believed to please a worthless man.<eos> Surely if you told the police now...<eos> No, M'Lady.<eos> I won't bring it back to life.<eos> Leave him be.<eos> As it is, he'll never know a day's happiness for there is nothing good in him.<eos> So what might you have done in York that would place you there?<eos> Now, let me think.<eos> I posted a letter to an old army pal.<eos> Would he still have it?
Am I the only one who sees it?<eos> Who sees what?<eos> Oh, well, in this letter,<eos> Sam and Marie are in love, but Marie is gonna marry someone else, and Sam doesn't want her to, then...<eos> What if-if she gets the letter before her wedding?<eos> Or worse, what if she gets it just after her wedding?<eos> It's a bit complicated.<eos> It's not complicated!<eos> What's complicated about it?<eos> You address it, you mail it and she reads it.
- ...he went to airplane heaven.<eos> - Get inside.<eos> Jumbo, you down there?<eos> I can't see you, buddy!<eos> We gotta get back inside, Jumbo!<eos> Oh no.<eos> Everyone back inside now!<eos> The whole mountain's about to come down.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait wait, don't close it yet.
I know what a tough business real estate is.<eos> I've made my share of mistakes.<eos> But you have to have the integrity to live with them.<eos> And not look for rich scapegoats.<eos> Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> Withdrawn.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Ms. Silmas, you mentioned integrity as if...<eos> Well, as if you had it.
- What are they planning?<eos> - Working with?<eos> No, you've got it all wrong.<eos> I wasn't working with them.<eos> I was their first victim.<eos> Man Bat: My name is Dr. Kirk Langstrom.<eos> I was a research scientist trying to break down the DNA of bats.<eos> I was hoping to develop a life-saving serum from their immune system, which is very resistant to disease.<eos> But others had a different plan for my work.<eos> Pyg and Toad stole my research and perverted it, forcing me to test the serum on myself.
I can't do this.<eos> If it's the price... for a nation.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary of State.<eos> 'Good morning.<eos> 'As many of you are aware, 'we have had to draw the tragic conclusion that, two days ago,<eos> 'Nessa Stein, 'an unending campaigner for reconciliation in the Middle East, 'was killed by a terrorist outrage perpetrated by a group functioning, 'apparently unencumbered, within the State of Israel.<eos> 'As the shock waves continue across the region and the world, 'this administration has decided 'that it cannot let this appalling act go unanswered.<eos> 'Throughout the length of Israel's existence,<eos> 'America has stood full square beside her.<eos> 'Our belief and loyalty cannot be called into question 'and we do not bring it into question here today.
My orders.<eos> The hatred you feel for me right now... ..only matches what I have felt for your people... ..all my life.<eos> I know you won't take it... ..because you think you are better than me.<eos> More cultured, more sophisticated.<eos> More human.<eos> And I hate you all the more... ..because you have never stopped to think why that is.<eos> No, I have.<eos> I have.<eos> And I know the answer.<eos> And I've known it since I first asked... ..and after every dreadful thing that's happened since... ..and the answer's always the same.
Hey, Maureen.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Everybody, this is Maureen.<eos> - Hey, everybody.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Officer.<eos> Charlie's going out with a cop?<eos> I've got to take a picture.<eos> Get together.<eos> Did you get it?
Did you see that bicycle just blow through that sp sign?<eos> These guys think they don't have to obey the same rules that cars do.<eos> - Want me to light 'em up?<eos> - Go for it.<eos> You can stop now.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Okay, but if you need backup,<eos> I'm a hotshot rookie who plays by his own rules.<eos> Sir, you knew there was a stop sign back there.<eos> You went right through it.
No shit.<eos> It was you.<eos> You.... you sent me the Euro note?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Why?<eos> DEA got iced out of the Quintana investigation.<eos> We lost the money, everything.<eos> So, what, do you want a hug?<eos> I'm giving you a story.<eos> You don't want it, I will find some other asshole journalist who does.
~ Which one?<eos> Chloe Ilson?<eos> Were you not concerned when she didn't come home last night?<eos> I assumed she was at college.<eos> She's always there late, overnight sometimes.<eos> Boyfriend?<eos> She was seeing someone there.<eos> An older guy.<eos> They had some massive row the other day, though.<eos> He broke it off apparently.
Oh, thank you, Phil.<eos> ~ I'm going to have a baby sister?<eos> ~ Yeah, or brother.<eos> ~ Isn't that amazing? ~ I want a sister.<eos> ~ And she's only ten years old?<eos> ~ Well, yeah.<eos> She was only seven when she was diagnosed, apparently.<eos> What's the prognosis?<eos> Well, with fanconi anaemia...<eos> assuming they could find the right donor, a bone marrow or stem cell transplant could cure it altogether.
~ So I'm not to be trusted, is that it?<eos> ~ Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> I trust your judgment more than I trust my own.<eos> But you need to trust Hathaway.<eos> Hoax call.<eos> Same MO.<eos> So you think there's something in what Lewis was saying?<eos> ~ Well, it's one theory.<eos> ~ And the other?<eos> If the original weapon's been used again, either he gave it to somebody or...
Why are you so interested in him?<eos> He's been the victim of the most awful misunderstanding.<eos> And tomorrow the Court of Appeal will confirm that.<eos> I see you share the same taste in philosophy.<eos> I've learnt a lot since I've known Graham.<eos> You should try reading it.<eos> Dr Rook asked me to go and talk to Lawrie.<eos> About what?<eos> He thinks he has a passion for Nietzsche.<eos> She wanted me to encourage it.
It could be that the wrong man has been put away for the past 13 years and the real killer is still out there.<eos> Good to see you, Mr Hathaway.<eos> ~ You told me to dig up everything.<eos> ~ No, it's good.<eos> ~ I could have done with a heads up, that's all. ~ Sorry.<eos> The statement wasn't disclosed in the original trial.<eos> Do we know why?<eos> Just got lost in the system, I guess.<eos> It ended up getting archived in unused materials.<eos> So, in 2001, Lawrie had an alibi for PC Neal Chadwick's murder, and we lost it.
"Be seeing you, Lawrie."<eos> ~ What's he doing with a mobile phone?<eos> ~ How did he get your number?<eos> Is it just the one night, Mr Blayne?<eos> Oh, I hope I'll be here and around a bit longer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll take that for you, sir. This way.<eos> ~ I hate these places.<eos> ~ I think that's the idea.<eos> Oh, can you get a copy of Lawrie's visitor list, so we can compare it to Rook's.
The things I've done...<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> Please.<eos> "You have reached the voicemail of Dr Philippa Garwood.<eos> I'm sorry I'm not here to take your call.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> I'll get back to you as soon as possible."<eos> Philippa, it's James Hathaway.<eos> That play.<eos> If I'd never found it, I'd still...
Fondness for psychopaths.<eos> Nothing weird there, eh?<eos> How are things at the hospital?<eos> No change.<eos> You should go along, though.<eos> ~ They reckon she knows who's there.<eos> ~ Yeah, I will. When this is all over.<eos> What's this?<eos> Brendan Ward's wallet.<eos> He still had it in his jacket.
Oh, just how grateful I am for your excellent advice.<eos> Oh, you've taken it, then?<eos> - I have. In a way.<eos> You've invested in building?<eos> Well, she's invested in a building, yes.<eos> I've found a cottage in Haughton-le-Skerne, and I'm going to see it on Tuesday.<eos> It's £300, so it's a big decision, but you've given me the courage.<eos> Oh, that's not what I meant at all.<eos> I thought you wanted to be in the market, to increase your capital.<eos> Well, I'll rent it now and later I thought I'd take in some lodgers.
I threw mine out.<eos> It was obviously a mistake.<eos> I steal stuff.<eos> I've been stealing stuff since I was a kid.<eos> I'm not gonna get invited to work at a library.<eos> It is a magic library.<eos> Eh, great.<eos> It doesn't fill my pocket.<eos> I came here to find out who's trying to kill me.<eos> If magic's real, how come we don't see it all the time?
- Still vexing.<eos> Does it have anything to do with this painting?<eos> - "Crown of King Arthur"?<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> Crown of King Arthur?<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Crown of King Arthur was forged by Merlin to give Arthur control over the magic that he needed to build Camelot.<eos> So the brotherhood wants to bring magic back, but they need the crown to control it.
Not her signature.<eos> If miss Chaidez went to all this trouble creating the perfect alibi, is there any chance she was working with Corporal Day?<eos> Well, we know whoever signed the credit card bill sat at table number 17.<eos> We're finding table number 17 the night of the murder right now.<eos> We've been checking Facebook and Instagram postings marked #Coralridgegrill.<eos> Now, this is not table number 17.<eos> This was a bunch of guys from Louisiana at table number 9, but...<eos> Behind them and to the right is table number 17.<eos> The picture was taken at 9:44 P.M.<eos> Now, if we enlarge it...
The DNA was specific. Your sperm was found inside Emily Butler.<eos> - Jesus! - Guard:<eos> Kucik!<eos> You read the letters, yeah?<eos> We had sex that day.<eos> I didn't need to rape her because we were together.<eos> The only thing that I know about what happened in that house was my girlfriend was murdered and I'm in here for life.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I'm glad they're giving Bankowski the needle.<eos> I'd give it to him myself if they'd let me.
Hold on... one other thing that has never changed in all of Marcella's video wills was the house.<eos> It was always going to her Maltese...<eos> Falcon. Devin was getting phone calls from realtors even as we interviewed her, and Carter said that he could sell the mansion, no problem.<eos> The Brewster home and surrounding estates have fallen 30% in value over the past five years, even though the rest of the housing market has gone back up.<eos> Now, neighbors say it's because of the unconventional way Marcella has decorated the grounds...<eos> Stuffed horses, statues of "David," lots and lots of neon.<eos> Yeah, and something else these estates have in common...<eos> Security gates.<eos> The neighbors met us at the front door, but the security gate closed behind us when we entered.<eos> So, who opened it?
"Surprise me."<eos> Can anyone here tell me how Ethan suddenly speaks Japanese?<eos> - What?<eos> - This morning, I dropped him off at school, and he heard two Japanese girls talking about him.<eos> And he talked back in Japanese.<eos> All right, little man's on fire.<eos> But the question is: what's fueling that fire?<eos> Well, his neural net's programmed to basic Japanese.<eos> Yeah, but that's not nearly enough to explain this.<eos> Linguistically, it's-it's like saying Ethan had a stepladder and-and used it to reach the moon.
Check again. Derek Pearce.<eos> Grand Avenue.<eos> Penthouse A.<eos> He bought it for one dollar.<eos> Multiple property records confirm.<eos> From who?<eos> Previous owner was Claypool Industries.<eos> Sending you a full purchase history now.<eos> Okay, well, according to this,<eos> Claypool Industries bought the property for $5.2 million, and then six days later, Pearce bought it for one dollar.

There's more in Heaven and Earth than can be dreamt of in our philosophy.<eos> There's no shame in it.<eos> Not in being sick.<eos> But if there were something wrong and you didn't admit it, that would be a shame.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm just worn out.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go.<eos> I'll let you get some rest.<eos> But promise me this: that if you do need help, you'll ask for it.
It's an Oscar!<eos> Ooh, and I made banana bread.<eos> Oh.<eos> I don't eat that, but...<eos> I'll have some.<eos> Tyler, make sure that you get me with the Oscar.<eos> You know what, Mickey?<eos> Here.<eos> Will you take a picture of me with the Oscar?<eos> Just wanna make sure. I want it on my phone.
So now I'm here for my cut.<eos> Here's the good part.<eos> I bet people will pay to watch me shoot your dick off.<eos> Want to see whose video gets more hits?<eos> Let's make a hole in you and show them.<eos> Bitch!<eos> Come on, let's see that tongue out.<eos> Get your tongue out like I told you.<eos> You want me to do it now, bitch?<eos> Stick it out or I'll fucking turn it purple.
Some elbows.<eos> - You have to repeat it back to me perfectly. - Oh...<eos> - Can't miss a beat.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Now, if you do screw up...<eos> You got to drop and give me ten push-ups.<eos> That's what we're doing today.<eos> That's a totally one-sided deal that I would never accept.<eos> How about this?<eos> How about you show me a combination and if I repeat it perfectly, mm-hmm.
Let's get our undercover people into place in McCarren Park.<eos> If the kidnapper's good, they'll probably give Kendell a second location when she gets to the park.<eos> They're gonna want to make sure she's alone.<eos> What did you take from Doc's computer?<eos> Financial spreadsheets, account numbers, no names.<eos> And then you sent that to Cosgrove?<eos> Kind of.<eos> I mean, the dude's really bad with tech...<eos> An old guy, you know?<eos> ... So, uh, he likes to have a hard copy, and I gave it to him on the day that he died.
Oh, my God, they're gonna...<eos> - She's gonna be okay.<eos> She's gonna be okay.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> They need her safe and sound till they get you.<eos> And they're not getting you.<eos> Can't track the phone.<eos> They put the SIM card in a burner cell that's untraceable.<eos> All right, so we do it the hard way.<eos> You give me the flash drive and we'll use it as a bargaining chip.

(Quietly): Wait a second...<eos> Marshall?<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm Carrie Wells.<eos> I'm here to help figure out what happened to your dad.<eos> I know where the flash drive is.<eos> - I'm heading to Marshall Cosgrove's.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Why Marshall?<eos> - I didn't know he had it.
- Yeah, a long time ago.<eos> - Hey, easy with that.<eos> Okay, you're not my dad.<eos> I am not your dad.<eos> You're right.<eos> Why does Marshall have the flash drive?<eos> I help him with his homework sometimes.<eos> Ah, you do his homework.<eos> You put it on the flash drive.<eos> He takes it from your locker.
I need Kendell's flash drive.<eos> Kendell?<eos> Marshall, you told me<eos> - you weren't hanging out with her.<eos> - I'm sorry,<eos> - I'm sorry, what's your name?<eos> - Lacey Chambers.<eos> Shut up, Lacey.<eos> For one minute.<eos> I need the flash drive and I need it now.
Love letters.<eos> Katherine?<eos> Let me see those.<eos> I never thought I'd ever get to read these.<eos> They're not yours?<eos> No, I'm Jonathan Walker the fourth.<eos> These letters were written by Jonathan Walker...<eos> My great-grandfather.<eos> So my dad shipped this box to us just before he died, and it got lost in the mail.<eos> He got it from his dad when he got married.

- What do you say, Oliver?<eos> - Yes. Let's.<eos> Cheese... really?<eos> "To whom it may concern... "<eos> "My name is Samila.<eos> "I am 18 years old "and I live in Seattle, Washington.<eos> "I have tried everything.<eos> "I've called all your official phone numbers, "I've checked all sorts of online websites, "and searched dozens of archives,<eos> "and I am hoping you will care enough to help me.<eos> "I am trying to find the man who saved my life... And changed it forever."
I've already picked out the tub for upstairs and before you ask, no, you may not.<eos> It's a surprise for Caroline, she's gonna be the first one to use it.<eos> Don't worry, Yolanda.<eos> You'll be the first one to clean it.<eos> All right, Elliot, what's our game plan for Cooper Finley?<eos> Oh, what's a Cooper Finley?<eos> Is it a car?<eos> Can I have one?<eos> 'Cause mine's mostly duct tape.<eos> Cooper Finley is a hacker that broke into Josh's new app and forced it offline for two days.
Turn on me like that?<eos> I've been nothing but good to you.<eos> It's been an adventure, Erich.<eos> That's for sure.<eos> Good luck, kid.<eos> You're gonna need it.<eos> All right, so Salter got the gun to Blunt.<eos> Harbach used the gun to kill Neyers.<eos> So, at a minimum, Blunt is an accessory.<eos> Well, now when you've got a four-year gap between when Salter gave him the gun and when we found it on Harbach...
The cops know about the half-million dollars you gave to James Harbach.<eos> So what?<eos> Well, they also know that you gave me Salter's old gun to give to Harbach two days before he killed Neyers.<eos> Jesus, man. And they're saying that you paid your grandfather to kill him, and so now because I delivered the gun to him, I'm an accomplice in this murder.<eos> They're... they're...<eos> they're coming after us! First of all, they don't know anything.<eos> They're just trying to scare you into implicating me, which you can't do because I never gave you Salter's gun.<eos> What?<eos> Of course you did.<eos> How the hell would I even have it if y-you hadn't given it to me?
So...<eos> I mean, so, what, you just killed her? Look at it like this, Bill... 2/3 of all human conceptions are spontaneously aborted by nature.<eos> 10 million women die every year in childbirth.<eos> I just nudged Cindy towards those probable outcomes.<eos> Right?<eos> It was sloppy, but effective.<eos> Now, the way that I killed my father... that was a work of art.<eos> You know?<eos> I made sure all the evidence was double-sided, circumstantial.<eos> Salter gave me that gun years ago for protection, and I gave it to you to give to my grandfather because, well, he lived in a shit house in a shit neighborhood, and he... he couldn't even afford a lousy security system.
- Girls!<eos> Girls!<eos> Please.<eos> Sally, you can understand how your mother and I are both worried about your nose.<eos> Yeah, I know, because where would Mom be without her perfect nose?<eos> She wouldn't find a man like you.<eos> She'd be nothing.<eos> It was a perfect nose.<eos> And I gave it to you.<eos> You're lucky Henry is important enough to get Dr. Kramer to fix it this weekend.
Did you park your white horse outside?<eos> Spare me the suspense and tell me what your "save the day" plan is.<eos> I don't have anything yet.<eos> The idea I had wasn't great.<eos> It wasn't great.<eos> It was terrible.<eos> I want to hear the real one.<eos> Or are you just going to pull it out during the presentation?<eos> This idea is good.<eos> I think we can get the client to buy it.

Excellent, let's hear something.<eos> "I will jump in the funfair."<eos> "I will jump in the funfair."<eos> "I will get things for you."<eos> "Hey girl, don't sway too much.." Very good.<eos> It was a cute song.<eos> You will not give spinach to me.<eos> This place is in the center of the Mumbai.<eos> All around are the buildings only.<eos> Buildings surround it and right in the center is this shit hole.
"Enough for me."<eos> "Rain of gold falls upon her house.<eos> "lt is truly the sun of God."<eos> But say it with more feeling.<eos> They need a trembling voice to believe it comes from the heart.<eos> By Tuesday we'll recite "Hagar," "Bullfight" and "The Wise Man Ching Chang".<eos> "Poetry.<eos> "Poetry must stand and speak.<eos> "Stand on a broken washing machine<eos> "and speak the language of the sock that broke it.
But you hardly seem like the rare-books type.<eos> Don't judge a book by its cover.<eos> I think that's the saying, right, detective?<eos> Yes, but I'd still like an answer.<eos> I needed a job, he gave me one.<eos> Simple as that.<eos> In our experience, things are rarely that simple.<eos> You know what he kept in the safe?<eos> Nope.<eos> You know the combination or where he keeps it?
- What happened to it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe he got tired signing all those autographs.<eos> All right, Jane spilled coffee on it,<eos> - and she asked me to get the stain out.<eos> - Well, you did.<eos> It's just too bad the stain was on the signature.<eos> I know.<eos> I made it worse.<eos> Jane brought it to me because she thinks I'm some kind of whiz with the stain removal.
Thanks.<eos> I know you didn't have breakfast.<eos> Peace treaty?<eos> I don't need much.<eos> I'm not staying any longer than you make me.<eos> You know, you shouldn't see this as a sentence.<eos> I'm giving you food, clothes, protection.<eos> When have those things ever been free?<eos> I never asked for your help.<eos> But you needed it.
Not even that, uh, Pablo what's-his-face?<eos> That annoying barbecue guy?<eos> Pablo Vaye. Mmm.<eos> Handsome and he knows his way around a brisket.<eos> - And, no, there's nothing pointing to him.<eos> - So, besides Lantini, any links between Callahan and the rest of the people on the boat?<eos> Not even a thin thread.<eos> But if we had any doubts Callahan was tied to that bombing, they're gone.<eos> - That the kid's picture?<eos> - Mm-hmm. We uploaded it to the server. Jay?
- I don't gamble.<eos> - Shh, here it comes.<eos> Auf wiedersehen.<eos> This is Frank Winter.<eos> I need an outside line.<eos> Indiana.<eos> Is that Chanel No. 5?<eos> I thought they stopped shipping that?<eos> Oh, my mother planned ahead.<eos> Emptied the pantry and filled it with bottles.
See, my old man refused to go home without a kill.<eos> I read Babbit's work in college.<eos> He is an underappreciated scientist.<eos> - He's one of the best around.<eos> - And you want me to shoot him?<eos> Charlie, you're not the hunter here.<eos> These men will not go back to Washington without a trophy.<eos> And if they can't bag a deer, they will settle for a grouse.<eos> You got a brilliant career ahead of you.<eos> Don't throw it away by lying to protect the wrong man.
What do you mean, I can't?<eos> No. My dad would kill you.<eos> That's easy.<eos> Fine.<eos> That's worth it.<eos> I'd die for you.<eos> You're worth it.<eos> I want you to take that shirt off.<eos> Make me.<eos> Take that shirt off before I cut it off.
- I can think of. - We should call the cops.<eos> Okay.<eos> I had a conversation on my computer... 911, please state your emergency.<eos> Yeah, hi, there's someone threatening me and my friends online, and they also threatened our friend, Valerie Rommel.<eos> You sent some officers over there earlier to her house, but they didn't see what we saw, and there's a lot more to the story.<eos> What is your friend's address?<eos> What? Her address.<eos> Uh, guys?<eos> Guys, what's her address?<eos> Uh, hold on, I have it in my desk.
...and we're being attacked.<eos> She says there's something in her house and she's being attacked, and it's her boyfriend and all of her friends.<eos> Just tell them to come to that address.<eos> You know who's attacking you?<eos> Okay.<eos> She says just come to the address.<eos> Wait, what is it again?<eos> What's the address?<eos> Yes, I'll tell...<eos> I'm sending it to you right now.
Well... there is something, someone that I've... always wanted to meet.<eos> But I know what you'll say.<eos> Try me.<eos> You'll say he's made up, that there is no such thing.<eos> Go on.<eos> It's...<eos> It's Robin Hood.<eos> Robin Hood. Yeah!<eos> I love that story.<eos> I've always loved it, ever since I was little.
You can't keep me locked up with a laughing person.<eos> Oh, I find that quite funny.<eos> Do you know, I feel another laugh coming on. Ha-ha-ha!<eos> Guards, I cannot remain in this cell!<eos> Execute me now!<eos> You heard him - execute the old fool!<eos> No, hang on, execute him!<eos> I do not fear death, so execute away!<eos> Execute him!<eos> I'd like to see if his head keeps laughing when you chop it off!
Can you just stop?<eos> You'll give yourself a hernia!<eos> So what are you hanging around here for, then, Your Majesty?<eos> Why are you bothering to squeeze the pips out of the peasants if you've got a skyship on stand-by?<eos> I'm impatient to hear your story.<eos> Oh, but I do not have one.<eos> I was lying.<eos> Lying?<eos> Yeah.<eos> People are so much better at sharing information if they think the other person has already got it.
It was... it was goo you weren't here for it.<eos> She hanging in there?<eos> No.<eos> Are you gonna take the cross, too?<eos> If we nee it.
Yeah, sure.<eos> The woman in exam room two, what meicine woul you give her?<eos> awn calle it.<eos> I know, but if you coul, what woul you give her?<eos> She was in a car accient.<eos> She suffere internal injuries.<eos> - It's just a guessing game.<eos> - So guess.<eos> You have the key.<eos> i you take it or i she give it to you?

You gonna kill each other now?<eos> Chill out, man!<eos> Who died and made you mother?<eos> [Roars]: Mom!<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll take you to work.<eos> I can't pawn guns.<eos> That's illegal.<eos> I'm glad to hear you say that, because this gun was used in a homicide.<eos> Yeah, so, you know, if it was here, and we found it, that makes you an accessory.
It's from your place of employment.<eos> We don't have a gun at the garage.<eos> It's from the Metro Pawnshop.<eos> You work there, too, right?<eos> See, the thing is, Donnie, this gun was used in a murder, and then returned.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> I don't think you're paying attention, Donnie.<eos> This gun had to be used by someone from the pawnshop.<eos> That's why you had to return it.<eos> So your boss didn't know you took it.
I mean, I can honestly say I'm the only programmer in the history of Atari where every one of my games that was released was a million seller.<eos> The word meteoric comes to mind.<eos> And now, Steven Spielberg brings us E.T. the Extra Terrestrial.<eos> Spielberg says, well, you know, my pictures, they open slow.<eos> And they build, and they hold, and da da da da da.<eos> And I just looked at him, and I didn't know anything. I said, not this one.<eos> It was E.T.. I said, it's going to open huge , and it's going to stay huge.<eos> OK, the movie comes out. It's a huge hit.<eos> And we want to do the cartridge of it.<eos> OK? You know, every time you try to take some kind of a property and move it into another medium for a pure profit motive, you get trouble.
If we can prove to that judge.. ..that she's already had problems.. ..then this marriage can be immediately terminated.<eos> Sir, yes...she's got terrible problems.<eos> She's a psycho.<eos> Cribbing, crying, yak-yak...day and night.<eos> Sir, I did everything for her.<eos> But no, it all seems useless to her.<eos> And then she's furious about.. ..why I don't admit my mistake.<eos> I will if I make a mistake.<eos> Sir, do you get her attitude?<eos> Sir, do you get it?
Daddy, I tried to explain to her, I really tried.<eos> Okay?<eos> And she would not listen.<eos> No matter calm and normal, taking a breath, nothing worked.<eos> She just would not listen ever.<eos> No.<eos> Not listen.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> What did you do?<eos> I clutched her skirt and tore it off and everyone could see her underwear.
Cheeseburgers on pretzel bread.<eos> That's it, I quit.<eos> Cooper, wait until you try Gabi's waffle fries.<eos> With my special, secret-recipe ketchup.<eos> Ooh, what's the secret?<eos> Bought it at the store.<eos> Here, why don't you... why don't you try some? Oh, no!<eos> Why don't you come to the laundry room with me and I'll help you get it out.<eos> Gabi, I don't even care about this shirt.<eos> I found it in a dumpster...
Promise me you won't say anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> And one last thing...<eos> - Are Cooper and I fired?<eos> - No.<eos> Then can I go home early?<eos> I've had a really hard day.<eos> Go.<eos> And can I take this extra salad?<eos> 'Cause I already tossed it with the dressing and...
Hey, sounds like you're hungry.<eos> If you don't mind instant ramen, I have some in my room.<eos> Good Night. Huh.<eos> Didn't you want to talk to me?<eos> Hey, Hinata.<eos> I wonder who gave it to him.<eos> I'm happy for you, Naruto.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> You're getting the scarf wet.<eos> I don't need it anymore.

Naruto, take care of Hinata.<eos> Leave it to me.<eos> What is it?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - What is it?<eos> It's Hanabi's kunai.<eos> Huh. You brought the scarf?<eos> Huh.<eos> Why aren't you using it?
What is this?<eos> Was there a war long ago?<eos> What's wrong, Hinata?<eos> It's a spider web.<eos> You can see far with your Byakugan, but you walk straight into a spider web.<eos> You're so silly.<eos> Naruto.<eos> What is it?<eos> Umm, What happened to your scarf?<eos> It's warm underground, so I took it off.
You start with her.<eos> Ellie.<eos> She was smart.<eos> Had spirit.<eos> That's always trouble.<eos> Angel gave permission for anybody to do whatever they wanted to her.<eos> Is that what's going to happen to me... If I help you?<eos> You're gonna transfer me to Michigan, right?<eos> I read online that's the place to go.<eos> Just sign the statement, Tino, before I take it away.
Strange. Huh.<eos> If it were anyone else.<eos> [Beep] Stanton!<eos> Uh, boys, listen, I've hit a slight snag in my plans, and I could use your discretion on a personal matter.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you know you can trust us.<eos> We got attorney/friend privilege.<eos> Listen, I need you to remove the color-field painting from my wall.<eos> There's a safe.<eos> Sir, do you want us to open it?
Oh, I-I trust you have no plans tonight.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Good.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Looks like we're heading to Vegas.<eos> S04E10 Red or Black ♪ Ooh, what a mixture ♪ ♪ Such a vivid picture ♪<eos> Infeld said not to open it.<eos> Well, I don't want T.S.A. literally up my ass if it's filled with meth or a human head.<eos> Can't fit a human head in here.<eos> You could if you chop it up into a bunch of pieces.
I'm going to be going away tomorrow for let's just say a very long time.<eos> Stanton...<eos> I'd really appreciate it if we could get the wheels of justice moving with a little more alacrity.<eos> Could we fast-track this case, get it on the calendar for, say, tomorrow?<eos> Why not?<eos> We got all the evidence we need.<eos> [Snaps fingers] Thank you.<eos> Appreciate that. Wait.<eos> Why are you taking... that's my guitar!<eos> We're confiscating it, along with the rest of your winnings. Stanton:
Well, we are looking at five years in prison.<eos> Or we let Infeld meet his destiny. You guys are the lawyers.<eos> I'll follow whatever you say.<eos> I can't do well in prison.<eos> Peter Bash, Jared Franklin, Eliazar Mundy, please step forward.<eos> Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, your honor.<eos> - Good afternoon, your honor.<eos> I talked to the D.A. about his more-than-generous offer.<eos> Yes, yes, it's a very generous offer, your honor.<eos> I'd take it and run.
Were you aware the property was insecure? No.<eos> When did you last visit the property yourself?<eos> Well... It'll be two or three months since, now.<eos> And your wife says you've no tenants at the minute.<eos> No, no.<eos> Never had any.<eos> I've not got round to sorting it out.<eos> Who has keys to the property besides yourself?<eos> Nobody... should have.<eos> Have they damaged it?
You staying over there now?<eos> No. I...<eos> I just went over there the other night and... Never left.<eos> I used to go there a lot when I was younger.<eos> It's like a rite of passage.<eos> So that's what that was. Mm.<eos> You can finish your beer, Daniel.<eos> Take as long as you like.<eos> The door, it'll lock behind you.<eos> I'll just take it with me.
Then you forsook me.<eos> And now I'm lost.<eos> I know there's... There's good in you, Daniel.<eos> And that goodness is God.<eos> You don't know me, Tawney.<eos> You only think you know me.<eos> You only see what you want to see.<eos> You don't know the despicable things I've done.<eos> It doesn't change that it's there... your goodness.<eos> But if you keep that goodness to yourself and you don't share it with the world, that's a greater sin than anything you think you might have done in the past.
I only want what's best for him.<eos> I'm not saying I know exactly what that is.<eos> It's not a plea deal.<eos> So, I'll go to the D.A. with your request.<eos> It's not a request.<eos> Understood.<eos> I'd like to listen to the tape.<eos> Tape?<eos> My confession.<eos> I haven't heard it since the trial, and I'd like to.
I liked her.<eos> Are you gonna say you killed her today?<eos> Probably.<eos> Will I ever see you again after you leave paulie?<eos> Probably not.<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> Don't tell mother for a while, okay? [ sighs ] Do you need my bike today?<eos> No.<eos> Thanks for letting me use it, though.<eos> I liked knowing you were riding it.

Relax, nothing can hurt you.<eos> Good.<eos> Now you see a door, the answer you are looking for is behind that door.<eos> Now open the door slowly.<eos> I am afraid to open it.<eos> Don't worry, you are completely safe.<eos> Tell me- what does the door look like?<eos> Very old...<eos> Very ancient...<eos> I think I have seen it before.
You don't have a name and a birth certificate.<eos> Stop telling these lies!<eos> My parents have passed away.<eos> But actually they are still alive, and they gave birth to a son after abandoning you.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> I want you to look closely.<eos> Think hard, in the depth of your memory,<eos> (Mr. and Mrs. Ren Jianguo) where did it all begin to go wrong?<eos> The answer is inside your memory,<eos> I want you to find it again.
Like what?<eos> It's...stupid.<eos> It really doesn't matter.<eos> No, I'd like to know.<eos> I would stare at your photo on the murder board.<eos> And I started thinking that if I would look at it long enough every day, that that would keep you alive.<eos> I guess it worked.<eos> And then I had this thing about your chair.<eos> My chair at the precinct?<eos> I wouldn't let anyone touch it.
Previously on The Bridge...<eos> I'm giving you a story.<eos> You don't want it, I will find some other asshole journalist who does.
- Or drink heavily.<eos> Come on, get that beer.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Next stop... Pulitzer station.<eos> Hey. Eva, they-they have something to tell you.<eos> What happened?<eos> They killed the prosecutor.<eos> I'm so sorry, Eva.<eos> And, uh, what happened to her statement?<eos> We think they have it.
Abelardo was one of the good ones.<eos> He was totally alone, trused no one.<eos> I'm sure he kept backups of Eva's affidavit.<eos> You had him changing hotels, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Do you know where he stayed last?<eos> I know where he stayed two nights ago.<eos> It didn't pass legal.<eos> - You wanted the story.<eos> - Yeah, and I supported it.
The aim could not be more true.<eos> If the tree line is the wall and we are two arrow flights scarce, true aim does not matter, does it?<eos> We need to bring the engine closer.<eos> Bring it closer, we will become pin cushions.
The light would be filtering in.<eos> You're not in the National Gallery, you're inside that church - low light, maybe the sound of chanting, maybe the sound of prayers being spoken slowly.<eos> The smell of incense used to carry up the prayers of the faithful to the heavenly realm, and if you will now just imagine that you are looking at this painting by the light of candles, candles which flicker, candles which would shine against the gold, and you might think...<eos> Cos remember you can't read, you can't write, the year is 1377, your houses are too hot in summer, too cold in winter, death is part of the threnody of everyday life, people are dying all the time,<eos> you might think to yourself, "If I'm good, I can perhaps get up to the kingdom everlasting<eos> "where all is good, great and golden."<eos> I think another thing might also happen - by the flickering candlelight, you might think that these figures were moving.<eos> If they were moving, they were real and could hear your prayer and intercede for you with Christ and the Virgin in heaven.<eos> The painting would be acting as a sacramental channel from earth to heaven, and in a sense, that's how this painting worked.<eos> I don't mean to make this sound as crude perhaps as I am but if you will for a moment just imagine that I've brought from my pocket a picture of a sweet, grey, fluffy kitten and I've pinned it here and I've said,
I'll stop there and say thank you very much and goodbye.<eos> How did Leonardo da Vinci start off with a blank panel and a palette of oil paints and create a painting of such sublime beauty?<eos> If you just look at that flower in the corner there, how did that happen?<eos> It's this wonderful mixture of observation and imagination.<eos> What was in the artist... What was Velazquez's intention on painting Venus with her back to us but with that bewitching look in the mirror?<eos> And how did Stubbs achieve such an anatomically accurate representation of a horse?<eos> This painting is huge, so physically, there must have been great challenges in painting it but artistically, look at the detail, look at the observation that the artist was able to represent.<eos> What was in van Gogh's mind when he painted this glorious vase of sunflowers with its brilliant use of colour to convey mood?<eos> Just look at the number of colours that are in this painting.<eos> It's really yellow and green but with this amazing blue stripe through it and a blue frame to the vase.
The only way, until the advent of photography, to have an image, is to have a painter paint you.<eos> They had money, they were wealthy, they could pay for the best painter living in England to capture their image, and the top painter living and working in London in 1533 was the German painter<eos> And, at some point, the three men -<eos> Hans Holbein, Jean de Dinteville, Georges de Selve - would have got together and discussed this composition.<eos> They're the ones telling the painter what to do.<eos> Probably, Jean de Dinteville having the greater say, because it was his painting - he paid, it went back to his chateau in Polisy, and it could well be that Hans Holbein had no idea of the whole significance of everything he was being asked to make.<eos> I have a colleague who thinks this is all about a murder that took place.<eos> And I look at it, and I say but, "Where?<eos> What?"<eos> And he says, "I'm not telling you, you'll steal my idea and publish it."
This is not painting for the marketplace.<eos> This picture was for a rather important client.<eos> So we can't be absolutely certain about this underlying painting.<eos> I think it's fair to say it's the same sort of body type and general characteristics as Frederick Rihel, so you might say that he may have changed it in response to this event that happened, is one theory.<eos> This is in itself is quite a bold and very unusual composition.<eos> There are more or less no full-length portraits after his experiences with the reception of The Night Watch.<eos> So that in itself is unusual and to have this great empty space with what look like trees and the rest coming through is quite fascinating.<eos> But for whatever reason of which we can't be certain, this picture, which is probably not entirely finished but very far along, was changed.<eos> And then we get into some interesting things about what happened when it was changed.<eos> He, amazingly enough, just turned it sideways and started again.
He goes up onto the mountain, comes down with the Ten Commandments and he gathers the Israelites around him.<eos> He says, "OK guys, I've been up there, I've had a word with him.<eos> "Do you want the good news, or the bad news?"<eos> And they say, "Good news."<eos> "Good news is, I've got him down to ten.<eos> "The bad news is that adultery is still on the list."<eos> Anyway...<eos> This painting got vandalised a couple of months ago.<eos> Some crazy guy came in with a red aerosol.<eos> Luckily, they got the restoration team in straight away, took it down, took it away, worked all night and I came in the next morning and it was...
Luckily, they got the restoration team in straight away, took it down, took it away, worked all night and I came in the next morning and it was...<eos> - It was back up?<eos> - That's really nice. - Yeah, it was back up, cleaned up, perfect.<eos> Sadly, these things happen from time to time, but you just have to learn to live with it.<eos> Now, let me show you the last Claude, because there's a nice little story attached to this one.<eos> To come back to that research on Watteau was fundamental.<eos> Bringing the works together was also an important element.<eos> Now, we will see from what will come out of the...<eos> Study of the partition -<eos> I have ordered a big electronic copy of the partition and we have sent it to William Christie, who believes - and I think all the scholars - believe that, Watteau, represented very accurately every musical movement, so it's not...
A lot of the things he does in his working practice as well as the application of paint are all kind of inextricably bound with what we treasure in them.<eos> So I'll start off with Boy Bitten by a Lizard.<eos> The main thing I'd like to convey about this picture is to get you to understand a little bit about how he's using his priming, his ground - that's the layer he puts on the canvas before he starts painting the figure.<eos> In this case it's a kind of rich, bricky red-brown colour.<eos> This is something that he's exploiting, then, in the subsequent build-up of the paint.<eos> The brown colour is left exposed quite deliberately to help him evolve the modelling of the flesh tones.<eos> Bellori, an important critic writing in the 1670s, was already writing about this - how he used the ground exposed to give the middle colours of the flesh painting.<eos> You can see that in the shadow sort of around the breast and the shadowed part of the cheek, the shadowed part of the hands, and quite a lot of drapery painting is essentially the ground colour.<eos> And it's a very economical way of proceeding, because once you establish the figure, you use the ground, you can put a very thin, translucent brown colour to push the shadows back, and then when you build<eos> the lighter colours up, when you're mixing the light-coloured paint and putting it on top of a darker ground, it gets very opaque very quickly, and so it's extremely economical.
School buses can't get through.<eos> Yeah, what are you gonna do, call in the army again?<eos> You've reached Dr. Maggie Langston.<eos> If this is a medical emergency...<eos> You mind?<eos> No.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> You got a really nice place.<eos> It's big.<eos> I got it when I thought I was moving in with someone.
Dave, is that you?<eos> I think that's Dave Oldroyd in there.<eos> - What, you know him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Stage 2 Osteosarcoma patient.<eos> He's due for his next round of chemo in like an hour.<eos> Dave, what are you doing in there?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> - My head hurts when I move it.
Fake I.D.?<eos> Where are you getting this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe 'cause you've literally shown it to every student in school.<eos> I have been trying to ignore you all day.<eos> So, I got carried away.<eos> Come on, Coach Meller.<eos> You remember the rush of having a fake I.D., right?<eos> Ah, geez, all right.<eos> Just don't let me see it again.
There's a kid in the locker room with a beard.<eos> If I don't act, I could get left behind, so I dug deep and really did some soul searching, and I figured out what my problem is.<eos> I need a new backpack. Uh-huh.<eos> I'm using my "Shaq-will" O'Neal one, and according to a guy on a sports team, he's not even playing anymore.<eos> So I'm changing it up.<eos> It's a whole new Brick this year.<eos> And the new Brick carries... A messenger bag.<eos> Here's your first message... no one cares.<eos> Oh-ho, I think they will.<eos> See, the beauty of a messenger bag is you can adjust it to your mood.

Hmm.<eos> Maybe with just a slight adjustment.<eos> I think this is how they're wearing it these days.
- No.<eos> No more tweaks.<eos> It's been eight years, for God's sakes.<eos> There comes a time when you have to say,<eos> "the cake is done," and take it out of the oven.<eos> I know you're frustrated, but the bone is just a little spongy.<eos> Spongy bone.<eos> I'll tell you what's spongy... your bank account, 'cause it's sucking up all our money.<eos> And don't think we don't know about the lake house you bought, 'cause it was in the paper.<eos> Maybe next time, you don't brag about it on the front page.
Perfect.<eos> You got any sense why he's got such a hard-on for this artifact?<eos> Well, I don't know, but from the way he's talking, it sounds like he wants it for someone else.<eos> Expensive gift.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> I'm supposed to get Margot out of the suite between 7:00 and 8:00 tonight, and he's gonna send someone in, crack the safe.<eos> Then we'll just have to beat him to it.<eos> I want you and her out of the hotel by 6:00.<eos> Then you'll go in, crack the safe, and put a tracker on the piece so we can figure out where it ends up.<eos> Wait, we're just gonna let Galan steal it.
The woman... the woman that was staying here, donde esta?<eos> Yo no sei. The woman, she leave.<eos> Did she check out? When?<eos> Que hora?<eos> For you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Everything we found out about Margot Atkins, who works for the Smithsonian, it's gone.<eos> What do you mean gone?<eos> The trail's been wiped clean like she never even existed.<eos> Whoever she's really working for created a false legend, then erased it.
Like a hand is inside my chest...<eos> And it's squeezing my heart... tighter and tighter, and he won't let me go until it's over.<eos> "He"?<eos> What?<eos> "He" won't let go?<eos> It's not about that.<eos> - It isn't?<eos> - No, no.<eos> It's not about Neil telling you to leave your own house?<eos> He paid for it.
I thought it was a 36 hour trip.<eos> It is but some things have come up.<eos> What things?<eos> Well, for one, Marcus's so-called "friends" have turned my tree house into a brigade, which they are not letting him up into.<eos> He is currently standing guard.<eos> Everyone has to take a turn standing guard.<eos> No, no, Marcus doesn't have to stand guard.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> It's his tree house.<eos> I built it for him.
I'm going to tell you this because I trust you, and... and, hell, even if I didn't, you're the last stop.<eos> I'd been to Anderson's house, before the fire.<eos> I wanted to see in person why Anderson wasn't cashing Cranfield's check.<eos> But when I got there, nobody answered.<eos> I could hear someone was there though, so I went around the back.<eos> There was this vibration.<eos> For no reason, I suddenly felt terrified and so sick.<eos> When it stopped, the feeling immediately went away.<eos> It had to have been that machine he was working on, the one he talked about last night, 19 hertz.<eos> And now I understand why he called it the ghost machine.
Well, I just mean, if I lost somebody and then I had to answer a bunch of personal questions about them to get a benefit check, I'd probably go mental.<eos> No offense.<eos> I've never seen anybody go mental.<eos> They're sad, but they're safe.<eos> Then why do you carry a gun?<eos> What?<eos> She has a gun in her purse.<eos> Right?<eos> What makes you think she has...<eos> Actually, Jill, I used to have a gun, but I don't need it anymore.
No offense.<eos> I've never seen anybody go mental.<eos> They're sad, but they're safe.<eos> Then why do you carry a gun?<eos> What?<eos> She has a gun in her purse.<eos> Right?<eos> What makes you think she has...<eos> Actually, Jill, I used to have a gun, but I don't need it anymore.<eos> - Why'd you need it before?
To lure me?<eos> To kill me?<eos> No. Why would I?<eos> How?<eos> Or perhaps... perhaps you did not have a choice.<eos> Tell me, whose bidding is it that you do?<eos> Is it John Alden who wants me dead?<eos> Or Mary Sibley?<eos> Or do they work in concert? Hmm?<eos> Tell me now, or I'll slide this blade along your throat, and you'll be dead before I clean and sheath it.
You watched our sex tape?<eos> !<eos> Not just me.<eos> We all did.<eos> Oh.<eos> Wow.<eos> Remind me never to rob a bank with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> In our defense, you left it in the armoire.<eos> That's where I put it.
Happy new year!<eos> All: Happy new year!<eos> Happy new year!<eos> Okay, Dewey, stay focused, okay?<eos> Now, if this happens for five years...<eos> Can I just have my beer back?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> It's not your beer anymore, because under the law,<eos> Harcourt possessed it for five years, made like it was his, and you didn't stop him.
Dude, I'm a parrothead, too.<eos> Pipes.<eos> I rem... I remember pipes.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you do.<eos> [Chuckling] No, man.<eos> No, not... no.<eos> Construction pipes.<eos> Like, he had construction pipes lying on my property.<eos> Did you say something about it to Harcourt?<eos> Uh, no, but I wrote him a note, and I told him I didn't think it was cool, and then I put it on the windshield of his Ferrari.
It doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Oh, my God, it goes on the other side.<eos> They like to sit... here, just... fine.<eos> - Switch them.<eos> - Fine, fine, fine.<eos> - Here you go, take this.<eos> - No, excuse me, can I pass?<eos> - Just take the seat.<eos> - Just let me pass and I'll put it on the other side.
Shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> It's two against two.<eos> We have no other choice.<eos> We flip a coin.<eos> - That is the dumbest thing - I'm not letting a freaking coin<eos> - you've ever said. - decide whether or not I go to jail tonight!<eos> We don't have time to fight!<eos> We need to make a decision and commit to it.<eos> So if someone has a better idea, say it now!
You got your fancy equation that can predict failures.<eos> Uh, well, it's in the same way a-a weatherman can predict a hurricane, but the hur...<eos> Eh, it's not quite the same thing.<eos> Uh, a hurricane can't be fixed with a wrench, can it?<eos> When you put it that way...<eos> So, now, would it be fair to say that the cancellation of Professor Boyd's flight was not an act of God.<eos> It was... an act of Ted.<eos> No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> The intent of that rule is to keep out drug users.<eos> Weston: I can't tell you the intent, only that all these people violated it.
My wife...<eos> Naomi.<eos> A little Mrs. Cullen?<eos> - Yeah. - And a baby.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - Now, this here's Psalms.<eos> And it appears that the vest Mr. Psalms is wearin' is mine.<eos> No, was yourn.<eos> Elam had your gun and your belongings when they took you away.<eos> How'd you get it off of him?
You know, I feel lighter.<eos> Seriously.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> "Supersede"... c-e-d-e?<eos> S-e-d-e.<eos> It's Latin for "seat."<eos> I watch a lot of "Jeopardy!" when I can't sleep.<eos> How's the warrant coming?<eos> Well, it'd be going a lot faster if the spellcheck was working.<eos> Well, I need it as soon as Oliver gives me a team of uniforms.
You're gonna dodge a call?<eos> Really?<eos> 1519, are you 10-8?<eos> Okay. Uh, 1519.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry about the raid.<eos> Did Oliver say why he's calling it off?
Okay, point is, they were leaving you here alone?<eos> I'm 17.<eos> No school today?<eos> Come on, Seth, I'm not gonna bust you for skipping algebra.<eos> I wasn't even supposed to be here, okay?<eos> I... I... I ditched to go get this new console.<eos> Steam Box?<eos> You game?<eos> Do newbs get ganked?<eos> Didn't even get it unwrapped. Somebody steals it.
Between you and me, people around here are starting to think that maybe this was an inside job... insurance fraud.<eos> Happens all the time.<eos> It wasn't.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because.<eos> What?<eos> Because I had a stash of pot in the studio, okay?<eos> And whoever broke in took it.
Shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> It's two against two.<eos> We have no other choice.<eos> We flip a coin.<eos> - That is the dumbest thing - I'm not letting a freaking coin you've ever said.<eos> decide whether or not I go to jail tonight!<eos> We don't have time to fight!<eos> We need to make a decision and commit to it.<eos> So if someone has a better idea, say it now!
Find a defense that will free our client.<eos> The First Assistant saw Gina with an aspirin that morning.<eos> Forensics found aspirin residue on the plate.<eos> She was warned about the allergy first day on the job, which means we should argue... we should argue... which means we should argue... we should argue... means we should argue... she's guilty.<eos> Hi.<eos> Wes.<eos> I just moved in next door.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Uh, your music...<eos> I normally wouldn't ask to turn it down.
Guess what!<eos> You go to jail, and I'm the shoddy lawyer who put you there!<eos> I had a headache!<eos> It isn't --<eos> Stop lying!<eos> Get out.<eos> I can't think with you here.<eos> She's not wrong, annalise.<eos> It's aspirin.<eos> We all buy it.
- She would have kept what?<eos> - The memory card.<eos> She was filming Sumner and all the girls when they were messing with him.<eos> She was going to put it on the internet before...<eos> - Before he died.<eos> - I see where you're going with this.<eos> Does she incriminate herself?<eos> - No, she was holding the camera, but the other girls do.<eos> - Yeah, but you can't just break into her room to get it.<eos> - Well, she wouldn't keep it in her room, she has girls in and out of there all the time.
You know, I got the lemonade, the fizzy kind that you love.<eos> You love that.<eos> Like, eight years ago.<eos> True.<eos> Yeah, that was a while ago.<eos> So if you don't want that, we'll get something else then.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Don't let her do that.<eos> Your dad bought you the lemonade fizzy stuff that you like.<eos> You suck it up, and you drink it.
Nobody's saying you're not handling it, sarah.<eos> Tell him they're gonna try to get into my groin, okay?<eos> - Sarah, is that dad?<eos> - I want to get out of here.<eos> Of course, he's dad.<eos> He's being dad.<eos> No, you got to make sure that he listens to those doctors.<eos> - I've got to go.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Or I'll rip it out myself.
Thank God we were never that bad.<eos> I'm sorry you had to see Luke and I mid-make-out last night.<eos> Well, Jenna, it's not like it was the first time.<eos> Ouch.<eos> Totally true, but ouch.<eos> Luke seems like a good guy, though.<eos> I'm really happy for you.<eos> It is hard to find a person of quality around here.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You know, maybe I'll write another song and call it My Crazy Ex Talks Like A Speed Freak
- Let me help you.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'm just gonna grab my vacuum.<eos> Oh, I threw that old thing down by the dumpster<eos> Because I got a robo-vac.<eos> It cleans by itself.<eos> But I love my old vacuum.<eos> I had it since college.<eos> I lost my virginity to that vacuum... To the sound of that vacuum.<eos> I turned it on, so my roommate didn't have to listen To me having sex with her brother.
Guys, I can't tell you how important tomorrow night is.<eos> Well, apparently important enough to interrupt A story about my workout.<eos> I'm just excited.<eos> It's my first Halloween in ten years without Cassie.<eos> - Oh. - And since I don't have to Hang out with her dumb friends this year,<eos> - We're dumb.<eos> - So what are we doing?<eos> Well, as always, Annie, Dennah and I Are going to the single greatest party of the year, Halloween hella-rage,<eos> Zagat lovingly called it "a [bleep] damn mess."
To see what's in there to determine if I'm gonna go downstairs or not.<eos> - You know, saves me a trip.<eos> - You are the laziest man I ever met.<eos> What?<eos> Are there any grapes in there?<eos> - Uh, no. - Oh.<eos> (Door creaks) (Both scream) What?<eos> Both:<eos> Hey, babies.<eos> Diane had a nightmare and told me about it, and now I'm more scared than she is.
- Don't move!<eos> - Okay, okay!<eos> Just hold on, Flynn!<eos> Slider.<eos> Do you mind if I call you "Slider"?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> You can't prove anything.<eos> That jacket you're wearing, you stole it out of the closet of a house where a girl was murdered.<eos> The original owner's DNA is going to be all over it, and your gun is being tested in ballistics right now.<eos> And we will match it up with the bullets you put in Bug.
To destroy the earth, and most importantly...shopping!<eos> What a bastard!<eos> Let me kill you first.<eos> Invading the earth just for shopping?<eos> You big evil!<eos> Let me tear off your ears!<eos> Oh why are you here?<eos> I make an appearance to support you!<eos> Why do you wear a wig?<eos> I've actually been wearing it all this time.
It's the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Yeah, we got others in the family.<eos> My abuser actually was my scoutmaster.<eos> Not a priest.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Dig in, guys.<eos> I need an answer.<eos> You're not getting it now, Terry.
Mickey?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a great guy.<eos> I love you.<eos> But we got a problem.<eos> Alan?<eos> Alan.<eos> Sorry, Debra, but I can't make this movie.<eos> So, what?<eos> He won't do it, we'll get someone else.
So, what?<eos> He won't do it, we'll get someone else.<eos> No one will fucking touch it now.<eos> You went to his house.<eos> What would I have seen if I had taken pictures of you, Ray?<eos> How many fucking women would there be?<eos> I need you to sign these papers.<eos> What are they?<eos> Loan papers for the new house.<eos> I don't want it anymore.
Frankie, it's a fantasy.<eos> Just go along with it.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You're right. You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're in the most Cosmopolitan city in the world.<eos> Meanwhile, back in America, after 24 hours and three visits to first aid...<eos> Sue tripped over her binder and munched it pretty hard...
Two diet Cokes, no problem.<eos> Two straws.<eos> Sure.<eos> The menu, there for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What you doing?<eos> !<eos> Have you got the list?<eos> No!<eos> I left it back at the home, then.
But that's okay.<eos> I guess spies don't need sleep.<eos> I'll give you something on Humphries.<eos> That's what you really want.<eos> No, I'm fine with just locking you up.<eos> But if you want to have a conversation, tell me everything, and we'll see where we go from there.<eos> I needed a job to stay in the country.<eos> Humphries was the only one who made me an offer, which, of course, came with a catch.<eos> You would be working for Eternity labs, instead of him.<eos> He said they stole his idea, and we were going to get it back.
- He's my science teacher.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Ah, welcome.<eos> OK, well, come in.<eos> Jake, I'll give you the grand tour.<eos> No, you better give your shoes a spritz.<eos> You've got half of Bremin on them.<eos> Wow, this smells fantastic.<eos> Yeah, I backpacked through Italy after uni and came across this recipe in a little village there.<eos> Of course, I've refined it over time.
Are we all agreed on that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then, what?<eos> Then we kept following Andy.<eos> Mmm. Details, Felix - did he walk, did he run?<eos> Did he talk to someone else, hmm?<eos> What about you two?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Felix said that Andy grabbed his bag and ran, and then... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Why did he take it?
And now for the piece de resistance of the Tony Bravo Enterprises tour, the Riot locker room.<eos> See, there's lucky Buddha.<eos> Duquesne's beats.<eos> I knew you ladies would dig it.<eos> Ooh, let's see what the new guy's wearing.<eos> - [Both sniff] - Oh, that smells like wet dog.<eos> Ah, I heard that was a gift from his brother and it came highly recommended by the salesperson.<eos> Ooh, look, Holester's locker.<eos> - Uh-uh, give it.<eos> - No, I touched it first.
- That's true.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna need one of you for the interrogation.<eos> You stay.<eos> Take a break from the rookie.<eos> I got to get him to Fite Nite, anyway.<eos> I bet it's guns. Or drugs.<eos> It's always drugs with these Dowling guys.<eos> Gail: I bet it's a severed head.<eos> Why would there be a severed head in a safe, Gail?<eos> Where else would you keep it?
Thanks.<eos> See you around?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wes: You and I need to talk.<eos> - About what?<eos> - "About what?"<eos> You took something that belonged to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know that bust was mine.<eos> Actually, you gave it away.
- What is it?<eos> - A knife stab, the heart might be damaged.<eos> Dark blood.<eos> Adrenaline, stat! - Scalpel.<eos> - Here?<eos> - To the OR.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I was just passing by.<eos> A stab wound.<eos> I plugged it with my finger.
What?<eos> ! No! Hmm.<eos> So Renzo and I met at a tap class. - He's amazing.<eos> - Oh, stop.<eos> - Do you dance?<eos> - Not on purpose.<eos> And also not well.<eos> Kathy my dear, do you have a medium-ish pot with a lid?<eos> I think you've used all of them.<eos> No, I need it for the beans.
Without proof of the baby, we got nothing.<eos> We have the Aruna file.<eos> They killed Derek Pearce because I sent him an e-mail.<eos> What do you think will happen if I go in there with just my story and the Aruna file?<eos> What choice do we have, huh?<eos> Sparks reports to the board.<eos> You walk into the morning meeting, you play them the file.<eos> - They can't all be in on it.<eos> - And what if<eos> Sparks buries the truth of the baby before they see it?
♪ here they coming with their guns, guns, guns, guns ♪<eos> ♪ say, "don't move, stick 'em up" ♪ ♪ you really think I'm gonna run, run, run, run ♪<eos> ♪ I'm never giving up ♪<eos> ♪ don't want to, don't want to ♪<eos> ♪ don't want to mess with me ♪<eos> - * I got the feeling I can break * - Give me the ball.<eos> - All right, first first, McNally, we're drinking.<eos> This isn't a drinking game, and that was my point.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> Life is a drinking game, McNally, and you have been phoning it in.
- Please listen to me!<eos> - Put the sword on the damn ground!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Put it down!<eos> - I just want my dad's ring!<eos> - Put the sword down!<eos> Duncan, I'm right behind you!<eos> Put this sword on the ground right now!<eos> Holster your weapon, now.<eos> - No, not until he drops it.
You're kidding, right?<eos> I am sober.<eos> You're a loser.<eos> You take that back.<eos> Make me.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> If you guys are gonna do this, let's get a mud pit and make some money.<eos> This is all your fault.<eos> You ruined my life.<eos> I ruined it?
Oh! Fuck!<eos> Ah, shit.<eos> Point is, rats can be fucking anywhere.<eos> Downtown, Boyle Heights, fucking Palisades... they don't give a shit.<eos> And that's great for me.<eos> 'Cause I'm building a goddamn empire on rats.<eos> See what I'm saying?<eos> You got to find a spot and fit in.<eos> Do the shit nobody wants to do.<eos> You see, I saw a need and I filled it.
Ok.<eos> Look.<eos> I hate to ask for a favor, but I need a locator spell.<eos> Something is missing...<eos> A white oak stake.<eos> It's powerful enough to kill an original.<eos> Did one of them put you up to this?<eos> D, if that stake is used on Klaus, every vampire that he sired dies, too.<eos> I know.<eos> What if I do find it?

What are you saying?<eos> She knows the stake will not be used because she knows precisely where it is.<eos> She's had it all along.<eos> So Jackson is MIA, and Oliver seems to think he's the alpha.<eos> They're not gonna listen to me.<eos> The crescent mark on your shoulder did not disappear when you became a hybrid.<eos> Go on.<eos> Talk to them.<eos> What the hell you two want?<eos> Hold your tongue, or I'll tear it from your gaping mouth.
They may not like me very much, but these people, including Oliver, are my family.<eos> Let him go now.<eos> You see, there's your queen-- Powerful, fearless, and, unlike me, merciful.<eos> These people need to show you more respect.<eos> How you handle them now is up to you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm going to find the witch.<eos> Seems I need to educate her as to what she may or may not do in my city.<eos> The stake is safe.<eos> Davina won't use it on Klaus if it would kill me.
I'll make it quick.<eos> You're stalling. No.<eos> That's not creep at all, watching me on me own date.<eos> Stop complimenting her and find out what she's hiding.<eos> I'm wooing her, Vincent.<eos> It requires charm and personality, something you'd know nothing about.<eos> Our mother wants answers, and if you can't get them, we'll do this my way.<eos> What are you gonna do, you gonna bore her until she can't help but tell you everything?<eos> If you want to find out if someone has a weapon, you provoke them into using it.<eos> I never said I had it.
Social networking, dad?<eos> So it's not just some stupid fad anymore?<eos> I'm going all in now.<eos> I mean, how cool is it that when you're away at college, I'll still be able to follow everything you're doing?<eos> [Cell phone chimes] Don't forget to friend me.<eos> My dad just friended me.<eos> That's the worst.<eos> My mom thinks writing "Call me" on my wall is texting.<eos> Now, about your essay.<eos> I read it with a very critical eye.
I know. What is up with her?<eos> But forget about that now.<eos> We are celebrating.<eos> Okay, big smile.<eos> How about some strudel while we wait?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Just a few more minutes.<eos> How much longer?<eos> Sadita's so used to hanging out the window sweet-talking all the customers, she isn't any good at firing up a sausage.<eos> Sergio, I will grind your sausage and feed it to--
I don't mind.<eos> Do you have any clue how selfish you're being right now?<eos> Okay, man, that's enough.<eos> She'll send it to you later.<eos> This is awk-weird.<eos> Jenna, we can just go.<eos> You know what?<eos> No, we're staying, 'cause we are having a great time.<eos> Matty, you want your essay so bad?<eos> Why don't you go and get it yourself?
What are you- Is your dad here?<eos> Uh, yeah, come in.<eos> We're going to Martha's Vineyard for the summer.<eos> He's doing one last big dinner.<eos> Dad. Hey. What are you doing here?<eos> Do you want to stay for dinner-- We got plenty of food.<eos> I stole the scales.<eos> I stole all ten of them.<eos> I sold them to a dealer, I--<eos> He gave me pot, and I smoked it.
I guess we're both fucked then.<eos> Possibly.<eos> I owe you.<eos> I won't forget it.<eos> Hey, Simmo...<eos> There's something you could do for me.<eos> Can you please give this letter to Brayden?<eos> It's to say how sorry I am.<eos> You can read it.<eos> I've left it unsealed.
Sure.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He's coming in tomorrow.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> What brings you here, Red?<eos> Have you got a sec?<eos> I might.<eos> You know the law, right?<eos> Yeah, wish I'd studied it before my trial.
Oh, he wants blood, But has recused himself.<eos> Now, as far as the press is concerned, He's going through a routine medical procedure. The good news is we've managed<eos> To keep a lid on the kidnapping so far.<eos> So what do we know about this woman?<eos> She's one of five significant warlords in the territory.<eos> Now, we don't know her place of origin, Date of birth or if Ulrika's even her real name,<eos> But we do know that she trusts no man Except for her right hand, Grigori Babishkova.<eos> Their base of operations is a former Soviet prison.<eos> It's a virtual fortress.<eos> The locals call it "the Citadel."
In the days after the tsunami, the government allowed them to continue to sell their produce as usual.<eos> The current state-mandated limit for radiation in produce is 100 becquerels per kilogram.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Finding out that he had been selling highly contaminated produce for over two weeks, his father was consumed with guilt.<eos> _<eos> In the 3 years since the accident, Tarukawa's farm has been cleared to sell crops once again.<eos> This was accomplished through an official government decontamination process.<eos> They come in, scrape up the top layer of soil, load it into trash bags, and haul it away, and as of now, they have no idea where to permanently store the 250,000 tons of contaminated soil
- That's okay, buddy.<eos> No harm done.<eos> - Oh, no. What'd you do?<eos> Okay, we're gonna have to take a break.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - Hello, how are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> My colostomy bag.<eos> No, don't touch it, don't touch.
No, it's the sequence when you do the U-turn that's when you have to roll your window down.<eos> You do it before we make the U-turn.<eos> So let's get on the main road, and then we'll keep moving.<eos> Then we'll roll up the window and start rolling.<eos> Correct.<eos> Don't roll that passenger window down, PJ, because the camera's attached to it.<eos> I am not following.<eos> Do I have to touch my window the whole time?<eos> Before your window is down for your comfort right now your driver side window is up.<eos> Don't even touch it until we get to the U-turn and then Joe will come out and open your window.
This ain't it.<eos> This ain't the one I saw.<eos> It's all we have.<eos> All there's ever been.<eos> Watch me break my back, he don't give me nothing. "That'll do."<eos> - Father wouldn't...<eos> -How you open it?<eos> MARIE:<eos> I told you, my husband has the combination.<eos> He's never given it to me.
Looking for a good time.<eos> You know what kind of place this is?<eos> This is where hope comes to get fucked in the ass.<eos> When's she showing up?<eos> If we run now, how's D'Angelo gonna know?<eos> Run where?<eos> With what?<eos> Hey.<eos> Get into the count room, drop off the money.<eos> Leave the satchel, don't open it.
It was... (SANDY GROANS)<eos> I want to go home.<eos> ~ (MOANS) ~ I know you do, Sandy.<eos> ~ I know.<eos> ~ I want to go home.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> I... I had no choice.<eos> He'd written a letter...<eos> to his sweetheart.<eos> But I never sent it... .. because it was covered in his blood.
Understand?<eos> I am thinking straight.<eos> That Irish rotter needs to be stopped.<eos> Go home, Gary.<eos> That's an order.<eos> Don't worry, Jem.<eos> This is the last time you have to see me.<eos> Jem, can you at least look at me?<eos> Open up!<eos> Open this bloody door or I'll bust it through!
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Is this yours?<eos> Used to be.<eos> Present from Gary.<eos> - How did he get it?<eos> - He made it for me.<eos> No, Jem.<eos> Henry Lonsdale made this bracelet for you.<eos> He showed it to me the night he disappeared.
Take your clothes off and get in.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I...<eos> I just...<eos> You don't wanna take your shirt off?<eos> Well, I never did yet with you.<eos> I've never...<eos> You've never seen me with my shirt off.<eos> I very strategically always had it on whenever we did anything and I...
I don't need a person to like it.<eos> Tell me about you, tell me about your first kiss.<eos> Well, I was supposed to kiss this kid Jeff Choadler, because this girl Dina who told everybody their business all the time said,<eos> "You're gonna kiss Jeff at the dance."<eos> And then later, I'm in the cafeteria and this boy I like,<eos> Mark, said,<eos> "Hey, I hear you're gonna kiss Choadler."<eos> And I said, "Don't talk about me."<eos> And he laughed in my face.<eos> So I took all the food that was on my tray and I shoved it in his face and then he hit the ground and I just started pummeling him and his girlfriend came over and she ripped out a chunk of my hair and the principal walked me home.
Well, does Skinner know that we have a foreign spy potentially eavesdropping on every signal on the seventh floor of the CIA?<eos> All right, listen.<eos> What are the odds he's got this phone on him?<eos> Well, assume the worst.<eos> Assume that he's gonna trade on that intel and tip off Abdul-Fattah that JSOC is tracking him.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> They already left the building.<eos> I see that.<eos> I don't want to bury the lead here, Charlie.<eos> But if the president gets this Abdul-Fattah intel from Skinner and finds out you withheld it from the book, that is gonna be very, very bad for you.
You got to be very clear about where your loyalties lie.<eos> Oh, I am sir, very clear.<eos> He stole your challenge coin?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Her CIA challenge coin?<eos> That's messed up.<eos> - You know, you earn those things.<eos> - Yup.<eos> I got it from the Basra op.<eos> He claims that I misplaced it in the move.
Your lead's a dead end.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> What the hell do you think you are doing, texting me?<eos> I turned the mic on on your phone and heard that stupid French translator, so tell the truth.<eos> And don't forget,<eos> I used to interrogate people for a living.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I don't even have that tablet anymore.<eos> Dash threw it down the burn chute.
When my brother and his wife were killed on their wedding day?<eos> When my wife's village was bombed by U.S. planes and her mother and father were murdered?<eos> What, then, did she say to me?<eos> The agency believes the interview is a message to Fatah's followers, and that we should try to keep it from airing.<eos> And exactly how much of the First Amendment would you like us to ignore to kill the interview?<eos> Depends.<eos> How many lives would we want to save?<eos> This isn't a constitutional question.<eos> If Fatah intends to rally terrorists using our media as a delivery system, then I intend to shut it down.<eos> David, can you stop it from airing?
I said, "sir, I am truly sorry we disrespected your daughter."<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh!<eos> Good ol' Southern charm, huh?<eos> Oh, it ain't failed me yet.<eos> Hm.<eos> All right.<eos> Now what do you want, before I'm too drunk to say yes?<eos> The Fatah interview.<eos> I need you to kill it. Um...
The choice is yours.<eos> This is Aleek Al Moosari.<eos> We believe he's the key to finding Fatah.<eos> Moosari is clearly affiliated with Fatah's network.<eos> To what extent, we don't know.<eos> We're investigating that possibilities.<eos> And Nick Vera?<eos> I know director Navarro disagrees, but is it possible that Nick Vera is part of the same cabal? Ma'am, Nick didn't kill Aaron.<eos> In Kabul, he gave me a gun.<eos> I had it on me during the attack.
He told me how he'd found out and threatened to ruin this young painter.<eos> And mother relented and stayed.<eos> Father took pride in having won her back.<eos> He said it was just a dalliance that she'd forgotten.<eos> But he was wrong.<eos> She never forgave him.<eos> And I never forgave her.<eos> She donated millions of dollars to secretly keep this painting on display...<eos> And one day die in front of it.<eos> I hope she saw it.
Maybe it's time you consider a change of venue.<eos> You can have any job you want.<eos> Because by far, you are the best Marine I have ever known.<eos> Gunshot came from my six.<eos> Find him and shut him down.<eos> - Get me a location, Malik.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> God damn it, Thomas!<eos> You've led him right to me.<eos> If he's using a remote platform, I'm not seeing it.
I was stationed there once upon a time.<eos> - Of course you were.<eos> - So what can I do for you?<eos> Ryan's mission down there has a--many number of variables.<eos> So we're not yet sure how it's going to break, but we'd like to be prepared for every possible outcome.<eos> Can we sit down to strategize?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> - How about over dinner?<eos> - Dinner.<eos> Well, I'd say let's go somewhere, but honestly, the food's better here, plus they bring it right to your desk.
But just when the British had done the difficult bit and got the Beetle back on track, they and their American Allies made the costliest blunder in the history of car making.<eos> The Beetle, the designs and the factory itself were offered to Western car companies as a free war reparation.<eos> But no-one wanted to know.<eos> The chairman of Ford said it wasn't worth a damn.<eos> Britain's Lord Rootes also turned it down.<eos> 20 years later, the Rootes Group, his great automotive concern, would produce its own small rear-engined car in the form of the Hillman Imp, but that was liquid cooled and plagued by overheating.<eos> In the end, only around half a million were made, around 3% of the total Beetle output.<eos> Meanwhile, all of this, the hub of Europe's greatest and most profitable car-making business, all of this, it's all here because of the Beetle.<eos> Epic British fail.<eos> Eventually, unable to offer the factory as a free gift if you bought 20 litres of petrol, the Allies gave it back to the government of Saxony.
This is a Peel Trident.<eos> The original was made on the Isle of Man for just a year, 1965 to 1966.<eos> But this one is a faithful modern replica.<eos> Back in the mid '60s everyone was space mad, which is why it looks like something from the Jetsons.<eos> This one, as you can hear, has an electric motor.<eos> The original had a 50cc petrol engine, a top speed of 38mph and, as usual, not enough wheels.<eos> Doesn't really solve anything.<eos> OK, it might look futuristic, but if you thought this space cadet capsule could ever be the way forward for mass transport, you'd need your head examined.<eos> You see, the reality is, if you want to change the world and save it, you actually need something quite large.<eos> It's not obviously a car, it's a van, and maybe even more than that, because at one point Ford took to calling it a "delivery system".
See if he'd be willing to come by and say goodbye.<eos> He won't. He doesn't want to hear from me.<eos> After I got locked up, I wrote him a letter a week ... sometimes two.<eos> He never responded. About three years ago, the letters started coming back with no forwarding address.<eos> Listen to me, Vince. The only way my son will see me is if he knows I did not set that fire, which I did not.<eos> I swear it.<eos> Well, you seem like you've gotten your act together in here.<eos> Sometimes, prison does that for people.<eos> Write another letter.<eos> I'll find Jason. I'll take it to him myself.
It was booby-trapped.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means if she'd used it on you it would have blinded her and blown off her hand.<eos> I played right into your hand, didn't I?<eos> What are you on about?<eos> You were hoping that thing would blow up on me.<eos> Oh, fucking settle down, Red.<eos> You've been tight with Simmo lately.<eos> It wasn't meant for you.<eos> I thought you were getting it for her to use on me.
Peter cannot know that you know. Ugh.<eos> Now, I can't name the parties involved because of our healthcare system's inane confidentiality laws, but I have delivered a baby or two.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Communication just came from airport police.<eos> Looks like Nathaniel Dietrick's flight was delayed and he's just deplaning with someone else, male, 60s. What do you think?<eos> Maybe somebody he met on the flight?<eos> Yeah, or it could be a business partner we weren't expecting.<eos> Give me details on who this guy is.<eos> We need information and we need it now.
Does it matter anymore?<eos> I will not risk an innocent life.<eos> And I will do whatever is necessary to bring down the Panthers.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> Then when you're not watching.<eos> How about I arrest you right now for interfering with an FBI investigation?<eos> Interpol said you didn't exist.<eos> We have places we can put you where you don't.<eos> A slap, very Joan Crawford.<eos> I deserved it.
Sounds good.<eos> Guess I just have one question.<eos> What exactly are you going to do with this company?<eos> All due respect, I don't see how that's any of your concern.<eos> All due respect, you're the one coming to me with an offer.<eos> So if I say it's my concern, it is.<eos> Mike, you're asking about a competitor's business plan.<eos> And if he wants to not be competitors, then he needs to answer my question.<eos> Okay, I'll tell you.<eos> I'm gonna do what anyone would and sell it for parts.
Call my client?<eos> Louis.<eos> It may be your client, but it's still my case.<eos> Like hell it is, Jeff.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, you call.<eos> - Oh, I plan to.<eos> And when I do, I'll be telling them that Mr. Slippery Fingers is no longer our problem.<eos> Just one second ago, you said you believed him.<eos> Yeah, I also told you that his story was so ridiculous and nobody would believe it.
Louis, I know how badly you wanted this.<eos> But this is a man's life.<eos> We won't cut him loose.<eos> I'll tell Malone.<eos> I'm proud of you, Louis.<eos> Did you get an offer to walk away from your takeover?<eos> I did.<eos> What was the offer?<eos> $30 million.<eos> And you turned it down?
If I knew social workers were going to end up on my doorstep...<eos> Thank you for being such a good neighbour to him, Mrs Salim.<eos> We can cope here, between us.<eos> You don't have to leave your own home.<eos> I've got no family living.<eos> I'm 80-odd.<eos> You've packed your bag, I see.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've got to keep a bag packed.<eos> Never know when you might need it.
Neither of you are going anywhere.<eos> I've lost my crew.<eos> We were the last astronauts, this is the last shuttle, these are the last nuclear bombs.<eos> We're the last chance for Earth, and you're staying to help me.<eos> Decision made. Yeah. What is killing the moon?<eos> How can the moon die, though?<eos> Everything does.<eos> Sooner or later.<eos> Can we save it?<eos> Depends what's killing it.
I know more about the secrets you carry than you do.<eos> Shall I list them?<eos> I can begin with the first little butterfly you destroyed, the sweet young widow from our village who caught your eye when you were still human.<eos> Ah, you remember her.<eos> Of course.<eos> How could you forget the first girl to ever steal your heart, she of mystical blood, the doppelganger Tatia?<eos> I did nothing but love that woman till the day you took her life.<eos> I know that's what you believe, which is precisely why you are here.<eos> I need to show you the monster you really are.<eos> When I do, you will beg for salvation, and happily, I shall provide it.
I watched you paint.<eos> I watched you feel your unborn daughter's kick.<eos> I said stop.<eos> A millennium of observing me, were your eyes closed as I slaughtered whole villages, fed my way through thousands of innocents?<eos> Because... Let's face it...<eos> I have a tendency to play with my food.<eos> Have I made you proud, father?<eos> Remind me to teach you how to send a text message.<eos> You were told to get the white oak stake days ago.<eos> We need it now, seeing as your father has risen.
Proud werewolves on a witch's leash.<eos> I hope those rings you're wearing are worth it.<eos> You're gonna like me, Davina Claire, and I'm gonna let you pretend a while that you don't already.<eos> When he wakes, he'll make his own decision.<eos> You declared war when you came after my family.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Slap them on a witch, can't do magic as long as they're on.<eos> Kidnapping.<eos> Rather unpleasant way to begin a family reunion.<eos> Well, wait until you see how we end it.
You must be starving.<eos> I will not be tempted by your beauty, nor will I be blinded by your empathy.<eos> You don't leave a girl much wiggle room.<eos> I would appeal to your morals, but those seem to be all over the map.<eos> I'm not the one who was sleeping with one vampire while half in love with another.<eos> Your morality is a moving target.<eos> Mine is not.<eos> You believe people can change.<eos> You're still seeking out Klaus' redemption as if that were a thing that was even possible.<eos> Elijah seeks it out.

So?<eos> Well, I haven't been back in a while, and the only way she won't suspect me is if I bring back the thing that I was sent to find.<eos> And that thing is?<eos> The white oak stake.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Kaleb!<eos> Look. It's the only way that she's gonna trust me.<eos> She doesn't want to kill them.<eos> She just wants to make sure that the weapon doesn't fall in the wrong hands.<eos> I swear as soon as she's gone, I'll give it right back to Klaus.
Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - You be a good boy.<eos> Good night, honey.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> I'm gonna eat your leg.<eos> You're not gonna get it.
I push you into the stand, you scream, I pretend to faint.<eos> I don't want any part of this.<eos> Besides, look at this fruit.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> We don't want to steal this.<eos> Hey, you trying to steal my fruit?<eos> No, I just said I don't want any of this rotten fruit.<eos> Oh, you too good for my fruit?<eos> This is the best fruit on the block.<eos> So you want me to steal it?
We know little of its operation, nor the -- the mechanism of magic that unleashes the -- the death that follows.<eos> Only this one enigmatically simple sentence --<eos> "malum est aperta."<eos> "The evil begins."<eos> But I have been misreading it all these years.<eos> We all have, my father included.<eos> "Malum" means "evil," but equally "apple."<eos> And I know believe the sentence to read,<eos> "the apple opens," and, by implication, unleashes the death that results.<eos> I believe I have seen that apple, or the box that contains it... In the house of John Alden.
No, you weren't.<eos> I was in this office like a half hour answering questions before the exam even started.<eos> Well, even so, I mean, who's going to ask you questions about that?<eos> Somebody will, somebody always does.<eos> And if it's not Holbrook it's gonna be someone else.<eos> Look, if they think I'm lying about this, it's not gonna be long before we're all answering questions about New York.<eos> Ali, where did that scar come from?<eos> The one on your thigh.<eos> I know it's not from you being blindfolded and jumping out of a car.<eos> So how did you get it?
Water changes its molecular structure around 1 trillion times per second.<eos> Whenever the molecular structure of water changes, the overall chemical properties of water also change.<eos> No other liquids on earth can do this.<eos> Water molecules respond to temperature and the chemicals they come in contact with almost as if the water is aware of its surroundings.<eos> For Anders, this property blurs the distinction between a chemical and a living thing.<eos> Some people might think that a glass of water could be alive.<eos> My personal view of life is that it's related to something that has consciousness on some sort of level, and the question is if that is the case with water, and we -- we can't say "yes" or "no."<eos> Whether or not a glass of water is alive, water itself is still the essence of all life that we know of.<eos> About 60% of your body is water.<eos> Cells with your DNA call it home, along with about 1,000 unique species of bacteria.
What we discovered about the graviton is that, in a very precise way, it can be interpreted as two copies of gluons.<eos> Which binds the nuclei of atoms together through the strong force.<eos> But Zvi and his colleagues believe gluons could also be responsible for gravity.<eos> The graviton could actually be a pair of gluons.<eos> Everything became instantly clear, like a moment of insight, the "Eureka!" moment.<eos> This is our "Eureka!" moment, where -- where we really knew that we understood it.<eos> And the fact that it came out that simple really was the great surprise.<eos> We always had suspicions that something like this was true.<eos> But that it -- it works as simply as it did -- that was really the big surprise for us.<eos> Zvi's work could mean that when an apple falls, the gravity that pulls it down is just another manifestation of the strong force.
If you put matter inside, it spoils the symmetry, and you have gravitational effects.<eos> At the end of a Montenegrin folk dance, male dancers are drawn into the center to form a massive structure.<eos> The female dancers are pushed outwards.<eos> In Dragan's theory, tiny particles of matter and antimatter in the quantum vacuum follow the same steps.<eos> Galaxies are made of matter.<eos> They pull in the matter in the quantum vacuum and push its antimatter away.<eos> So there's slightly less matter and slightly more antimatter in the space between galaxies.<eos> So the quantum vacuum becomes gravitationally repulsive and galaxies are pushed apart.<eos> Physicists can see this galactic drift happening.<eos> They are not sure where the energy that is causing it comes from, so they call it dark energy.
Erik doesn't yet know what it is created from, but he feels sure gravity cannot be a fundamental force of the universe.<eos> From the fact that I can derive gravity from changes in entropy, that basically means we have to think about gravity in a different way.<eos> Instead of assuming it as a fundamental force, we can now view it as something that can be emergent.<eos> We might find out the truth about gravity if we could feel it more intensely.<eos> This is impossible on earth, where gravity is weak.<eos> But there is a place in the universe where gravity reigns supreme... inside a black hole.<eos> Here, it may completely incinerate matter in a wall of gravitational fire.<eos> In unusual situations... You don't always get what you expect.<eos> But sometimes unusual situations lead to new insights.<eos> To find the truth about gravity, physicists are studying it in a place where they expect it to Act very strangely.

It's just like water leaving a nozzle.<eos> The further it travels, the more the spray spreads out.<eos> But if enough collectors are spread out over a wide enough area, the amount caught in each one would allow you to reconstruct the shape of the nozzle.<eos> The nozzle of the hose is spraying information out.<eos> With a single telescope, or a single cup, you can only record or capture part of the information coming from the nozzle.<eos> But with many cups spread out all over the field, you sample the full information field from the object you're looking at, in this case, the nozzle.<eos> And you can recreate and understand what was happening when the water left that very small volume.<eos> Shep's planet-sized virtual telescope should have enough resolution to determine the gravitational physics at the edge of a black hole.<eos> Gravity is a theory.<eos> It works very well on the earth, but we haven't put it to ultimate tests.
When a letter goes through the mail, the information inside follows a physical trail.<eos> In the quantum world, the rules are entirely different.<eos> In quantum communication, the information disappears here and reappears at another place.<eos> It does not follow a path.<eos> You cannot track it.<eos> You cannot follow it.<eos> In the quantum world, information is carried by tiny particles in what scientists call "quantum states."<eos> A state tells us which features a particle can show if I measure it.<eos> You can think of particles like glowing balls of light that are constantly changing colors.<eos> If one is in a sealed box and Anton never opens it, the particle will forever exist in the changing state of red and blue.
- Well, he's a spy.<eos> There's a pretty good chance he's right.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you have anything to do with Annie leaving ODNI?<eos> Leaving?<eos> I thought she was with you and Calder.<eos> She left us standing in director Fitzgerald's office, and then out of the blue, Caitlyn Cook calls me and asks me about an Op Annie's working with Ryan McQuaid.<eos> We should talk.<eos> Auggie, I'm on my way to meet Roger in Brunswick.<eos> He's got the intel, but he wouldn't give it to me over the phone.
Hey. Hey. He's having a meet-and-greet onstage in the middle of my sound check?<eos> Sorry, Deac.<eos> He's the boss.<eos> And don't he love to let me know it.<eos> Didn't think it was possible, but you're even cuter when you're mad.<eos> I must be downright adorable right now.<eos> So, I hear you got yourself a new song.<eos> - You gonna play it tonight?<eos> - Probably not.<eos> I wrote it for the wife-to-be.
I know, but now I'm meeting with all the radio stations in New York, in New Jersey.<eos> I swear, I think I'm getting together with every programming director in the tri-state area.<eos> I'm playing this game.<eos> That's all I have to say.<eos> All right, well, you are walking into hell with dynamite drawers on... I know that.<eos> I mean, next, are you gonna tell me that you want your own barbecue sauce, like me?<eos> - What's that like?<eos> - What?<eos> Having your face on a jar of barbecue sauce?<eos> I mean, have you ever even tasted it?

Come on.<eos> Mr. Mayor.<eos> It's a beautiful day for golf, isn't it?<eos> Why don't we save the pleasantries, Jeff?<eos> The only reason I'm here is because I'm curious.<eos> Why would Jeff Fordham be the top bidder to golf with the mayor?<eos> I guess I just got caught up in the fun.<eos> But I was torn between this and throwing out the first pitch at the sounds game, but since I throw like a girl...<eos> Hey, listen, given my history with your ex-wife, I knew you wouldn't take a meeting with me, so yes...<eos> I saw an opportunity, and I took it.
You forgot to mention that you charted.<eos> I've listened to as much of your music as I possibly could find, a... and you're... you're amazing.<eos> You still have the gift that these articles are talking about.<eos> Yeah, well, it turned into a curse, didn't it?<eos> Contributor!<eos> No, what happened was tragic, but you can't believe that your family would want you to turn your back on music.<eos> Well, I wrote a song, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, and you should sing it, not just sell it to somebody else.<eos> I wrote it for you.<eos> I didn't write it to sell it.

No, I like it.<eos> I'm glad to see you getting out there.<eos> I just got to figure out what I want to do and who I want to do it with, you know?<eos> Like maybe some ex-writer friend of yours whose girlfriend just left town?<eos> You trying to ask about Gunnar?<eos> 'Cause if you're asking about Gunnar, ask about Gunnar.<eos> Okay, I'm asking about Gunnar.<eos> Nothing there.<eos> Just... I don't know.<eos> Between our personal history and Zoey, it's kind of like we had our chance, and we missed it.
And Luke Wheeler and Rayna Jaymes for "ball and chain. "<eos> And the award goes to...<eos> Luke Wheeler and Rayna Jaymes for "ball and chain. "<eos> ["Ball and chain" plays] Yes!<eos> [Cheers and applause]<eos> ♪ It's just a ball and chain ♪<eos> Thank you! Yeah! Yeah!<eos> I'm gonna try to do it without this.<eos> Um, this song was written for me by a talented kid, uh, named Gunnar Scott, and I just knew...<eos> I knew it was gonna be a big hit, so I asked Rayna to sing it with me, and it blew up, and, uh, so did her album, as you can tell by how much tail she's kicking tonight.
Would you take your jacket off and give it to me sir?<eos> - Please.<eos> - D-did I do something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> By the power vested in me by the state, I declare you a temporary patrol officer of the L.A.P.D.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Okay, move over.<eos> Hold this.<eos> - Don't put it on!
Sounds like a man drawing lines.<eos> Justifying a reason to turn on us.<eos> Shouldn't fear me.<eos> I'm just one man, with a glorified bus driver as backup.<eos> One man that was a Spartan.<eos> You're playing scared, Commander.<eos> See, I already died.<eos> That's the difference between you and me.<eos> Gave my life away when I was signed up to be a soldier.<eos> It's a matter of what we give it away for now.
You don't understand.<eos> - They'd never let me.<eos> I... - Then stay.<eos> You have a choice.<eos> What you have to do, whatever it is, will it really make you happy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I think you know as well as I do that there'll be no peace in your heart like there is today.<eos> My heart has never known peace.<eos> Then maybe, just maybe, we'll find it together.
Then why aren't you trying to stop it?<eos> Why are we in here, while outside, our friends and neighbors perish?<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> Now we can only wait and then tend to the survivors.<eos> Survivors?<eos> I will have none of this.<eos> Whatever it is, I would rather be with those that suffer it, not those that perpetrate it.<eos> Open the door.<eos> It is sealed.<eos> Only more blood will open it now.
Come on.<eos> Hey, sorry I'm back so late.<eos> I was closing up the Animal Clinic.<eos> I got more hours to earn a little extra money.<eos> How much more did you need?<eos> This is payment from the dead pool.<eos> I found it in Garrett's locker.<eos> This belongs to Derek?<eos> So you're just keeping it safe for him in a gym bag underneath your bed?<eos> How long have you had it?

- He's not.<eos> Then how come we're stopping here first?<eos> You'll see.<eos> I can't see anything.<eos> Can you turn on the lights?<eos> Yeah, actually, I need you to do that. Oh. Did I do okay?<eos> For our first real date?<eos> It's a start.<eos> Did you bring a movie?<eos> I borrowed it from Stiles.

You got a problem with that, that's too bad.<eos> To be honest, I really don't care one way or another.<eos> This isn't about marijuana for me.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You know this woman?<eos> That's Allison Ball.<eos> Strange thing-- she had molasses on the soles of her shoes when she was shot dead this morning.<eos> Well, molasses is used in the cultivation of cannabis, right?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Lot of the growers use it.
He worked for you running numbers and making collections as part of your illegal gambling operation.<eos> You're not even gonna ask what happened to him?<eos> I can see what happened to him.<eos> Someone capped him.<eos> Yeah, somebody-- with your gun.<eos> Did you forget, Remi?<eos> Your gun's in the system.<eos> You used it five years ago to shoot a carjacker.<eos> The thing is, it's not my gun anymore.<eos> I gave it to Stuart a couple years back.
It was a bloodbath...<eos> A whole trail of it leading outside.<eos> And mom just stood there, hosing the blood off elke.<eos> So your mom was awake when you found her?<eos> No.<eos> She was asleep.<eos> I started yelling for my dad.<eos> So, let's be clear...<eos> You actually saw her take the sleeping pill that night?<eos> No, but she told me she took it when we got into bed.

Right before we went to sleep.
Trust me. How can you imagine I'll ever trust you again?<eos> - She doesn't mean it, Mama.<eos> - On the contrary, it's the most honest thing she's ever said to me.<eos> - Here you are.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Is our life overcomplicated?<eos> In what way?<eos> Mrs Patmore is buying a house up here.<eos> Why don't we sell the London house and do the same?<eos> We could rent it out as long as we want to work at Downton.
Only I was thinking.<eos> And I wonder what if we were to leave here and to go and live in a place far away across the sea?<eos> - What would you say?<eos> Well, because... it might be better for us to start a new life there.<eos> Why?<eos> Because...<eos> Because I hope to God I'm doing the right thing.<eos> (BELL RINGING) That's the stable clock.<eos> We better get back.<eos> I've got an idea and I've told Mrs Hughes but I want you to know it.
I shall have to manage without you. I may as well get used to it.<eos> Don't be like that.<eos> I'm not 'like' anything.<eos> I'm just facing facts.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> Waiting for you.<eos> I can't think why.<eos> Did you enjoy this evening?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> In fact, I hated it.
I'll make the popcorn.<eos> Guys... in 30 seconds, we went from<eos> "Let's change the world" to "Let's watch TV."<eos> I'm sorry. Is that a "no"?<eos> Okay.<eos> No.<eos> Leonard's right.<eos> We're here to focus.<eos> Didn't we used to have a list of all our ideas?<eos> I-I think I still have it.
She worked her whole life maintaining that store!<eos> How can you sell it without consulting us?<eos> I'm selling my store, who do I have to consult?<eos> It's not your store, it's Auntie's!<eos> Who are you to yell at me!<eos> I don't have any money to live.<eos> If I don't sell that store, I'll starve.<eos> What, cat got your tongue?<eos> Leave, then!<eos> I'll buy it!

It's okay.<eos> Easy now.<eos> All right.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Lyle?<eos> - He's in jail.<eos> Trust me, he looks a lot worse than we do.<eos> The rain stopped.<eos> I stopped it.
So, I'm a "Key" person?<eos> You're our resident scientist. Mm-hmm. And... who do I call if someone, say, uh... breaks into my house?<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> I really am. I... I-I-I-I can't explain it.<eos> I-I just... I got overzealous.<eos> That's what you call it, huh?<eos> I really am sorry.<eos> So, you're planning on keeping that star, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The dome hasn't treated those who wear it too kindly.
We sent some people to the church.<eos> There's a working generator there, gassed up.<eos> The one here is half-full, but, with the way we're riding it, I don't know if it will last the night.<eos> Also, we don't have much food or water.<eos> If we're stuck here with no provisions, things will go south fast.<eos> Well, there's still a decent amount at the Sweetbriar.<eos> Don't know how secure it is, though.<eos> If it gets as cold as you think it's going to...<eos> We could lose it all to a freeze.<eos> I'll find Barbie, take the ambulance, fill it up with food.
Or how she died 25 years ago, but is now alive again?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You asked.<eos> Sam, people don't die and come back to life.<eos> I mean, they can be medically resuscitated, but not after two decades.<eos> And yet, here she is.<eos> And that is the girl I knew.<eos> Your sister faked her own death, I-I don't know, maybe Melanie somehow...<eos> Rebecca, I saw her die.<eos> And I know death when I see it.
It's not even loaded.<eos> Yeah, and it's not going to be, because you're gonna put it back in that drawer,<eos> - find the key and lock it the hell up.<eos> - Norrie.<eos> Joe, the one and only time you have ever held a gun you almost shot Melanie in the face.<eos> Okay, in other words, I didn't.<eos> It's not coming with us.<eos> Barbie thinks his dad could be dangerous.<eos> Hunter does, too.<eos> We need it for protection in case he tries anything when he gets here.
All white dudes look alike to you?<eos> That's not me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I mean, there's a slight resemblance, I guess, but...<eos> What is that?<eos> You sell medical supplies.<eos> You know should know an I.V. When you see one.<eos> Portson Medical Supplies... that's right.<eos> My name is Aaron Harvey, and I'd really like to know what you have in that bag and what you intend to do with it.<eos> If you won't give the truth, then, as I said, I'll take it.
- Did he call you recently?<eos> - No.<eos> You got a cellphone?<eos> Cellphone's not legal in here, man.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're not the cellphone police.<eos> We're investigating a murder.<eos> Larry's dead?<eos> Because he did say I could have his radio.<eos> I mean, he'd want me to have it.
Really?<eos> That's not cruel?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I told him he could start writing his book.<eos> You're letting him write "Finding Carter"?<eos> Yeah. I wanted him to be happy.<eos> Well, here's the thing about your dad, Carter.<eos> He's not a liar.<eos> He's not, he just... He hides things.<eos> There's an explanation, and I'm gonna get it.
And it's in the basement of a urologist's house in Sherman Oaks.<eos> Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude.<eos> This is where I go to get away from... all my other solitude.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> It's a replica.<eos> Original.<eos> Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.<eos> The gun from Hellboy?<eos> Yup.<eos> How did you get it?
Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude.<eos> This is where I go to get away from... all my other solitude.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> It's a replica.<eos> Original.<eos> Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.<eos> The gun from Hellboy?<eos> Yup.<eos> How did you get it?<eos> Bought it at auction.
I thought you did.<eos> Do you know what a disaster this is?<eos> !<eos> You mean 'cause this room isn't supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?<eos> !<eos> What do we do?<eos> Should we call someone?<eos> And tell them that we compromised all the equipment?<eos> Let's just get it out of here before anyone knows.<eos> Okay, how do we catch it?
With gift-giving, there's an implied social contract.<eos> If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn't have one for me, she'll feel terrible.<eos> Then you're both sad?<eos> Yes.<eos> Maybe she'll feel so guilty, she'll never make me celebrate the holidays again.<eos> So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?<eos> That's right.<eos> So stay on my good side, or I'll get you a little something, too.<eos> Okay, here's the plan.<eos> I'm gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.
All right.<eos> I'm gonna check the bombs.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> The breach in the hull.<eos> The temperature must have caused the bomb casings to crack while we were in stasis.<eos> I had to turn off life support to preserve power.<eos> I didn't know that -- What?<eos> That it would destroy the bomb?<eos> Oh, I'm sure there's another explanation.<eos> You don't think I sabotaged it.
We have a lot to do today.<eos> I mean, we've got to get six families out, and we have to do a sweep of 12 units.<eos> - Uh, we got Barbara Coleman in unit 49, Eric Dupuis...<eos> - Somebody stole my bike.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Did you see anything, or were you all just standing around, talking?<eos> Sir, we just got here, all right?<eos> We didn't see your bike.<eos> You want to leave us your name and the serial number, we'll look at it.<eos> I spray-painted it orange to make it look hideous so nobody would steal it.
I have no idea, 'cause I just waited and waited, and then she just never showed.<eos> I started asking around, and, Nick, no one's, like, seen the mom in... in a year.<eos> Wait. You think they live there on their own?<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> Can you come and get me now?<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Is this your bicycle?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Oh, it was just a wild guess.<eos> Where did you find it?
- will fall short, too?<eos> - Of course.<eos> And if we fail and Heisenberg fails, it'll never get built.<eos> We could all go home.<eos> You could have kept quiet.<eos> But instead... you walked into my office and you sounded the alarm.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> And now I do.<eos> And now we'll reorganize all of our resources toward finding a solution.<eos> And when we do drop the bomb... and make no mistake, we will drop it... all those lives will be on your head, Charlie.
- Matt Jacobs.<eos> 1013 Prospect Drive, Wheatridge.<eos> Hold on.<eos> We must thoughtfully weigh how Matt may react to a revelation such as this.<eos> He's a load of laughs, isn't he?<eos> Oliver, you always say that delivering the truth is what we do, no matter when it arrives.<eos> It's nice to know some of the things I say make an impression upon you,<eos> Ms. McInerney...<eos> Alright, although delivering the truth this late in the day is never a good idea.<eos> We will deliver it in the morning.
They are nice people, aren't they?<eos> I saw it right away.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Pretty young lady, lovely cutie, sweetheart, sugarpants.<eos> And Marlene likes you.<eos> He really was in the camp?<eos> Yes, but doesn't talk about it.<eos> "The angel of death."<eos> The first picture he painted after Auschwitz.<eos> Incredible, he's eligible for compensation, but he does not want it.
He had a child. A girl.<eos> One day, he took her to the barn.<eos> The man lay on top of her.<eos> His weight crushed her.<eos> Well, what's this have to do with us getting paid?<eos> This went on for many years.<eos> Later, when this was discovered, the girl was cast out.<eos> She lost everything.<eos> Darkness was tempting her.<eos> She met her demons, they took her grace and drank it.
Not unless we find anything.<eos> I don't wanna get her hopes up.<eos> To the mall.<eos> What?<eos> No, is that not our rallying cry?<eos> I really think it worked last time.<eos> You know what, never mind.<eos> It was a metaphor.<eos> Your place is so nice.<eos> I don't really think of it as my place.
Idiots.<eos> Okay, so if my math is right... and it is... we can siphon 700 kilowatts a month through the fall before anyone even notices. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?<eos> Over 30,000 shock-related<eos> - accidents happen every year!<eos> - Please.<eos> I got this.<eos> See?<eos> Power's up.<eos> Why are you stealing electricity?<eos> Just borrowing it until they turn our power back on.
I'm right over Klemmer.<eos> Could be there in less than a minute.<eos> Time to advise the passengers.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats with your seat belt fastened.<eos> - Mr. O'Brien?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I've got a space cleared for you up here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've linked my computer up to LAX, so as soon as I get the download, they'll have it as well.
I did what you told me to do.<eos> I hid it in my cell.<eos> You gave some to Simmo.<eos> Franky.<eos> Or you sold it to someone who gave it to Simmo.<eos> I didn't! Franky!<eos> She's telling the truth.<eos> How the fuck would you know?<eos> I was here when Fletch tossed the cell.<eos> He found the gear and she hadn't opened it.

But...<eos> What did you say?<eos> Haemo.<eos> Haemophiliac.<eos> Yes, I know that.<eos> But what did you say before?<eos> They upped my dose.<eos> Might have bled to death, eh?<eos> So the drugs stop the bleeding.<eos> Yeah, yeah, stopped it.
And the station manager...<eos> well, he let me bring this home.<eos> - Oh, wow.<eos> - Gorgeous.<eos> They may have photoshopped it just a itty-bitty-bitty bit.<eos> Just like you.<eos> It's wonderful you don't care what people are saying about it<eos> It's a website with pictures of famous people before and after they've "allegedly" been altered.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> They took this totally unflattering "before" picture of me and posted it right next to what I really look like.
Ah. 'Cause you're the expert, huh?<eos> Listen ... and this is murder 101 ... when you hire someone to kill your wife, you don't want to be around when the hit goes down.<eos> It's called an alibi.<eos> Yeah, I know what an alibi is.<eos> I watch "Franklin Bash".<eos> Super.<eos> Listen, you sold your soul for this crap, so ...<eos> It's not crap.<eos> It's my life.<eos> And she flushed it down the toilet.
I'd be surprised if we didn't find some of David Ridges' DNA on this guy.<eos> Another good reason for me not to be the one to touch the body.<eos> Oh, good point.<eos> Hey, Sheriff.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Ferg, where's Ridges?<eos> Gone. Didn't you know?<eos> How can he be gone?<eos> This door's supposed to be locked.<eos> Yeah, I think someone picked it.
No!<eos> What the hell? !<eos> Have you seen a native guy with long hair? !<eos> Get off of me!<eos> Has anyone seen an Indian with long hair? ! Hey, hey!<eos> What's happening?<eos> Did you see Darius?<eos> No.<eos> David ridges -- he was here!<eos> This girl, she -- she took my picture, sent it to my phone!
Think about it.<eos> They wanted the cops at the scenes, they wanted the robberies discovered.<eos> Heck, they probably even wanted us to come.<eos> Everything about these guys is maximum attention.<eos> They used giant car bombs to break out of prison.<eos> Certainly crossed enough borders since.<eos> It's almost as if they were demanding our involvement in this.<eos> They wouldn't be the first to purposely make us part of their plan.<eos> Yeah, but we're so well publicized.<eos> It's common knowledge that that strategy has not worked for those who have employed it.
Just go, OK?<eos> Let me do this.<eos> OK, fine, yeah.<eos> And I'll always remember you.<eos> Fine.<eos> Great...<eos> Cos I was just going to do this.<eos> No driver required.<eos> And I really like that hair band.<eos> But I suppose I'll just take it, will I?

I left the Aruna drifting with its crew.<eos> Or what was left of them.<eos> It was... like a... Like a madness...<eos> That spread like a virus. And I told myself that the people that I knew... You knew most of them, too...<eos> They weren't themselves anymore. They were killing each other.<eos> What the hell was it?<eos> I have no ideia.<eos> I just had this feeling that it wasn't from earth.<eos> From us.<eos> I put myself in the vite-pod and programmed it for a medical coma.
Why not?<eos> Because things are really great with us right now.<eos> I don't want to screw it up.<eos> What?<eos> Is that crazy?<eos> No, it's stupid.<eos> - It's not stupid.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Sounds to me like you are still holding on to a past experience that has left you superstitious.<eos> But if you don't let this go, you're gonna be the one that blows it apart.
I saw it this morning before the explosion.<eos> You got a... you got a plate number?<eos> Yeah, 685 4TM.<eos> It's not in the system,<eos> - but I can call down to transport.<eos> - Don't worry. I'm on it.<eos> Sure.<eos> Hey, yeah, this is McNally from 15 Division.<eos> Um, I need you to run a plate for me, please.<eos> Yeah, call me back at this number when you have it.
They're way out.<eos> They're never gonna make it in time.<eos> Guys, what is going on?<eos> Okay, Duncan, here's the thing.<eos> Bomb squad is on their way, but it looks like we might have to do this ourselves.<eos> Uh, w... w... why don't you just open the door and just let me out?<eos> We can't.<eos> We can't touch the door.<eos> It's wired.<eos> That'll set it off, all right, you got to sit there.
That is Marlo Cruz.<eos> Just Sam's ex-girlfriend.<eos> Yay.<eos> McDonald was on those tapes.<eos> Intelligence wants me to come by and file a report on what we found.<eos> Okay, just... just stop a sec.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I got your footage back.<eos> You won't get in trouble.<eos> And, no, I didn't watch it.
..I will name them as Nagarjuna and Venkateswara.<eos> Do you mean the movie heroes names?<eos> - No.<eos> I meant the universities.<eos> Would you name Osmania if it is a girl?<eos> Yeah, good idea.<eos> I names dog in our street as KITS and cat as BITS.<eos> "Black clouds are forming.."<eos> Hey, Raja Ravi Varma's painting is here.<eos> I didn't observe it till now.
- Venky!<eos> Did you write a love letter before?<eos> Why did you ask that, sir?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I want you to write one for me.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Why would I write a love letter to you, sir?<eos> If necessary, you write it yourself.<eos> I will sign it.<eos> You should write the letter and I will sign it.
Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> There is something on your face.<eos> Is it gone?<eos> - No!<eos> Now?<eos> - No.<eos> There is beauty on your face.<eos> Sir!<eos> Do you want ginger chutney or coconut chutney?<eos> Oh, beauty cannot go even if you wipe it.
Just like FDR, I had helped usher in a New Deal, and with all the love in the air, the dirty look Matty was giving me stood out even more.<eos> What's your deal?<eos> That whole thing back there about me taking your virginity in "never have I ever"?<eos> - I was just playing the game.<eos> - In front of Gabby.<eos> That's kind of aggro, don't you think?<eos> And whose virginity did you take?<eos> You don't know him.<eos> Don't you have a hotel room to get back to?<eos> I gave it to a needy party.
My eyes. Gouge out my eyes!<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Let's go, boys.<eos> Mm. Let's go, girls.<eos> Seriously, you're coming with us.<eos> No, no.<eos> No touching.<eos> They said no touching.<eos> No, dummy.<eos> Gabby is throwing you a surprise party, and you're missing it.
Why were the Chinese here?<eos> Same reason you're here, August.<eos> Chinese gun buy down in Selma got ambushed.<eos> We're the likely suspects.<eos> I gave Lin proof that we had nothing to do with it.<eos> There's not gonna be a war.<eos> I'll need that proof as well.<eos> It was local peckerwoods.<eos> One of our NV charters got the intel.<eos> I gave it to Lin.
You should've run when you had the chance, buddy.<eos> This is all I have.<eos> I got no place to run to.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> Did the club vote for Mayhem, or is Jax doing this on his own?<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> I need to know if there's something I can do to earn my way back.<eos> I'll do anything, man.<eos> Please.<eos> If I were you, I'd take that gun, put it in my mouth and pull the trigger.
Or the Chinese.<eos> Shit goes down, you need to know it wasn't us.<eos> I got a huge property deal that needs to close, and my business partner's M.I.A.<eos> Our investors are already getting skittish.<eos> The last thing I need is a gang war that brings the Feds sniffing around my relationships.<eos> End this rogue problem.<eos> Now.<eos> I hate to tell you, Mr.<eos> Marks, but the war's already on.<eos> And you're losing it.
Can't break it to rick, But I don't think we'll ever be able To get people back home on our side.<eos> Some things you just can't bounce back from.<eos> Got a long way to go before clearing our names, rick.<eos> We can't leave until we free these people from leader's control.<eos> Ah, what is the matter with you?<eos> Is that control chip messin' with your head?<eos> Hulk:<eos> Just like back home, We help people whether they hate us or not.<eos> Maybe sakaar not want hulk's help.<eos> A-bomb: Yeah, well, it sure looks like these peeps could use it.
Let's get him out of here.<eos> Go.<eos> You're alive.<eos> It appears so.<eos> We couldn't stop the bleeding, so I brought you here.<eos> The blade is Empyrean steel.<eos> It should have killed me.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I never saw it.
That's racist.<eos> Hmm, yeah, but I married a brown guy, so I get a free pass.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'm ready for my birthday blow job.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Your birthday was like a month ago.<eos> - G... - Oh.<eos> Okay, okay, if you really, really want it.
I can, and I will.<eos> If you're gonna discuss what happened, you can just forget it because I--<eos> I am not here to talk about that, and you know it.<eos> What?<eos> You told Harvey about my problems with the board.<eos> I told your attorney about a situation you discussed with your other attorney.<eos> And now he's using it to strong-arm me into caving to Mike.<eos> No, now he's using it to give you the opportunity to impress your board.<eos> Did you bring Harvey that information to get rid of me?<eos> Logan, I didn't bring Harvey that information, he asked me for it.
I'm not doing this again.<eos> If you're running, you're on your own, man.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm not running.<eos> Because they came at me hard last time.<eos> I'm not running.<eos> Charlie's what, six weeks in? I can't...<eos> I'm staying put.<eos> Okay, so what are we talking about?<eos> I got to get my hands on that tape before he plays it for somebody else.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm not running.<eos> Because they came at me hard last time.<eos> I'm not running.<eos> Charlie's what, six weeks in? I can't...<eos> I'm staying put.<eos> Okay, so what are we talking about?<eos> I got to get my hands on that tape before he plays it for somebody else.<eos> He?<eos> Who has it?
Mike is tired of getting got, okay?<eos> He's looking for any way to end this.<eos> If I put Sid 6 feet under the earth, guess what.<eos> Mike's got me dead to rights on two murders.<eos> Two, D.J., okay?<eos> No Sid, no Briggs.<eos> You ever think it might be time to just... get out in front of this, come clean?<eos> - There's still time.<eos> - Yeah, until there isn't.<eos> Hey, look, man, if he's playing the tape for me, he's not playing it for his bosses in D.C.
I can't just leave her down there.<eos> You can.<eos> That's the only thing you can do.<eos> I told her I'd come back for her.<eos> You lied.<eos> You lie for a living.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The ballerina didn't used to spin.<eos> Now it does.<eos> If it's fixed, why are you taking it apart?
Jakes.<eos> Paige, don't do that.<eos> I need to show you something.<eos> Can it wait?<eos> I just got...<eos> No.<eos> [Music continues] Home.<eos> Okay, so the letter on the left, this is the one that Lina gave me the day that we met.<eos> At Calcoast looking for tinker bells, yeah.<eos> You never mailed it?
That's not all.<eos> Watch what she's saying.<eos> Do it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Do it.<eos> When was this?<eos> It was three nights ago.<eos> Less than 24 hours before cyrus petrillo confessed.<eos> What, you think the guy in the video In your backyard is ali's fake kidnapper?<eos> That melissa stole the recording and gave it to him?
Hey, Miriam!<eos> Is your name Miriam?<eos> Why, yes.<eos> How did you...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Miriam, where are you?<eos> Miriam!<eos> Hey, Miriam, come on, stop fooling.<eos> I promised you dinner.<eos> Yeah, I just don't feel like I earned it.
And then last night,<eos> 23-year-old Carrie Hudson.<eos> It's a dead pool.<eos> A hit list of supernatural creatures.<eos> This is only part of it.<eos> The rest still has to be decoded.<eos> - Who found this list?<eos> - Lydia.<eos> - How?<eos> - She wrote it.
23-year-old Carrie Hudson.<eos> It's a dead pool.<eos> A hit list of supernatural creatures.<eos> This is only part of it.<eos> The rest still has to be decoded.<eos> - Who found this list?<eos> - Lydia.<eos> - How?<eos> - She wrote it.<eos> Actually, she transcribed it.
You said you weren't seeing him.<eos> I'm not, really, really not.<eos> I just--he's just advising me on something, but I'd rather Elizabeth didn't know about it.<eos> I'm not your watchdog.<eos> I don't care what you do.<eos> Okay, nice.<eos> You're being "Tough" Taylor tonight.<eos> I like her.<eos> She's like the United States of Taylor.<eos> That joke wasn't funny the first 300 times you made it.
I'll teach you.<eos> Focus on the different scents.<eos> Some are tied to identity.<eos> Others give off an emotion.<eos> Your dad should be back within the hour.<eos> You want to wait in his office?<eos> Actually, we want to talk to you.<eos> Privately.<eos> This is a hit list?<eos> We call it a Dead Pool.
- Come on.<eos> - No, no.<eos> There's only one way out on this side of the basement.<eos> I know.<eos> But if we don't get out of here, someone's going to die.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.<eos> We have to at least see if he's blocking the exit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's blocking it.
No, I-i can't be this person for you.<eos> That's what nurse Jackson or Dr. McAndrew's for.<eos> They can't answer this question.<eos> Only you can.<eos> Fine.<eos> What?<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Not like you think it will.<eos> It's the chemo that sucks.<eos> But maybe you'll get lucky and won't need it.
Emma, this is Jordi, my new roommate.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me get this straight.<eos> They gave you a roommate?<eos> I must be dying, right?<eos> Looks like you're gonna have a single soon.<eos> - What are you in for?<eos> - I have a problem with my leg.<eos> It's got to go.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Well, do you get to keep it?
Looks like you're gonna have a single soon.<eos> - What are you in for?<eos> - I have a problem with my leg.<eos> It's got to go.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Well, do you get to keep it?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm planning to freeze it.<eos> - Like wedding cake.<eos> - Right,<eos> I'll take it out for a walk every year.
I need to talk to him.<eos> Well, he should be back soon.<eos> You're welcome to wait.<eos> I don't want to get in the way.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> This place is huge.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna call Alvey and see where he's at.<eos> ... go to to begin with. I haven't had one single drink, and immediately some dude spills a drink on my boyfriend, Josh.<eos> So then Josh grabs my water, and he throws it in the guy's face.
I thought you knew.<eos> I have not heard this story, no.<eos> Oh, well... It was after a fight, and he lost.<eos> Ohh, we were both getting stoned back then and being stupid.<eos> And he got it into his head that I was messing around, which I wasn't...<eos> I was pregnant with you.<eos> He was really just upset about the fight, I think.<eos> And we started arguing.<eos> And his eyes just went blank, like glass lowered in front of his eyes.<eos> And he pushed the couch in front of the door, and he grabbed this shotgun he had, and he kept sticking it in his mouth.
Something?<eos> I could not be expected to stay in mystical objects class when there were perfectly good trolls to battle.<eos> Oh, you all would have done the same.<eos> I'm detecting another drone fleet entering Earth's atmosphere, Sir.<eos> Great.<eos> This Thanos doesn't quit, does he?<eos> She. It?<eos> I had some sort of vision when I touched the stone.<eos> I saw Thanos destroy a planet with this thing.<eos> If it's that powerful, he won't stop attacking Earth until he gets it back.
Great. Um, okay, you guys read up.<eos> Just give us a sec.<eos> [ clears throat ] Yeah, so, this doesn't add up.<eos> Tulpas require a-a ton of psychic energy to juice up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it's not like the "Supernatural" books are tearing up the New York Times best-seller list, and I seriously doubt this play is even sold out.<eos> Hope not.<eos> Oh, but you know what?<eos> This flower...<eos> I know I've seen it in the lore somewhere.
Let's go.<eos> Hey, wait, wait, wait...<eos> You planning on riding in the trunk, Mr. Gagnon?<eos> Searching the trunk.<eos> If you understood the lengths these people went to, you would too.<eos> Good?<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Just typing in the route.<eos> I've already mapped it.
Has he not told you anything about our work together?<eos> Tell me about it?<eos> Mr. Mystery?<eos> You've got to be kidding.<eos> - He does love a mystery.<eos> - What's in that bag?<eos> - Amanda, don't be rude.<eos> - Oh, that's not rude.<eos> Curiosity should always be encouraged.<eos> I tell you what, Amanda, why don't you open it up and have a look?
It's a good thing.<eos> But you're the most important.<eos> You run the health department and the department now owns Corvadt.<eos> If you say no-one gets the vaccine until we all do... so be it.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> That's political suicide.<eos> My career will be over.<eos> How do you think you got your career?<eos> Through talent and ability?<eos> You've got your career because we gave it to you.
He just fucking shot her!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> I saved you. And those soldiers weren't there to kill you, either.<eos> - Then, why were they there?<eos> - They were there to kill him.<eos> Me?<eos> What the fuck have I done?<eos> She made the rope, plaited it from pages torn from a Bible.<eos> Then she wound it into the gate's mechanism but we don't know which way.
Two fish.<eos> Not a man in sight.<eos> How long can fish live in those bags, by the way?<eos> Fill the tub.<eos> Fill the tub.<eos> I'm filling it.<eos> I'm filling it.<eos> So, uh, doogie.<eos> Who do you have to burp to get the Wi-Fi password?<eos> We're getting it free from the coffeehouse downstairs, but it has a time limit.
What did Lorelei watch?<eos> She liked movies like Beach Party or Gidget, anything with blue skies and sandy beaches.<eos> There was something else.<eos> This is the last thing she checked out.<eos> The night of the fire.<eos> Are you ready to open old wounds?<eos> I can take it.<eos> I learned from the best.<eos> The video card...<eos> She kept it.
Are we going to your new place now?<eos> No, we're going to school now, and then tonight, that is when the adventure begins.<eos> Did you get the Xbox hooked up?<eos> Did I get the Xbox hooked up?<eos> Does Superman fly?<eos> Does Spider-man do spider-man-y things?<eos> - Okay. - Yes.<eos> Hey, superhero, seriously, the window.<eos> It almost took my finger off.<eos> You said you'd fix it.
Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, my goodness.<eos> Can you move them?<eos> Any wounds?<eos> Just my pride.<eos> Thank you, Wayne.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Best call I've had all week.<eos> - Thank you, Wayne.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> There's the front door, if you could shut it because we left it open.
Address these things...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Lyla, have a seat.<eos> Dan? Is everything okay?<eos> Am I in trouble?<eos> If it is about our luxury bag, I know, and we've been working on getting him to give it up and have one that is more "locker-friendly."
Woww!<eos> I felt the same way, the first time.<eos> Whats that for?<eos> Well, to steer the temple, of course.<eos> Wow!<eos> Oh, and what's this?<eos> You know where the moon comes from, don't you.<eos> No.<eos> It comes from the world of dream.<eos> The first guardian carved the Moon and brought it into our world through this trap door.
What?<eos> You just kind of make nerdy sexy.<eos> That's true.<eos> - Where were we?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Aah! - Mother. - Oh.<eos> Martha?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't know you guys were home.<eos> I just wanted a little dental floss, and it looks like I found it.
It's no joke.<eos> It's more dangerous than this job.<eos> Those women, they rush the stage like these are the last men on the planet.<eos> I have bruises that I can't explain.<eos> Ladies be crazy, Javi.<eos> The card's rfid architecture is like nothing I've ever seen.<eos> Yeah, but there's got to be something else that you can tell us about it.<eos> I can tell you this...<eos> it's not commercially manufactured.<eos> Well, how did anarchy boy get it, then?
You mark my words, Mrs. Ruiz... somewhere in this pile is the key to identifying our witness.<eos> I followed up on Jaffe's car.<eos> There's no G.P.S., no E.Z. pass.<eos> There's no way of finding out where he and Anton went that night.<eos> Okay, what about you on financials?<eos> For an ex-cop, the guy lived like a monk.<eos> So did Anton, which is part of our problem.<eos> The kid had no cell phone, no credit cards to pull.<eos> There's got to be a connection between these two guys.<eos> I'm just not finding it.
He must have found it.<eos> It's not in the drawer, Natalie.<eos> The photo was in an envelope.<eos> I hid it in an old camera case.<eos> Wait.<eos> Jason said he stayed here because his mom was out of town.<eos> So?<eos> Natalie, the... the camera case that you put the envelope in, was it for a polaroid camera?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Because Jason brought it to Kennedy elementary yesterday for show-and-tell.
- It better be.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's right, ma, that's right.<eos> I can't be killed. Did you hear that?<eos> So how're you gonna, you know, make a dent in San Francisco, Harry?<eos> 'Cause they already had the earthquake. Huh.<eos> You know me.<eos> I always got something up my sleeve.<eos> The public always wanted to see me conquer death.<eos> But what they never understood was how much I needed it, too.
Get off me!<eos> You try and keep the screws away.<eos> Stop stop stop stop!<eos> Hey, hey, stop.<eos> It's OK. Shoosh, it's OK.<eos> It's me.<eos> Come on, you're alright. What happened?<eos> What happened?<eos> They stopped my HRT.<eos> I gave my urine to Jess and she gave it to Doreen.
Yeah, you say that now, but last time we fought, you couldn't even remember his name.<eos> 2003, Nyack, New York, Ed Trenton.<eos> I was working a case.<eos> Three dead -- livers ripped out and eaten by your father.<eos> Livers?<eos> Yeah, I tracked him down that night to your house.<eos> Well, you say he was a monster.<eos> What kind of monster was he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Never seen that kind before, never seen it again.
Close the guard circle!<eos> Follow me!<eos> Come on!<eos> No!<eos> Is anyone there?<eos> Can anyone hear me?<eos> Who am I that it's ended for me so badly?<eos> Well, let's calm down, surely the master will see the letter and soon come to rescue me.<eos> One, two,...<eos> What if he does not see it?
"Paloma has so many skills."<eos> "Talents."<eos> "And we appreciated what she had to offer."<eos> "Paloma told him you're a generous man."<eos> What does he want?<eos> - "A truck."<eos> - A... A what?<eos> He wants a pickup truck.<eos> A pickup truck?<eos> I think he needs it by Friday.
Sir, I was coerced.<eos> Speeches will be limited to five minutes so that we may hear from as many candidates as possible.<eos> Well, she has got my vote.<eos> - Who does?<eos> - Mrs. Winter.<eos> It's about time we had a fresh face on the town council.<eos> Colonel's gonna wish he were back in the Solomon Islands.<eos> Do you think you could get me a meeting with her?<eos> I have a few issues I'd like to talk to her about.<eos> The new George Zucco picture came out in November, and they still haven't shown it in the theater here.
Okay, guys, we think Korra found her way back here.<eos> Now let's split off into teams and scour the town.<eos> Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu.<eos> Now just give me a second while I<eos> Wait.<eos> Pabu?<eos> Pabu!<eos> Why is Bolin hugging that big rat?<eos> Ew.<eos> Now he's kissing it.
And Opal is one of those airbenders.<eos> Believe me, I understand what's at stake.<eos> Then I think you'll agree. The only plan that will work is for me to give myself up.<eos> What?<eos> Korra, no. We'll figure out another way.<eos> I talked it over with Lord Zuko, and I've given it a lot of thought.<eos> I have to do this. You can't expect us to sit by and just let Zaheer take you.<eos> The world has been out of balance for far too long.<eos> It needs the air nation back again.<eos> I can't let Zaheer destroy it and everyone we love.
Go home, sleep it off.<eos> I am home, John, okay?<eos> So make no mistake about what this means to me.<eos> I am the one that got the Sheik to sit down at that table.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I am the one that kept the tanks out of this Plaza.<eos> I can hold this country together until elections.<eos> Or you can go back to Washington and you can say,<eos> "I had a chance to save this country"<eos> "and I didn't take it."
You've been spying on my brother? For Tariq.<eos> It's a little late to get protective, don't you think?<eos> And before you get all bent out of shape... maybe you should listen.<eos> Finally!<eos> I could eat my foot.<eos> Mr. President, tonight I have prepared for you a starter of lemon soup with edible wood cream cheese.<eos> Rapido.<eos> The wood itself is unique.<eos> It has a sponge-like quality.<eos> And I have soaked it in honey overnight.
For his plan to rig the election.<eos> He's basically buying their votes.<eos> Which we're gonna make Jamal believe is Tariq securing their support for a coup.<eos> Look, we're all nervous.<eos> We're all taking a risk, but we're taking it together.<eos> You all right?<eos> The bids for the desalination plant have come in.<eos> Let me guess, they are too high.<eos> 'Cause they know you have oil.<eos> Tell them they either lower their bids or we accept one, let them build it, then nationalize it and toss them out on their ass.
This is a choice.<eos> This is a choice.<eos> You should have told me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> I just didn't think it mattered.<eos> My son is there every fucking day.<eos> - Are they doing coke around him?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> We don't do it ourselves.

Some social-media bullshit.<eos> #Zoozone, yes, but it's not the best.<eos> However, if we consider all these other girls went missing from 18-and-over clubs from surrounding jurisdictions to be part of the same pattern...<eos> And we compare Kate Sherman's photos to the dates each one of these young ladies went missing...<eos> Maybe we can find a matching face somewhere in the hashtag universe.<eos> Remember, it's not just a man we're looking for.<eos> There's a woman involved here somehow, too.<eos> If they're a team, the woman could be the one drugging the girls.<eos> What about that drug?<eos> Has S.I.D. identified it?
It's not our car.<eos> - Well, I'm just saying.<eos> It's...<eos> - Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> You're getting pedantic now?<eos> Should we call Milner?<eos> - Becky, should we call Milner?<eos> - Listen, I don't know what's going on... but Milner said that all this was over, and it turns out that that's bullshit.<eos> And him... he made my disease.<eos> He created it.
Esteemed scientist Carl Sagan publishes his Pulitzer Prize-winning book... Dragons of Eden.<eos> Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence.<eos> The book explores the theory put forth my neuroscientist Paul MacLean, which connects parts of the brain to different time periods in history.<eos> Paul MacLean suggested that the forebrain itself could actually be subdivided into three different parts.<eos> One of which he called the reptilian complex, the other he called the paleomammalian complex... or later was referred to as the limbic system... and the third he called the neomammalian complex.<eos> This was significant because he tied these three different aspects of the forebrain to evolutionary history, to development.<eos> So, he suggested that the more primitive reptilian brain was the oldest part of the brain and it was reminiscent of our evolving from reptiles.<eos> So the reptilian complex or the basal ganglia, um, MacLean associated with some of the more aggressive behaviors or territoriality of some of these things we typically associate with many reptilian species.<eos> If a human only had the reptilian part of the brain, they basically would be operating just by instinct.<eos> If they want food, they would just take it.
Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis?<eos> Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong<eos> It's swell to have a stiffy It's divine to own a dick<eos> From the tiniest little tadger To the world's biggest prick<eos> So, three cheers for your willy or John Thomas<eos> Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake<eos> Your piece of pork Your wife's best friend<eos> Your Percy or your cock<eos> You can wrap it up in ribbons you can slip it in your sock<eos> But don't take it out in public or they'll stick you in the dock

This is for orphan children.<eos> They let you out from the hospital?<eos> Didn't you have to stay longer? I'm ok! I was to take the interview.<eos> - They hired me!<eos> - Good for you...<eos> - Aren't you glad? - Cut it, children are watching!<eos> - You'll see, everything will be O.k...<eos> - Yeah...<eos> So, what have you done with the furniture?<eos> I found someone with an empty flat, and I moved it there.
I think you should help.<eos> No. You declined any additional coverage. Right there.<eos> You declined it.<eos> - Thas just paperwork. - Ls a legal contract.<eos> I was...<eos> I had a few to drink when I signed that, too.<eos> - We'll have to get this worked out.<eos> - You'll have to pay for that car.<eos> - You have to help me. - No, we don't...<eos> I returned it with a full tank of gas.
Professional thief.<eos> - Hazard of the biz.<eos> - Wait a second, please.<eos> What I don't appreciate, Elliot, is being called a freak.<eos> That's my word, and I get cranky when people like you use it.<eos> Gwen, think about this.<eos> You ever been struck by lightning, Elliot?<eos> I've been struck by lightning 14 times.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> I just attract it.
- A check for 50,000 dollars.<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> Did you sell your organs?<eos> No.<eos> Noel gave it to me.<eos> - Noel has 50,000 dollars?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's part of the marriage settlement with Natalie.<eos> This lawyer showed up and Noel didn't want it... lt doesn't matter.<eos> Noel loaned it to me.
The hero of Canton The man they call Jayne<eos> Now here is what separates heroes<eos> From common folk like you and I<eos> The man they called Jayne He turned around his plane<eos> And let that money hit sky<eos> Oh, I'll be gorram.<eos> That's where that cash went.<eos> I stole that money from Higgins like the song says.<eos> But I got tagged by anti-aircraft started losing altitude, had to dump them strongboxes to stay airborne.<eos> Sixty thousand, untraceable and I drop it right square in the middle of mud-farmer central.
We were invited.<eos> Hello, Christopher.<eos> Why did you think we would not come?<eos> - You thought the invitation was rude.<eos> - It was rude.<eos> It would have been equally rude for us not to attend... when we were perfectly capable of doing so, so we came.<eos> That's called 'rising above it. '<eos> I see. You wanna come here long enough to get a drink?<eos> That would be nice.<eos> - I'll get it for you.
Now, did I see Todd blink when I asked him about that toolbox?<eos> Spooked him enough to make him admit that he touched it.<eos> And now he's saying Ryan went to the bathroom.<eos> This guy is telling so many lies, he can't keep them straight.<eos> I wonder which one he told Jessica to get his hands on her fortune.<eos> Let's check out the source of the money.<eos> Jerry's estate was worth about 10 million.<eos> He left every cent to Jessica.<eos> She was the love of his life.<eos> She still have it?
Give you a tip, Preston.<eos> You gonna run a hustle, you best stay with what you know.<eos> Man, fuck you and your tired-ass advice, all right?<eos> But that sandwich was good.<eos> You gonna move our little thing down to Edmondson Avenue.<eos> Take the gully.<eos> What about Scar?<eos> Who?<eos> Listen, I'm giving you points on the package... so, you make a go of it, you hear me?<eos> You working for yourself, too, so you gonna put out the strong product... and you gonna get the locals behind it.
Bats then perfected that technique, using sound frequencies beyond our hearing.<eos> A bat detector makes those calls audible to us.<eos> Bats emit high-intensity pulses of sound, then listen to the echoes that bounce back.<eos> Their brains then process these reflections to give a three-dimensional image to their surroundings and their prey.<eos> Moths, with their rather laborious flight, are relatively easy to catch.<eos> Some evolved a defence, a simple ear, so when they hear the sonar of a bat approaching, they can swerve out of the way.<eos> So one bat changed tactics.<eos> The long-ear doesn't hunt with sonar, it uses its enormous ears to listen for prey.<eos> It can even filter the faint sound of a moth's wing-beats through the noise of the rushing water.<eos> Its sonar guides it through the branches, but as it approaches the moth, it enters "stealth mode".
Thank you very much. How are you?<eos> Somebody got me in a headlock.<eos> I am much worse.<eos> -l think we can do something about that.<eos> -You're a very confident man.<eos> -Yeah? -You really are.<eos> Say, would you like to make another deal on that one?<eos> What do you mean, another one?<eos> You already owe me $5,000 for the other one.<eos> Would you like a chance to get it back, maybe?
Okay. Let's take a look.<eos> Looks good.<eos> Strep throat, right?<eos> - No fever, no swollen glands.<eos> - I had the exact thing last year. Strep.<eos> You have a cold, Mr. Ramirez.<eos> Antibiotics, 10 days. Right?<eos> No white spots on your tonsils.<eos> Antibiotics won't help.<eos> - Last year they cleared it right up.
- Yeah.<eos> I gave Scott and Walter a thousand dollars.<eos> What? !<eos> Okay, look, I know you're gonna get upset about this--<eos> My God! A thousand dollars? !<eos> Remember the happy hobo.<eos> I have him $5!<eos> Okay, but to a hobo, that's like a thousand.<eos> So you gave Scott and Walter money after I asked you not to?<eos> No, I gave it to 'em before you asked me not to.
I was *not* at the Refreshment House after-hours, I was not *present* at any bombing or explosion,<eos> I did not have a *private* meeting with the beautiful Miss Sarova.<eos> The end.<eos> Cross my heart, smack me dead, stick a lobster on my head.<eos> Our money... is in the Transport Pods.<eos> Can we have our stuff now? ... please.<eos> Give it to them.<eos> Two lenarts are packaged and ready.<eos> The rest is still on it's way here.<eos> Then load it up.
We think we know who has our deuterium.<eos> It's someone we've already met.<eos> I knew I'd see you again, Captain.<eos> I expect you've reconsidered my proposal.<eos> We're not here to trade.<eos> We're here to take back what belongs to us.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Our scans indicate you've got some of our food, one of our consoles, and a large quantity of our deuterium.<eos> We didn't take any of that from you.<eos> No, apparently you killed the crew of another ship and took it from them.
All right, sit down.<eos> The kid's being held at San Vitale in Rome.<eos> - You ever seen anything like this before?<eos> - He's a minor. This is uncharted territory.<eos> - I gotta tell you something.<eos> - What? Unless the eligibility papers meet the treaty obligations they're gonna release him.<eos> - Into whose custody?<eos> - They're just gonna release him.<eos> - Russ... It's a provisional arrest.<eos> We don't have the paperwork right the foreign minister's gonna review it and decline extradition. No grounds.
A polychaete worm.<eos> For it a sponge is an excellent hunting ground.<eos> In such a maze of tunnels, attack can come at any time from any quarter.<eos> Once the guards are alerted the worm loses its advantage.<eos> Better to retreat intact, than risk serious injury.<eos> The sponge not only makes a safe home for the shrimps, it also supplies them with food, so that they never need venture outside.<eos> And establishment that provides for all their needs is clearly well worth defending.<eos> Just as shrimps guard their home, other animals defend their hunting grounds.<eos> Glassfish make tempting prey for the redmouth grouper.<eos> Its strategy is to swim slowly amongst them until they no longer see it as a threat.
What are you talking about?<eos> Porno tape?<eos> I'm talking about bumping... a zillion dollar telecommunications satellite off course... causing an interruption in service.<eos> Their stocks take a dip, we buy in, we do a mid-course correction on the satellite...<eos> Bingo!<eos> The stock goes back up...<eos> Obscenely rich.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> What has that got to do with porn?<eos> I make another porno tape, screw up all the barcodes, pass it along to the Russians, and I get to be division head.
Hi, Kenny.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - What?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm gonna catch a perch.<eos> - How are you gonna do that?<eos> - I'll show you.<eos> You see this bread?<eos> I'm going to throw it in like that.<eos> When they come up, I'm going to do this and catch it.
You know, now that he's free of all that negative karma... tonight would be a good night foryou to make a baby.<eos> - Oh! But, Abby, he can't even walk erect.<eos> Hey, glad you could make it!<eos> Ah, Dharma, I didn't quite understand your message.<eos> Why are we celebrating Gregory's freedom?<eos> Freedom from what?<eos> - He quit his job.<eos> - To do what?<eos> We don't know!<eos> Have a suit. I won't need it.
Okay.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't!<eos> I'll get you a gift now.<eos> Is there anything you need?<eos> We've been trying to get pregnant since we got engaged, to get a jump on things.<eos> No one's getting any younger.<eos> Because the thing is, we're not able to, you know, conceive.<eos> We've seen a bunch of doctors.<eos> They say that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg, put it together in a dish and put it into another girl.
- I put it on a loop.<eos> It will just play and play and play until someone turns it off.<eos> Dad, you got a sec?<eos> Sure, sure, let's all sit.<eos> Relax.<eos> Look, I baked Christmas cookies.<eos> Hey, Dougie, those should hit you in about an hour.<eos> So, kids, what's on your mind?<eos> Well, Dad, it's about the car.<eos> The look on your faces when I gave it to you...
Where's Cartman?<eos> He's said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.<eos> Ya I wonder why he's being so nice.<eos> - Here he comes.<eos> - Hey Cartman, did you bring us money from your mom?<eos> - Heh.<eos> Ya right you guys can kiss my black ass.<eos> - You said you could get us money Cartman.<eos> Man you guys are hella-stupid.<eos> If I had money I wouldn't give it to you ass holes.
Is ther e a fly in our studio?<eos> - - I'm not hearing anything.<eos> - - Ther e ain't no fly.<eos> Casey, ther e's no fly.<eos> Dana, ther e is a fly in the studio the size of a bald eagle, and every time he buzzes my head on a flyby, it's like a sound check at a Black Sabbath concert.<eos> You're not picking this up?<eos> Dan, is ther e a fly in the studio?<eos> Let him work through it.<eos> Isaac, I see you're smiling and holding a ratings book both at the same time. What do we know?<eos> We'r e not number one, we'r e not number two, but we picked up a point and a half with men 18 to 49, and we took it evenly f rom Fox and Bristol.
- You know me better than that.<eos> - l thought I did.<eos> Those disruptors were working fine when I gave them to you.<eos> What happened after that, I don't know.<eos> Perhaps you dropped them.<eos> I want my money back.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> You took delivery.<eos> Let me get something straight.<eos> You're saying there was nothing wrong with this when you sold it to me.
What are you going to do?<eos> You're gonna beat me up?<eos> What, you weigh 400 pounds together?<eos> It doesn't matter. The fact is that the tap is broken and it's your fault.<eos> Morons.<eos> You are so rude.<eos> Give us our $4 back.<eos> Familiar?<eos> Wow, Eric, you just tore their money.<eos> And gave it back.
- The flip.<eos> - [ Sighs ] The pass.<eos> - The pass?<eos> - The pass at Thermopylae, that's the answer.<eos> - What's the question?<eos> That's the shortest route from Marathon.<eos> The Persians have to go through there.<eos> - So it's the best place to stop them.<eos> - Two against an army?<eos> No, an army against a landslide that we cause, thereby sealing it off.
All you do is get drunk!<eos> You're just in time.<eos> I can't find that pack of coffee.<eos> Where did you hide it?<eos> Why do you do that?<eos> It'll destroy you.<eos> Don't change the subject.<eos> And I'm not drunk.<eos> Just three little shots.<eos> If there'd been more, I'd have drunk it.
She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness.<eos> She is the Slayer.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, great. A book.<eos> Oh, I haven't gone through the new arrivals.<eos> Put it in... that pile.<eos> - Here, I'll get it.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Thanks, Dave. Willow pile.<eos> When I've examined it, you can... er... - ..skim it.
What can you tell me about the Scone Stone?<eos> It's priceless, miss.<eos> Worth more than the Crown Jewels?<eos> They're just bits of diamond.<eos> But the Stone of Scone, missy, that's beyond any price, aye.<eos> Christmas, 1950.<eos> With few days left for Christmas, the race is on... to get Santa's sleigh loaded up in time, and with shop windows glistening like pre-war, it's a real problem to know just what to pick.<eos> But Christmas isn't just about having things.<eos> There's lots of fun in going round and seeing all the exciting things inside.<eos> And mistletoe gives Auntie a chance, even if you don't need it yourself.
I wish I could.<eos> Jack's arrived, sir.<eos> I gave him the file.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - He told you to go and...<eos> He said that he'd be here in a minute, sir.<eos> Always carrying that bowling ball around like some kind of bloody trophy.<eos> Serial killers collect trophies, you know.<eos> Might take a bit of clothing, a necklace, something to remind them of their victim.<eos> Some of them have even have the nerve to wear it in public.
A gift from Mesaje and Mesaul.<eos> It took a while before we knew how to get the sound to play.<eos> - What's this? - A silence concert.<eos> Why is everyone laughing?<eos> - It's hard to explain, it's... - Our humor.<eos> It was because... Didn't you hear it?<eos> - No. - There was a...<eos> - How can I explain it?<eos> - It's difficult with just words.<eos> - Will we ever be able to hear it? - Yes, of course.
You're having second thoughts.<eos> No. You said Caesar washed the money?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Then what? Exactly.<eos> - He hung it up.<eos> - He what?<eos> To let it dry.<eos> It was unreal.<eos> Hundreds paper-clipped everywhere like leaves.<eos> Then one by one he ironed all of it.
I--I thought I was a cat. Well, kind of, kind of.<eos> I identified with cats. Well, I kind of did.<eos> I wonder why that was?<eos> They're never sure when you try to stroke them, is that right?<eos> So maybe I was a sad cat. Was I a sad cat?<eos> Because I wonder-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I wonder about cats.<eos> Truly, I did. I did. I did.<eos> 'Cause I was a fuddy-duddy. Fuddy-duddy. I kissed them all.<eos> Kissed them. I will always kiss cats.<eos> If a cat would let me kiss it, I'd kiss it.
- We resuscitate suicides.<eos> - She wanted to die.<eos> - All suicides.<eos> Add an amp of bicarb to her IV.<eos> - So you dressed up like a cat, huh?<eos> - My dad made the costume.<eos> - Is he okay?<eos> - I'll check for you. Okay?<eos> Did you get a lot of good trick-or-treating stuff?<eos> My dad's got it so I won't eat it all at once.
What'd you do to him?<eos> I was waiting for hours.<eos> What'd you expect us to do?<eos> I have to see you.<eos> It's really really important.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Then what about those jeans in the bidet?<eos> But... they couldn't have!<eos> I swear!<eos> - You saw it?
-There you go.<eos> -All right.<eos> Let it spring right back.<eos> Good.<eos> So you saw a piano showroom?<eos> Yeah, a piano showroom, right on the Expressway.<eos> Drove right by it.<eos> It's-- Let's Bovie this bleeder.<eos> What's so strange about that?<eos> I've been driving that same route home every night for six years and I never even saw it until last night.
Get it out of your way.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - All right. Let it spring right back.<eos> Good.<eos> So you saw a piano showroom?<eos> Yeah, a piano showroom, right on the Expressway.<eos> Drove right by it.<eos> It's... Let's Bovie this bleeder.<eos> What's so strange about that?<eos> I've been driving that same route home every night for six years and I never even saw it until last night.
Just kill me and get it over with.<eos> I think I'd rather find out why you're always in such a rotten mood.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Drinks should always be on the loser.<eos> It's from the water I guard.<eos> Now I understand why the villagers want their river back.<eos> It's not their river.<eos> They got there before Hera did.<eos> Diverting it was a crime.<eos> I'd like it better if you'd say I stole it from those gutless wonders in Trachas.
- Suck this.<eos> Gentlemen, focus, focus.<eos> - Now, where were we?<eos> - In your garage.<eos> - I meant where were we--?<eos> - All right.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm gonna call a lawyer friend of mine and find out more about this.<eos> If Reverend Flashback can call himself a church and not pay taxes then why can't we?<eos> Our wives would take the money and waste it on charities health insurance, lingerie.
Welcome to the park.<eos> Today, Kevin's peewee Cowboys are gonna test their mini-muscles against Danny's Little Giants.<eos> Little Giants, nice touch.<eos> - I thought you'd like that. - Guys.<eos> Kevin, you call it.<eos> - Heads.<eos> - Excuse me. How come he gets to call it?<eos> What's the difference?<eos> You kick off, we ram it down your throat.<eos> We kick off, take it from you, then ram it down your throat.
We get dressed up in war paint and whoop around like idiots.<eos> He wants me to speak like they say in books: ""How, white man! ""<eos> You people are such assholes!<eos> Of course he's got to hear the war drums all the time!<eos> It gets on my nerves.<eos> You'll move on, you'll have the cash. What's eating you?<eos> I don't have the $1 ,000 I owe you.<eos> I knew you'd say that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You'll get it as soon as I change my rubles into dollars.
What? I took the tape, and I showed it.<eos> No.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Listen.<eos> They freaked out. They want to buy them.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> They liked it?<eos> No, no. I mean, they, like, psychotically loved it.<eos> They want to pay you for it.
That's good.<eos> That means he's telling the truth.<eos> Not according to his wife.<eos> She swears the only thing on Weiss's mind lately was this.<eos> "An Alternative Mode for Proton Decay."<eos> His rejected grant application.<eos> Proton decay?<eos> That's Manning's field.<eos> Edward Manning and his team filled a vat with 1,000 tons of fluid... containing 100 billion quintillion protons.<eos> They surrounded it with detectors, computers.
This was planned. Got it.<eos> Seat's soaked with blood.<eos> (Siper) The victim's prints are all over the steering wheel.<eos> She drove, perp controlled her from the passenger seat.<eos> His hand was here, on the back of her headrest. You lift prints?<eos> I wish.<eos> This bastard's smarter than the average mutt.<eos> He was wearing leather gloves. How'd you get that?<eos> Animal hide has a unique texture, plus the stitching along the seams makes its own impression.<eos> I can match it if you find the gloves.
How about that fucking briefcase?<eos> Good idea.<eos> Give us your briefcase, man.<eos> I'm not giving you my goddamn briefcase.<eos> Motherfucker, give us your motherfucking briefcase!<eos> I was willing to mind my own business.<eos> I was willing to respect your territory and treat you like a man.<eos> You couldn't let a man sit here for five minutes to rest on your precious piece-of-shit hill?<eos> Want my briefcase?<eos> I'll get it for you, all right?
Come on in.<eos> Let's go.<eos> No, I haven't seen my father yet.<eos> I don't know how he is.<eos> No, no, the phthisis is gone now.<eos> He is not in the hospital anymore. He's staying at home now.<eos> We are staying at the hotel for the moment. If you need me tomorrow, you can find me here.<eos> Did you write down the phone number?<eos> As for the data-conversion project, you can find everything in my study.<eos> Yes, in case the Swedish engineers asked for it.
Take five million.<eos> You're dead.<eos> We've just had our first home-cooked meal.<eos> I'm domestic now, huh?<eos> - This is terrific, Dad.<eos> - You want more spaghetti?<eos> - No, I'm stuffed. - Garlic bread?<eos> I made it myself.<eos> Well, I didn't make it myself.<eos> I cooked it. I sliced it.
- Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> When the Russian actress and dancer Natalya Dolzhenko made Salome in 1908, she wore a necklace made of magnificent pearls given to her by the czar.<eos> Last week, at an auction in Paris, I paid 300,000 francs for that same pearl necklace.<eos> My wife is going to show it to you now.
MY HUSBAND INTENDED TO PAY YOU THE MONEY.<eos> WHAT IF HE'D ALREADY SENT IT? NOW, LOOK.<eos> I COULD PAY YOU THE MONEY NOW, IN CASH. AND WHO'S TO KNOW WHEN YOU GOT IT?<eos> OH, PLEASE.<eos> THE FUNERAL WAS SO EXPENSIVE.<eos> AND EB DIDN'T LEAVE ME HARDLY A PIG'S WHISTLE.<eos> ISN'T THERE SOME WAY? HOW MUCH DID HE OWE YOU?<eos> ANOTHER $250.<eos> I SUPPOSE IF IT WERE CASH.<eos> OH, I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.
That puts me in an awkward position.<eos> I can't put his name on the card... if he doesn't give me the money.<eos> Rules are rules.<eos> I'm the class treasurer, an elected official.<eos> They could subpoena my diaries.<eos> Um, look... a couple weeks ago, Shawn lent me five bucks... and I never paid him back.<eos> That's why he doesn't have the money.<eos> Oh, so you're the deadbeat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I've got it now, so here it is.
I asked what the problem.<eos> The problem is that your friend can not come in here.<eos> As I said?<eos> Mac...<eos> He saw the warning, boy?<eos> What are you waiting to come out?<eos> I thought the sheriff had to do with the law was respected.<eos> You're right.<eos> Now I am not the sheriff more.<eos> Leave alone, or should I put it out?
Councilman Addison is restless.<eos> I'm on my way to that house of ill repute to interview the lady in question.<eos> Aren't those also known as cathouses?<eos> Lois made a joke.<eos> Anybody get a load of today's National Whisper?<eos> Come on, Jimmy.<eos> Don't bring that trash in here.<eos> Sorry excuse for a newspaper.<eos> Chief, it's really smooth.<eos> This invisible guy... breaks into the safe of the city's most notorious slum lord... takes the cash, and hands it out to the tenants in one his buildings.
- The what?<eos> - It's in the deed of trust.<eos> Article 3, early payment penalty: 350 dollars.<eos> Of all the low-down tricks.<eos> - I'd be happy to return your check.<eos> - Let me tell you something, When you put fluorescents, I held my tongue.<eos> When you hung that fish on the wall I held my tongue.<eos> Even when you made me stock 300 copies of "The Right Stuff".<eos> But I won't do it again.<eos> If the privilege costs 350 dollars, I'm overjoyed to pay it.
Well, that's too bad.<eos> Say, Dave just whipped up some scampi. That ought to set you up right.<eos> Scampi? Shrimp?<eos> Big Gulf prawns, fresh flown in yesterday.<eos> Please, the last thing I want to think about is shrimp right now.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Let me get this straight. You're saying the thought of shrimp is distasteful? Will you stop?<eos> I'm gonna vomit right here on your bar.<eos> Joel-The bridge of your nose- Does it feel like it has pins in it?<eos> Well, I don't know if I'd call it exactly pins. Why?
I am not being unreasonable.<eos> I didn't say you were.<eos> I thought it, but that's different.<eos> You're right.<eos> We can't react to every thought in the other's mind.<eos> Isn't it astonishing, the clutter in our consciousness?<eos> Odd memories coming to the surface.<eos> Remembered songs.<eos> Stray daydreams, scattered minutiae.<eos> I wonder how true telepaths sift through it.
Millions of penguins and seals and thousands of whales feed here.<eos> The majority of them rely on just one source of food - krill.<eos> Krill are small, shrimp-like creatures about six centimetres long.<eos> In winter, they are dispersed widely, mostly under the ice, but in summer they assemble in vast swarms, some of which may contain a billion individuals.<eos> They are the most numerous animals on Earth.<eos> Their total weight far exceeds that of the total human population.<eos> Humpback whales.<eos> During the brief summer, they gorge themselves on krill.<eos> When the krill swarms are near the surface, the humpbacks collect them by lunging.<eos> They simply open their cavernous mouths and scoop it up.
As a matter of fact, all the money the store takes in today, Mr. Duncan is donating it to the children's hospital.<eos> And the day after Christmas, we empty out all the money in the cash register and Mr. Duncan just takes it right down to the hospital.<eos> -That's very generous of him.<eos> -Well, children bring him a lot ofjoy.<eos> As they do to everyone who appreciates them.<eos> I'm not supposed to spend this money, but I have $20 from shoveling snow in a jar in our garage where my older brother can't find it.<eos> So I can pay my mother back with that.<eos> So you can give this to Mr. Duncan.<eos> The hospital needs it more than I do.<eos> Besides, I'm probably gonna spend it on stuff that'll rot my teeth and my mind.
I'm tormented enough.<eos> Listen, kid, nobody torments you. But I'm gonna torment you. Why?<eos> - 'Cause I'm Little Caesar. - Who's that?<eos> Edward G. Robinson.<eos> Sounds more like bleeding' Cardew Robinson.<eos> He does it to annoy me. Doesn't half get on me nerves.<eos> Come on, girl, where's me scoff?<eos> In the oven. Steak and onions.<eos> Oh, I had that last week.<eos> If you're not careful, I'll hit you with it.
Kozenczak inspector?<eos> Hendricks here, from the construction company.<eos> They have moved to earth for you.<eos> Literally.<eos> I do not know where you got that story that there is a body below would sit.<eos> Our lost time and lost your money.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Pam, you call the boss's office?<eos> I'd better go to.<eos> She has found it?
You got the money.<eos> Can't you just let me go?<eos> And people tell me I have no sense of humor.<eos> This is not funny.<eos> Now, where is the money?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you will.<eos> Marco.<eos> Ok, all right, I hid it in the loft.<eos> But I can get it for you.
No, thanks.<eos> I'm expecting my er...serious colleague.<eos> Bye, Sergeant.<eos> Lawrence and Clark have been under observation since you arrived.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> It was not connected with the accident, and, therefore, none of your business.<eos> Here, this is a specialist art magazine with an item about a private sale in London of a Renaissance manuscript.<eos> The first of a pair.<eos> Kenneth Lawrence was the unnamed dealer?<eos> But where did he get it?
I'm not gonna use the ticket.<eos> I'll get my money, get off the plane, turn your ticket in for a refund.<eos> Not gonna cost you a dime.<eos> - Come on, give me the card.<eos> - This is a great idea.<eos> Here. Use this one.<eos> I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase.<eos> Wait a minute, wait a minute.<eos> Get two tickets.<eos> You're returning it anyway, what's the difference?
Write out a check.<eos> That way, my wife will know you're not marrying Lisa just for her money.<eos> Theresa.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm always gettin' these two kids mixed up.<eos> - There's a little problem.<eos> - No ink?<eos> I didn't want to put the money in a bank.<eos> You know what kind of shape they're in these days.<eos> I converted it to precious stones-- diamonds, emeralds, that kind of thing.
Someone's coming!<eos> Mudfish, what are you doing?<eos> I'm telling you now, will you just shut up, you little punk?<eos> You're going too far.<eos> This ain't right.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Don't send in any more guards!<eos> What did I fucking tell you?<eos> I'll fucking carve out her liver and spit it at you, you motherfuckers!
You better get the upper hand around here, because this is gonna be home for a while.<eos> Your ball hearing took a dump.<eos> - what did the judge say?<eos> what did he say?<eos> He said, ¡¡Eat shit and die, Mr. Kritski. " That's what he said.<eos> Don't worry, honey.<eos> Daddy never gives up. He'll get you outta here.<eos> Look!<eos> Look at the throw pillows. I thought they'd add color to your apartment.<eos> why don't I give it directly to the soul brothers?
Good.<eos> Good night.<eos> Where to next?<eos> You made your point.<eos> I can't fake you out.<eos> Fine.<eos> I admit it.<eos> Don't put me through this anymore.<eos> I'm sorry, but I will not have alcohol in my dormitories.<eos> Then I'll get it.

Just take my word for it, will you?<eos> And let's have a little less lip.<eos> Right. So how does this madness of yours manifest itself?<eos> For heavens sake, watch closely.<eos> You take off your shoes and you put a piece of bread in each one.<eos> I know I do!<eos> What is your problem?<eos> So, what happens next?<eos> I take the bread out of my shoes and hide it in my secretary's handbag.<eos> Then I take it out of her handbag and throw it in the bin.
- Speaking of A's...<eos> - Yes?<eos> ...Will is gonna get an "A" in my English class.<eos> Congratulations, baby.<eos> Do you have any news for my parents?<eos> Not really.<eos> So, how about that stuffing?<eos> Serve yourself.<eos> It looks...<eos> Looks great. Shall I pass it on?
cinnamon toast?<eos> Then, voilà...<eos> we garnish and serve.<eos> That was magnificent.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now is the time for each of you to take one assignment card from my Home Ec bag o' challenges.<eos> If someone would please wake up Miss Bundy and Miss Wanker.<eos> The dog ate my homework!<eos> Anyhow...written on every card is the name of a dish that you must prepare tonight and turn in for your final grade tomorrow.<eos> And then later that day, my cats and I will eat it all.
The tap let the bad thoughts out.<eos> It is like a souvenir from another life.<eos> Even the iron curtains do not fall as suddenly as before.<eos> I was very quiet, and they lowered themselves.<eos> I made you mad.<eos> I said: Are they opening?<eos> And you: No, they are closing. And me:<eos> What good can come out of an open iron curtain?<eos> It is better to close it.<eos> Luckily, there was someone who could close it.
I'd use your fingers, like I do when you're sleeping.<eos> Doesn't anyone understand?<eos> Peggy...<eos> I just heard about your bra.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Do you have a backup?<eos> No.<eos> Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.<eos> Peggy, you have got to plan ahead.<eos> Now, I have a backup, and I break it in gradually so it's not such a shock, and I'm always out scouting.
I don't want any shooting around here.<eos> It frightens the tenants.<eos> Well, I'll, uh, I'll try not to get shot... here.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> You never paid me for a paper before.<eos> Well, it's about time I started.<eos> What's the record?<eos> Twelve minutes and eight seconds.<eos> It didn't take that long.<eos> I got a buck says he can't fix it quicker.
- You don't believe her?<eos> - I don't know. I mean, her story answers all the right questions, but--<eos> You saw the sheriff try to kill her, what do you think?<eos> I think $200,000 is a lot of money.<eos> I keep waiting for a story to fall in my lap and now I'm looking at this big black bag of cash.<eos> Kind of cuts out the middleman with you and me, don't you think?<eos> It's not ours to take, Robert.<eos> It's not hers either.<eos> Think about it, molly. Even an even split could pull us out from under.<eos> We need to get rid of it. I don't know why you took it in the first place.

Go over there and make sure.<eos> Do it.<eos> You're right.<eos> It is wine.<eos> Brothers!<eos> My old friends!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> It's me the Prophets preached about.<eos> God talked to me in the desert.<eos> He gave me a secret and told me to bring it to you.
come on, alf, just give me the 6 grand, so i can go home and use the vaporizer.<eos> 6 grand?<eos> you think i placed a bet with you... and now i owe you $6,000!<eos> yeah, that's the general idea!<eos> come on, give me the money.<eos> [ sneeze ] bless you.<eos> thank you.<eos> mr. mintz, i'm afraid i don't have $6,000.<eos> you'll find it.<eos> because if you don't find it, well, let's keep that hypothetical.
Uh, well, uh... You know, it's this place where I go with the girls, and we sit and swap recipes and talk about the kids.<eos> And put dollar bills down guys' underpants.<eos> Well, that too.<eos> I'm going to turn in.<eos> It's a funny thing, Peg, but the other day, I went to pay the repairman, and when I looked for my money-- darned if every cent wasn't gone.<eos> Oh, those kids!<eos> All right, Peg.<eos> Just how much of my money has found its way into the crotches of dancing, oily men?<eos> How would I know, Al?<eos> I don't count it, I just shove it in.
No, you guys agreed.<eos> And since I could spend the rest of my life in an orange jumpsuit, I think that I have the final say here.<eos> We're never gonna pull this off.<eos> Yes, we will.<eos> Look, I found a drill bit that can break that lock.<eos> And I already rented a van and a dolly.<eos> What are you gonna do with everything inside the bin?<eos> We'll burn the clothes and personal items.<eos> And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods somewhere, and then we'll call the police with a burner phone.
Like Hanna.<eos> She isn't taking mine or Spencer's calls.<eos> Have you talked to her?<eos> No. I haven't.<eos> But hopefully, I can lure her out of the house with a hot fudge brownie.<eos> Uh, I don't think that's an actual parking spot, Spence.<eos> The laptop's moving.<eos> What?<eos> Mona's laptop.<eos> Somebody's taken it out of the storage unit.
And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods, and then we'll call the police with a burner phone.<eos> We'll never pull this off.<eos> Yes, we will.<eos> I found a drill bit that can break the lock.<eos> And I already rented a van and a dolly.<eos> What are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin?<eos> We'll burn the clothes and personal items.<eos> And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods...
Not just the plot, but details...<eos> All these little details.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> She was very smart.<eos> Too smart.<eos> Honey.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Who do you belong to?<eos> She told me about this book.<eos> She said her grandfather got it for her and he'd read to her from it and scare the hell out of her.
- In her room?<eos> - I know it sounds silly, I just wanted it with me for a little while.<eos> Does her mom know you took that?<eos> Mike, it's not like we took it.<eos> Is her mom giving away her stuff now?<eos> Is that what's happening?<eos> - No, that's not what's happening.<eos> - Then give me the book.<eos> - Mike!<eos> - I'm taking it back to where it belongs.
I wasn't introducing you.<eos> Toby knows you.<eos> Yeah, well, I think he'd rather know me as the guy who lives in the barn.<eos> Okay, well, this has nothing to do with you, Jonny.<eos> I mean a lot of stuff's been going on and Toby's just removed himself, not just from me, but from everybody.<eos> Jonny?<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Isn't that... our vandalism?<eos> Why did they call it "The Trial of the Century"? Um... Because Clarence Darrow was...
I'm not here for your needs.<eos> My job is to take care of your cousin.<eos> Well, he would want us to stay longer.<eos> I understand.<eos> But what Mr. Mahoney needs right now is rest.<eos> Spencer?<eos> Spencer, slow down.<eos> There was blood everywhere!<eos> Okay?<eos> I threw out the purse, but what if somebody finds it and they turn it in?
♪ If I show you, then I know ♪ ♪ You won't tell what I said ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause two can keep a secret ♪ ♪ If one of them is dead ♪<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey. What's going on?<eos> I thought you weren't leaving till Thursday?<eos> No, I'm sticking with my original plan.<eos> I'm going back today.<eos> I barely even got a chance to see you.<eos> Besides, didn't Mom change your flight last night?<eos> Yeah, I'm changing it back.
I can't tell you and Emily what to do, but consider your actions.<eos> Okay, so what are we gonna do when Hanna goes to trial?<eos> Are we just supposed to turn our backs on her too?<eos> We're not talking about ethics.<eos> That's for sure.<eos> Maybe we should go. Yeah.<eos> Spencer, I want you to promise me you won't go near that courtroom.<eos> Everything I've tried to trace this number back to a source just disappears into a black hole of nothingness.<eos> No tagged ID, no localizing signature, the phone on the other end could be on Mars or on the other side of this room.<eos> An insanely secure phone and somebody uses it to order pizza?
Everything's fine.<eos> Mike, go eat dinner and we'll talk later.<eos> - So when did this happen?<eos> - Last night.<eos> It was left out on my front porch.<eos> - My mother could've opened that box.<eos> - I wish she had.<eos> Aria, if you and your brother are being threatened, you need to take that little gift to the police.<eos> Hanna made that mistake, and now she's sitting behind bars.<eos> Look, Ezra, I'm here because you get it.
Ms. Marcus,<eos> I don't like edible objects thrown in my courtroom.<eos> Please, Your Honor, I'm building a foundation.<eos> Get on with it.<eos> Alison, toss that to me over here.<eos> Again, please.<eos> And one more time.<eos> Was that last pass painful because of the recent burn to that arm?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> My elbow, this part of my arm, I once broke it and it never completely healed.
I don't like edible objects thrown in my courtroom.<eos> Please, Your Honor, I'm building a foundation.<eos> Get on with it.<eos> Alison, toss that to me over here.<eos> Again, please.<eos> And one more time.<eos> Was that last pass painful because of the recent burn to that arm?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> My elbow, this part of my arm, I once broke it and it never completely healed.<eos> How old were you when you broke it?
No, sir.<eos> Have you had to steer away from certain sports?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> What about summers at sleep-away camp?<eos> Did that weak arm keep you from taking electives like archery?<eos> Shall I repeat the question?<eos> Did you take archery?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Well, let's refresh your memory.<eos> You not only took it, you were darn good at it.
I mean, that is a problem.<eos> Nobody wants something that nasty in their head.<eos> I'd like you for one moment to consider the idea that, to the tumor, we are the problem, we are the invader.<eos> We are the danger.<eos> To the tumor, we are the cancer.<eos> And the tumor?<eos> Well, the tumor sees itself as a sweet, cute, fat-cheeked baby just trying to make its way into the world, and we want to stop it, destroy it, tear it from its happy little home like barbarians.<eos> To the tumor, we are the soulless, murderous monsters.<eos> Why do I do this?<eos> Why do I call it "baby" and talk about killing it?
It is alive.<eos> And what's it all come down to?<eos> Life... Will... Out.<eos> Grey's Anatomy 11x13 Staring at the End<eos> So, our fat-cheeked-baby tumor that's nestled in that brain, it's a creature of habit.<eos> It has the same routine day in and day out... to grow, to spread out, to take up space.<eos> That's it.<eos> At this point, our baby tumor is so enmeshed, so invasive, it's touching virtually every single brain structure.<eos> It's pushed existing tissue aside, shoved brain matter out of the way to find room for itself.<eos> How do you remove it without destroying the brain around it?
Oh, come on.<eos> In a few hundred years, it will be really fun.<eos> It will burn slowly.<eos> A musical instrument is not an ax. 3. 4. 5 00:23:45.160 -- 00:23:48,310 Yes, and a daffodil is not a sword,<eos> ... But still won the last round!<eos> What do you think my tank?<eos> Do not worry, you are not charged.<eos> Dislike.<eos> Me neither.<eos> I bought it for my fish.
But the tour's canceled.<eos> (in Southern accent): Hey, Randy, the tour's canceled.<eos> (in normal voice): I don't know why I did that.<eos> Anyway, go ahead, Nick.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Talk about how much this sucks.<eos> Tell me that Ryan's not coming 'cause he's a blank who's a blank.<eos> I do have one thing to say.<eos> While you were away, we were all talking about how much we wanted to go on the tour.<eos> So don't cancel it.

Why should you be forced to buy me a present just because the government told you to?<eos> Right?<eos> You didn't plan anything, did you?<eos> - Nothing big.<eos> - Good.<eos> So we walking to school or what?<eos> Uh, yes, uh... Can you just give me one second?<eos> Will, shut it all down.<eos> Send the horse back!<eos> She doesn't want it!
That was so stupid.<eos> Stupid in a good way?<eos> I guess.<eos> - Oh, hi, mom.<eos> - Nice one, little punk.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mr. Chris helped.<eos> Is it okay if we go to my room?<eos> I want to show Shea the music video.<eos> We copied it directly.
Maybe Linus is working with this mystery woman.<eos> And Cody got caught up in whatever game the two of them are playing.<eos> Well, my guess is, you come all this way to Portland, you're going to play this game more than once.<eos> Checked with Robbery.<eos> They've been hearing about businessmen, single guys from out of town, being trick-rolled.<eos> - Put out an APB on Balouzian's car. - Yeah.<eos> If Balouzian's the guy who attacked our victim, he could be Wesen.<eos> What kind is the question.<eos> And if they're gonna pull this again, where?<eos> If they rented the first condo using Toynbee's identity, maybe they used it more than once.
Sean.<eos> Rosalee.<eos> I think I might have a problem.<eos> A problem?<eos> What kind of problem?<eos> You helped my mother figure out what Adalind had done to Nick and how to fix it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good times.<eos> There was a book that Adalind used to cast a spell.<eos> Yes, we still have it.
Yeah.<eos> I keep reliving the moment that I was shot over and over.<eos> And I wake up...<eos> And I have blood all over me, and it's as though I've just been shot again and I'm bleeding to death.<eos> That does not sound good.<eos> And you're hoping the answer to this is in the book?<eos> I am.<eos> Your mother shut the book.<eos> So I'm hoping you can open it, because we can't.<eos> How'd she open it?
No clothes in the closet, nothing.<eos> It's the same setup as the condo.<eos> She must've left when Linus came in.<eos> How'd she get past us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Was she wearing these?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where did you get these?<eos> Linus' coat.<eos> When I chased him, he left it on the ground.
Our delivery system.<eos> Which should we use:<eos> the 4-inch, 6-, 8-...<eos> Or the jumbo?<eos> Let's not take any chances.<eos> Jumbo.<eos> All right, it's ready.<eos> Let's fill it up.<eos> APB picked up Linus' car outside Los Portales bar on Thurman.<eos> They've got it under surveillance.
OK.<eos> -He'll get caught.<eos> -Let him.<eos> If he does, it'll be your fault.<eos> Are you jealous he's not getting a dress for you?<eos> Why the hell would I want a dress?<eos> -Sure. -OK, I've got it.<eos> -What?<eos> You've got it?<eos> -How did you get it?
-Let him.<eos> If he does, it'll be your fault.<eos> Are you jealous he's not getting a dress for you?<eos> Why the hell would I want a dress?<eos> -Sure. -OK, I've got it.<eos> -What?<eos> You've got it?<eos> -How did you get it?<eos> Here, no questions.<eos> -Don't take it out here!

I'll come back, and I'll kill you! Bitch!<eos> Bitch! Bitch!<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Bad.<eos> You went too far, Aritz.<eos> We're gonna get kicked out because of you.<eos> Thanks. Nothing's gonna happen to you guys.<eos> You've both passed.<eos> I love your keychain, can I have it?
What?<eos> I forgot your keychain there.<eos> The Batman one.<eos> The one you gave me.<eos> But don't worry:<eos> they can't trace it back to us.<eos> What? What do you mean "back to us"?<eos> I had your keychain with my keys.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I left, I didn't have it.
I think it was Neil McDonald.<eos> Because he was a good player and he was young, and that.<eos> And I went, "Oh, Neil's playing,"<eos> and I touched the sheet, and he nearly took my ear off.<eos> He smacked us right across the ear.<eos> And he went, "Don't touch that f-ing sheet until you're on it."<eos> So that's what it meant lo be a professional footballer and I thought, "Shit, I'm in trouble."<eos> Yeah, and I was panicking.<eos> So I thought, I'll make him a cup of tea and that.<eos> Polished the cup and made it perfect for him, and then I took it in with my hands around the rim.
I didn't get a good look, though.<eos> He was wearing glasses.<eos> All right.<eos> We're going offline.<eos> Our suspect has proven that he can manipulate technology.<eos> We can't trust our own databases.<eos> We can't not use technology either.<eos> Well, then use it sparingly with caution.<eos> How's the sketch coming?<eos> We'll have it within the hour.
Malcolm, don't.<eos> Killing him.<eos> It seems like it just perpetuates the cycle of violence that he celebrated.<eos> Joe Carroll has escaped federal lockup twice.<eos> I for one will sleep easier knowing he's dead.<eos> Well, just because something makes our lives easier doesn't make it right.<eos> As doctors, we do everything we can to preserve life, all life.<eos> You agree with me, don't you?<eos> Cancer's a living organism, right?<eos> Do you hesitate when you kill it?
Stop.<eos> No.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because they found me.<eos> Nooo...<eos> Which means I can't play house with you anymore.<eos> I just want you to know that I'm proud of this family, of what I built here with you and the kids.<eos> I wish it didn't have to end.<eos> Now don't worry, baby.<eos> I will cherish the future we would have had, and I'll keep it with all the others that I've collected.
He's right.<eos> Stop, here, get away from the door.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Parker. Aah!<eos> Duke, wait!<eos> It's bulletproof.<eos> There's no point.<eos> Phase in there and get her.<eos> I can only use a trouble once.<eos> I already used it going in the Void to get you.
He killed Roland Holloway's niece.<eos> She was one of the bodies I found in the bay.<eos> So it's not Croatoan.<eos> It's a Holloway trouble.<eos> The haunted house, where a building merges with a person.<eos> It all fits...<eos> The crashing light, the furniture all moving by itself.<eos> Hiding dead bodies where they're hard to find.<eos> So if you had this trouble when you exploded...<eos> Who got it?
So if you search "heart disease," like our Vic, you get the heart disease info page.<eos> Fine, okay, but if you search general symptoms like "fatigue,"<eos> or "nausea" and you click around long enough, you end up...<eos> At the heart disease info page.<eos> Yeah, I tried it, too.<eos> I got this rash on my elbow.<eos> It-it's not on his elbow.<eos> Look, I searched "rash,"<eos> then it took me down some wormhole of related symptoms, and then eventually, I ended up on a page that said I had cancer.<eos> The algorithm takes any symptom and links it up with a bunch of others.
All right, I'm gonna go eat a sandwich with one hand and fill out the invoice with the other.<eos> Don't worry, Meg.<eos> There's got to be someone else who'd be willing to take that test for you.<eos> Like who?<eos> You guys are my only friends, and everyone in my family's a moron.<eos> What about your hot mom, Meg?<eos> What? I said how about your dog?<eos> He's smart.<eos> That doesn't sound like what you said, but yeah, Brian is kind of smart.<eos> Maybe I'll get him to take it for me.
Oh, yeah. I'm a huge fan of "FATSPOL."<eos> That's the acronym I use for Faster Than the Speed of Love, because I mention it so much.<eos> God, that would've saved me years.<eos> Anyway, I was just rereading my favorite passage the other day.<eos> "The weight of the gun in Jason's hand surprised him.<eos> 'How heavy,' he wondered, 'is the human soul?<eos> That's page one.<eos> She's quoting page one.<eos> Your book is genius, Brian.<eos> I can't believe Amazon is dumping it for 99 cents.
We leave them here, the cops will be up our asses so fast.<eos> I say we pull the backhoe around, dig a hole.<eos> A few Gypsies vanish, who's gonna give a damn?<eos> They're family!<eos> Not some fucking trash to be thrown out.<eos> Come here.<eos> Fucking animals.<eos> - Andreas, you gotta calm down.<eos> - But these...<eos> Get the guys to put the bodies on a truck, appoint someone to drive it to a long-term lot somewhere, lock it up, let the bodies freeze, and that buys us some time to figure out what to do with them.
I'll say a prayer for the guy, but call me back when you get this, okay?<eos> I need to see you.<eos> It's me, Roman.<eos> You've reached Andreas. I can't take your call.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> It's your fiancée calling... again.<eos> Where are you?<eos> You were supposed to be here two hours ago.<eos> Remember, I bought you a really expensive watch?<eos> How about you try using it to tell the time, okay?
Snow?<eos> She finds you.<eos> Get in.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Thralls still hold the castle.<eos> They have infiltrated every inch of the Kingdom and beyond.<eos> The mirror is broken.<eos> However, a piece of it did come through with us.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Red Hood has it.
Hold them back!<eos> Come on it!<eos> This is bad.<eos> He is mobilizing his army.<eos> We have to assume he has the fragment, and he is preparing an attack.<eos> He probably has stockpiles like this set up all over this city.<eos> We have to give up searching for Red.<eos> Times up.<eos> If Rumpelstiltskin has the mirror, why has not he attacked yet?<eos> Because he has not it.
If we leave now and we cannot get back... this all have been for nothing.<eos> My father has a whole army back home.<eos> Maybe if we open the Portal, he can send them through.<eos> If he has an army, why does not he use it?<eos> Because he is employing strategy, unlike some.<eos> If we attack him with an army it might trigger his invasion.<eos> It is probably best to destroy the fragment.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - If only you do.<eos> If he wants it so badly, why do not you use it to lure him out, and then kill him?

They will send the national guard, the military.<eos> All to rescue Mayor Heart.<eos> And one by one, I will take control of them all.<eos> Secure the lobby.<eos> No one gets through.<eos> Why do not you head outside?<eos> And when you see your friends... kill as many as you can.<eos> Finally.<eos> It has begun.<eos> All right! Laguardia and his men are buying us enough time to get into the lobby before they shut it down.
All right, just give me a minute. I'll think of something.<eos> No. You don't do anything. You don't talk to anyone.<eos> You don't do anything.<eos> Just... Just don't.<eos> I don't know why I'm poring over these files because nothing in them is going to help us find your granddaughter,<eos> - unless...<eos> - Where's... Where's the pendant?<eos> Chango, I left it right there.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, you saw me put it down there, right?
What is fable?<eos> - Where is Ruth?<eos> - And where is Mabel?<eos> If one is aware that one is losing one's mind, one can't really be losing it, right?<eos> What are you asking me for?<eos> I don't exist.<eos> Go away! Shoo!<eos> Skedaddle.<eos> Is that Isaac's phone?<eos> He left it to me in his will.
So what about this sex tape everyone's been talking about?<eos> Who-who told you that?<eos> - How did you find out about that?<eos> - I heard you whispering about it on the phone the other night with one of your asshole buddies.<eos> Look. It was a home movie kind of thing.<eos> What did Andreas have to do with it?<eos> Was it like a porn thing with the strippers or something?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Was Andreas in it? - I don't know.<eos> I didn't see it.
We'll take care of him.<eos> I promise you.<eos> All right, let's get you to the hospital.<eos> Careful.<eos> All right, where do you want us?<eos> Right where you are.<eos> Don't do anything stupid.<eos> All right, how far do you think it is to Mexico?<eos> Hundred yards, tops.<eos> If this leads to the anthrax lab, we will shut it down, we will secure it.
Come to papa. Uh-huh.<eos> And we obviously have a cactus to go with it.<eos> Yes.<eos> This cactus is from Argentina, not Mexico.<eos> Ah, that's where I went wrong.<eos> And there's a tale.<eos> Two young lovers who were forbidden to marry, so they ran away, up into the mountains.<eos> Avoiding all drug tunnels, of course.<eos> Now, the goddess of the land took pity on them.<eos> She changed the young man into a giant cactus, and she took the spirit of the young woman and put it into the plant.
I'm Devin.<eos> "Seven Minutes in Devin."<eos> Good luck lasting that long.<eos> You are adorbs.<eos> That's two on the same cheek, Dev!<eos> I'm gonna have to explain the hand mark to my mom at bath time.<eos> Uh...kiddin', yo!<eos> I shower now, solo -- just me and the baby monitor.<eos> Here, Stevie, try the chicken.<eos> Val raised it, humanely slaughtered it, and paired it with an amazing spaetzle.
After some soul-searching and a-a pretty painful fall down a handicap ramp, I realized that whoever you really are, I support you.<eos> Is somebody sexually confused?<eos> I was above you.<eos> I was above you the whole time.<eos> Okay, Steve, if you're looking for gender clarification, there's a number of things we can try.<eos> First we raise some cash to get that dick off you.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Comin' in hot!<eos> Look, I'm just saying, let's raise the money so we have it.<eos> Worst case -- we use it for a big Costco run.
What?<eos> - Bulk order.<eos> -Bulk order?<eos> Why'?<eos> l-low could you'?<eos> We've always gotten it this Way.<eos> Always?<eos> Bean paste is the soul of a dorayaki.<eos> L-low could you treat it so lightly?<eos> They deliver as soon as we order it.
There's more.<eos> There has to be.<eos> You love falling in love.<eos> The moment when it's all possibilities and dreams.<eos> You think he's out of my league?<eos> The thought never crossed my mind.<eos> Where are we going to drink tonight?<eos> Somewhere dimly lit and terribly old-fashioned.<eos> So we're on the doorstep, saying goodbye.<eos> And I'm trying to give him Pavel's number, because I don't have a phone except he doesn't write it down.
'I should have called and stuff, 'but I need a bed for a few weeks. Any chance?<eos> 'Got myself into a spot of bother.<eos> Big-George-type bother.<eos> 'Only this time I'm not so sure I'm going to get out of it 'and if I don't, remember I love you, all right?<eos> 'Speak soon.<eos> 'Remember what Machiavelli said, "Before all else, be armed."'<eos> "Be armed"?<eos> Typical of Cal.<eos> Leaving me with this humongous level of guilt and self-loathing.<eos> But before I could cross that bridge into Stonemouth, I needed permission and there was only one person who could tell me for sure if I had it - Powell Imrie.
Yeah, well, a lot happens in two years.<eos> Quite like the retro thing, myself.<eos> I preferred the comforting ambience of a Masonic conspiracy.<eos> How did you know I was back?<eos> Oh, the jungle drums were beating.<eos> No, course I knew you'd be back.<eos> What's this, man?<eos> ~ What?<eos> ~ Don't tell me you've gone and developed taste, have you?<eos> ~ I got it in Shoreditch.
Marco Gonçalves, coming in to buy a bunch of it.<eos> Security cameras outside the store caught his license plate.<eos> We put a FINEST message out, and a radio car got lucky.<eos> Now, the prints place him at the AgriNext executives' murders.<eos> So does the witness.<eos> I take it from the legal pad that he's writing his confession.<eos> In addition to copping to killing the AgriNext execs, he wants to take credit for a dozen other hits.<eos> He's trying to maximize his value to the SDS, absorb as many charges as he can since he already knows he's going away for life.<eos> GREGSON: But here's the thing, the only murder he won't take the rap for is Clay Dubrovensky's. BELL:<eos> He does seem to have an idea as to who did do it, but he won't give us a name.
And you think somebody here...<eos> We're still putting together a time line-- it would help to look at security footage. But I don't see any cameras anywhere.<eos> Our owner wanted a celebrity clientele.<eos> Somebody told him not to put them in.<eos> Then I'd like to see your receipts for Monday night. It'll help us figure out who was here.<eos> Yeah, you can have whatever we got.<eos> Including...<eos> Hold on.<eos> There was a phone.<eos> One of the servers found it under that table at the end of the night.
My supervisors told me that the lawsuit was just a financial grab.<eos> Are they capable of doing something so horrible?<eos> Man: No way my boy went swimming In an area without a lifeguard.<eos> He knew better than that.<eos> Are you saying nicole lied?<eos> I don't blame her for covering her own ass.<eos> I blame the judge for not seeing through it.<eos> The system's rigged to favor The pretty white girl.<eos> I know the score.<eos> I've seen it too many times.
I thought we were working well together.<eos> Yeah? Well, everyone has a threshold.<eos> Janice: Forensics sent over the items Pulled from the crawlspace.<eos> No useable prints or dna. Janice:<eos> It's mostly trash, but there are photos Of nicole in her lifeguard uniform And newspaper clippings about her rescues.<eos> "santa monica lifeguard saves drowning children,"<eos> "lifeguard rescues drowning man From dangerous riptide."<eos> Looks like hero worship.<eos> And we're attracted to heroes because We see them as the embodiment Of our undeveloped potential.<eos> Freud called it the ego ideal.
Concentrate on your duties.<eos> Very well.<eos> At what time does the convoy leave?<eos> -Shortly after dawn.<eos> She will be accompanied by six armed guards on horseback and two bodyguards inside the carriage.<eos> They will be joined by a second convoy at Marly.<eos> I will kill her in the forest, then.<eos> -You are certain you can do so?<eos> I know the perfect spot.<eos> I've used it many times.
- Please.<eos> I just had this, like, weird thing with an ex, and I kinda wanna get Froyo with you and tell you all about it.<eos> I can cut next period.<eos> Look, I know that you want to protect Kimber, but you can't.<eos> She is dead.<eos> But what you can do is help find her killer, and that is what best friends are for.<eos> Okay. But you have to promise you won't judge.<eos> I so won't.<eos> The night Kimber went missing, she left me a voicemail.<eos> And I didn't play it for anyone because it made her sound bad.
Hey, wait a minute.<eos> Seriously, where are you getting your information?<eos> That's not important.<eos> What is important is that you guys know that there's chatter going around that Roman's using a decoy.<eos> And the decoy's name... is Emil Hossa.<eos> So you're telling us the guy we took down ain't Roman. That's what<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> So where the hell's the real Roman?<eos> We got a deal or not?<eos> I said I'll consider it.
Why don't you go to the bar, get yourself a soda?<eos> You want to see something awesome, have Pop open it for you.<eos> That was rough.<eos> Well, at least the worst part's over.<eos> Now just hook up the electricity and the water, and someone's got to go turn the gas on.<eos> I was talking about your endless hunting story.<eos> Are you sure that bear didn't die of boredom?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Somebody's got to go in the basement, into the crawl space, and turn the gas on.<eos> I was down there, and I'm ...I'm sure I turned it...
Paige's birthday's coming up.<eos> I know.<eos> I saw a necklace she'd like.<eos> How do you know?<eos> How do I know what?<eos> That she'd like it.<eos> Maybe you think she'd like it because you like it.<eos> It'd be from both of us.<eos> Did you buy it?<eos> No, I didn't buy it.
I had a bad night.<eos> A woman the size of my mother beat the crap out of me.<eos> I'm sure she could have taken down any one of us.<eos> Agent Aderholt, line 2-- Buffalo Field Office.<eos> This is gonna be another call about a dentist with a 70-year-old patient who slipped on the ice and broke her jaw.<eos> I'm getting five of these a day.<eos> People love to cooperate.<eos> Aderholt.<eos> And it said in the paper there's a sun-room?<eos> Best room in the house-- except the kids have taken it over.
Bye.<eos> - Good, right?<eos> - So...<eos> And that's good. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Almost.<eos> - ♪ I'm all out of love ♪ - There he is. ♪ I'm so lost without you ♪<eos> He's taking it hard-- the divorce.<eos> He starts singing, he's had it. ♪ I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you ♪

Oh, hey, Cris, I owe you an apology.<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah, you do...<eos> For that thing.<eos> What... w-what thing?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You tell me.<eos> You tell me.<eos> Okay, well, I-I decided to switch from satellite to cable, and I-I didn't even get your opinion about it.<eos> Wow, you can afford satellite or cable?<eos> I-I just feel bad because I know you would never consider a big change without talking to me about it first, 'cause we're way better friends than that... Right?
$150.<eos> Now, I could give it to the school, or I could take it to Vegas and triple my winnings.<eos> For the kids, of course.<eos> I want you to stop talking to Alberto.<eos> You know Vegas is family-friendly now, right?<eos> And, Henry, don't make your sister feel bad about how much more you made, okay?<eos> Guess who raised $200!<eos> What?<eos> ! Cris told me to set up outside a Zumba class.<eos> People eat more chocolate when they think they've earned it.
"The odyssey."<eos> It's... it's the first book I ever sold Adrian.<eos> The day we met.<eos> Michael's a rare book vendor.<eos> Our hands touched when I was ringing her up...<eos> And it was... It was such a high.<eos> It was electric.<eos> We were both too shy to ask for a date.<eos> So I wrote my number on a bookmark.<eos> I saw it as soon as I got home, and then I called.
And depend on.<eos> It has to be you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> No. Just... What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing. You?<eos> I'm just lying in bed with my tumor.<eos> Aw! You brought it home.
- It's on top shelf! In the fridge.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Hello... I'm in here.<eos> - Oh, I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Our shower's still busted and I got rounds.<eos> You know what?<eos> I told him a thousand times...<eos> You put the bread on the counter, it molds.<eos> You put it in the fridge, it's fine.
We should start being better to one another.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> I think you'll see, once you get to know us, we're good people, too...<eos> [Exhales sharply] - There's no smoke.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Okay, folks. - [Police radio chatter]<eos> Who owns the boat?<eos> He... uh, that would be me.<eos> Why? Is there a problem?<eos> Technically, you can't store it here, and some crazy lady keeps calling.
'Cause you're too young to die.<eos> And I can get you out of here.<eos> Safely.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Please...<eos> We got to go.<eos> Humanichs are on the way.<eos> Evacuation tunnels down the hall.<eos> Look for a panel by the heating vent.<eos> Take this phone, only I can call it, and I will.
This is good news, they're happy.<eos> Oh, they're happy she crushed my hand?<eos> Congratulations on a job well done, Dr. Frankenstein.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm the boss, I had to make the call.<eos> The boss of what?<eos> Have you even thought about what we're doing here?<eos> Yes, this project could save lives, a lot of them.<eos> Well, I'm sure the people who split the atom said the same thing.<eos> Julie, Humanichs was supposed to be a revolution.<eos> Six months, and all we've done is turn it into another weapon.
It's up to me to find the truth... before it's too late.<eos> Previously on Extant...<eos> There are 29 known deaths in the United States in the last six months.<eos> All women who died from accelerated pregnancies.<eos> All of which trace back to your son.<eos> Dad?<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> All we have to do is power her up.<eos> Did you steal that dress from my closet?<eos> No, I printed it out.
Well, then I would say we deserve a drink.<eos> Uh, I don't want a drink.<eos> I want answers.<eos> About John's death.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> After he left Humanichs that night,<eos> I called you and you told me not to worry and that you would handle it.<eos> And... 20 minutes later, he was dead.<eos> Are you accusing me of murder?<eos> Just tell me you didn't do it.

- Really. - Me?<eos> - You.<eos> - Again.<eos> - Again.<eos> This isn't Major Rawlings' watch.<eos> Major Rawlings' watch was in his room.<eos> How do you know it's in his room?<eos> The crown is extended.<eos> Which you only do to reset the time.<eos> The killer realised that Major Rawlings had forgotten his watch, used their watch, set the time to 12:43, and broke it... ..and put their watch on Major Rawlings' wrist.
June 1940.<eos> I... I came to Kembleford.<eos> I was going to sweep you off your feet.<eos> I saw you at the square.<eos> You were... of course, beautiful.<eos> You wore your blue floral dress.<eos> The day the Kembleford men came back from Dunkirk.<eos> Seeing you there... You deserved better than me.<eos> You still have it.<eos> Of course I still have it.
- The hell I can't. - If you go to Calderon's... I'm scared you're gonna die.<eos> We are talking about the world's most dangerous man here.<eos> You think I'm gonna let you and Ethan just venture off by yourselves?<eos> Okay, look at this.<eos> This is the amulet that I was holding in my dream<eos> - when I tried to kill you.<eos> - So what?<eos> Maybe you recognize it from somewhere else.<eos> Maybe John had a picture of it.<eos> Maybe this is the future, and I saw it.
Inside, there's something for both you and Kelsey.<eos> You're talking like somebody who thinks they're gonna die.<eos> No.<eos> It's just a precaution.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll have 20 Model Ls up and running by tomorrow.<eos> And you got the specs for this new project from Taylor?<eos> They just came in.<eos> I've put a team on it.<eos> Expedite it.
Why not me, too?<eos> No.<eos> No, honey.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Charlie and Julie are inside right now finding a way to protect you.<eos> We... are gonna figure this out.<eos> But if it doesn't work, this is what needs to happen, Mom.<eos> We both know that.<eos> We don't have to time to build and upload a true antivirus, but we could target the first few lines of the worm's code.<eos> Maybe we can get Ethan's neural net to reject it before it does any real damage.
It's okay.<eos> JW?<eos> What the hell?<eos> _<eos> Where's Ethan? Mom?<eos> Oh, Ethan.<eos> Ethan.<eos> How?<eos> When I tried installing the anti-virus, it triggered an emergency firewall.<eos> John must have put it in there to protect him.
Thanks very much.<eos> Can I have everyone's attention?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dr. Oppenheimer... asked me to say a few words about the road ahead.<eos> But I want to talk about the road that got us here.<eos> I had a teacher in St. Louis.<eos> He used to say that science isn't a quest for truth, but a process of correcting your errors.<eos> We've racked up more than our share on this hill.<eos> And I want to correct one right now.<eos> The fact that we're all standing here, that there is a path forward, we owe it to one man, and he isn't standing here with us.
What is the cause of this?<eos> The unjust punishment of righteous men.<eos> Hush your tongue.<eos> The sentence was levied under the eyes of God in his house.<eos> Oh, you mean this temple?<eos> Do you really believe that God would confine himself to a house built by men, when he made all of creation?<eos> Oh, you be careful.<eos> You're alone in here.<eos> And didn't Jesus say,<eos> "I will tear down this temple and rebuild it in three days"
- Uh-uh. I'm not asking.<eos> - The awesome healing power--<eos> - I am not asking.<eos> - --of total positive energy.<eos> You should leave because I'm about to pretend to get a phone call.<eos> Hello?<eos> No, he's still here.<eos> - No, he's not taking the hint somehow. - Mm-hm.<eos> Honey, where's my bandana?<eos> You chewed it up, we had to throw it away, remember?
Janie?<eos> - Ah! - Lauren.<eos> Now we will soak you with the super-duper soaking device, ja?<eos> Get her, get Jennifer.<eos> Who's Jennifer?<eos> Tom just said the strangest thing.<eos> - Jennifer.<eos> - What?<eos> I know what to call the baby.<eos> That's where he got it from.
What's wrong with me?<eos> Nothing, nothing at all.<eos> You look... your dress is... well, your dress is attractively symmetrical, the way it, uh, yeah.<eos> Attractively symmetrical, is that Keats? No.<eos> Who's... who's Keats?<eos> And look at you, all dressed up to meet an Overlord.<eos> What will you do if you see one?<eos> Ply him with drinks and ask him questions?<eos> This is the kokoro symbol.<eos> I had a pendant as a kid, lost it skinny-dipping in Lake Towada.
I made an appointment with Boden's guy.<eos> - The counselor.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We could go together.<eos> I mean, if you want.<eos> Thanks anyway.<eos> But arson reached the same conclusion you did the day of the accident.<eos> Squatters cooking on an open flame cause a 100 gallon propane tank to explode.<eos> Neither arson, nor anyone else, knew the burn patterns we in a different place from where I saw the fire.<eos> I didn't even know it myself until we went back.
Now, sir!<eos> Bilal Hassani and Zahra Hassani, you're under arrest for felony human trafficking and false imprisonment.<eos> MPD strip-searched the Hassanis?<eos> That's going to go over well.<eos> It's standard intake procedure.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The gaggle is gonna pounce.<eos> I assume that you're talking about the strip search.<eos> It's standard intake procedure.<eos> Bahrain's gonna take it as an affront, ma'am.
The guy's used to getting his way.<eos> Well, that may be, but... I happen to know he's extremely ticklish.<eos> Wait, did the secretary just admit to intimate anatomical knowledge of the prince of Bahrain?<eos> His CIA briefs must be detailed.<eos> Okay, turning to tomorrow... the winners of the State Department first grade essay contest are visiting, so please watch your language.<eos> And, also, a pen has been stolen from my desk.<eos> By one of you,<eos> - I presume.<eos> - A pen?<eos> How do you know you just didn't lose it?

Problem solved.<eos> Fork!<eos> Apologies.<eos> Feed me.<eos> Scusi?<eos> Feed me.<eos> Please, help yourself to food and drink.<eos> Mimi, could you pour the wine?<eos> So, have you owned this place long?<eos> I am only leasing it.
~ What?<eos> Fire!<eos> We could have been killed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for saving my life!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I think so.<eos> What happened?<eos> A leak in the petrol tank.<eos> Didn't you notice when you repaired it?
Exhaustion probably.<eos> She's having trouble sleeping.<eos> Have you consulted a doctor?<eos> All "avaricious quacks", apparently.<eos> I've tried talking to her but erm...she doesn't make it easy.<eos> My punishment for spending two decades abroad.<eos> I'm the prodigal son trying to make amends.<eos> I have a book that might help.<eos> Priests must be familiar with the idiosyncrasies of older people.<eos> Shall I drop it round tomorrow?
- Pardonnez-moi!<eos> - You imbecile!<eos> Votre chemise!<eos> Wet!<eos> Wet! Wet! - Goh!<eos> - Get on with your work!<eos> I've got to go and get changed for my welcoming speech, haven't I? !<eos> I finished the article.<eos> - You shouldn't be in here.<eos> I wanted you to read it.

You two need to go back to Quantico.<eos> Retake your surveillance course.<eos> Rookie.<eos> Looks professional.<eos> Also looks to me like you idiots initiated this confrontation.<eos> He resisted arrest, assaulted us.<eos> That's GBH, sir.<eos> All right.<eos> Have I.T. grab the best frame they can.<eos> We'll put it out citywide.
She's a teenager.<eos> She's just trying<eos> - to get some reaction from us.<eos> - She couldn't try some normal form of rebellion like drugs or sex?<eos> Let's go, please, boys.<eos> Let's go in the car.<eos> Come on.<eos> In the car, please.<eos> Go, darling.<eos> Where did I leave it?
It's unbelievable, right?<eos> But why is Alton doing this?<eos> Why would he hunt down the courier and fry his brain?<eos> Unless the courier is just the go-between to whoever's experimenting on Alton.<eos> You said Effective World-Wide Solutions were in the business of illicit goods, right?<eos> Yeah, but more like arms, weapons.<eos> - Okay, well,<eos> Muirfield were experimenting on me with a serum to turn me into a weapon.<eos> So, maybe Alton was getting a serum, too.<eos> But it was cut off when Agent Thomas intercepted it.

How many more battles for you and lonely nights for me until it's all done?<eos> Kenna... I might not be back until late.<eos> If you can wait for me here, we will go to the party together.<eos> And you can show me your handiwork.<eos> So, Marie de Guise wants you to get back to the business of making heirs.<eos> Mary's willing.<eos> Is she, now?<eos> I don't know that she's ready.<eos> She already links me with the attack.<eos> The man who did it blamed me outright before he...
Moving to the purple room is not an achievement.<eos> Stewie, what are you doing here?<eos> I asked Peter to read my manuscript, and he said he had to take you to dialysis.<eos> Anyway, you got me thinking.<eos> I've spent my entire life in that ivory tower, learning from pop-up books and animal sound machines, instead of actually experiencing the world.<eos> That's why I got this.<eos> I'm gonna take a year off, hit the open road and live life to the fullest.<eos> You're a baby.<eos> How'd you afford a car?<eos> Don't worry, I got a great price on it.
If you're so sly, hoarding gold in our home why didn't I get so much as a ring?<eos> Who were they for?<eos> They're mine.<eos> What, pops? What, pops?<eos> -They're mine.<eos> -As if I'd buy that!<eos> Buy it or don't, I couldn't give a shit.<eos> Do pick them up and put them back.<eos> How did you get the money to buy all this gold?<eos> Who said I bought it?
(Dr. Vose) There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> This will just make you sleep for a while.<eos> You're a very attractive woman, Miss Grimke.<eos> [both grunt] - [groaning] - That is not my name.<eos> I am a Borden.<eos> (Chaswick) Please help me.<eos> I'll confess to everything, just... just please.<eos> You just did.<eos> (Lizzie) Tell me what you think.<eos> "I, Raymond Chaswick, want the world to know "before I leave it that it was I, "not my cherished son Everett, who murdered my ex-wife and her husband."
Or won't?<eos> Maybe this will loosen your tongue.<eos> ( rock crashes ) SPRINGLOAD:<eos> Deceiver.<eos> You saw what I did to your friend.<eos> Now tell me:<eos> Where lies the Lost City of Doradus?<eos> Thieves.<eos> You think you can follow me to the treasure?<eos> And then what, wrest it away?
I'll improve his command center.<eos> ( sighs )<eos> Wait.<eos> This is where I had my workout area.<eos> Where's all my gear?<eos> Moved it.<eos> Where?<eos> Don't remember.<eos> I can't find my armor polish.<eos> Denny said he moved it "under the alien thingie,"
He went from a sociopathic caterpillar to a slightly less evil butterfly.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And anyone who believes that is an idiot.<eos> Please don't ever repeat that name to me again, ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ok. Heh.<eos> Already forgot about it.<eos> What was the favor?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I'll figure it out on my own.
And I think she might be right.<eos> Think?<eos> That seems like something you might remember.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> I mean...<eos> I was just 13 when he fell to his death from the stairs.<eos> And you know that...<eos> That's around the time I started to lose my mind.<eos> Lyman... He showed me this police report, and it says that I pushed him.<eos> Well, Mama had her judge friend bury it to protect me, but now if I don't sign the conservatorship
I remember standing over his body, crying.<eos> That's all.<eos> But that report says I did a whole lot more, and there's forensic whats-its, and I...<eos> Red, Red, Red.<eos> Look, you may be a little crazy, but this doesn't add up.<eos> I promised I'd free you from your mother's control, and that still stands.<eos> I'm gonna get some answers.<eos> I just need you to trust me, okay?<eos> _<eos> I gave you the benefit of the doubt, but your rag made it clear that you don't deserve it.
Ant.<eos> Ant.<eos> Ant.<eos> Ant.<eos> God, they're everywhere.<eos> Are we sure that we've cleaned up all the food and crumbs?<eos> Why is everyone looking at us?<eos> We're the ones who eat up all the crumbs.<eos> Yeah, we're the solution.<eos> Well, there are no ants on my desk because I sanitize it daily.
Britton, we need...<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> (Man) Okay, yeah.<eos> Nice.<eos> What's this called?<eos> Nothing, just Gowanus Canal Houseboat.<eos> But interesting, you kept the building in focus, but not the boat.<eos> How come?<eos> I don't know, I just thought it was cool.<eos> (Man) It has a nice tension, but maybe if you framed it differently or cropped it.

Thanks for doing this.<eos> It's such a sweet idea.<eos> My dad got this car when I was 15.<eos> I learned to drive in it.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've always felt safe in the...<eos> In this car.<eos> Smells like the past to me.<eos> I used to steal it for dates.
I don't know.<eos> Because I was thinking you need a suit for the trial.<eos> Could go buy one in the morning.<eos> I have a suit.<eos> (Rosie) No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It's slightly iridescent, but the pants match the coat, and that's what makes it a suit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You were wearing it when we first met. (Gary) Mm-hmm.
Who is he to do that?<eos> He had no right, none.<eos> Let's take a little recess, please.<eos> [Gavel bangs] Thank you, Mrs. Weschler.<eos> She just killed me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know I promised you that I would not go after these people personally, but I also promised that I would keep Harry out of jail.<eos> Now, are you okay with me doing what I have to do?<eos> You're going to lose this case.<eos> Do you want me to win it?
You think your parents wanted you waving around a gun because you're afraid?<eos> We don't have to talk.<eos> We don't have to talk.<eos> Crap.<eos> My God.<eos> Stop.<eos> I said stop.<eos> What's the point?<eos> The world is trying to die.<eos> We're supposed to just let it.
It certainly beats the alternative.<eos> And when these indestructible warriors rise, you'll be their general... and lead them in a war on Gotham that will reclaim this city for the Court.<eos> After I undergo the ritual that will make me like them?<eos> You'll die, yes... but you'll be reborn as something miraculous.<eos> One man's miracle is another man's damnation.<eos> We've trained you since you were a child... lifted you out of the gutter, and you dare to...<eos> Not a soulless thing, Talon.<eos> A god.<eos> A great destiny awaits you.<eos> And I know you will willingly embrace it.
Come on, Dad, what was he like?<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He was tall.<eos> Oh, jeez, I know what he looks like.<eos> Weren't you freaked?<eos> He's a killer alien.<eos> Dude could have probably hurt you just by looking at you real hard.<eos> He was very matter-of-fact.<eos> He said he had a job for me.<eos> And I'm doing it.
- And now he's looking after my car.<eos> - Sure am.<eos> - Mom, I can take care of your car.<eos> - Oh, I know, honey.<eos> But you're busy.<eos> I don't want to bother you.<eos> Besides, Lance, this is a '96 corvette we're talking about.<eos> It doesn't exactly take care of itself.<eos> Yeah, I know what it is.<eos> I bought it for her.
I'll see your hundred, I'll raise you whatever you have left.<eos> No, Lee...<eos> I'll re-raise you.<eos> "Re-raise"?<eos> You're busted.<eos> No, I'm not busted, and I am gonna re-raise you.<eos> I raise you...<eos> - my sawmill.<eos> - No, Lee. Your sawmill?<eos> You want it, Gowen?
A bug autopsy?<eos> That's right, yeah, and one of them was murdered.<eos> Well, before you go and declare yourself king of the lab,<eos> I have some reading for you.<eos> Wh-What is this?<eos> So you said there's no evidence that psychics are real.<eos> But for generations, physicists have believed that nothing could move as fast as light.<eos> But now they've discovered neutrinos.<eos> Lister proved that bacterial infections could kill, but doctors still wouldn't wash their hands before operating because they'd convinced themselves it was foolishness.<eos> A solar eclipse was magic before we understood it.
He said it has to be right away.<eos> Okay. Um, maybe because Daisy's selling it today.<eos> And for some reason, he wants me to drive with my thumbs.<eos> Drive it with your thumbs?<eos> Yes. That was very clear.<eos> He kept saying, "Drive thumb, drive thumb, drive thumb."<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Not "drive thumb."<eos> Thumb drive.<eos> There must be a thumb drive in the car that he doesn't want to lose when Daisy sells it.
We brought you a present.<eos> A birthday present.<eos> Well, it's neither of our birthdays.<eos> No, it's for Sweets' birthday.<eos> Do you remember the thing he would do?<eos> He would give out presents on his birthday.<eos> He would say how grateful he was to all of us<eos> - for another good year.<eos> - Apparently, he finished your present just before he died and never told anyone.<eos> He was gonna give it to you today.
He would say how grateful he was to all of us<eos> - for another good year.<eos> - Apparently, he finished your present just before he died and never told anyone.<eos> He was gonna give it to you today.<eos> A thumb drive?<eos> Yeah. And this is what is on it.<eos> It's the book that he wrote for the two of you.<eos> When he was examining our partnership for the Bureau?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But he left out the psychology and the efficacy of your partnerships and all that other boring, technical stuff and turned it into a love story.
Abducted by whom?<eos> We don't know.<eos> But I promise you, we're doing everything we can to get Mitch back.<eos> So that's why we're here?<eos> You don't want us telling anybody.<eos> The situation is very sensitive.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How could this happen?<eos> My husband was supposed to receive a serum today.<eos> The CDC said he needed it to survive.
It's not ok!<eos> I'm agony.<eos> I can hear my tumors growing.<eos> Ok.<eos> We'll try to help, but just please stop hurting yourself.<eos> You want to help me?<eos> Help me die.<eos> Why the hell did you do that?<eos> He made a wish.<eos> I granted it.
Happy birthday, Bonnie.<eos> Elena: Hey.<eos> You want to... Ugh... Give me a hand, please?<eos> Little busy here.<eos> Ok.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then you are on decoration duty.<eos> It's Bonnie's birthday.<eos> I know what today is.<eos> Then you know how she would have wanted us to spend it.
Well, you started it.<eos> Felt good, though, didn't it?<eos> Maybe a little.<eos> Phesmatos tribum...<eos> I didn't know you and Bonnie had a death pact.<eos> It was my idea.<eos> I thought of it after we watched<eos> "The Bodyguard" for the billionth time.<eos> Phesmatos tribum...<eos> I never thought she'd go through with it.
I didn't even know this place was here. Shh. Okay, let's go.<eos> I found it first... their baby's problem.<eos> I know, but that isn't...<eos> I wished horrible things for them, Jo.<eos> Jackson left me for her, and I wished them misery and fights and breakups.<eos> I mean, I'd see them sitting together in the cafeteria, and I'd wish them food poisoning.<eos> Then I found this.<eos> You would never have wished them this.<eos> You know that.<eos> If you hadn't have found it, somebody else would have.
Ginnie Godden?<eos> Why didn't she come to you first?<eos> Well, she was in shock.<eos> She ran up to the road, and collapsed.<eos> Lucky someone saw her - she might've been next.<eos> Any connection to the deceased?<eos> They worked together behind the bar.<eos> Best friends.<eos> Ginnie says she met Sylvia here, they'd separated, then she heard a scream.<eos> A bit odd, isn't it, that she didn't happen to... see any of this murder or whoever committed it.
Tell me everything.<eos> When was the last time he...?<eos> When was the last time he was seen?<eos> So you didn't get our message.<eos> Of course we did.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> - No, the second message.<eos> - Inspector...<eos> It turns out his breathing improved so much they took him off the iron lung.<eos> Well, they needed it for another child.
The bank had been financing a business Billy set up when he married Julia.<eos> I knew it wasn't going well, but I didn't realise just how bad things were.<eos> Was it making a loss?<eos> Mr. Harrogate kept pouring money into it but never seemed to earn anything back.<eos> I stumbled across a hint of it at first.<eos> I saw something unusual in a ledger that was out on Mr. Harrogate's desk.<eos> Got me thinking, so I looked into it further.<eos> It turns out the bank's accounts don't balance.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> I think he was using the bank's money to prop up Billy's business and keeping it off the books.
Billy had involved me in some scam of his, without my knowledge.<eos> The racehorse?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> Who lights a fire on a summer's day?<eos> I found the contract - in your grate.<eos> I'd never seen that document before, although when I saw what had happened to Billy, I knew he must have been involved in something.<eos> So you wanted to destroy the evidence, so the police didn't think you were complicit?<eos> I asked Martin to help me find out what else had been going on.<eos> And?<eos> Looks like Harrogate was pouring money into the club. Billy was taking it out and spending it on the horse.
In fact, why don't you all come to dinner tonight?<eos> This isn't one of those dinners where you guilt everyone, is it?<eos> No.<eos> Guilt dinners are only for you.<eos> And they may need to stop 'cause it's getting expensive.<eos> I personally would hate to see the man who abandoned me with two small children, but if you're cool with it, then fine.<eos> See you at 7:00.<eos> Bring dessert.<eos> Oh, I shouldn't bring dessert.<eos> I'll just eat it in the car.
Sure, well, let me know if you hear of anyone looking for office space.<eos> Oh, Danny, what was it you wanted to tell me? Uh... I wanted to...<eos> Do you want my watch? - Do I want your watch?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> [whispering] Son of a bitch.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing, take it.<eos> Thanks. Huh.<eos> (Morgan) Yeah, this guy in the subway, I asked him if he was done with his coffee, and he was sleeping, so took it.
Little Vito's gonna be a great barber someday.<eos> Adrian, have you seen the...<eos> Whew.<eos> Oh, that's bad.<eos> Oh, wow, would you look at this?<eos> I got an extra deodorant in my two-for-one deal.<eos> It's from the Al Pacino fragrance line,<eos> "Scent of a Man."<eos> Nah, I'm good, man.<eos> I couldn't even handle it when my wife put potpourri in the bathroom, but luckily, the stupid cat ate it, and that solved two problems at once.
- All right, pal.<eos> - Okay, take care.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> I haven't called my lawyer yet, but put a sub sandwich in the fridge and you label it...<eos> Hey, you got a problem with me, you bring it to me.<eos> I did not become an OB/GYN just to deal with a bunch of whiny babies!<eos> Don't be coming in here yelling at us.<eos> You don't even talk to us.<eos> Yeah, do you even know what my job is?<eos> I mean, I definitely know it.

It was like a dream come true.<eos> Look, Dr. Bergdahl, we're not here to antagonize you.<eos> We actually got you rehired.<eos> Also, we've decided to be our most Oprah selves, and we're gonna give you all of our fund-raiser money.<eos> What?<eos> Come on.<eos> You're actually gonna give me $250,000?<eos> No way.<eos> It's $187, but the gesture is just as generous.<eos> Also, all the money's pledged, so if you really want it, you probably have to call and follow up...
It's $187, but the gesture is just as generous.<eos> Also, all the money's pledged, so if you really want it, you probably have to call and follow up...<eos> Oh, it's very nice of you, but I can't accept.<eos> Hey, why don't you stay at Dr. L's?<eos> She has an apartment she doesn't even use.<eos> Hey, can I ask you a random question?<eos> Why would a successful doctor need to sleep in a car?<eos> I'm kind of on the outs with my wife, Alice.<eos> It's why I'm not staying at my place, and yes, I could probably go get a place of my own, but I feel like that would kind of be admitting that my marital problems are more than just temporary, so...<eos> That's it, that's all my dirt, you got it all, so I hope you're happy.
- Hi.<eos> Is the telescope ready?<eos> It's sold.<eos> What'?<eos> You couldn't have waited?<eos> How much did you get?<eos> 3200.<eos> We need more than that.<eos> I'll have more, when I get my salary.<eos> But I've already ordered it.

How about a drink?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - I'm all grown up now.<eos> I know but... tomorrow I'm doing my periodic health examination.<eos> - Will you have an eye test, too'?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I won't be long.<eos> Here's your money.<eos> Come in.<eos> You don't want it.
Yeah, you're right.<eos> Any volunteers?<eos> Eh, eh, there's no need to ask, Chief!<eos> I'll head over there and I'll grab a bite on the way.<eos> - And I'll take over at midnight.<eos> - Great! And I'd better head over to Dante Point.<eos> - See what my friend Nicky knows.<eos> - Ah, is that your surfer friend?<eos> Mind if I tag along, get a feel for the scene?<eos> As long as you don't call it '"the scene'"!
"Rich people are worth more than poor people.<eos> Life's not fair.<eos> Grow up."<eos> Captain, with your permission, I'll send this to Harlan Emple.<eos> See if he can identify the maths.<eos> Well, it gets weirder.<eos> Position our guys found the envelope in, bullet would've went right through it.<eos> So somebody placed it on the body after he was shot.<eos> So someone kills a homeless man in the middle of the financial district, leaves about $4,000 and a note saying how little poor people are worth.<eos> If this is some sort of political statement, I don't get it.
Well, whoever did it wants us to connect this body to that lawyer.<eos> Go talk to him and find out why.<eos> Specializing in dispute resolution and wrongful death compensation.<eos> Only the latest in a long line of euphemisms for "blood money".<eos> You know about this stuff?<eos> Whenever a corporation cuts corners on a child's car seat or allows poison to penetrate our food or rolls the dice on an oil rig safety valve, someone like Mr. Schrader calculates the minimum amount of money they can pay the victims' loved ones to keep them from suing.<eos> Or, heaven forbid, from clamoring for criminal prosecution.<eos> Maybe that's what the money in the envelope is about.<eos> That's what Schrader's formula would have determined each victim was worth?<eos> So the killer set a price and then paid it.
How did she think that was gonna play to the guy on the street?<eos> Not to mention the Aceway boardroom.<eos> If they're still on the fence about settling claims with fixed sums, they won't be for long.<eos> She probably just gave the killer exactly what he wants.<eos> Nick made something of himself.<eos> So did some of the other people on that plane.<eos> Why shouldn't they be recognized?<eos> Why shouldn't their families receive more?<eos> Marcus called-- the sketch from the gun dealer should be here soon.<eos> He'll e-mail us once he gets it.
Okay, what is happening?<eos> What are you doing with your thumb?<eos> We feel it best to proceed with the given strategy.<eos> She played you!<eos> I know, and it was wildly arousing!<eos> But let me tell you something, Jess.<eos> She played you, too.<eos> No, she didn't. No, she didn't.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I filled out the form, I submitted it.
I know, if anyone found out, we'd both be in hot water.<eos> You'd lose your job.<eos> I'd lose my presidency.<eos> Hester hates you, Theo.<eos> Crap!<eos> I did it again.<eos> I can't stop calling you Theo.<eos> [laughs] Then don't.<eos> I've always liked the name.<eos> That's why I picked it.

Somebody is having an affair.<eos> [sighs] Go get the toilet paper, 'cause [bleep] just got real.<eos> Do all jets come with a masseur that good?<eos> Another couple minutes, and I might have been in the mile high club.<eos> [laughter] Zita, how can I ever thank you?<eos> Well, when you and Duke adopt your first cute ethnically ambiguous baby, you can name her after me.<eos> - Done. - [laughter]<eos> ♪ Ready for the good life now ♪ ♪ Ba-da da-da-da-da-da ♪ We're here!<eos> Okay, Duke's weigh-in is just about to start.<eos> We'll make it just in time.
I should have let the machete brothers cut my buddy's head off.<eos> Well, if you did, maybe you wouldn't be choking down a damn Khan worm right now.<eos> What's a Khan worm?<eos> You think that's what it is?<eos> Or some sort of freak cousin.<eos> Freak cousin of what?<eos> A couple years back, Dean and I worked a case.<eos> We got stuck in a cannery with this worm.<eos> It would get into people's bodies and -- It was freaking awful.<eos> All right, so you've been to this rodeo before. How do we kill it? Worst case -- headshot the person it's in.
Maybe you should stay out of trouble for a while,<eos> Ms. Harper.<eos> What's the fun in that?<eos> You are a good man, Harold.<eos> And you, thanks for reminding me that it's not just my ass on the line.<eos> Finch?<eos> I think she just stole your watch.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> I stole her ring.<eos> She knows where to find me if she wants it back.
Now hit it!<eos> What'd you do? Fart us out of the ditch?<eos> Seriously, Caroline, step on it.<eos> No, Max.<eos> We can't risk getting into an accident.<eos> What if it's not fatal?<eos> Driving a Lamborghini slow is like going to Red Lobster and not getting the Cheddar Bay biscuits.<eos> Come on, we got to enjoy this car while we can.<eos> - Hit the gas. - All right.<eos> I'll take it up to the top of my age dating window.

A little respect for me in front of your brass-- is that too much to ask?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> That crack you made about addressing me as Commissioner.<eos> Well, that wasn't a crack.<eos> It's a fact.<eos> Proper protocol is to address a former PC as Commissioner.<eos> I know that.<eos> Well, then what's your beef?<eos> The way you said it.<eos> I didn't say it in any way.
This was sex between two consenting adults.<eos> What do you think?<eos> He's sticking to his story.<eos> No way he does that if they're sexually involved.<eos> And Jenny insists that it's not herin the video, but they both have good reasons to lie.<eos> So we're back to a third party.<eos> If the woman in the video isn't Jenny, then there's a good chance that she's our stalker.<eos> Well, one thing we know for sure-- she's trying to ruin her, making everyone think she's sleeping with Coach Baker.<eos> Why didn't they release the video sooner then?<eos> If it's fake, you disprove it, and it goes away, but if you start with a rumor, it doesn't matter if the video's real or not.

It was brunette, right?<eos> I saw some pictures of you.<eos> They were taken a couple weeks ago.<eos> You were brunette.<eos> Wait, you think that it was me with Coach Baker?<eos> Well, the video's dark, and you and Jenny have very similar body types.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Just ask Coach Baker.<eos> He'll tell you that it wasn't me.<eos> I posted it, ok, but I didn't shoot it.
You wanna hold it down here, honey. I'm working.<eos> I'm working, too.<eos> You the new singer?<eos> Let me guess,<eos> Lucille Balls?<eos> Ha!<eos> Best day of my life.<eos> Sorry, I'm all woman. Careful. You're gonna miss your chorus.<eos> Oh, really, smart ass?<eos> Well, why don't you take it?
No, that's because we were sleeping together.<eos> You sleep with all your fighters?<eos> Keeps them focused.<eos> I thought fighters weren't supposed to have sex before a fight.<eos> Well, it keeps me focused.<eos> - Ah...<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> What about the text from Mickey?<eos> I don't sign my fighters for their communication skills.<eos> If I did read it, I don't remember.
No. The cartridge also!<eos> Make this again!<eos> Thank you<eos> Finding Leander Anton ... disappeared in a playground in Silverhöjd, enters its seventh day.<eos> Now he criticises the police investigation.<eos> Martina Sigvardsson, police chief of Silverhöjd, responded to criticism.<eos> We follow rules and guidelines.<eos> Of course, we do everything that is in our power to find Anton.<eos> Do you think it's a kidnapping?<eos> Nothing suggest it, but doesn't ruled out any possibility.
Don't tell your mom, she doesn't like if you drink soda.<eos> You're painting something nice.<eos> Very good.<eos> Yes, Tom Aronsson.<eos> What body?<eos> Yes, it's me you're talking to.<eos> How so it appear "strange", what do you mean?<eos> Oh well.<eos> I'm on strict schedule.<eos> Fill in the report, and I'll read it.
If we go to the police, they put us in a nut house for life.<eos> I feel so terribly powerless.<eos> If only there was some way to prevent them from start explosion.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know?<eos> It's an agreement between ThÃ♪rnblad and woods.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> It was in a secret chamber in the farm, hidden between pages of a book.<eos> Your ancestor, Adolf Fredrik's book. Have you read it?
I'll talk to you later.<eos> How could you ? !<eos> You know when you should have drink.<eos> The illness you feel because the parasite takes nutrients from you.<eos> How bad it would be?<eos> It will take over.<eos> You will stop being human.<eos> You have to know a way to get rid of it!<eos> What kills one, kills the other.<eos> How many people are there who have it?
Yes.<eos> He was under contract to the Ontario Government for the new northern railway.<eos> You say his visit was unexpected.<eos> Do you have any idea why he returned to Toronto?<eos> I don't.<eos> All he told me was that our fortunes were about to change.<eos> - How so?<eos> - He didn't say.<eos> He hurried right out to take care of some business.<eos> He returned with a small parcel and put it in his suitcase.
No, sir.<eos> Mrs. Graham didn't have the key.<eos> However, if you'll allow me...<eos> Let the dog see the rabbit.<eos> Thinking of a change of profession?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Just trying to hone my skills.<eos> - Oh. - I've almost got it there now.<eos> - Crabtree, move it.<eos> - Sir, I've almost got it.
Yeah, that's fine there.<eos> Sir.<eos> Sir, you've no tie or collar.<eos> - No need, George.<eos> - This here's our guide.<eos> There aren't enough horses for all of us, but a couple of donkeys should do the trick.<eos> There we are.<eos> Leave it to the Newfoundlander to catch a fish.<eos> Excellent work, George!<eos> Perhaps you could gut it, sir, as were I caught it.
Perhaps another time... Mack.<eos> Sir, her manners could use some refinement to be sure, but do you think she actually killed the man?<eos> She did not seem at all seem surprised at the news of Mr. Graham's murder.<eos> And George, poison is traditionally a woman's weapon.<eos> Excuse me, would I be able to borrow this board?<eos> - You will be bring it back?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Even a small drop of the liquid from Graham's flask was enough to kill this rat.<eos> There's no burning of the mucous membranes, so we can rule out arsenic, cyanide, - strychnine.<eos> - I activated carbon I made from ground nutshells and gave it to this rat.
It's your name?<eos> In English, it means Eagle Flight, doesn't it?<eos> You know the properties of water hemlock.<eos> You poisoned Mr. Graham's flask when you guided him to the train.<eos> Am I speaking the truth?<eos> Why?<eos> Silver.<eos> If people found out, then we would...<eos> You would lose your home.<eos> Can you deny that you won't take it away?
I suppose he knew someone would come looking for him.<eos> - And the people he was with?<eos> - They moved further north.<eos> It won't go well for them, will it?<eos> The silver will draw prospectors like moths to a flame.<eos> Migizi Pimise started a fight he couldn't possibly hope to win.<eos> But surely, they have a treaty that will protect them.<eos> Let's get you to bed.<eos> Our government is made of men of good conscience.<eos> Let's hope they honour it. _
Soon after your half-uncle, Thorvin Hampton, came to visit your father, Mr. Hampton was murdered.<eos> Then we found your father's lighter at the scene.<eos> Sheriff, what are you saying?<eos> I'd like to help your father live out his days in a facility rather than a prison.<eos> Now, if you bring him up to War Eagle, I may be able to help him do that.<eos> Kind of tucked this place away, didn't they?<eos> Out of sight, out of mind.<eos> Is this your father's?<eos> Grandfather's, actually.<eos> He took it with him when he fought in World War II.
We're going to do all we can to save you, Mr. Piper.<eos> Don has been taken to the Huntsville Memorial Hospital just off the I-45.<eos> He's conscious.<eos> She should probably speak to him now.<eos> It doesn't look good.<eos> Would you like to speak to Don? Yes, I would.<eos> We don't let people speak to patients unless it's a grave situation.<eos> All right.<eos> Hello?<eos> He's unable to hold the phone himself so I'm gonna put it up to his ear.
Good, good.<eos> I've got some relief for you, Mr. Piper.<eos> I'm gonna take good care of you, okay?<eos> Let me just have that arm.<eos> I'm gonna just hook this up for you.<eos> And this will make you feel a lot better.<eos> All righty.<eos> This is real simple, Mr. Piper.<eos> All you need to do is,<eos> anytime you feel you need some relief, this will just take it all away for you.
Now, I'm gonna walk back over there to my family.<eos> I want you to watch me and as you watch, I want you to know that one day you will walk, too.<eos> You'll probably do it better than I do.<eos> You met someone who understands.<eos> Give me a call, all right?<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Hey, it's not about me.<eos> Before I died on that bridge, I was unsure of what my purpose was.<eos> Now I see it more clearly.
Back again to be beaten.<eos> No... No.._BAR_ just wanted to see whether.. ..you still look beautiful when I am sober.<eos> Come back in the evening.<eos> Stars don't shine in the day.<eos> It's lying on the table...your English horn.<eos> Champa picked it up from the stage.<eos> And my head?<eos> It's been missing since last night.<eos> I guess that also got left behind.<eos> Did you find it?
- Tilak!<eos> Glory to..<eos> - Tilak! Glory to..<eos> - Tilak!<eos> Glory to..<eos> - Mother India!<eos> Tilak!<eos> - Yes.<eos> I heard an air-plane's going to fly here.<eos> Did you see it?
Our airplane will look like this.<eos> Your Sitara Devi doesn't know..<eos> ..one needs lots of gold to build an airplane.<eos> The real one, not fake.<eos> You stole it?<eos> Sitara Devi, doesn't your Shivy know..<eos> ..taking something from your own house, isn't stealing.<eos> I'll knock some sense into you.<eos> Shastn/ Ji's airplane won't be built with filthy money.<eos> Then how will we build it, Kaka?
I know, I don't look a day over 38.<eos> All right, but when's the next time<eos> I get to be youngest anything anymore?<eos> All right, I'm affected by that too.<eos> You know, my hair is naturally gray.<eos> - Really?<eos> - All of it.<eos> - Everywhere.<eos> - Okay, I got it.<eos> - I dye it from my head down--
There's this philosophy in this progression in the food.<eos> It just broadened my vision.<eos> The philosophy of kaiseki is that we are supposed to represent the area that we're living in.<eos> When I was working in the countryside, we took from what was close to us, making the best use of what the season has to offer.<eos> I was so in love with the idea that I put a farm-like garden in the back of my house.<eos> One of the first things I've learned about kaiseki is the integrity of the ingredients should never get lost.<eos> In Japanese, it's called sozai wo mamoru, which means "To protect the ingredients."<eos> After having this garden, to see it from seed, to watch it grow little-by-little, to watch the process, to see it struggle, to see it survive, there is this whole level of appreciation that everything takes time,<eos> everything takes the right amount of nurturing, everything deserves effort because it's making an effort.<eos> This little tomato took three months to grow... and to just toss it or to waste it or to take it so lightly, we're not doing our best to appreciate what nature is truly offering, what the lessons of life that are all around us are trying to teach us.
The restaurant was successful.<eos> My dad was really, really proud of me... but I was not happy.<eos> I was completely burnt out.<eos> I didn't feel that my voice in cooking was strong enough to say,<eos> "Hey, this is who we are.<eos> This is what I am.<eos> This is the food we serve."<eos> It was more of trying to go with the flow, like, adjusting and accommodating and figuring out what it is that people wanted.<eos> There wasn't room to be creative because there's not a lot of things that we should do to sushi.<eos> We should always keep it very simple, very pure.
Take the opportunity?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> So, no.<eos> All due respect, why not?<eos> If I put my own ask out there, it is tantamount to proposing a quid pro quo.<eos> Right, no quid pro, can't have that.<eos> You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.<eos> But a pension increase scratches the backs of 35,000 NYPD.<eos> Who deserve it.
- No, look, just don't do that.<eos> - Then tell me where the fuckin' money is!<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I... listen!<eos> I do not know.<eos> My brother was killed before I could find out.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> I'm not buying it, Webster.<eos> You said you had it!
- that I'm unhappy?<eos> - Does it matter to me that you're unhappy?<eos> - Um, not so much.<eos> - You prepped for this trial, Alicia.<eos> Ten months ago, you swore to me that you could win it.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, when you wanted me<eos> - to stay on as a client.<eos> - No.<eos> In fact, I told you to drop it, that defamation was hard to win, but that if you wanted to pursue it, we would do our best, and we did.
- Mrs. Florrick?<eos> - Oh, no, thank you.<eos> And it's Alicia.<eos> Okay, Alicia.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now, I only have a few moments.<eos> Let's cut to the chase.<eos> You want my money, huh?<eos> Yes. - Ah?<eos> - And let me tell you why I deserve it.
I understand.<eos> Don't tell my dad.<eos> What?<eos> I said don't tell my dad.<eos> About that kid?<eos> All American Mike.<eos> Don't tell him.<eos> He'll just get angry.<eos> - You'll have a black eye.<eos> - I got it from tripping after school.
Her daughter.<eos> And no one will allow me to be vindicated.<eos> No one seems to consider how much I... how much I miss her.<eos> How much pain I still feel.<eos> I know I'm... I'm not a perfect man, but I loved Carolyn.<eos> And they shouldn't be allowed to tell 15 million people that I did this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Dylan has a black eye.<eos> - I saw.<eos> - How did he get it?
Just because you're dating a police captain doesn't mean you can kick in other people's doors.<eos> Vincent does it all the time.<eos> Why can't I have some fun, too?<eos> Because Vincent's a beast,<eos> Bob and Carol are super assassins, and you're just a dude who heals himself.<eos> Gee, thanks.<eos> Sorry, I'm a little cranky.<eos> Did you figure out how to get that serum out of your body?<eos> Although, when it worked on the heart a couple weeks ago, I think it's because, uh, the transplant pushed the serum past it's limits, like, shocked the system.<eos> Overloaded it.
Vincent said that you couldn't heal.<eos> He took me to the hospital, took some X-rays.<eos> No broken bones.<eos> So you can still heal yourself.<eos> I don't know-- I don't think so.<eos> Otherwise, I wouldn't still be in so much pain.<eos> Getting hit by a truck must have pushed my healing power past its limit.<eos> So, by shocking your system...<eos> I overloaded the serum.<eos> Maybe even burned it out.
Get out!<eos> Candace, are you okay?<eos> Why'd you stop yelling at the girls?<eos> I'm having a heart attack.<eos> What?<eos> Well, we should go to the hospital.<eos> Yes, we should go to the hospital.<eos> - And let me tell you something.<eos> - What?<eos> The next time someone in your life has a heart attack, you immediately step to it!
Thank you very much.<eos> Hey, thanks for waiting, guys.<eos> We'll do this as quickly as possible.<eos> One at a time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Great.<eos> Use it in good health.<eos> - All right, next.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Thanks for having exact change. Appreciate it.
Yeah.<eos> Why don't you sit?<eos> Thank you.<eos> To turning the page. Mmm. So...<eos> Agent Gaad is under so much pressure with this investigation.<eos> I'm not sure he's gonna make it.<eos> He lost his cool yesterday in a way that he never has before.<eos> He actually attacked the mail robot.<eos> And Gene couldn't fix it.<eos> They're sending it out for repairs.
- Failed basic training.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it bloody does!<eos> - Referred to a psychiatric unit?<eos> - So he saw a psychiatrist.<eos> - I don't care if he...<eos> - No, I'm sorry, Sinclair... we are out of time!<eos> And frankly, it is this kind of backwards thinking that loses wars.<eos> May I remind you who funds this camp?<eos> May I remind you who runs it?
It's okay, it's okay.<eos> (moaning) Oh no, no.<eos> Your pulse is low.<eos> You've lost too much blood.<eos> Do you know your blood type?<eos> - O.<eos> - That's good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Why do you have that?<eos> I found it on a German soldier.
- What's he saying?<eos> Wrong...<eos> - room.<eos> It's the wrong room.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Get Sinclair.<eos> Ok. - Shh, shh, shh. - On y va.<eos> - Wrong room.<eos> - No chance he remembered the layout wrong?<eos> He didn't remember it wrong.
- Aurora!<eos> - You remembered!<eos> - Well, it's been so long.<eos> - Um, Cecile, meet my friend Mathieu.<eos> I've been telling him about Michel's profiteroles for months now.<eos> I was hoping your brother<eos> - would be at the cafe.<eos> But...<eos> - Yes, well, what a shame.<eos> We try everything, kept it open for as long as we could, but...
So I did what you asked.<eos> I went through the evidence from Mark's safe house top to bottom.<eos> You're gonna tell me I'm crazy, right, chasing ghosts?<eos> Actually, I might have something, evidence that a computer was in use.<eos> But there was no computer in the evidence log.<eos> But there was an open Ethernet line with an unusually high data transfer rate.<eos> Someone in that house was spending a lot of time online.<eos> Missing computer.<eos> This is good.<eos> So how... how do we find it?
Never even had a chance.<eos> No.<eos> I lost my wife and... and my apartment, any... any dreams I had left.<eos> You can get it all back, you know?<eos> Your manhood, your dignity.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How?<eos> The cameras that we planted are still active.<eos> They link to this web portal.<eos> If the FBI found the laptop, then they would have taken them down, so somebody else has it.
Yeah?<eos> How?<eos> The cameras that we planted are still active.<eos> They link to this web portal.<eos> If the FBI found the laptop, then they would have taken them down, so somebody else has it.<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> Feds came in the door 90 seconds after Mark split.<eos> Laptop was on your bed.<eos> They have it.<eos> Maybe they just haven't looked at it yet.
"Follow will be yours, "the infamous Joe Carroll killing from beyond the grave."<eos> Immortality.<eos> What do you have?<eos> I went through all the evidence logged from Mark's safe house, and I found this.<eos> A receipt.<eos> For a laptop purchased in Rego Park.<eos> I have the BIA, which means if someone is using the laptop<eos> - we can find them in real time.<eos> - How? I'll just enter the I.D., into our system, see if it pings anywhere.<eos> If not, we'll have to submit warrants to all the telecoms, so maybe we can find it that way.
- What is happening?<eos> Jane, listen, I need you to clear out the room.<eos> I know who has Mateo and I know how to get him back.<eos> _<eos> Wait, Rose?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What does she want?<eos> Let's call it a trade.<eos> I had a dragonfly broach.<eos> Luisa took it when we last saw each other.
Grab those wipes.<eos> And-and grab that burp cloth.<eos> Oh, and I need pants.<eos> _<eos> Hey, can you grab me that bag of, um,<eos> - _ - adult diapers?<eos> All right, let's go!<eos> _ 81 minutes; Mateo has to eat in 81 minutes.<eos> Just answer me... did you take the pin?<eos> You don't have it?
- _ - adult diapers?<eos> All right, let's go!<eos> _ 81 minutes; Mateo has to eat in 81 minutes.<eos> Just answer me... did you take the pin?<eos> You don't have it?<eos> You're not gonna get in trouble.<eos> Did you take the pin?<eos> We'll be right there.<eos> Wait, where are we going?<eos> - Who has it?
Juicy.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm having trouble with my girlfriend.<eos> Okay, we're done here.<eos> Now, on to important stuff.<eos> The sperm.<eos> - Scott?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I had a little shopping bag... small, blue.<eos> Oh, yeah, the baby present.<eos> I put it up in Mr. Solano's penthouse for you.
I must be doing something wrong.<eos> Maybe he's cluster feeding.<eos> Which brings us back, here.<eos> Come on, did you doubt Michael?<eos> He's a mensch.<eos> Get a book and read it so you know what you're talking about.<eos> Then wait for the right moment, when she doesn't know and her mom doesn't know, and even Abuela is stumped, that's when you come in with the save.<eos> Cluster feeding.<eos> Uh, it's like when a baby eats and eats before the mature milk comes in.<eos> I read it here.
They even have a spa menu. Who knew?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, could I get a side of bacon?<eos> Small.<eos> Or maybe large.<eos> What do you think, Darlene, small or large?<eos> Whatever you want, sweetie.<eos> It's not that bad for you.<eos> It's protein.<eos> I even eat it myself sometimes.
Because I want to move on with my life, and be the person I want to be.<eos> And praise, and praise.<eos> Raise?<eos> No, praise.<eos> These aren't arm raises, they're "arm praises."<eos> They're part of the new exercise program I invented.<eos> Okay, I don't need an exercise program.<eos> Oh, but it's so much more than that.<eos> It's the ultimate in multitasking your mind, body and spirit.<eos> I call it "atonercising."
Darn, looks like your services are no longer needed.<eos> Fine, I didn't really want to do it anyway.<eos> It's not like I'm getting an Oscar for this [bleep].<eos> I am so thrilled to be a part of this, honey.<eos> I've already been working on an impression of you that I think you'll adore.<eos> Hard to believe, since you literally know nothing about my life, but whatever.<eos> Good luck, Darlene.<eos> You're gonna need it.<eos> Hey, I didn't get to your yearbook yet.<eos> Do you mind if I get it back to you tomorrow?
No, no.<eos> I don't want your hospitality.<eos> Hey, what are you mad at me for?<eos> I could've had your job.<eos> I turned it down.<eos> Yeah, well, that doesn't give it back to me.<eos> Well, you should've made her cut the Microloans program.<eos> Dude, I begged her.<eos> Burke was just looking for a reason to humiliate your boss.<eos> She handed it to him.
- Thank you.<eos> Grumpy, too.<eos> Sorry, I didn't sleep.<eos> I had a weird dream.<eos> About what?<eos> I don't remember the details.<eos> That's unsurprising.<eos> Our brains often protect us from disturbing dreams by suppressing our memories of them.<eos> What does it mean when you remember a dream vividly?<eos> Means that we enjoyed it.
What happened?<eos> They moved the third chemical to a higher security lab.<eos> I don't have clearance.<eos> The guy who does, Marvin, would never help us.<eos> He's by the book.<eos> Does he carry the same security card as you, only with the necessary clearance?<eos> Yes.<eos> If I get you that card, can you get the chemical?<eos> Sure.<eos> But... how are you gonna get it?
I like that rule.<eos> Good.<eos> Ok.<eos> Happy writing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Caroline, voice-over: "As I was saying, things are great."<eos> Woman, voice-over: "Dear diary, I'm in hell.<eos> "It's hard to imagine a place worse "than where I've come from,<eos> "but by some spectacular miracle,<eos> "I found it.

They all complained of stomach pain.<eos> Francis came in here, lay down...<eos> And died.<eos> Yes.<eos> No sign of a struggle.<eos> So, we have a change of clothes, the key to his Jeep, phone, wallet containing cards and cash.<eos> Now, according to Francis's son, his journal is missing.<eos> Apparently he relied quite heavily on it.<eos> It's what he wrote his notes and dates in.<eos> You think someone's stolen it?
"Ed Alzate... 40 years of service to Denver."<eos> That's all right.<eos> Whose picture's that?<eos> That's me.<eos> Oh. You are a philanthropist.<eos> Very generous with the hair.<eos> Hey, Kyle, when did this happen?<eos> According to the billboard, it's been going on for 40 years.<eos> I guess that's one way to give back to the community.<eos> - Did you see it?
- Go on.<eos> - Emma had a boyfriend.<eos> - What?<eos> Who?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yet. What's going on on your end?<eos> - The breastplate is gone.<eos> - What? What do you mean, gone?<eos> - How?<eos> - Well, if I knew that, Peter, I would have it back in my possession.

Charles.<eos> It's okay. - There's no paper trail. - You think I care about that?<eos> Hey, come on, Charles. Talk to me.<eos> You have no idea, do you?<eos> One day, you'll realize this is a mistake, and it'll be too late.<eos> Oh... damn it!<eos> [Ashley]: Nobody pays attention to car alarms anymore.<eos> - You owe me.<eos> - What do I owe you?<eos> My club. You bought it out from under me.
If he could see me now, he'd laugh.<eos> He'd already know what to do.<eos> He'd have done it.<eos> How would he do it?<eos> Have a seat, Billy.<eos> We're going to stir the proverbial pot.<eos> But you can't play whist without four men.<eos> Then let there be two Washingtons and two William Lees.<eos> My brother Lawrence taught me this game.<eos> He used it to order his thoughts.
- Agent Keen?<eos> - And Ressler.<eos> They were supposed to deliver a witness two hours ago.<eos> They haven't been seen since they left Kenyon's compound.<eos> Have you mounted a search?<eos> I'm on my way out to assist HRT, but there are hundreds of square miles of rugged terrain.<eos> It could take days.<eos> The weapons.<eos> Agent Keen said there was a complete inventory list.<eos> You have it?
Islam was spreading across the land, and in Bayo, my father was among a few converts.<eos> Read what you wrote.<eos> - "Allah akbar."<eos> - Good.<eos> Very good.<eos> Now, keep practicing.<eos> No more.<eos> No more travelling so far to bring babies into the world.<eos> Women in other villages have babies too, and your daughter needs to learn the trade.<eos> I will not allow it, it's not safe.
Al...<eos> Algenib, the flank.<eos> Mark...<eos> Markab, the saddle.<eos> Enid...<eos> Enif, the nose.<eos> Ar Rissalah's symbol.<eos> The horse's head.<eos> It's Pegasus.<eos> Fatah's using it as a map.
Yeah, man. You covering the back room, too, right?<eos> Oh, wait, now. You fucked up my baby.<eos> You fucked my moms.<eos> Wait. Okay.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hold on. Yes. Yes, I did, okay?<eos> Unknowingly, though.<eos> That's the God's honest truth.<eos> Look, we just left your car there, man.<eos> Someone must have come along and fucked with it.
And by "doesn't really exist," you mean what?<eos> It's most closely related to Phyllobates terribilis, a frog from the Colombian jungles, but not exactly.<eos> It's a batrachotoxin, which is only found in three poisonous frogs from Colombia and three poisonous birds from Papua New Guinea.<eos> And I'm not even gonna try to pronounce the name of said frogs and birds.<eos> And let me just add one ounce of this poison kills 10,000 mice, 10 to 20 humans, and 2 African bull elephants.<eos> How do I know this?<eos> I looked it up.<eos> So where did the poison that killed Zack come from?<eos> I think it's got to be Wesen.<eos> How did the M.E. explain it?
Hi, Jon.<eos> I'm Bonnie Wheeler.<eos> To sell a property as special as yours, you could go with a realtor with decades of experience, or you could go with...<eos> Me, the ultimate fan, who conceived not one, but two kids to shot through the heart.<eos> Jon, I know I may be living on a prayer, but I promise I will sell your place, dead or alive.<eos> Bonnie Wheeler.<eos> I give real estate a bad name.<eos> Mom... I thought dad burned down the Bon Jovi shrine.<eos> He did.<eos> I rebuilt it. (Theme music playing) ♪ It's amazing how the unexpected ♪
Did you say pool?<eos> No, I said, "pools," as in, "I'm so rich, I built a second pool, "because I forgot I already had one."<eos> - So the place is vacant?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> I just need to find a rich guy with deep pockets.<eos> Oh man.<eos> If I had a dollar for every time I said that, I could afford that place myself.<eos> What about a rich woman?<eos> Like my boss, Mary hart.<eos> Yeah, if you show me the apartment, I'll talk it up to Mary.
Answer: Not very.<eos> Well, I just hope that Mary bites.<eos> She may be my only hope.<eos> Ugh, I just wish I could get this listing all to myself.<eos> Why don't you just ask Brad?<eos> Like I'm gonna take advice from a guy who's got sailboats on his pants.<eos> But...<eos> I could ply him with alcohol and seduce him, and then guilt him into giving me the listing while he's still under the effects of an after-glow coma.<eos> You're an inspiration to women everywhere.<eos> Hey, if God didn't want me to use it, he wouldn't have made it magical.
Yeah, your plan.<eos> I should have known.<eos> No!<eos> Our plan.<eos> I hit on her, but she hit back.<eos> I was out-hitted.<eos> That's right, I out-hitted him.<eos> "It's 9:00, going in for the move.<eos> Get in here."<eos> The next time you make a secret plan about me, don't email it to me.
Professor X of the X-Men.<eos> It's not that Professor X wouldn't get up, it's that he couldn't!<eos> Well, I'll show you who can get up!<eos> That's right!<eos> I don't need this scooter!<eos> All of you, follow me to the future!<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> Stick a forklift in him, he's dead.<eos> I've never written a eulogy before, but this time, I did.<eos> Unfortunately, I left it at home.
Something's going on.<eos> We haven't gotten mail in a week.<eos> I- - I haven't gotten mail in a week.<eos> Nobody writes you.<eos> Officer Swanson, I'll remind you that you are under oath.<eos> Now, please tell us what Mr. Quagmire said he did with the girl.<eos> He, uh, said he gave her a Frosty Jim.<eos> And can you please explain to the courtroom what a Frosty Jim is.<eos> Uh... Sir, you're under oath.<eos> Well, it's when you urinate in a condom, and tie it off, freeze it, and then the woman, um, pretends it's a man.
I-I'll see you real soon.<eos> Hey, you guys take good care of my child rapist friend!<eos> Mr. Quagmire, wait!<eos> Judge? !<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to tell you the good news in person.<eos> Your sentence has been commuted.<eos> You will not be serving prison time after all.<eos> You got a good body, man.<eos> Why do you hide it under that robe?
Just one week after Drew signed a month-long contract to pitch in Portland.<eos> How convenient.<eos> Is Valentine's this weekend?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Should I get the extinguisher?<eos> 'Cause your pants are on fire, liar, liar.<eos> You don't think Paige notices the timing?<eos> It is a business meeting.<eos> Valentine's is a scam created by the greeting card industry.<eos> The only reason why I picked that place is because Paige mentioned it.
Our best couple friends.<eos> We haven't actually met them yet, so the names are just placeholders.<eos> But in my head, he's a human rights lawyer, and she loves to pickle vegetables.<eos> Pam the pickler.<eos> Oh, Jack, stop.<eos> You are moving way too fast for me.<eos> I just... I need a little space, okay?<eos> I mean, how can I miss you if you won't go away?<eos> I think I understand.<eos> I'll take my foot off the gas and put it on the brake.
I have something for you, Meena.<eos> It's a story about a man called Lemuel Gulliver and his travels to all these strange and different lands.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll be back to check on you soon, Meena.<eos> As Georgia helped me heal from what Robinson Appleby had done to me, I came to see that there was no good way to deal with that man.<eos> The only way would be to leave him.<eos> Books offered me solace, but they offered much more than that.<eos> Only by learning about the white man could I ever escape and find a way back home.<eos> I love when you say my name.<eos> Well, then come closer and I will say it again.

He gonna be born free.<eos> I hope so.<eos> I need to speak to one Miss Meena Diallo, the midwife.<eos> - Hold on now, who's asking?<eos> - Lieutenant Waters - What does His Majesty's army want with my wife?<eos> We need her services.<eos> British soldiers and officers filled Manhattan and took their pleasures with the women in Holy Ground.<eos> Every one of them knew that I could catch babies.<eos> They called me "One-Pound Meena" for my fee.<eos> I never kept the money, but just used it to help the people of Canvas Town.
- Yes.<eos> I received a letter yesterday.<eos> Lieutenant Waters made him a courier between Albany<eos> - and Saratoga about a month ago. - Saratoga?<eos> General John Burgoyne, who Lieutenant Waters is to meet in Albany, just won a small battle in a place called Freeman's Farm outside of Saratoga.<eos> - Sam... - Hmm?<eos> If the British cut off New England, will the fighting end soon?<eos> This fight could determine the course of the war, my dear.<eos> Now, here, we have your name, Adam.<eos> I wrote it here:
Yeah, actually-- I took apart every clock in my parents' house when I was a kid.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> I got in big trouble for that, too.<eos> Until I moved on to the furnace.<eos> Uh, Andie's grandmother left her a clock, and I, uh...<eos> I want to get it fixed for her.<eos> Aw, so she can see how wonderful you are.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The jewelers, they won't even open it for less than 500 bucks.
Man, I am so screwed. What am I supposed to tell Andie now?<eos> Don't worry about it. I got you covered.<eos> How?<eos> Well, this is our backup clock.<eos> As soon as the clock exploded in the bone room, I figured we needed a plan B.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> Craigslist. Nine bucks.<eos> Nine?<eos> So Andie's clock isn't worth anything?<eos> I don't know, maybe nine bucks was a fortune when her grandmother bought it.
~ Nah. ~ Why not?<eos> I'd have thought that was...<eos> No, I know.<eos> I've been there and I've, sort of, done that, with Ford GTs.<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> ~ They'll fit it with a burglar alarm that will go off every time you fall asleep or when your child's doing some important solo work in the school production - "Woo-woo-woo!"<eos> This is weirdly specific.<eos> Stuff that happened to you.<eos> I know what will happen and then you'll drive home and get a phone call from somebody, saying, "Your car's been stolen."<eos> You'll say, "It hasn't, I'm driving it."
No need to wonder if they were having an affair.<eos> Not sure it lasted.<eos> What?<eos> 'Secrets cost.<eos> 2K.<eos> Tomorrow.'<eos> ~ He was blackmailing her?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> I've never seen this phone before.<eos> We found it in your wife's gym locker.
Helen?<eos> That was the pathologist.<eos> We were right.<eos> The serial number on the metal pin shows it was inserted into the leg of a Steven Cadley at Nottingham University Hospital.<eos> So, Marcus Leyton was really Steven Cadley.<eos> Right up to the moment that he entered witness protection.<eos> The reason there's no record of Marcus Leyton before 2009 is because he was actually Steven Cadley.<eos> Lived on the Carswell estate in Nottingham.<eos> A bit flash, by all accounts.<eos> Liked spending money, even when he didn't have it, which got him into trouble, mostly with this guy, Lewis Hargreaves, loan shark and money-launderer.
So how'd this guy get around the system?<eos> Kate?<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Would Emma have disarmed the system and let him in, especially that late at night?<eos> Well, if she didn't let him in, he'd only have a few seconds to cut the feed.<eos> Unless he knew the code.<eos> Would she give out that information?<eos> Probably not, but maybe somebody else would.<eos> I mean, who else knew the code?<eos> Only me and Emma knew it.
Unless he knew the code.<eos> Would she give out that information?<eos> Probably not, but maybe somebody else would.<eos> I mean, who else knew the code?<eos> Only me and Emma knew it.<eos> I changed the code every 90 days.<eos> Maybe Emma put the code in her phone as a reminder and somehow it was hacked?<eos> No.<eos> No, I wouldn't let us write it down.<eos> After a home invasion 6 years ago, uh, I made us memorize it.
You could've at least told me.<eos> What? We're both sick of playing boss.<eos> I mean, as soon as he gets up to speed, he can take stuff off our plates.<eos> - He ran Cardiff for 22 years.<eos> - I know.<eos> Mutiny is not Cardiff.<eos> That's the whole point.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Cameron, he's an ex-convict, which is not exactly the smartest hire when we're in the market for more funding.<eos> And when we're this strapped for cash, you're gonna waste it on somebody that doesn't know a bitmap from a baud rate?
- Priceless.<eos> That's a fire hazard.<eos> - Hey, where's Donna?<eos> - Whoa, look who's here.<eos> Shouldn't you be in Tahiti or something with all the money you just made?<eos> Look, there's a major problem with "Tank Battle." The game's not fair.<eos> Dude, we've got bigger headaches right now.<eos> And it's a good thing Cameron isn't here.<eos> Oh, yeah, lucky me.<eos> Listen, there's times when I fire at my opponent and the game doesn't read it and I get killed.
Chances are they've suffered total data extinction and they're gonna blame us.<eos> God knows how many subscribers we've lost for good.<eos> Oh, did you enjoy your finger food and cocktails?<eos> Cameron, what is this?<eos> What's going on?<eos> A rogue program ate our drives.<eos> Nuked all our data.<eos> Something called Sonaris.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You sent it?
Cameron, what is this?<eos> What's going on?<eos> A rogue program ate our drives.<eos> Nuked all our data.<eos> Something called Sonaris.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You sent it?<eos> I... I mean, I... before we left...<eos> Stop. You wrote this?<eos> No, uh, I didn't know that he actually went ahead and sent it.
We've both been down the same road, but if there's one thing I've learned, it's that revenge will never bring you closure.<eos> You gotta help me.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm not a murderer.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> I dropped the package off to her in the morning, and that's all I did.<eos> I didn't like leaving packages at people's doorsteps during the holidays.<eos> A lot of thieves.<eos> A lot of bad people out there.<eos> I made sure she signed for it, and then I left.
Alone?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> All right.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> What is going on?<eos> I need your cell phone.<eos> Why?<eos> It's important.<eos> Is your personal laptop here?<eos> No, I left it at home. Why?
They're clean.<eos> I know.<eos> Which is why I didn't come to you right away.<eos> I wanted to confirm it.<eos> And I did.<eos> Last night.<eos> I found the RAT.<eos> On your home laptop attached to a personal video file.<eos> I downloaded the malicious code.<eos> I have it right here.
Why are you bleeding?<eos> And where the hell did you find that code?<eos> That's it.<eos> That's the code I just found on Chan's computer.<eos> That's how our target was able to open up the microphone on Dr. Chan's computer and listen in.<eos> My husband will divorce me.<eos> I sometimes imagine killing him.<eos> I'm afraid I'll really do it someday.<eos> Then our target must have recorded the sessions on his own device.<eos> Nelson just discovered it on my laptop.
Yes.<eos> His name was Logan Reeves.<eos> He knew that I would always cherish the videos of the two of us with Hannah, that I'd always keep them with me.<eos> He embedded a RAT in one particular video file.<eos> Basically, it allowed him to live inside my computer.<eos> It was the video of us with Hannah in the park.<eos> The last time all three of us were together.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> The video?<eos> Do... do you have it?
I'm Stage IV.<eos> Just gave me about four months to live.<eos> Look, Leslie Shay wasn't just some victim in this fire.<eos> She was my partner and his best friend.<eos> No guarantees, all right?<eos> But let me see if I can take a look.<eos> Dawson.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This was arson.<eos> Which would mean the Shay was murdered, and whoever did it is still out there.
- He has her?<eos> He has Nancy?<eos> Please, too little, too late.<eos> Max, we're in $10,000 worth of debt and you spent money on new kitty litter?<eos> Relax, I'm going to pee in it, too.<eos> Well, I guess it beats that Sprite bottle you've been using in your bedroom.<eos> It's just such a long walk to the bathroom that every time I have to go, it's like I'm raising money for MS.<eos> Oh, I have good news.<eos> I found your lost bra in the litter box.<eos> Don't think I'm not still wearing it.
He'd download schematics and plans and drop them for me in the tunnel.<eos> Who?<eos> - Mikhail Dankov.<eos> - The astronaut?<eos> If Tom was onto him, then maybe he's your killer.<eos> We checked his tracker.<eos> He was inside the habitat at the time of the murder.<eos> Mikhail knew if his movements were being recorded, he'd never get away with what we were doing.<eos> So he beat the system.<eos> He cloned his tracker before they embedded it under his skin.
Zoom in on the window.<eos> Look down on the bottom right.<eos> Is that the rover?<eos> I thought the computer said that it was docked during the murder.<eos> Clearly, the computer was wrong.<eos> Now, uh, push in on the rover's arm.<eos> Filter out some of that reflection.<eos> It's the screwdriver.<eos> There's your killer holding the murder weapon.<eos> The rover did it.
This can't be right.<eos> All the data from M.I.R.A. indicates that the rover was docked when Tom was killed.<eos> I'd say the data's wrong.<eos> And according to your literature, that rover has the speed and dexterity to kill with mathematical precision.<eos> Mr. Jansen, who has access to the rover controls?<eos> One of your astronauts?<eos> Someone at mission control?<eos> No one has access.<eos> The rover is an extremely complex piece of equipment.<eos> Under human control, there's too high a margin for error, so we designed it to interface solely with the computer.
The rover was docked.<eos> Is it possible someone could have altered her memory?<eos> No one altered my memory, Mr. Castle.<eos> My memory is perfect.<eos> Her memory core was designed to be a closed system.<eos> It can't be altered, but something's off.<eos> M.I.R.A., run a level-one diagnostic on all systems.<eos> There is no need to run a diagnostic.<eos> All systems are optimal.<eos> How about we run it anyway?
No way.<eos> Not with Cat driving.<eos> Good.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, actually, that was fun.<eos> She kicked ass.<eos> Don't ever lose that part of you.<eos> Especially in a marriage.<eos> Flash drive?<eos> We'll take it to DHS, see if they can I.D. any of the suspects.
It's late.<eos> You should go.<eos> Julie, please, listen to me.<eos> I know you're awake.<eos> I know someone hurt you.<eos> Someone hurt me too.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I recognized the necklace right away.<eos> Lucy wore it all the time, and...
Oh, the best date of your life was watching me give birth?<eos> Now, that's just sad.<eos> That's not sad.<eos> Watching you bring this amazing... little person... into the world, that... that was awesome.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> About what?<eos> This song... for our first dance.<eos> I think it's perfect.<eos> You want to tell us how... Lucy McCabe's necklace ended up in your cabin?<eos> I took it... all of it, from the girls.
Thanks.<eos> WOMAN: Okay, that's all the time we have for sharing today... I liked your share.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Listen, I've been thinking about making some changes in my life.<eos> Is there any chance I could talk to you sometime about how you became a lawyer?<eos> Sure.<eos> Want to grab a coffee after?<eos> That'd be great.<eos> My treat.<eos> No, no, no, no, I got it.
He knows the game.<eos> He's holding onto the information.<eos> Withholding the truth to maybe make a another deal in case Coughlin doesn't bite.<eos> Okay, Gabriel knows that my cousin's an easy target.<eos> If he told IA that Chin took the money for himself,<eos> Coughlin's going to make sure he loses his badge and for good.<eos> $18½ million.<eos> I have to imagine that was pretty heavy.<eos> We got you with the bags coming and going, Detective, so where's the money?<eos> The money, uh, would be right where we left it.
Yeah.<eos> Steve... I just heard from my contact.<eos> It turns out that there was more to Danny's arrest than just bringing him to justice for the Reyes murder.<eos> What else could it have been about?<eos> It was an apology of sorts.<eos> Reyes was in the middle of a big deal when he was killed on the CIA's watch, and somebody has to answer for that.<eos> How big a deal we talking about?<eos> $1.3 billion of cocaine never made it to market.<eos> Reyes was the only one who knew where that shipment was.<eos> The CIA's been looking for it ever since he was killed.
All right.<eos> Listen, there's this guy that we used to move drugs for back in the day.<eos> And he was... he was really dangerous.<eos> How dangerous?<eos> Now, first of all, I want to apologize if I overstepped some bounds with you and your little girl, and... she's just really talented.<eos> - Yeah, thanks a lot, man.<eos> - She's special, and that's why I think there's a... a home for her at Empire.<eos> With your blessing.<eos> We got a bigger problem here, Lucious.<eos> And you throwing my daughter a bone ain't gonna fix it.
Now he's the perp?<eos> Hey, that's my professional opinion, partner. Mm-hmm.<eos> Picture's on its way.<eos> If you need any more assistance, you know where to reach me.<eos> Okay, this is where the accelerant was poured.<eos> It extended around the entire room and then across into the center, where the fire started.<eos> It's not gasoline.<eos> No, it's liquid petroleum.<eos> It's used in camping stoves.<eos> Fire bugs call it white gas.

That's good.<eos> There's been a lot of crime in this building.<eos> Just the other day, a plant was stolen from right outside my front door.<eos> While you're here, maybe you can catch the hoodlum who did it.<eos> Yeah, uh, we'd love to help, but we're... you know, we're kind of tied up.<eos> Oh, I understand.<eos> You're busy with important police work.<eos> I'm just an old lady with a stolen fern.<eos> Oh, did I mention that it's a fern?<eos> Six years I had it.
This is what gives us a bad name.<eos> 20, 30 minutes-- that includes a drink.<eos> That's three hours-- make us look terrible.<eos> This is impossible.<eos> We can't do this.<eos> You, uh... you reading the workbook?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> It was over here, now it's over there; you had to do something with it.<eos> When you fell asleep, you dropped it on the floor.

- We have over a hundred disciples who have paid a great deal to be here, so I can assure you, no one's holding anyone captive.<eos> But, officer, you're welcome to take a look wherever you like.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> When a smug yemi like that tells you that it's okay for you to look anywhere you want, she's hoping you won't.<eos> ¶¶ - I know you're scared.<eos> I was scared too at first.<eos> Come out, come out, come out, angel. [crunch] - Ow!<eos> I tried to be nice.<eos> Now I'm gonna rip out your angel and make you watch me eat it.
You've never farted?<eos> But yeah, right, women don't fart, you know?<eos> You know what, can I borrow your lighter?<eos> I'm gonna light a fart right on stage.<eos> What do you think of that?<eos> You guys want to see this?<eos> All right what I'm gonna do--<eos> Don't light your fart.<eos> Please, don't light your fart.<eos> ...the second boom, you guys go nuts, and I'm lighting it, all right?
So I called the bat man and he comes over and I'm in the closet looking through the crack, at-<eos> The bat is on the ceiling, hanging upside down, he's just looking around.<eos> And so finally, there's a knock at my door and I go, I crawl to the door and I open it and he's like, hello.<eos> And he says, "Where's the bat?"<eos> And I'm like, "Ehhh..."<eos> So the guy walks over and he just takes the bat.<eos> That's it.<eos> He just took it.<eos> He's like, all right?<eos> Yeah, you pretty much nailed it.
Besides, I... Kind of already said yes.<eos> Without asking me?<eos> Lou, see, all I have tried to do is protect you.<eos> I mean, do you even know what it means to be in a... In a marriage, in a partnership?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It means we both bring our baggage and our eccentricities into this union, and it is our job to respect each other's quirks...<eos> Among mine, being my family.<eos> And mine?<eos> Well...<eos> How about the fact... That you keep losing your wedding ring and I find it all over the house and I return it back to you without once asking you why you keep taking it off?
This is still a fake marriage, right?<eos> Uh, it's tricky.<eos> Are you attracted to her?<eos> Jack, have you seen her?<eos> Everyone from Southampton to the South Pole<eos> - is attracted...<eos> - Yes, but that doesn't mean that they should be married to her.<eos> And that brings me to the other thing.<eos> This ring...<eos> No one's attracted to me when I wear it.
You know, if we just stick together...<eos> Alright.<eos> That's fine.<eos> It's what I wanted anyway.<eos> A little peace and quiet.<eos> You wanna play a game or something?<eos> Nah, I'm just gonna take a nap.<eos> No thanks, kiddo.<eos> I found this antique book in one of the holding rooms.<eos> It says it's a classic, so I'm sure I've read it before... but it's all new to me now.
No, the oxygen.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> We're draining power from the other systems to boost the shield.<eos> I'd better hurry.<eos> Venting airlock.<eos> You should know, I've used my neural link to upload an override program.<eos> It can be accessed from the navigation console on the bridge.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Simply initiate the override, then after a few moments, once complete, it will automatically execute the jump to FTL.<eos> We won't need it.
So far, so good.<eos> Any sign of an electromagnetic discharge out there?<eos> Negative.<eos> Descending into the access channel.<eos> The control systems for the coupling should be located near the bottom of the ramp.<eos> We just dropped into emergency lighting.<eos> Accessing control panel.<eos> I can see the coupling.<eos> I've identified the faulty electrical component.<eos> Removing it now.
I'll think of a better one than Cutie Pie.<eos> You're my Angel Dust.<eos> Sorry, that's a drug.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Bye.<eos> Louise. When are you coming down?<eos> Mom has a stain on her apron.<eos> You're missing so much.<eos> How'd you get this number?<eos> Mom writes it on my leg every morning in case I get lost.
what are you talking about?<eos> I'm not into you.<eos> I was just messing with you, you big jerk.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Oh. [Chuckling] Oh.<eos> Oh, you were just messing with me.<eos> Wow, that is really cruel.<eos> Yeah, well, what you did was really thoughtless.<eos> Cristela deserved that CPR money.<eos> She's the one who needs it.
High caliber, high velocity.<eos> Judging by the size of the wounds, it was definitely shot from some distance.<eos> Someone knew how to shoot.<eos> Who, damn it?<eos> And why cheerleaders?<eos> Where's the motive?<eos> They didn't even ask for a ransom.<eos> They want headlines.<eos> They want mass panic.<eos> - Well, they got it.
That's okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Edwige, I can see that you know this knife.<eos> You're scared of this knife.<eos> Why?<eos> - Why are you lying to me?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> Madam, if there's one thing I know, it's a liar.<eos> Now, tell me about this knife, or I will use it.
You know what I like about those glasses?<eos> They look like bull's-eyes.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I am. Okay!<eos> We're not gonna hang around for round two.<eos> Everybody load up, and let's get the hell out of here.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> That wasn't a request.<eos> This place is still our best bet for evidence against Galavan.<eos> We leave, they'll destroy it.
She broke into your apartment, found the file you had on me.<eos> It was clear that you'd been sent to push me to sell my company, that your entire family was corrupt, but I still had to find out what your uncle knew about my parents' murder.<eos> Now I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bruce!<eos> Wait.<eos> That name wasn't real.<eos> It was just something I made up to stop him.<eos> That's funny.<eos> You only made it up when you were under the knife, not when Bruce was getting tortured.
I know that now.<eos> Please...<eos> I'm gonna prove that I love him more.<eos> I am going to carve your pretty face off your skull.<eos> And then you will both understand what true love is.<eos> Okay, just one more thing.<eos> What?<eos> Your dress.<eos> I-I love your dress.<eos> I just want to know where you got it.
- Okay.<eos> - Wait, give me a second. I want to look smart when you say it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Uh,hey,Genevieve, DetectiveBoylewantedme toletyouknow thathe,acollegegraduate, hada similartheory thatitcouldhavebeen anex-boyfriend. - Wow.<eos> He is so smart.<eos> - Wow, it actually worked.<eos> I've got to hand it to you, buddy whatever you're putting down, she is picking up.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> Oh, one more thing. - Boyle has another question.<eos> - Tell her when this is all over, I'm gonna rub her body in pâté, and then rub it off her with a cornichon.
- Where were you July 21st, Mr. Butthead? - Uh... [mocking] - Uh, duh, uh... you were robbing Genevieve's gallery.<eos> You framed her, and I should arrest you right now.<eos> - What are you, cops?<eos> - What?<eos> No, we're artists.<eos> And as artists, we question everything, including certain people's whereabouts on particular dates.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> - Fine, but we're taking this, because you don't deserve that memory.<eos> - That painting is $95,000.<eos> - I don't want it anyway.
Shut up, Charles!<eos> Jake?<eos> Where's Jake?<eos> Did you eat him, Terry?<eos> No!<eos> Good morning, guys!<eos> How'd you get out of the pit?<eos> Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.<eos> Actually, it took me hours.<eos> I tied all my clothes together, tethered them to a log, and used it as a grappling hook.
Hitchcock just drank his own fish.<eos> What?<eos> Nooo! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪<eos> Ames, you're two minutes late. I called all the emergency rooms.<eos> I know.<eos> I went home from your place to shower, and I'm so tired that I fell asleep while shaving my legs.<eos> But we went to bed so early.<eos> "Property Brothers" was over at 10:00.<eos> I mean... sex.<eos> We do it.
I mean, sure, there are a couple of similarities, but... oh, man.<eos> It's the exact same one.<eos> Ugh! I have a dumpster mattress!<eos> All right.<eos> That settles it.<eos> We're going mattress shopping.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Oh, this is the best.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> You know, once we get it, we'll have to break it in.
Soren is probably allergic to dust.<eos> Oh, hello!<eos> Yes, I am allergic to dust.<eos> Everyone is.<eos> That's what sneezes are.<eos> You're what sneezes are.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> Oh, in Sweden, we call it police work.<eos> Perhaps you don't have a word for it? - I hate you.
Get your weird, hairless fingers off of it.<eos> Soren shaves his fingers for cycling.<eos> It cuts down on drag.<eos> Agneta is my biggest fanatic.<eos> Just as I am a fanatic of her slam poetry.<eos> - Would you like to hear some? - Would I like to?<eos> - I would hate to!<eos> - Your loss.<eos> Well, we've already searched the entire apartment.<eos> Yeah, well, now we're gonna search it, and find things you all missed, like this!
- Very cool guy.<eos> - So cool.<eos> Yeah, that's cool.<eos> Hey, this is weird because I hate you guys, but can I ask you a question?<eos> If you broke up with your husband, would you tell Soren about it?<eos> Are you making a funny laugh joke right now?<eos> I would insist he be there for it so that my husband would have a shoulder to cry on.<eos> Yeah, several years ago, Agneta and Lars were having trouble conceiving.<eos> She didn't even have to ask me to donate my sperm.<eos> I had it already in a "Tooperware," ready to go.
They do, actually.<eos> - They're quite nice. - Oh.<eos> Kevin, there's something we'd like to show you. Ta-da!<eos> Ah, magnifique.<eos> The treble is ours.<eos> I look forward to getting number four next year.<eos> Actually, we've been banned for life from all future tournaments.<eos> Oh, no. What happened?<eos> My fault, Kevin.<eos> I snapped the second-place trophy over my knee and threw it in a urinal.
- You are bad.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> You're making fun of me.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Well, I don't care.<eos> He would never open a gift, right?<eos> But what if his gift didn't look like a gift?<eos> - He would open it?<eos> - Exactly!<eos> I left it in a cardboard box on his desk.
I don't give a crap, sir.<eos> Sharon needs a doctor, so get over yourself.<eos> Tell him you threw away his stupid duck, then give him 20 bucks to buy a new one.<eos> It cost $740.<eos> What?<eos> That is an insane price for a duck!<eos> That's way too much!<eos> All right, now I'm angry about the wrong thing.<eos> Look, just fix this for Sharon.<eos> Frederick, the duck was ugly and gross and I threw it in the garbage.
- I...<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'll deal with you later.<eos> Seems like you already dealt with me.<eos> I got the gist, we're good.<eos> Peralta, can I confess something to you?<eos> I didn't throw Frederick's duck in the garbage.<eos> Yes, I know, sir.<eos> I didn't throw the duck in the garbage.<eos> I threw it off a bridge.
But it's mold.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And it's black, so...<eos> Well... well, like they always say, if it quacks like a duck, you should put on a face mask.<eos> Well, preventing a terminal lung disease is not high on my list of priorities right now.<eos> It's actually number 257, uh, right after "Get a juke box."<eos> Listen, Samuel, I...<eos> I just want you to know, you're not in this alone.<eos> And all your friends are here to support you every step of the way.<eos> The same friends that gave me money to play poker, and then, they cruelly took it away from me?
Er... Florence, could you make a start on the financial checks, please?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Commissioner.<eos> I'm here to talk about Sergeant Bordey.<eos> Ah. So, you know?<eos> I've had a formal request to release her.<eos> But she hasn't decided if she's going yet.<eos> Nevertheless, she can't go unless we agree to the transfer, by, um... signing this release form.<eos> I see.<eos> And will you sign it?
I reckon we might have a possible suspect on our hands.<eos> Really?<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> I spoke to the cashier at the bureau de change, where Jenny withdrew the 6,000.<eos> ~ Did she remember anything?<eos> ~ She remembered plenty.<eos> She had to think twice about handing over that amount of money to someone who was being accompanied by an angry friend.<eos> Your contact thought Jenny was being intimidated?<eos> Look, all Gloria knows is that Jenny and another woman had an argument before going inside the bureau.<eos> Jenny then withdrew the money and handed it to the woman.
You should see them.<eos> They make for interesting reading, because two voicemail messages were left on her mobile from a hotel landline, before midnight on the night of the murder.<eos> ~ Just before midnight?<eos> ~ I know.<eos> Just before the candles were lit and she was killed.<eos> ~ Have you accessed her voicemail?<eos> ~ They have been deleted.<eos> But, according to the record, she accessed and deleted them at 7.15am the following morning.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. She accessed her voicemails after she was dead?<eos> Ah, but Florence came up with the idea of dusting the screen of Jenny's phone to see who else had used it.
Or super bad.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I'm just looking for anybody who could even be remotely considered a candidate.<eos> Good news is, so far, none of them are anywhere near New York, so... even if Liam does exist, with five hours to go, no way he can screw up the wedding.<eos> No. I can't keep this from Catherine now.<eos> I mean, it's bad enough I haven't told her that Julianna escaped from the hospital.<eos> And now she's broken into the precinct.<eos> She's probably got the serum. No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> But even if she got it, she didn't inject it into you, and that was the big concern, right?
(Katya voiceover) Previously on Allegiance...<eos> The moment we have enough information to prove that Black Dagger is real, we go straight the FBI.<eos> We work together as a family.<eos> (Victor) The money for Black Dagger will end up in Italy.<eos> (Natalie) The transfers arrive at a bank in Rome in three days.<eos> Someone must be there to identify who picks it up.
- That's right, we can't.<eos> The SVR would track that and the moment they realize we were in the same city as the triggerman, they'd kill us all.<eos> You planted those documents the task force just found, the documents saying Mikhail's files were in Rome, all as an excuse to get me there?<eos> That's right.<eos> And then what?<eos> I just slip away from my colleagues, all trained spies and spycatchers, and go and track an SVR contractor skilled enough to command a payment of $50 million?<eos> Yes.<eos> (Endo) I cannot promise it will be available for long.<eos> I have many suitors.<eos> [imitates Chinese accent] I'm sure you do, Endo, but I want it more.
Closer branch.<eos> You went to Qingdao for your training?<eos> Of course.<eos> Who was your instructor at the base in Qingdao?<eos> Shu Chen.<eos> His rank?<eos> Leftenant Colonel.<eos> What color was the outdoor track?<eos> There was no outdoor track on base.<eos> Now I can take you through primary school and get you a copy of my mother's last angiogram, or we can just get to it, and tell me your price.
Let me guess, it's got a big gamma gun on it?<eos> Ah, I put big gamma guns on my cereal.<eos> You I know I got a whole vault full of them back at the base.<eos> Interesting.<eos> With the Green Hammer, I can topple entire nations single-handedly.<eos> The world will tremble in fear.<eos> HULK: Tremble at this!<eos> You swore you were protecting this town.<eos> My town.<eos> But you were just using it as bait to lure us in.

Yeah, why?<eos> All aboard, tour bus is leaving.<eos> Next stop, anywhere but here.<eos> No, don't take that.<eos> Deactivate Green Hammer.<eos> (LAUGHS) Fool, I warned you.<eos> Booby-trapped controls.<eos> Exactly what I would have done.<eos> That town is my home.<eos> Not gonna let you destroy it.
Got a blip on the GPS tracker in Devil's collar.<eos> Central Park, here we come.<eos> What if Devil-boy got mad Hulks left him?<eos> Mad at us?<eos> Nah, he loves us.<eos> Nah, he loves us.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> He's fine.<eos> HULK: Tracker says we're close.<eos> (PANICKED CRIES) (DEVIL DINOSAUR ROARS) But I don't think we're gonna need it.
- Worthy of the Wedding at Cana!<eos> - Our thanks, Father.<eos> God be with you.<eos> - How 'bout a riddle?<eos> - Let's hear it.<eos> "Lifeless out of life, life out of lifeless."<eos> Doomsday...<eos> No.<eos> You say it, Ionita.<eos> The egg, for the hen lays it lifeless, and when it hatches, it comes to life.
Status update, Rosa.<eos> How are the flowers?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yellow.<eos> Terr-bear?<eos> I had my tuxedo altered to make it tighter like you wanted.<eos> Delicious.<eos> Jake, have you checked in with the jeweler?<eos> Yes. They said the ring will be ready at 2:00 on the wedding day.<eos> I'm gonna pick it up on my way to the ceremony.
How do I look? Oh!<eos> You look incredible!<eos> Down low! Butts, butts, butts.<eos> You're the worst family in history, but at least you're ready.<eos> Scully's run out of songs.<eos> Right now, he's singing. ♪ Don't, don't, don't, don't ♪ ♪ Don't you forget about me ♪<eos> Best rock and roll song ever written.<eos> Tied with Kokomo. Hey! So we have good news and we have great news.<eos> The good news is we found the ring.<eos> The great news is we'll never lose it again.
- Are you all right?<eos> - Yes. - I saw the helicopter...<eos> - It must have looked dramatic.<eos> It was an exercise.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> Anything else will be denied.<eos> - I'm still going to write about it. - Really?<eos> - I have pictures.<eos> - Of an exercise.<eos> I recommend that you drop it.
There's nothing in here.<eos> Then why is she guarding the door?<eos> Leave, now.<eos> Don't piss her off.<eos> She'll drop an ark on your head.<eos> You are her, from book.<eos> Goddess of Badland.<eos> That book's trash.<eos> Shtako, that is her.<eos> Why didn't you kill it?
Victoria, a word?<eos> Yes, Stuart.<eos> While they look at the congressman's office, why don't you show me yours?<eos> Anything special you'd like to see?<eos> How about we start...<eos> With the lamp?<eos> And by "lamp," you mean... The object when plugged into the wall illuminates the room.<eos> You know, when you leave it on too long, it generates a surprising amount of heat.<eos> That's why I keep mine... On a timer.<eos> She said she'd put it on the desk, it's not on the desk.
Information.<eos> I came in here earlier.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I needed help finding someone.<eos> And I gave you a name and sent you on your way.<eos> That name again?<eos> What?<eos> What was the name you gave me earlier?<eos> Draves.<eos> Wanna write it down this time?
You even garnered some respect in certain circles.<eos> You can't afford to have people think you've gone soft.<eos> We could send you back to your ship without your tongue.<eos> Maybe that would help.<eos> I'm just telling you what i hea.<eos> And i'm offering you an opportunity to prove That you are still an effective team.<eos> I have a job for you.<eos> It's a traugott research facili.<eos> Our intelligence indicates They're about to make a major discovery.<eos> And you want us to steal it.
No more blind ops.<eos> Full disclosure or we don't do .<eos> Well, i am sorry to have wasted your time.<eos> Just hang on a second.<eos> We should talk about this.<eos> There's nothing to talk about.<eos> Yes there is.<eos> No there isn't.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I will forward coordinates for a rendezvous, And give you twenty four hours to think about it.
Previously on Dark Matter...<eos> It's a Traugott research facility.<eos> Our intelligence indicates they're about to make a major discovery.<eos> And you want us to steal it.
Might even be more fun.<eos> Would you ah like to see that?<eos> You're a sick sonuvabitch.<eos> Wexler, Cain, we've got a problem.<eos> What?<eos> You need to get to the bridge.<eos> Just as it was getting interesting.<eos> To be continued.<eos> I don't suppose you have that knife on you?<eos> Six has it.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Are you telling me that little girl managed to kill her?<eos> I don't know what happened, but she ain't just taking a nap.<eos> You find that little bitch, and when you do, you don't stop to chat, you just put one right in her brain.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Roger that.<eos> This is the VRC Dimitriev.<eos> We have a shuttle inbound off your port side.<eos> Do you have the device?<eos> Yeah, we got it.
Yeah, really sorry you didn't earn your commission on that one.<eos> It's a small price to pay for peace of mind.<eos> Okay, let me run this scenario by you.<eos> Traugott's been doing RD on a white hole bomb.<eos> They've got a prototype but they can't test it without getting the G.A. on their backs.<eos> So what do they do?<eos> They float word around about it, back-channel whispers, and guess who takes the bait?<eos> Mikkei.<eos> They hired us to steal it.<eos> We do, deliver it, and once it's safely into their hands,
Prepare to jump.<eos> You left her? !<eos> They're gone.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> [THE ANDROID] I've dropped us out in close proximity to the system's A-type main sequence star.<eos> As long as we remain within it's radiation shadow, we'll be undetectable by long-range scanners.<eos> [ONE] But it's safe, right?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> If you're going to come up with a plan of action, I suggest you do it quickly.
Watergate, the invention of the pill, the White Album.<eos> Has there ever been a more perfect weapon of destruction?<eos> Yes, Sally survives in the end, but does she?<eos> Aren't we all running from the chain saws in our past?<eos> See you next Tuesday. Wow.<eos> You are amazing.<eos> What did any of that mean?<eos> Uh, well, it means that, uh, we've all been traumatized. Oh.<eos> What we do with the hurt from that trauma defines who we are.<eos> Do we look... inward and-and heal or... do we take that hurt and turn it into anger and take it out on the world?
But what do you mean, "you guys"?<eos> I'm by myself.<eos> But... where's Gracie?<eos> I thought she was upstairs with you.<eos> I don't know where she is, actually.<eos> The GPS said she was in this house!<eos> Wait. You tracking her phone?<eos> Yes.<eos> I gotta know where she is at all times.<eos> Okay, well, maybe she turned it off, because serial killer or not, that's a little creepy.
The risks are real, but we need to close ranks.<eos> If any of you die while protecting a sister, you're allowed to skip the rest of Hell Week.<eos> And I'm gonna hire security.<eos> I don't feel comfortable with a man protecting me.<eos> It's representative of the patriarchal, post-colonial culture that encourages violence against women.<eos> Always... saying what everyone is thinking.<eos> Ladies...<eos> I got this, okay?<eos> I got it.<eos> We've got to get rid of the body before the new security guard finds it.
Geez.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Uptight.<eos> You like that?<eos> - I'd love having sex with your corpse.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> What did you just say?<eos> You just talked about a serial killer.<eos> - You made me picture it.
Isn't this a coincidence.<eos> I was headed over to Kappa House to steal some of your panties.<eos> Oh, Chad, that's amazing.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> But, Chad, listen.<eos> You have to help us.<eos> We're trapped in the house and the power went out and my phone is the only one that's working because I'm pretty sure the killer knocked down a cell tower or something.<eos> Wait, well, why does yours work, then?<eos> Because mine's a satellite phone.<eos> Elon Musk gave it to me.
If you need a ride to the store or McDonald's got your order wrong, please hang up.<eos> For robbery in progress, please press...<eos> Two on one?<eos> Doesn't seem fair, does it?<eos> Wait a minute, are... are you supposed to be<eos> Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia?<eos> When I was a junior, I spent a year abroad.<eos> I had an affair with a beautiful Eurasian man named Chon Wi Ha.<eos> He was a grand champion in the illegal Hong Kong fighting pits.<eos> Blood sport, they called it.
Look, I can't live like this, okay?<eos> All I do is work out and kill people.<eos> Where do you think I am?<eos> Yeah, I'm wearing a disguise.<eos> What do you think, I'm an idiot?<eos> Look, I'm totally incognito, I'm blending right in.<eos> Look, Gigi's the problem, okay?<eos> She's the one that got us into this, and now she's blowing our brand.<eos> I mean, who shows up in a Justice Scalia costume?<eos> She said she got it at the discount bin at the Halloween store.
I take packing very seriously.<eos> I was just in a zone... now I'm out of the zone.<eos> I just want to know why it isn't me you're taking home for Thanksgiving in the Hamptons.<eos> First things first.<eos> It's Hester, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hester.<eos> What is going on with the neckbrace?<eos> My spinal column was collapsing, so I decided to bedazzle my neckbrace and put it back on.
I have to say, Chanel,<eos> I am delighted and shocked that you're letting me keep whatever clothes I want... It's really big of you, considering the whole "I'm pregnant with your boyfriend's baby" thing.<eos> Well, honestly, the more I thought about it,<eos> I just realized that<eos> I love Chad so much, and part of loving someone is loving every choice they make, regardless of how selfish and destructive it is, you know?<eos> Thank you, Mommy.<eos> Oh, and if you want to start calling me Mommy, now being that I'm the one that's gonna actually be the mommy,<eos> I'm totally fine with that.<eos> Number Six, before you try on that kimono, why haven't you had any of this sushi?<eos> I mean, we got it just for you.
A what?<eos> Wait, are-are you saying you killed Hester?<eos> Gravity killed Hester.<eos> I just gave her a little push.<eos> Hester can't come between us anymore, Chad.<eos> You and I can pick up right where we left off.<eos> You can bring me home for Thanksgiving and introduce me to my future in-laws.<eos> Hold on.<eos> What did you do with the body?<eos> Duh. I put it in the meat locker.
A real mom to help you with this.<eos> Maybe I can... make you a playlist about it?<eos> No, Dad, come on.<eos> I need you right now.<eos> Here's what I think.<eos> When I was your age, I was thoughtless about sex.<eos> So thoughtless that I fathered twins with a girl whose name I can't remember, and those twins grew up to murder a bunch of people.<eos> Now, I know that that might seem like an extreme consequence of teen sex, but the lesson remains the same.<eos> Honey... if you don't think you're ready, you probably aren't.<eos> And if you aren't, well, then no good can come from doing it, anyway.
"'Derr, wait, I'm confused.<eos> Is Chanel talking to me?<eos> "Am I a useless Kappa slut?<eos> ' simply ask yourself the following question aloud..."<eos> "Is my name Chanel #3, Chanel #5,<eos> Chanel #6 or Zayday Williams?"<eos> "Because if the answer to that is yes, then felicitations, this missive is for you."<eos> So, do you all remember when we agreed to meet at the campus pool and kill the dean, and I got you all awesome new phones, so that when it came time to meet, the phone would light up a certain color, and when it did,<eos> you didn't even have to answer it, you just had to come meet at the aforementioned pool?<eos> And then do you remember not coming to the pool, despite me making it super easy for you by concocting a plan so simple that an orangutan could have figured it out?
Look, I-I know,<eos> I know that I can be socially awkward and-and a little bit off-putting and that most people find it very difficult to be around me, but you know me, Chanel.<eos> I'm not the killer.<eos> Um, excuse me?<eos> I think you're a serial killer because I know you, Number Five!<eos> You bite your own toenails.<eos> Okay, I am flexible.<eos> Why would I waste my money buying toenail clippers when God already blessed me with toenail clippers in the form of teeth in my mouth? !<eos> It's awfully convenient that you're the one who noticed Number Two's body went missing.<eos> Maybe you knew it was gone 'cause you'd already taken it to the house on Shady Lane.
Uh... I-I don't know.<eos> All of them?<eos> Okay, you know, I'm not a big fan of gotcha questions, dude!<eos> My friends are dead!<eos> I have nothing left!<eos> Nothing!<eos> Next question.<eos> As for me, I wrote up a quick book and became a media sensation.<eos> I was on the cover of Time, Newsweek and Men's Health.<eos> Well, I didn't write it.
I mean, as a student, sure, but not as a woman.<eos> I mean, I was stalking you outside of the sorority house, I got a job in the department so I could keep my eye on you.<eos> And I never really trusted you to take care of yourself.<eos> Well, clearly, I was wrong about that.<eos> - Well, Dean Munsch, um Cathy, uh...<eos> I can't stop calling her that, especially because she likes me to call her "Dean Munsch" in bed.<eos> Uh, anyway, Cathy and I, we're going to Napa for a couple of weeks.<eos> We're gonna, we're gonna suck down some deep cabs, eat some rich blues and... well, I don't know, pretend to make, uh, a lot of babies. Mm.<eos> I think you need your space.<eos> You've earned it.
See, you can't get the Sarkissians if we arrest Ari now, but if we don't, well, I'm the one that ends up eating the sins when it goes to trial, right?<eos> You knew exactly what kind of maniac Ari was when you sent me in, which is precisely why there was no cover team!<eos> Because you don't think you could be held accountable if you don't know what's happening, right?<eos> I'm sure the details will appear in your report.<eos> Oh, you're goddamn right about that!<eos> You wanna hear about my day, boss?<eos> It started out when we abducted Sammy O'Malley at gunpoint from his residence. Paul...<eos> Then Ari harvested the young man's kidneys.<eos> - After which... - Agent Briggs...<eos> We wrapped the body in a tarp and burned it in the back of a Lincoln Town Car!
- in our family.<eos> - I understand.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think we got that one.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> - Let's be honest.<eos> I wasn't really feeling the love.<eos> So let's get mom up and the baby standing with you and let's get...<eos> Can you take this banana 'cause I don't know what I was doing with that.<eos> Right, I'll get it right back to you.
I go by Lucy Tyler, and she's a fun, little, bubblegum princess, teenybopper character that I play.<eos> I tuck in my nose ring and I take out my gauges, and I wear my hair on my face.<eos> It's so much fun to have a different persona.<eos> - You okay? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> What did you do over the weekend?<eos> -I read my book.<eos> -What book?<eos> 'Tis by Frank McCourt.<eos> It's the second book to Angela's Ashes.<eos> Finally finished it.
That's fucking it.<eos> Good.<eos> Let it out, bitch.<eos> Slurp that shit up.<eos> Slurp it up.<eos> You missed a spot.<eos> Thought you, uh, Mexican chicks are good at this shit, cleaning up.<eos> I don't judge anybody.<eos> If that's what floats their boat.<eos> They're watching it on the computer, and they're not going out and doing it to an actual girl.
The degrading thing.<eos> Me, that I do it on camera to somebody who's faking it or that guy or that woman who's been working at that company, busting their ass for shitty benefits, for how many years?<eos> Who can't leave, because then what are their kids gonna eat?<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> People are in those situations - outside of porn, all the time. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Relationships.<eos> With me, it's all fake.<eos> That's where the line becomes fuzzy for some people.<eos> They don't see that.<eos> 'Cause they see our end product, that I guess is so realistic because people buy it.
She had facial abuse.<eos> - What?<eos> - That was her first scene.<eos> The dog bowl and all of that?<eos> - Pretty popular.<eos> - I did that.<eos> - So what happens?<eos> - That's not pretty girl porn.<eos> Facial abuse is like extra...<eos> She did it.
Jealous?<eos> I took you in when you had no one.<eos> Hi, can you help me?<eos> I'm looking for Max.<eos> Why, hello. Is it too late to be gay?<eos> Nashit?<eos> Oh, my God, he even looks good here in morgue light.<eos> We are so doing it.<eos> Caroline, you left your phone on the table at the restaurant.<eos> I confess, I used it as an excuse to come and see Max.
Yeah.<eos> Ha!<eos> Yeah, the shorter hair makes sense now.<eos> (Sophie) Yeah.<eos> Good for you, Caroline.<eos> I hope you like long, boring stories.<eos> Okay, where's Allie? I know she's here. I put a spy app on her phone, and I'm not proud of it, but I'm a jealous woman.<eos> Oh, her phone.<eos> I have it.<eos> She left it at The High when I threw her ass out today per your instructions.
You didn't think that was such a bad idea when you were using it to get what you wanted.<eos> And now you're threatening to take that thing away.<eos> Louis, you want to keep Joan, that's on you, but I held up my end of the bargain.<eos> You better hold up yours.<eos> I just want to go over it one more time, Professor.<eos> How much money was in that pot?<eos> I'm tried of going over it.<eos> Why do we have to keep replaying every moment of this game?<eos> Because your entire case depends on it.<eos> My case depends on the fact that I won that money gambling, not whether I won it with a flush.
Letting you come with me is something that I would only do for you if we were friends, which we are not.<eos> You canceled the hearing.<eos> You were right.<eos> He was lying.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, I knew he was a hypocrite after I found out about the gambling.<eos> I never thought he'd sell out Harvard.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He did take the bribe, but it had nothing to do with the accident victims.<eos> He did it to change someone's grade.
- Yes.<eos> I guess dining with your parents will be nicer than seeing Torquemada.<eos> And at least this gate isn't in a loop.<eos> No, my mother is in a loop.<eos> I've thought up a story about how we met, - in case your parents ask.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> Let's see. We met at the university.<eos> I had a mouse in a box to dissect.<eos> - OK.<eos> - The mouse escaped and you saw it and almost fainted.
- But...<eos> - No buts.<eos> I need you focused on the mission tomorrow.<eos> And whatever happens to the Ministry, we have to stay alive.<eos> At least so we can keep missing our people.<eos> I would like to apologize.<eos> Last night I left in the middle of the conversation.<eos> And I have two very important things to tell you.<eos> The first one is Amelia and I want to get married and I hope for your blessing.<eos> - You have it.
Without guidance, thank you very much.<eos> My life, my words, my pen.<eos> I am capable of writing.<eos> Miss Diallo, it is not a question of your literacy, but rather an issue of ensuring authenticity.<eos> That is precisely why nobody must tell my story but me.<eos> I will begin immediately, provided that no one interferes with my right to speak to any person, Dante, John Clarkson's butler, included.<eos> I want you to know that it was not my plan to prevent you from getting to know Dante.<eos> Blame me if you like, but please understand there can be no whiff of suggestion that your story has been influenced by the blacks of London.<eos> This could cause great damage.<eos> If I give my account and I will give all of it... it will be on my terms, and my terms only.
Where are they going to take her, the Ministry's jail?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's what she deserves.<eos> Do you feel sorry for Lola?<eos> Remember the Empecinado?<eos> Or the suspect that escaped from the future to become the magistrate of Salamanca?<eos> Or that because of her, the Nazis almost took control of this Ministry?<eos> Besides, she hasn't treated you well, has she?<eos> She sent you a photo of your wedding, and Alonso one of his abused wife, and Julián... she reminded him of the saddest day of his life.<eos> She deserves it.

Thank you.<eos> Well I plan on going to say goodbye to Federico.<eos> Federico?<eos> Careful, that poet's really grown on you, huh?<eos> And I think he wants something more than a chat with you. No.<eos> He's in love with Dalí and he will be for many years.<eos> I've read it.<eos> I've read up on him a lot.<eos> Listen to this poem.<eos> Let's see if I find it...
I've read it.<eos> I've read up on him a lot.<eos> Listen to this poem.<eos> Let's see if I find it...<eos> Here.<eos> "When the pure forms sank beneath the chirping of the daisies, I realised they had murdered me.<eos> They ransacked the cafés and the graveyards and the churches, opened the wine-casks and wardrobes, destroyed three skeletons to gouge out their gold teeth.<eos> They could no longer find me".<eos> It's chilling.<eos> And even more so once you know that he wrote it in 1930 in his book "Poet in New York" six years before he was killed.
But the important thing is that now you concentrate on your studies.<eos> Yes, yes you're right.<eos> You have time.<eos> Do you have a moment, miss?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's private.<eos> My goodness, so many secrets in these halls.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Lola Mendieta gave me an envelope for you.<eos> She told me to give it to you in case she wasn't here.
~ PRE-cancer.<eos> Frankly, I hate that it has the word cancer attached to it because it isn't cancer but it's sort of next door to cancer.<eos> What is she saying?<eos> That you do not have cancer.<eos> But she's said cancer, like, eight times.<eos> Doctor, you have said cancer rather a lot.<eos> Like, more than you'd hear in a casual conversation that isn't about cancer.<eos> Yes, and I'm sorry.<eos> But, while again, you do not have cancer, you do have a situation that we have to monitor closely so that it doesn't become cancer.<eos> That's two more times she's said it.
Ten days ago, I get a call from her editor saying she's down in Mexico, wants to blow the lid off this big drug cartel.<eos> You want us to find her?<eos> In drug cartel territory?<eos> There are ongoing, very sensitive border sovereignty talks between the U.S. and Mexico.<eos> The last thing the State wants is us sending in a paramilitary group to rescue a citizen.<eos> Well, they must know who you are.<eos> They know who Zoe is.<eos> There must be a substantial ransom; pay it.<eos> - I did. - $2 million via wire transfer.<eos> As soon as they got it, they called it a "down payment."
We can't even get to the stairwells.<eos> This configuration most likely leads to a central hallway, and central hallways have guards.<eos> We walk around the wrong corner, we're dead, and so is Zoe.<eos> If we can't see around the corners, we'll see through the walls.<eos> Sorry, Sylvester.<eos> My souvenir.<eos> Your souvenir... contains a light-receiving diode, so when it's nighttime, it doesn't chime and wake everyone up.<eos> We fire a laser pulse into the wall at the end of the hall.<eos> The pulse scatters in a million directions.<eos> It bounces off any object around the corner, including possibly the guard, who won't see it because it's invisible to the human eye.
I'll carry that.<eos> I won't argue with you about that.<eos> Ah, one more thing.<eos> In case of an emergency, ring the Abbey's bells.<eos> And what do we have the phones for?<eos> They're worthless here, in these mountains there's no coverage.<eos> The Spanish hell is everywhere.<eos> What is the Spanish hell?<eos> Nothing, a joke.<eos> You can tell it on the way.
And I swear to the contrary.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> I've already sent a team to resolve the problem.<eos> You all are here to obey my orders. Agreed?<eos> The second reason, and the reason I've shown you this old television program, is because Irene went to search for something that she didn't find and that now you must locate.<eos> The receipt for "Guernica".<eos> It's a painting by Picasso.<eos> It might be the most important one of the 20th century.<eos> The receipt?<eos> Do you want to return it or what?

Oh yes, about how there were three copies of the receipt.<eos> -Yes, thank you Angustias.<eos> (SIGH) Let's see.<eos> There were... three copies of the receipt.<eos> The first, the one that the Republican government in Barcelona, lost in 1939 when they fled to France.<eos> The next, the one from the embassy in Paris, was in the documents that the government bought in 1981.<eos> That was the one I was looking for.<eos> And the third?<eos> Picasso's own.<eos> You will have to go to Barcelona in 1939 and find the receipt before the Republican government loses it.
We have always had very good soldiers, but very bad bosses.<eos> In other words, it's nothing new.<eos> (Bombs falling, explosions)<eos> (baby crying)<eos> Come on, let's go, quickly, quickly.<eos> It smells like smoke, a bomb.<eos> If it was a bomb, there would be no hotel.<eos> Come on, come on, quickly, today.<eos> Excuse me, what happened?<eos> A small fire, but we have it under control.
On the second floor, rooms 211, 212 y 213.<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> Mission Failed And here I thought it would be easy.<eos> Nothing is easy.<eos> Ever.<eos> There's nothing left to do but to go for the second option.<eos> Let's see.<eos> In 1981, the government spent a fortune on some documents that weren't worth it and only paid for the receipt.<eos> So surely it must be there.<eos> But Irene didn't find it.
There's something.<eos> Could you hand me the tools?<eos> Here.<eos> It can't be.<eos> Were there mobile phones in the 16th century?<eos> ("Ministry of Time" theme)<eos> They found this phone in a 16th century dig site?<eos> The archaeologists must have flipped out.<eos> One is under psychiatric care, that's all I'll say.<eos> And it couldn't be a hoax, that someone put it there later?
If my clever prose makes you laugh, it speaks well to your intelligence.<eos> If you do not laugh, remember: "Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat".<eos> (Laughter)<eos> "The university won't give you what nature has denied you."<eos> I figured that.<eos> But take care, from experience I can tell you when nature does not provide, it will also take away.<eos> (Laughter and applause)<eos> So Walcott... He travels in time through a tunnel.<eos> That's what he confessed to.<eos> He says that they can move it in time and in space and it runs on nuclear energy.
No man has ever lived to boast of insulting me.<eos> - Murderer.<eos> - It would be best if you left if you don't want to end up like him.<eos> Come on, let's leave, quickly.<eos> And what will we do with all this?<eos> I have gold enough to spare without taking this junk.<eos> How did you figure out I was alive?<eos> They've been calling me from your old phone.<eos> My phone?<eos> - But I lost it in...

Yeah, he did.<eos> He was so proud of you.<eos> But I don't think he'd be proud of you right now.<eos> And it would break his heart to know that his death was the reason why you were throwing your life away.<eos> I'm sorry, Jack.<eos> Hey, you're getting a second chance to be the son that Dad was proud of.<eos> Look, Here's something to help keep you focused on what's important.<eos> His watch?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He'd want you to have it.
Ah, have you come to steal a glance at your old mistress?<eos> Is it just me, or does Diane look a little the worse for wear?<eos> Say it.<eos> I want to hear you say it.<eos> She looks old and too thin.<eos> So many mistakes, I see them all so clearly now.<eos> That was a very expensive mistake.<eos> What jealous tantrum did that necklace pay for?<eos> Look at Claude.<eos> She's rubbing my nose in it.
He asked me to fetch it for safekeeping.<eos> Safekeeping from whom, the Crown?<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Surely you've heard the rumors if I have.<eos> Word of financial ties between your lord husband and radical Protestants.<eos> I can assure you that no such ties exist.<eos> But if they did, the evidence would be in his personal ledger.<eos> That's why I've taken the precaution of hiding it.<eos> The lady has asked for her property.<eos> I think it'd be best you deliver it.
Before he went mad.<eos> You never told me that.<eos> Why would I?<eos> You asked me to give us a chance, so I did.<eos> Bash, you have no idea what it's like to be a girl in this world.<eos> Owning nothing, having no power except the effect that you have on men.<eos> The king noticed me, and for the first time, I mattered.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> Throw it away?<eos> Did you throw away Mary's love when you had it?
She's being a stubborn little fool.<eos> Calm down, Hunter.<eos> He didn't mean that.<eos> He cares about you, Beth.<eos> We all do.<eos> Get away.<eos> Where's my broomstick?<eos> Who stole my broomstick?<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> You stole it. No, I didn't.
I... I just wanted to try something new... I just... with my life.<eos> You know, try something different.<eos> You did it to get close to Stevie, didn't you?<eos> What?<eos> That necklace, I've seen it before.<eos> 'Grand Central Beer?<eos> I'm no sell-out, especially not that stuff.<eos> 'It's crap! '<eos> It belonged to Stevie, didn't it?<eos> He gave it to me.
I told you, the beer company are delighted with that little clip.<eos> But there was a bigger problem than the bad press that clip might have brought you, wasn't there?<eos> Stevie, the new Stevie... .. didn't want to sell out.<eos> He was still a man of the people... .. and because of that, he refused to sign that contract.<eos> But I told you, he did.<eos> He did sign the contract.<eos> And you saw Stevie sign it?<eos> No.<eos> - Pete did.<eos> - The date on the contract indicates that Stevie signed it yesterday morning.
The problem is, apparently Dr. Devlin has an alibi.<eos> I bet someone's covering for him.<eos> Devlin's a manipulative control freak.<eos> I was watching Iron Man 3 on the flight today, and it hit me.<eos> Andrew's like Tony Stark's evil twin.<eos> All that money and power, and he uses it to crush people.<eos> I guess Devlin's not Mr. Nice Guy.<eos> Jake, the violent, abusive control freak that Connie described to you is not the man I know.<eos> He's arrogant, yes. But a murderer?<eos> I don't buy it.
I don't buy it.<eos> He's probably a sociopath.<eos> He's messing with your emotions to get what he wants.<eos> Well, maybe to get into my pants, but not to get away with murder.<eos> I'm not happy about that, either.<eos> I want you off this case.<eos> This is just eating you up.<eos> Do not turn this around on me.<eos> You are so threatened by my ex from 15 years ago that you are accusing him of murder.<eos> Because he did it.
But you see why I had to lie. I couldn't face telling you the truth.<eos> Oh, so now we're blaming me?<eos> I finally see you again after all these years, and I have to admit that I paid for company?<eos> It's embarrassing.<eos> I can think of better words than that.<eos> Exploitative, gross, illegal...<eos> Yes, yes and yes. I never should have done it.<eos> But since the divorce I just haven't met anyone that interested me.<eos> And then this guy in my squash club, he gives me a number, swears it's exactly what I need.<eos> How many times did you need it?
Don't you remember me, Hulk?<eos> I'm everything you despise about yourself.<eos> Everything you try to keep buried.<eos> Your impatience, your hatred, your unbridled fury.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I also remember you're not real.<eos> You're just a manifestation of my own fear.<eos> Ah, that's where you're once again sadly mistaken.<eos> You see, I made some improvements on General Ross's anti-gamma cannon.<eos> I used it to wrest all the negative qualities out of you and manifest them in physical form, leaving you defenseless against your own worst enemy, yourself.
And it was stored on the computer in the vault.<eos> Who else knew it was there?<eos> Ellis, no.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> Stephen.<eos> Our oldest son.<eos> He was supposed to take over the business, but...<eos> Ben had so much more ambition.<eos> Drive.<eos> I-I begged them both to run it together, but the boys didn't see eye to eye.
Dirty Harry.<eos> What the hell are we doing here?<eos> I'm showing you what you want to know.<eos> - Housekeeper.<eos> - Not this late.<eos> Shit.<eos> What the hell's that?<eos> It's what they were looking for.<eos> Emma Wilson's journal.<eos> I took it from her apartment the day of the murder.

Okay good, now once you've... entered that... wow, still working on it.<eos> You also type like a gaping dickhole.<eos> Sorry, I don't wanna mess up.<eos> Man, you are nothing like your file.<eos> All these stories about what a badass you are, but I gotta tell ya, Farooq's not seeing it.<eos> Well, in those stories, I'm probably not changing poopy diapers, so...<eos> So do you seriously not even care - what I'm doing with your mainframe?<eos> - I honestly don't.<eos> Okay, I'm going to tell you anyway.<eos> I'm using it to backdoor my state-of-the-art spyware into the CIA network, so Pakistani intelligence will know everything they do in real time. And...
- Ugh, we are...<eos> - C'mon, nothing by the drifters? The tams?<eos> The dominoes?<eos> The embers?<eos> They call this "Classic Rock."<eos> Pff, what is this, Myrtle Beach?<eos> Ray. Is this Myrtle Beach?<eos> No.<eos> And that, my dear earthlings, is the key to understanding the entire universe.<eos> Well, at least as we understand it.
Our receptionist said there were two people here to look at a painting of me.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Not at the moment.<eos> Thank you, though.<eos> So now what?<eos> Now we build a case against Mr. Brown.<eos> Did you really have to bring that back here?<eos> I hardly think the painting will be missed.<eos> Once we prove that Coleman Brown is a cold-blooded murderer, they'll probably take it down anyway.
I let him walk around with PTSD for the next six months.<eos> I offered to help, too, but we didn't get anywhere until I insisted.<eos> You find something?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's a receipt.<eos> Or at least, it was.<eos> Modern receipts are printed often with thermal ink.<eos> It helps the text appear sharp and clean.<eos> Trouble is, it fades rather quickly.<eos> Unless you heat it.
No, but he will want to create a vigorous marketplace for the animal.<eos> There is, at this moment, a bidding war happening somewhere.<eos> All we need to do is find it and win it.<eos> What's this?<eos> This is everything I could find on criminal cases involving the sale of endangered animals.<eos> There's a global marketplace for these unfortunate creatures.<eos> It's clandestine, but there must be a way to connect the buyers with the sellers.<eos> So you think there's, what, some kind of code these guys use?<eos> You know, there are people who work this stuff full-time.<eos> Don't you think they would have found it by now?
I mean, that is a problem.<eos> Nobody wants something that nasty in their head.<eos> I'd like you for one moment to consider the idea that, to the tumor, we are the problem, we are the invader.<eos> We are the danger.<eos> To the tumor, we are the cancer.<eos> And the tumor?<eos> Well, the tumor sees itself as a sweet, cute, fat-cheeked baby just trying to make its way into the world, and we want to stop it, destroy it, tear it from its happy little home like barbarians.<eos> To the tumor, we are the soulless, murderous monsters.<eos> Why do I do this?<eos> Why do I call it "baby" and talk about killing it?
It is alive.<eos> And what's it all come down to?<eos> Life... Will... Out.<eos> Grey's Anatomy 11x13 Staring at the End<eos> So, our fat-cheeked-baby tumor that's nestled in that brain, it's a creature of habit.<eos> It has the same routine day in and day out... to grow, to spread out, to take up space.<eos> That's it.<eos> At this point, our baby tumor is so enmeshed, so invasive, it's touching virtually every single brain structure.<eos> It's pushed existing tissue aside, shoved brain matter out of the way to find room for itself.<eos> How do you remove it without destroying the brain around it?
We're back!<eos> Funniest thing--<eos> Stella fell in love with this dog on our walk, just stared at it lovingly.
It wasn't anything you did.<eos> You've been the best dog I could ever have asked for, and I love you very much.<eos> So... stay away from cars... don't eat anything pointy... and be a good girl.<eos> Goodbye, Stella-Bella. Wow.<eos> I didn't think I'd get through that without crying.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Hey, dad, check out this video.<eos> It's a teacup pig playing a piano.<eos> I saw that.<eos> Andy sent it to me.
I'm so sorry that I didn't pay attention to you at all today.<eos> And now you're all crazy.<eos> Gloria, I can't find the candlesticks!<eos> Ay, don't worry.<eos> I go help you!<eos> Ay!<eos> Gloria, are you all right?<eos> My ankle!<eos> Why is Joe's toy here?<eos> - Oh, gee, you really twisted it, huh?
Are you having any fun? _<eos> Uh...<eos> Yeah. You know, it's a little windy, but, eh. _<eos> So, you're okay with me cutting Luke's hair, right?<eos> - Hey, mom.<eos> - Well, hello.<eos> It's nice to know you're not dead in an alley somewhere.<eos> Right back at you.<eos> Yes, I am fine with you cutting his hair.<eos> Just don't leave it too long on the sides.
You are so right.<eos> I'm sorry that I let myself get distracted by my job.<eos> Okay, I'm looking for sweet and salty, Claire, not bitter. _<eos> Relax, Cam.<eos> I'm sure there's a kiosk around here that sells it.<eos> Good.<eos> Guys, listen, yesterday, did Haley mention where she was gonna go after she babysat for Lily?<eos> No, but when you do talk to her, can you tell her to please be careful with my powder-blue suit that Cam let her borrow without asking me?<eos> Why did she want a suit?<eos> A friend of hers needs it for a wedding, and Mitchell needs to stop dressing like he's in a barbershop quartet.
So, you have no idea where Haley is right now?<eos> You mean spiritually, geographically?<eos> Can you please stop spinning that sign?<eos> No.<eos> My boss says if I do, he'll replace me with one of those guys!<eos> Go back to where you came from!<eos> Dylan, focus!<eos> I don't know where she is, but I can sense that she's okay.<eos> It's like we share the same brain.<eos> Who has it now?
Come in, I'm almost ready.<eos> He's just here for a routine visit, isn't he?<eos> According to Antoine's letter, yes.<eos> He wanted to extend the peace treaty between France and Navarre.<eos> Could have done it through diplomats, but he hasn't been here for years, and now that I'm king, I suppose he wants to pay me a visit.<eos> What's this?<eos> A map?<eos> There's an enclave of the Loire Valley.<eos> The hills there have the lushest orchards and vineyards in the realm.<eos> The poet Marot calls it the Eden of France.
Oh, I was Freddie Mercury in a Queen cover band, but, uh, then I got demoted to Brian May.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm thrilled for your musical career and everything, but, uh, we got no way of knowing that this is you.<eos> I mean, we gotta be careful here.<eos> This is one of them, uh, highly sensitive joints.<eos> It'll take me weeks to grow that mustache back.<eos> Or years, to get a new badge!<eos> Yeah, well, that's your problem, ain't it?<eos> You will see us again, in God knows when.<eos> Young man, how do you fit such brilliance into such an ugly, ethnic head?<eos> Well, if you own a bar, you either keep it clean or learn to deal with inspectors.
For the cause.<eos> Joanna...<eos> Please.<eos> I want to help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> As soon as...<eos> Was that...?<eos> Joanna, did I just see that woman take money?<eos> We don't need it.
He is here...<eos> In us, with us.<eos> So why?<eos> So, the temple is...?<eos> Part of the old law, which is now been completed.<eos> We are still Jews, Saul.<eos> The temple is an important part of our lives.<eos> We have message to preach, James.<eos> But it has nothing to do with that pile of stones.<eos> You would just abandon it?
There are levels.<eos> I'm surprised you haven't encountered others in your era.<eos> Really... Tonight we have but one mission.<eos> To return to Fredericks Manor and put the world back the way it was meant to be.<eos> Ichabod.<eos> Ready the horses.<eos> We're going to Fredericks Manor.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You made a plan.<eos> We figured it out.
♪ Men. ♪ Okay, here it is.<eos> This is Louis' first science fair project.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> Louis made this all by himself.<eos> Last time I was here, he got the straw from his juice box stuck in his nose.<eos> He also got it unstuck.<eos> Uh, check it out.<eos> So, uh, so we'll take a piece of bread, all right?<eos> Put it in the mouth, where the saliva will start to dissolve the bread.
Maybe he got some off the table when i wasn't looking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I brought you meatloaf.<eos> Your phone.<eos> Who is it?<eos> No one.<eos> J-- just peter at work drunk texting, go to sleep.<eos> Shit.<eos> What's his problem?<eos> I don't know, i'm gonna tell him to knock it off.
How could she die like this?<eos> If you can think of anything else, please give us a call.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, if his car broke down, he'd need a new one.<eos> Must have been in a hurry, otherwise why didn't he get a tow truck?<eos> Maybe the car was stolen.<eos> Either way, his car broke down.<eos> He had to walk.<eos> Then his car must still be out there.<eos> Unless he was just using it as an excuse to get into the house.
Hey, female driver picked up a hitchhiker.<eos> He looked sick like he needed help.<eos> She was taking him to the hospital when he attacked her.<eos> Hi, Monroe.<eos> Sergeant.<eos> Monroe knows a thing or two about the Varme Tyv.<eos> Varme Tyv, is that what we're dealing with here?<eos> We think.<eos> From what I know about Varme Tyv, they need body heat.<eos> This is what happens when they don't get it.
Afghan politicians exploited this ruthlessly.<eos> The Prime Minister, Mohammed Daoud, spent his time travelling the world playing the countries<eos> - Russia, America and China - off against each other.<eos> Daoud wanted to use the modernization as a way of consolidating his power.<eos> Afghanistan was a fragmented country.<eos> Power was divided between ethnic groups and tribes.<eos> Daoud was a Pashtun and he saw how the dam project in Helmand could be used to consolidate the Pashtun grip on the whole country.<eos> He persuaded the Americans to make the project even bigger, to turn it into a giant piece of social engineering.<eos> Thousands of Pashtun nomads, who spent their time roaming the border area with Pakistan, would be settled in the new farmland created by the dams.<eos> Daoud presented it as just another innocent piece of modernisation - and the Americans happily agreed.
And any idea of transforming Afghanistan began to slip away, and the Russians retreated into the cities.<eos> Comrade General, what is the military situation in the country?<eos> But the rebels came into the cities and began to kill the Russian civilians.<eos> They hid bombs in everyday objects that exploded the moment anyone used them.<eos> Everything around the Russians became frightening and unstable.<eos> The forces that they had unleashed were pursuing them and as they did so they began to eat away at the very foundations of Soviet communism.<eos> One of the bravest and most honest of the Russian journalists in Afghanistan was Artyom Borovik.<eos> He wrote, "We thought that we were civilising a backwards country "by exposing it to television, to modern bombers, to schools, "to the latest models of tanks,<eos> "to books, to long-range artillery, "to newspapers, to economic aid, to AK-47s.<eos> "But we rarely stopped to think how Afghanistan would influence us, "despite the hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers, diplomats, "journalists and political advisers who passed through it.

They presented their local group conflict, their civil war between groups that had been going on for 35 years.<eos> They presented everything in that dynamic.<eos> So they came to us and said, "Those people over there are Taliban."<eos> And we went, "OK." And we went off and dealt with them.<eos> But, actually, we were dealing with their previous enemies.<eos> So we were just creating more enemies for ourselves.<eos> And you ended up in a downward spiral where, because everyone was manipulating us, we ended up fighting everyone.<eos> And then, in return, everyone who fought us immediately became Taliban.<eos> The way that we decided whether you were Taliban or not was whether you were firing at us.<eos> Post 2001, whereas we've understood the conflict as good/bad, black/white, government/Taliban, they've understood it as a shifting mosaic of different groups and leaders fighting each other, effectively over power.
Now, that's a thing, but it ain't Fallujah.<eos> I'm just curious how it looked to you.<eos> Well, a lot of guys don't sleep, temper's on a hair-trigger, usually they're having flashbacks, they're hyper-vigilant.<eos> I got a buddy, can't drive anymore.<eos> Thinks every piece of trash he sees lying in the gutter is hiding an IED.<eos> Yeah, there's not much you can do, besides be there for them.<eos> You can try to get them help, but they're not gonna talk until they're ready, so...<eos> But just so we're crystal clear here, sir, I don't have...<eos> Oh, I... I trust you.<eos> Hey, listen, the job is yours if you want it.
Uh, the whole point of flipping your humanity switch is that you don't care how you leave things.<eos> I go to school here, Enzo.<eos> I want to keep going to school here, and the second that I draw any suspicions-- break-ins, broken property, dead bodies-- people will try to interrupt my routine.<eos> Then I will end up rotting in a cell somewhere instead of I should be doing, which is preparing for my audition tomorrow.<eos> You, Caroline Forbes, vampire without humanity, auditioning for the school play?<eos> Musical.<eos> And obviously, duh.<eos> I'm a drama major.<eos> And what are you doing here?<eos> Find my phone led me here, though it didn't explain why your sticky fingers needed it last night.
A pair of swim trunks covered in shit.<eos> Ew. - Any idea who these belong to?<eos> - No.<eos> That's weird, because the name tag says "Kevin Appleblatt" on it!<eos> - Yeah, you pants-shitting liar!<eos> - It wasn't me!<eos> I swear. - Oh, really, Kevin?<eos> Can you explain to everyone here how your bathing suit ended up in the woods with shit all over it if you didn't do it?<eos> - Someone must have stolen it.<eos> Hmm. I don't know, but someone obviously stole it and took a shit in it.
- No.<eos> That's weird, because the name tag says "Kevin Appleblatt" on it!<eos> - Yeah, you pants-shitting liar!<eos> - It wasn't me!<eos> I swear. - Oh, really, Kevin?<eos> Can you explain to everyone here how your bathing suit ended up in the woods with shit all over it if you didn't do it?<eos> - Someone must have stolen it.<eos> Hmm.

You've always regarded women as disposable...<eos> What?<eos> You're going to put me on trial for gallantry?<eos> I didn't know it was a crime to spend time with a willing lover.<eos> It is when that lover is your sister.<eos> My family has served the King of England for generations.<eos> I have been at the side of Henry since I was a boy.<eos> I love him like a brother.<eos> I would never forget my honour, never...<eos> Do you want me to write it on the wall for you, Norris?
- Mom.<eos> - Ugh, all right, I'll go.<eos> You don't have to ask me twice.<eos> - Hey. - Oh!<eos> Look who's here.<eos> Another one of your wonderful life choices.<eos> Wow. Bad time?<eos> Well, there's always something.<eos> What's up?<eos> You left the Bartlett file on your desk, so I thought you might need it.
He's like this mythical beast in a bunk.<eos> It sounds like a great story, but save it for the article.<eos> And hey, word of warning, don't get too close.<eos> Too close?<eos> I didn't know it then, but I would become closer to this story than I ever imagined.<eos> Phone's for emergencies only, young lady.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Uh, that was an emergency.<eos> I, um... forgot... my diaphragm, so...<eos> My dad's gonna send it to me.
Been slamming my head against the wall on this song for years.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> I just can't crack it.<eos> Try this.<eos> - Oh, yeah. - You hear it?<eos> - I hear it.<eos> Two minutes!<eos> Thank you, two minutes!<eos> Listen, Andy, have you seen my glitter vest?<eos> Because I can't find it anywhere.
Who's gonna answer me?<eos> Who speaks for the government?<eos> Is that...<eos> It's President Reagan.<eos> Who?<eos> I may be the most powerful person in the modern world, but there's one thing I've never been able to conquer, and that is freedom of press.<eos> Yes.<eos> Let's turn the trucks around.<eos> What about the toxic sludge?<eos> The judge ordered Martinson to clean it up, but he didn't!
- Yes, it's a problem. People accept that possibility as truth, just like 13 years ago.<eos> Why are you bringing up things from 13 years ago?<eos> Was it this kind of pathetic evidence you used to destroy an innocent family?<eos> So, why don't you at least support your argument with some pathetic evidence?<eos> Don't just support him because he is your friend. Be a real reporter...<eos> and get some evidence to dispute it.<eos> I will have that evidence for you.<eos> I will find evidence that Ahn Chan Soo is not at fault.<eos> An innocent life will not be destroyed again like it was 13 years ago.<eos> The flow of the story that you are trying to alter... I will set it back on its rightful path.
I took down the license plate so let's find it together.<eos> We can help Chan Soo. You can stop now.<eos> We found that black box and the time that was edited out.<eos> Really? You thought of it too?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> You should've told me quickly.<eos> Why did you turn off your cell phone?<eos> Oh... I didn't have time to charge it because I was out all day.<eos> Why are you getting angry?<eos> Now that we have it, you should go home.
I'm going to the Administrative Office.<eos> Dal Po, when we get out, don't go home. You're coming with us.<eos> - No, it okay.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> - It is necessary. The doctor said if you use your arm, you could make it much worse.<eos> - Stay with us for now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - The culprit, has he been caught?<eos> - Yes. You remember the bus driver suicide story, right?<eos> - The bus company owner's son did it.
We can't just sit back and do nothing as they do this to her.<eos> What?<eos> No, it's nothing.<eos> This is the first time I've ever seen you sleeping at the office like this.<eos> Yes, I've never slept on the job before.<eos> You're not ill or anything, are you?<eos> I'm just sleepy.<eos> I've suffered from insomnia for the past 15 years, and haven't had a full night's sleep but I think my lack of sleep from all those years is catching up to me.<eos> I saw the announcement bulletin from the HR Department.<eos> Yeah, I saw it, too.
What were you just looking at?<eos> Uh, nothing.<eos> Wasn't nothing.<eos> You had a face.<eos> No face.<eos> Yes face.<eos> Total face.<eos> What were you saying about Maggie's apartment?<eos> Her neighbor says that she was seeing someone.<eos> She kept it from the boys for two reasons.
Let me guess.<eos> PCP is on the list.<eos> Bull here Monday?<eos> Monday.<eos> Yeah, I think.<eos> Know what time he left?<eos> I thought he was here all day.<eos> I can't be sure; guys punch each other out, but we got CCTV.<eos> Can we see the video?<eos> Sure, we got it.
Know the family?<eos> Johanssons?<eos> Yeah, good people.<eos> Been fishing the local area for years.<eos> Did the Johanssons have anything to do with Paul Pagent?<eos> Why?<eos> Is there some link to Janet's murder?<eos> That's what I'm trying to find out.<eos> I can't believe that prick's still walking around.<eos> He did it, 100%.
On our last night, we went to a bar for a few drinks and then Karly saw someone she knew and that was it.<eos> I didn't see her after that.<eos> What bar?<eos> CCTV footage from a bar called The Cave.<eos> Romain's story checks out. He and Karly are seen here.<eos> Then Karly and Indiana find a table in the corner and sit talking for hours.<eos> And now one's at intensive care and the other's on a slab at the morgue.<eos> What did you talk about?<eos> Got an ex-foster-girl in hospital, the victim of a hit-and-run, a dead young mother who didn't have an enemy in the world, and a cold murder case possibly linking the three together.<eos> You'll figure it out.
How'd you end up there?<eos> It was Senior's Hail Mary, trying to straighten me out after six boarding schools in four years.<eos> It just doesn't really jibe with my mental picture of Tony at 17.<eos> You must have hated it, the pomp and circumstance.<eos> Hey, look at this.<eos> This looks like some kind of tarp.<eos> Might've been used to wrap the body up.<eos> I got tire tracks over here.<eos> Tire tracks.<eos> So let's say the killer used this access road, dragged the body up to where we found it...
The track is from a tread used exclusively in the 1970s on various European cars.<eos> Could a tire manufactured in the '70s still be operational today?<eos> No, but a replica could.<eos> This is a custom job made to resemble the original tire of... a 1972 Citroen DS.<eos> DiNozzo!<eos> I just got a very angry call from Cadet Craig's father.<eos> You can't be interrogating one of my students without letting me know.<eos> And why are you looking at my car?<eos> Coach, will you open the trunk, please?<eos> Or I'll get a warrant and break it open.
- I let the kids down, I let you down.<eos> For what it's worth, I am proud of the man you've become.<eos> You okay?<eos> Never better.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> It's a photo of a photo but... you should keep it.<eos> It's the past, Bishop.<eos> It's your past, Tony, and it's a good one.<eos> I have a tricky relationship with the past.<eos> I either bury it... or fixate on it.
Well, if it isn't Jake Molloy!<eos> Look at you!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Yeah, I'm-I'm, I'm sorry.<eos> Closed-door meetings at NSA all day long.<eos> I mean, I would've called but, uh--<eos> But Gibbs had your phone? Yeah.<eos> I left it in the diner last night.
Look at you!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Yeah, I'm-I'm, I'm sorry.<eos> Closed-door meetings at NSA all day long.<eos> I mean, I would've called but, uh--<eos> But Gibbs had your phone? Yeah.<eos> I left it in the diner last night.<eos> He said he'd leave it here and I could pick it up.
Can I get a lift? Sure.<eos> Hop in.<eos> - Dude!<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Glad I'm not the only one that happens to.<eos> A couple of weeks ago, after you left the party with the twins, these Scandinavian girls showed up...<eos> Make a left here.<eos> From Denmark or Sweden...<eos> They were really tall!<eos> So I was driving them to my dad's boat. I'm using it while I work for him... So far so good, up to that point.
Alex.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - Finish clearing the table.<eos> - Yes, in a minute!<eos> Can you look what you're doing?<eos> Things got complicated. We had no option, Alex.<eos> That boy wasn't fooled by your act, in the car.<eos> He lost it.<eos> We asked him to calm down.<eos> Told him it was in his interest to shut up, otherwise we'd shut it for him. That only made it worse.
If my intervention was successful, and a deal was closed, I'd get a commission.<eos> I put them in contact, negotiations went ahead...<eos> But in the end, I never got a penny.<eos> After that, it happened again.<eos> With a petrochemical company this time.<eos> Once again, I was just tossed aside.<eos> Those deals were closed thanks to me.<eos> Do you know what I'm saying?<eos> These are the bastards who are bringing this country down.<eos> Who've sold it down the river.
How am I meant to sleep?<eos> How can anyone sleep at a time like this?<eos> I slept.<eos> Like a log.<eos> How?<eos> There is a massive rock headed this way!<eos> I know, which is why I'm writing my bucket list!<eos> How do you spell Minaj?<eos> What have you done with my passport?<eos> Look, I confiscated it.
He's young, he's fresh...<eos> He's been dead 50 years.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't care what you people think.<eos> If I did, I wouldn't have a back tattoo of Jon Bon Jovi riding a unicorn.<eos> Never thought I'd have to say this, but, mom, please wash that mustache off my baby.<eos> (Scoffs) Fine.<eos> But I don't see what you're so worried about.<eos> I mean, it's not like it's... permanent.<eos> - Oh, you get that off my baby right now!<eos> - I will get it off!
All right.<eos> God damn it!<eos> Was I not appointed to lead all Texian forces as commander in chief?<eos> - Was I?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Then why didn't they obey my order to abandon the Alamo?<eos> I should have gone in myself.<eos> We can't let this sacrifice be in vain.<eos> Their precious blood bought us precious time.<eos> Let us not squander it.
Just saying my bon voyages.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Gonna be a place in heaven for you, boys.<eos> We just can't turn our backs soon enough on this place.<eos> Few more supplies, and we'll vamoose.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> Kit.<eos> Guess it's now or never.<eos> Got this metal off a dead Mexican who tried to gut me.<eos> Melted it down to this.
Subtitles by DramaFever<eos> [NEW PRESENTS]<eos> We're your average high school friends who swore to a lifetime of friendship.<eos> Even though it wasn't under any special circumstances where our friendship began it was still special to us in our own way.<eos> Ahem... ahem. Ahem...<eos> [MEET ME IN THE SCHOOL BACKYARD.]<eos> - Did you fondle So Min's chest?<eos> - No.<eos> I didn't fondle her chest, but I just stood there and touched it.
- You should eat, too.<eos> - I already ate.<eos> But you should still eat.<eos> I'll go out and get more.<eos> It's okay, I like chicken better.<eos> Why do you keep changing your mind?<eos> I used up all the money I had to buy that!<eos> Duck is expensive!<eos> It's more expensive than chicken!<eos> I bought it for you, so have some!
Then there are those men who are there to console, and only to console those heartbroken women.<eos> Those are the good guys, or shall I say, brainless idiots?<eos> And I'm one of them.<eos> Jin Joo left for the land of the cold with the man she loved.<eos> But I'm sure she's receiving warmer treatment there than she would here.<eos> Right here... it aches right here.<eos> Do you know what that feels like?<eos> Take a look, So Joong.<eos> - Isn't my chest all red?<eos> - It's because you've been rubbing it.
You're sucked into the story, aren't you?<eos> Since then, men became obsessed with sex, and they kept on doing it.<eos> They couldn't stop!<eos> After centuries of peace living that way. The aliens of Planet Penis are in danger of extinction just like their ancestors foretold.<eos> Their birthrate plummeted.<eos> So they end up invading Earth to retrieve their comrades?<eos> Bingo!<eos> It's not really retrieving.<eos> Technically, they came to reclaim what was already theirs.<eos> But would you hand over your dick if they asked for it back?
What's the layout of their place?<eos> Same as this one.<eos> The satellite dish outside the window is actually one of our parabolic mics. They're back.<eos> It's a woman.<eos> It's their cleaning lady, Fana.<eos> Yeah, she's speaking Yoruba.<eos> It's a Western Nigerian dialect.<eos> She's talking to her mother.<eos> Did you get the money that I sent?<eos> Yes, we used it all to buy rice.
No, I actually think this might be, um...<eos> - [door clicks]<eos> - Where you at? All right, listen up, everybody.<eos> - I have some good news.<eos> - What, did you mute it? 'Cause Jillian was so frugal with all of our office supplies, we have a little-- well, actually, a pretty big budget surplus.<eos> Erasable pens save on Wite-Out.<eos> You guys all read that article I sent, right?<eos> - Mm-mm. - No. The one I wrote?<eos> - Nobody read that, Jillian.<eos> - That's great. All right, so if we don't spend it, corporate's gonna slash next year's budget, so I've decided I'm gonna throw us a little office party.
Hey, you see this?<eos> Still got "teriyoki" on my fingers.<eos> - [gasps] - What the--<eos> It's Blake.<eos> He's here.<eos> [cell phone jingling] - You're on speakerphone. - [laughing]<eos> - What's up?<eos> Adam's here. - It's Adam and Ders.<eos> And listen up, okay?<eos> It's Menergy's big day, and you are ruining it, because you're freaking our crowd out.
Oh, you always know when I've had sex.<eos> What gave it away?<eos> The bounce in my step or the glow in my cheek?<eos> No, it's probably the, uh, text I got from you that said,<eos> "Guess why I can't see my penis right now."<eos> I was bored.<eos> So, uh, how was your little talk with Ms. McMartin?<eos> You know, about that whole situation-- you and her--<eos> I just... you know, maybe I just judged you too harshly.<eos> No, no, I was... I deserved it.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> And it lit a fire in him that made this one seem a feeble candle.<eos> He left saying he was going to find Woodhull and get justice.<eos> Well, he... he never came to visit me while I was in prison.<eos> Well, he said he was going to send you a message that only you can read.<eos> He used the ink.<eos> He used the ink.<eos> Oh, Robert.<eos> Well, all right, how do we read it?
I confess that is not all I hope for.<eos> No?<eos> I have long carried a memory of you as a budding, lively young girl.<eos> But the woman I saw in the carriage... the woman who now stands before me, you have bloomed, become a vision.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I am no poet.<eos> Merely a warrior.<eos> A warrior whose wounds have made him question a life devoted solely to the quest for glory.<eos> But your letters have shown me a different path.<eos> And now the sight of you only affirms it.
Sergeant Hickey.<eos> Thank you, Benjamin.<eos> No, thank Brewster and Townsend.<eos> And Woody...<eos> I mean, Woodhull, sir.<eos> So, 7-2-1, do you trust the integrity of the Culper ring, then?<eos> With my life, sir, and yours.<eos> As you said, secrecy is the key to security.<eos> As long as the ring is secret, it is secure.<eos> I'll be taking it back now, if you don't mind.
What are you doing here?<eos> Well, um, I'm here to, um, prepare the room for the next acting mayor, and these are the decorators.<eos> Yes, I'm a decorator, you handsome guy, you.<eos> You're gay?<eos> I thought I just heard you talking about kissing her.<eos> Well, I'm straight for Joy.<eos> I'm just gay for design.<eos> We became a couple last night, but we haven't had our first kiss yet.<eos> You don't plan your first kiss.<eos> You take it.
I'd love to hear it one day.<eos> Well, I did it.<eos> By drugging my boyfriend with estrogen, I have created the perfect man.<eos> He's empathetic, he wants to talk about his feelings, and he even noticed my new bag.<eos> What?<eos> No, sometimes they notice shoes, but never the bag.<eos> Elka, what's wrong?<eos> Oh, George Clooney is upset.<eos> His little Bob doll is missing.<eos> I told you I was gonna give it to a kids charity.
Bob's not missing.<eos> Although he never did call me back.<eos> Oh, no, five texts from Bob's brother.<eos> Bob's gone missing.<eos> He went maple tree tapping in the woods and hasn't come back.<eos> They found his little bucket, but no Bob.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What if the voodoo is real?<eos> I've got to get that doll back.<eos> Melanie, what kids charity did you give it to?
He went maple tree tapping in the woods and hasn't come back.<eos> They found his little bucket, but no Bob.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What if the voodoo is real?<eos> I've got to get that doll back.<eos> Melanie, what kids charity did you give it to?<eos> I... I kind of threw it in the trash.<eos> What?<eos> How could you?<eos> You said you were gonna give it to a kids charity.
Don't call me.<eos> Don't text me.<eos> It's over.<eos> And don't watch me while I'm walking out the door.<eos> My ass is huge.<eos> Thanks again for helping me search for the Bob doll.<eos> They've sent the mounties out looking for Bob, but so far, nothing.<eos> Joy, I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll find it.
And Bob.<eos> I can see that.<eos> I just came by to introduce you to Reverend Matsuta, who will be officiating our wedding.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> So typical of Simon to appear without any warning.<eos> Well, the good news is, Simon showing up makes anything else that might go wrong seem so small.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Okay, you know my job was to pick up the wedding ring, and, well, you know how parrots are attracted to shiny things?<eos> Barry ate the ring?<eos> We're never gonna get it back.
I mean, damn him! Thank you, Officer.<eos> What were we thinking?<eos> First rule of running a business: security cameras are for security, not for making your ass look great.<eos> One day, science will invent a camera that does both.<eos> But for now, we should do what we should have done in the first place... Fire Nicky.<eos> All right.<eos> (Melanie) Uh, Nicky?<eos> Can we talk to you, please?<eos> Hey, I'm so sorry about the robbery.<eos> Do you have any idea who did it?
- Squirt.<eos> - Slap.<eos> - Dump.<eos> - Squirt.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?<eos> Really?<eos> Now, Melanie?<eos> - Slap. - Dump.<eos> Oh, shoot, I dropped the crab.<eos> George Clooney got it.
Marmite?<eos> It's a healthful yeast by-product.<eos> Rejoyla loves it.<eos> No, I don't really like it.<eos> You don't know what you like.<eos> Why are you still in bed?<eos> Well, the procedure was just a few hours ago.<eos> The doctor said she should rest.<eos> Oh, rubbish.<eos> When I got rid of my sixth toe, I simply wrapped a rubber band around it until it fell off like a lamb's tail.
~ Good.<eos> A lot of people would be surprised to find that you were<eos> ~ actually born in London, weren't you?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> I was born in Paddington.<eos> In fact, there was a very funny moment.<eos> I was doing a documentary with a friend.<eos> He was following with a camera, and I said,<eos> "St Mary's hospital is right down here.<eos> "That's where I was born." And as I was showing it to him, a wrecking ball came out of nowhere and just knocked it down and, apparently, they were moving it across the street.
Barefoot, down "Needle Alley"?<eos> Man, Kenyans run barefoot.<eos> You said someone got hurt.<eos> You were raving about "flesh and blood and viscera."<eos> It's runner's high.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, I don't know what "viscera" is.<eos> Tell us where you scored.<eos> Lots of kids buying in that hood.<eos> We clean it up, you come out a hero.
No, you can't get your knife back.<eos> They say it's not connected.<eos> They say that, but I don't believe them.<eos> It is. From reports in five states.<eos> They don't know if it's a virus or a microbe.<eos> They don't know, but it's spreading.<eos> - You need to...<eos> - No, people are killing.<eos> You need to spend less time online, okay?<eos> If... if there's a problem, we're gonna know about it.
Madam President's former staff is here.<eos> We'll be with them shortly.<eos> And, Lucy, you don't have to call her that.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> The protocol is confusing.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Send Colonel Preston in, please.<eos> If it's any consolation, I'm not enjoying this.<eos> In addition to everything else, one of my oldest friends might be dead.<eos> Why don't we get through it with as little snark
Last I checked, Russia's pretty far away.<eos> There's Russian soil here in L.A. The Russian consulate.<eos> - Yeah, Happy, can...?<eos> - Yes, I can.<eos> Cabe, give me the keys to the SUV.<eos> You guys prep, we'll be back soon. Uh...<eos> And I will need this, too.<eos> Do you really think this will work?<eos> It sends a signal to unlock a car.<eos> I'm just reversing it to receive a signal.
It was carrying enough plutonium to operate a laser system that could be used as a weapon, so they directed a dummy satellite to strike it and disrupt its orbit.<eos> It was kept hush-hush 'cause we violated the space-warfare treaty.<eos> If the Russians found out, it could be all-out war.<eos> Yeah, the satellites must have gotten intertwined, the mass was much larger than we thought.<eos> - The missile never had a chance.<eos> - I just hacked NORAD, and I got the specs for the dummy satellite.<eos> I am now recalculating flight dynamics, considering the massive shifts in center of mass, aerodynamic drag profile and the complete modification of angular acceleration.<eos> Impact is in 53 minutes and it's headed straight for Pasadena.<eos> With that mass, the satellite's too close to the Earth to be safely destroyed.<eos> We hit it now, it's nuclear winter.
Everyone to the roof.<eos> We'll be airborne in ten minutes.<eos> Wait, guys!<eos> Guys, the reason why we can't communicate with the satellite is because it's too far away for its damaged system to connect with RAC on Earth.<eos> We just need another way of talking to it.<eos> The unmanned X-24G spacecraft.<eos> Whoa! That's a top secret spy shuttle.<eos> How do you even know about that?<eos> That jet's the worst kept secret in the Air Force.<eos> Multiple blogs follow it.
You'd got there.<eos> You were ready.<eos> Yeah, and then all the bad stuff started happening.<eos> Because of the work you did, it means you were prepared for the bad things.<eos> Look, you might wish to continue with therapy, but you can go to Bristol, trust me. Oh.<eos> If you don't believe me, look in your diary.<eos> - The diary doesn't work.<eos> - I disagree.<eos> It's all in there, Rae.<eos> I mean, I've never read it myself, but I know the ending.
Maybe my illness wasn't a problem.<eos> Maybe it was just something I needed to learn to live with.<eos> Being brave isn't about never being afraid.<eos> It's about what you do when you are.<eos> Whether you can keep your head.<eos> Whether you do the right thing.<eos> In the spring, I was admitted to a mental home, because I kept trying to hurt myself.<eos> If I was to ask one of your friends what they liked about you,<eos> - what do you think they would say?<eos> - Our group of friends was... was nothing until you sprayed Rae all over it.
As in... racy. Oh, OK.<eos> Perfect.<eos> That's the look I normally go for. Oh!<eos> - OK.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - Here you are, then.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> The leavers' ball wasn't exactly top of my to-do list, especially without Finn...<eos> ... but I had to show Mum I was on the mend.<eos> Bought it when I was 30.
- Oh, good.<eos> - Here you are, then.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> The leavers' ball wasn't exactly top of my to-do list, especially without Finn...<eos> ... but I had to show Mum I was on the mend.<eos> Bought it when I was 30.<eos> When I was, and don't bite my head off, I was a couple of sizes bigger.<eos> I never... quite had the confidence to wear it out.<eos> Oh, Rae.<eos> I'll wear it.
No, I was fine.<eos> It was you.<eos> Are you gonna go get ready, then?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And can I borrow some eyeliner or something?<eos> - Yeah, I'll do your make-up.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Izzy, what's happened to your arm?<eos> Oh, it's better now.<eos> I'll take it off in a minute.
She knows we all do.<eos> Excuse me, secretary mccord.<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I can say the same of you.<eos> (laughs) please.<eos> Should I assume since you're here that the coup has failed?<eos> Yes.<eos> In part because of the information Your government provided.<eos> If you hadn't come,<eos> We might have assumed the United States backed it.
- Oh, well done.<eos> - Where's Bertie staying?<eos> - With his mother, at Castle Howard.<eos> - We should have asked him for dinner.<eos> - Unlucky, so we won't risk that.<eos> - Where's Cora?<eos> - Gone to the wretched hospital.<eos> - Why don't you like her going?<eos> - They take advantage of her good nature.<eos> - But she enjoys it.
What I need to reassure you about is that nothing really is going to change on a day-to-day basis.<eos> As you all know, that doesn't happen in a hospital where we are!<eos> What is it?<eos> It reminds me of when she ran the house as a convalescent home during the war.<eos> Do you still think they're taking advantage of her?<eos> If you want to keep her, Robert, you must let her go.<eos> I'm not very good at those American slogans.<eos> Then forget the slogan and listen to this.<eos> You have a wonderful marriage and with my parents, I should know.<eos> Don't spoil it now by asking her to choose.
- I daresay she'll need one.<eos> But her maid is giving birth in her bedroom.<eos> How very modern!<eos> - It wasn't exactly planned.<eos> - Which of our lives is?<eos> I should go up.<eos> Ooh, one for me.<eos> He's nice.<eos> Well, I wish you luck with the business.<eos> Though you won't need it, of course.
Well, no, being true makes it true.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll let you roll again, see what you get.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, Axl, what is going on?<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Oh, please!<eos> You didn't shoot any straws at me at the restaurant.<eos> You didn't lick my bread and then put it back on my plate.
Much nicer than the one you had in your employee of the month photo.<eos> What is that, a Rolex?<eos> How much did that cost you?<eos> Those things are expensive.<eos> This was a gift.<eos> Fancy.<eos> You want to know something cool?<eos> My partner here, he's a tech whiz, right?<eos> I, uh, am.<eos> He could look at your surveillance stuff, and he could tell you if someone had tampered with it like that.
Hey, Lieu, you got a new girlfriend?<eos> All right.<eos> That's a new necklace you're wearing there, Denny.<eos> Never seen you wear that one before.<eos> Oh, yeah, I just... This is a friend's.<eos> You're wearing your friend's necklace?<eos> He means girlfriend.<eos> I mean, it's not that defined... yet.<eos> Eh, defined enough that you're wearing her necklace.<eos> She asked me to wear it, okay?
She can really sell it, can't she?<eos> She wouldn't lie to me.<eos> Oh, you seem like a generous guy.<eos> I am... with people I like.<eos> Like Stella?<eos> See, we looked into it.<eos> - You bought her a necklace?<eos> - So what?<eos> So...<eos> She gave it to Davis.
Meet Dewar Linden, Manhattan real estate gazillionaire.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How many zeroes are there in a gazillion?<eos> Enough that we need to tread lightly.<eos> So what do we have, other than a slugfest between a couple of rich white guys?<eos> Our dead architect just dropped out of Linden's latest tower downtown and it looks like he bailed because of a disagreement over an earlier project.<eos> The Sicilian Atlantic City.<eos> Bro, this place opened, like, a month ago.<eos> - I've been dying to go there.<eos> - You know, in my vast experience, most people who kill for money are the ones who already have it.
No, no, just keep going.<eos> (sighs)<eos> I was thinking, we should talk (phone buzzes) about having a...<eos> This isn't fun for me, watching you text.<eos> No, no, this is great. Mm, mm, mm. Yum.<eos> But I-I got to go.<eos> I have a date.<eos> This is serious, Rupert.<eos> I'm losing him.<eos> If we're going to fix this relationship, we need a baby and we need it now.
- I'll make you some tea.<eos> - No, no, I'm fine.<eos> Guys.<eos> I just have been giving too many speeches.<eos> Look, we're entering the home stretch.<eos> We're a week away from election day, and you and Prady are neck and neck.<eos> So this interview today, it's everything.<eos> You have a great bedside manner. "Don't worry about it, but if you screw this up, everyone will die."<eos> If you get the editorial board's endorsement, traditionally speaking, that's two points in the polls.<eos> Now, you need it and he needs it.
- No, no, I'm fine.<eos> Guys.<eos> I just have been giving too many speeches.<eos> Look, we're entering the home stretch.<eos> We're a week away from election day, and you and Prady are neck and neck.<eos> So this interview today, it's everything.<eos> You have a great bedside manner. "Don't worry about it, but if you screw this up, everyone will die."<eos> If you get the editorial board's endorsement, traditionally speaking, that's two points in the polls.<eos> Now, you need it and he needs it.<eos> So whoever gets it wins, you understand?
Stop the clock.<eos> We're here, and we have the solution.<eos> First, you weigh six versus six.<eos> Wrong. That'll never work.<eos> You just wasted your time and mine.<eos> I just captured the exact moment when you realized you had failed.<eos> I guess we all got something out of this.<eos> (Holt) So that's it?<eos> This problem is beyond all of you?<eos> No one solved it.
(Rosa) Not to your face, but to a ton of people behind your back.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> Yes.<eos> Next round's on me. It's the least I can do for teasing your brains so mercilessly.<eos> So what are you gonna say to your old c.o. tomorrow when he asks if you've solved the puzzle?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Thanks for bringing that up.<eos> Fun chat.<eos> (Gina) Just say you're a captain now, and you're busy running a precinct, so he can go suck an egg.<eos> Or we can all work together all night long, and I'm sure we can eventually figure it out.
It's just that sometimes, in this world, you just have to worry about yourself.<eos> You're worrying about someone else right now.<eos> Man, if this gifted and talented program had a debate team, you would make a great captain.<eos> Putting Henry aside, did you want to be part of the program?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It sounded really great.<eos> Then we're gonna do something about it.<eos> What can we do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't pass the test when I took it.
You know, that's why I do it.<eos> No, my... my point is that, unlike half of your drives to work, this is no accident.<eos> You should take your mailroom duties as seriously as you take your wardrobe.<eos> Okay, I have been to the post office, Josh.<eos> They do not take their wardrobe very seriously.<eos> [Knock on door] Hello.<eos> How's my favorite referee/ gifted-program coordinator?<eos> Read the sign... "no retests."<eos> Not even for my niece, who has a vague and undocumented learning disability?<eos> If we let your niece retake the test, should we let all the other kids retake it, too?
Just like you know you're on parole for that burglary charge in 2011.<eos> An assault charge could violate you back to prison.<eos> It'd be worth it, though, wouldn't it?<eos> Hurting the man who hurt Maria?<eos> The problem is, neither of us can say with any certainty that I am that man.<eos> Right.<eos> Because you don't remember.<eos> Or at least that's the story you tried to sell to my other sister.<eos> The burglary.<eos> You said you didn't do it.
What life experience was your best preparation to become a big-time D.C. speechwriter?<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh. Space camp.<eos> - (laughs):<eos> What? ! - I'm serious.<eos> I-I did it the, uh, the summer - after fifth grade. - Uh-huh.<eos> It totally inured me against all hope of respect or recognition from my peers.<eos> Uh, I wore my uniform to the first day of sixth grade.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I still have it, in fact.
Sorry, uh, Mr. Jackson would like a word.<eos> Uh, not right now.<eos> NADINE: I could reach out gently to Ambassador Dominguez.<eos> Now...<eos> C-Can you just call?<eos> Why do you never call?<eos> You mind telling me how some lunatic-fringe Bible camp just turned into a flaming pile of crap?<eos> ELIZABETH: Congressman Ames made an end run around me, but we're on it. We're just now figuring...<eos> Yeah, well, don't bother.<eos> We're turning it over to D.O.D.
I've never understood what it means.<eos> [ 1980s-style instrumental music Pritchett's Closets...<eos> Choose one of our nine luxurious models like the Monte Carlo.<eos> Or how about a custom design using our state-of-the-art technology?<eos> Come visit Pritchett's and go home with the closet of your dreams.<eos> Closet?<eos> You'll love it!<eos> The entire town went nuts for that ad.<eos> People stopped me in the street, asking me to say the slogan.<eos> Are you sure they weren't asking you to explain it?
She wasn't singing before either.<eos> Okay, go get some water.<eos> Cam.<eos> Mitchell, I just don't want her to embarrass herself in front of her friends, not to mention the parents.<eos> I can already hear Andrew's condescending, "Hmm."<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> You're still competing with Andrew.<eos> He staged a coup, Mitchell.<eos> He forced me out of the group I founded.<eos> I founded it.
- It's ridiculous.<eos> - You know what's ridiculous?<eos> Is being forced to turn in your jingle bells to a man with less vocal range than a teakettle. Hyah! Hi.<eos> Oh, I thought you had a date.<eos> I did, but I bailed.<eos> He's not exactly the sharpest shed.<eos> What is his deal?<eos> I took his pacifier hours ago, and he's still crying. He's being such a baby.<eos> Well, maybe he's just not ready to give them up.<eos> No, I promised my mother that he wouldn't use it anymore.

How much money did Marcus lose this time?<eos> He didn't lose anything.<eos> He wants to start a restaurant.<eos> He doesn't want to start shit.<eos> He owes somebody something.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> He's turned his life around.<eos> What I know is, he has a problem, and he's looking to get money from you.<eos> And you're not gonna get it from me.<eos> Then I'll get it somewhere else.
What I know is, you're either gonna help me or Charles Forstman is.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> Harvey, I can't make you listen to me, but what I'm not going to do is let you come here and leverage me with some bullshit offer from a shady banker, so do what you're gonna do.<eos> But don't say I didn't warn you.<eos> You can buy all the Wonder Bread you want, Eric, but you can't take it with you to prison.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to remind you that once they find the money, it's all gonna come tumbling down.<eos> Well, they're not gonna find the money, 'cause there is no money.<eos> Not in your accounts, but I know what Cahill doesn't.<eos> Forstman gave it to somebody you care about, and if I tell him that, it'll be too late.
A monthly ritual to remind myself.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of what a pussy Gordon Gekko is.<eos> Now, you want to tell me what changed your mind?<eos> I decided I wanted the money.<eos> And you turned me down, so now you're gonna tell me why you want the money.<eos> My brother needs $150,000 for a restaurant.<eos> Hmm. Now we're getting somewhere.<eos> Let's have it.<eos> Okay, you want it?
Ugh! You're back.<eos> Yeah, I'm back, and I'm armed with righteousness and this!<eos> The Vanquisher.<eos> I see.<eos> Yeah, go inside, Sheldon... to get your checkbook!<eos> Like her?<eos> I call her the Vanquisherer.<eos> I got it from The Hobby Hole.<eos> And then I added the extra "er"<eos> when I customized the crap out of it.
~ Oh, my God, what is she wearing?<eos> ~ I don't want to hear it.<eos> Hi.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I look like a couch.<eos> ~ A beautiful couch.<eos> ~ I'm going to take the hat off.<eos> Fran really pushed the hat, I don't like the hat.<eos> Well, I don't think you need it because I would like to look at this unencumbered.
~ A beautiful couch.<eos> ~ I'm going to take the hat off.<eos> Fran really pushed the hat, I don't like the hat.<eos> Well, I don't think you need it because I would like to look at this unencumbered.<eos> ~ Do you want to go in there?<eos> ~ Yep.<eos> (Are you OK? )<eos> (Yes.)<eos> (Good.)<eos> OK, I took it off because...
Do you have something you'd like to add?<eos> Amen.<eos> I call upon these persons here present...<eos> Actually, I would like to say something, as maid of honour, just now if that's...?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's actually a short song but I think it's very fitting.<eos> Sorry, just a second.<eos> Remember this place?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not as nice as I remember it, though.
Now, not so much. Why?<eos> Because you'd met Sabine Mason.<eos> It was the needlepoint that gave you away, Erol.<eos> Needlepoint in hand, stitching away.<eos> I know taking the money was wrong and for that...<eos> Needlepoint gave you away.<eos> "The heart sees what is invisible to the eye".<eos> But I can see, Erol.<eos> What self-respecting 52-year-old man has a needlepoint canvas in their home?<eos> 'A 52-year-old man who's been given it as a gift?
I lived most of my life here, Nina, but I never knew anyone who would do something like this.<eos> I did.<eos> They traded me, too.<eos> Back and forth.<eos> You forget what it's like to have your own life.<eos> I'm not letting them do that to me.<eos> I won't let them decide who I am.<eos> Jacob would be proud.<eos> You know my son's name?<eos> I never told it to you.
- [Are you good in bed, do you think?<eos> ] - ... but I think probably every man thinks that.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know. I'd have to ask my mates.<eos> You can go to a girl that you've had sex with, or done things with, like, and say, "Was I good?"<eos> "Yeah! Of course you were!"<eos> Just to make your ego feel a little bit better.<eos> But in, like, reality... They're just thinking...<eos> Yeah, like, "You were nowhere near it."<eos> "She's talking about lesbian sex like she's done it!"
But in, like, reality... They're just thinking...<eos> Yeah, like, "You were nowhere near it."<eos> "She's talking about lesbian sex like she's done it!"<eos> I have. I'm fucking good at it.<eos> I could do a jigsaw puzzle inside a sock.<eos> Something deeper. A little slower. A little more, "Mmm!"<eos> And when they've got that big willy out, you think, "Oof!"<eos> And then your eyes go all watery and you think, "Ooh, I don't know!"<eos> It's a bit like a drug, to be honest.<eos> Sex is a drug and it's probably one of the best drugs out there which is legal, providing you're doing it with someone of a legal age.

The best sex, I think, is when you're in love. Um... when you just fall in love.
- Go away!<eos> - Do all women dislike it when you hold their head<eos> - while you're getting a blow job?<eos> - Piss off!<eos> Jennifer Wood says...<eos> Of course it's a compliment, but he wasn't embarrassed, so I'm pretty sure it had happened before.<eos> When I first met him, he was really nice...<eos> - You enjoy sex.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um... do you think they enjoy it?
I tried to get close to someone I thought had inside information.<eos> It ended badly.<eos> Not only am I still on the market, but we have no leads to help us find her.<eos> Ms. Groves, how would you like to try your hand at stopping a gang war?<eos> It would involve determining whether the Machine is functioning properly.<eos> When do we start?<eos> Must be some kind of mistake.<eos> I just wanted the Patterson case file.<eos> Wasn't in its proper place.<eos> Found it in the primary detective's effects.
You took out a life insurance policy on Lilly.<eos> Yeah, and she took one out on me.<eos> We did it to take care of each other, just in case...<eos> Look, I already told the detective all of this.<eos> Why are you making me go through it again?<eos> Lilly found money in the hotel room, money you were hiding from her.<eos> It was for a present for her... a necklace.<eos> I told the detective that it was stolen.<eos> Diamond and sapphire.<eos> Lilly was wearing it when she was attacked, and you bought it with that envelope of cash, so now it's hard to prove it even existed.
I texted. Got nothing.<eos> Oh, you think I've been dodging you?<eos> Well, FYI, unlike Kirsten I did not take a leave of absence from the university to be a stitcher.<eos> I had an optogenetics presentation.<eos> I put myself on total lockdown to prepare.<eos> You're going with the optogenetics story?<eos> You know, "needy lover"<eos> never looks good on anyone.<eos> We hooked up, followed by radio silence.<eos> I took it as a comment on my performance.
I told you to trust me.<eos> What happened?<eos> What did you see?<eos> I think Robbie's killer.<eos> The apartment was built in 1942.<eos> There are two entrances... one in the front with a doorman and one in the back through the alley.<eos> Now the original storefront on the ground floor used to keep inventory upstairs in apartment 3C, which they used to move merchandise with a private elevator.<eos> The boutique that we saw in Kirsten'stitch... daisies and dots... that occupies the same ground floor space.<eos> Apartment 3C is leased to the same owner.<eos> But what are they using it for?
Not doing stupid exams on the Irish Civil War. Yeah.<eos> Just because it took place 70 years ago this week and changed the course of our nation? Who cares? Totally!<eos> It's a sack of nonsense.<eos> Fighting over some dorky treaty that stimulated a tug-of-war between de Valera and Michael Collins to become the voice of a new Ireland?<eos> Wait, you've been studying! What?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> We said we wouldn't study!<eos> We said we'd fail together and then just blame the whole flipping system.<eos> I wasn't studying.<eos> I just have a photographic memory. I just stared at the book for ages and ages, read it and re-read it and then somehow remembered it.
Step back.<eos> Step back.<eos> Step back.<eos> Move it, Santa Claus.<eos> Come on. Hey, Sully!<eos> Hey. Ah, ah. Oh!<eos> You going somewhere? He's going somewhere with us, aren't you, Sully?<eos> Text from Vitale?<eos> I don't even know what you're talking about.<eos> He sent it from Rikers to your number.
I got to go change.<eos> Well, I'm gonna call Axl, tell him I need him to come down here this weekend.<eos> Ask about the socks.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going?<eos> Don't forget to put your bowl in the sink.<eos> It's right there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not my bowl, it's your bowl.<eos> You bought it, so technically it's yours.<eos> You just loan it to me.
I mean, how are you supposed to shine when you're only working with three condiments?<eos> I know!<eos> I did graduate magna cum relish from hot-dog college.<eos> How does that not put me on the radar at Chop Suey U.S.A.?<eos> I didn't even think about that.<eos> Sue-y.<eos> It has my name in it.<eos> Ooh, it's like a sign!<eos> You know, I bet it's because I dropped that gallon of mustard.<eos> Everybody saw it.
I know.<eos> And I'm not liking them a hell of a lot right now.<eos> Hold on. So you didn't actually move manure?<eos> No.<eos> There was no manure.<eos> But when my dad told me to come help him move manure, I damn well ran over there to help him move some manure.<eos> I didn't say I would and then send somebody else.<eos> Was there or wasn't there manure? !<eos> There wasn't!<eos> The point is, if there was manure, I would have moved it.
You have dropped so many balls, man.<eos> Do you ever get scared Grandpa Rick might make me his new sidekick?<eos> What? ! What kind of monster are you?<eos> A competent one.<eos> Who cares about the [burps] things you guys are talking about?<eos> [burps ] the whole point of freezing time was to stop giving a fuck.<eos> Put a shirt on your dumb dad, and let's get this dumb universe rolling.<eos> Let's do this thing.<eos> All right, listen, you two.<eos> We froze time for a pretty long time, so when I un-freeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.
Don't give me that<eos> "you probably play like a girl" look, because I play like a girl who grew up with three brothers.<eos> Okay, you're on.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I know you're not here to talk about basketball.<eos> Yeah.<eos> M.E.'s office was able to get a DNA profile on the knife used in your mother's murder.<eos> It was remarkably well-preserved, apparently.<eos> The M.E. ran it through CODIS, and it got a hit.
Can you describe this hole?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> I'm done.<eos> It was too dark to see.<eos> It was black.<eos> It was always black in the hole.<eos> I know it was small... 4'9" on the east and west walls, 6'" north and south.<eos> I measured it every day.
I know the Dustbuster is Leo...<eos> Because I know Leo. Oh.<eos> So, her book is real.<eos> And he's just one chapter out of 17, which means there are 16 other real men in that book.<eos> Abby, I don't care about the 16 other men right now.<eos> I don't care about Leo.<eos> If this gets out, if the press finds out that he likes what this book says he likes, they will laugh you off the podium.<eos> Which is why I came to retain the services of Pope and Associates.<eos> I need you to stop this book.<eos> I need you to shut it down.
You used to exude it.<eos> It came out of every pore.<eos> It gave other women a contact high.<eos> So, I must admit I'm a little disappointed by your behavior towards me.<eos> I'm trying to protect you.<eos> Protect me?<eos> That's... that's awful.<eos> I thought you'd be brave.<eos> - Sue.<eos> - I thought you'd be adventurous, fearless, sexy, confident, but instead, you're just this dried-up prude who, instead of celebrating the fact that I fully own my body and use it however I want with whomever I want
So...<eos> You're not alone...<eos> Okay?<eos> you're not alone.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sign the thing.<eos> Come on.<eos> People are... Waiting.<eos> Yeah.<eos> True love... we know it when we feel it, right?
I'm not really going to the office.<eos> Don't care.<eos> Need a cigar.<eos> Based off the walk I just took, side-boob is the new butt crack.<eos> So, you want to head down front?<eos> Alex!<eos> Okay, you need to drink this.<eos> I'll get a new one.<eos> Uh, is there vodka in here?<eos> If there is, it's not doing anybody any good until I get it in there.

Uh, I just found her.<eos> I'll have her call you.<eos> Take me to my sister!<eos> Oh. Whoo!<eos> All right, Lily's camp is just through those trees.<eos> - I'll be back soon.<eos> - Take your time.<eos> I got a couple of Robustos to keep me company.<eos> Um, what's up with the outfit?<eos> It's to keep the smoke off me so Gloria won't smell it.
It prevents rings.<eos> Thanks to you and your Dr Pepper, my teak end table upstairs looks like the Olympic flag.<eos> Think, Luke.<eos> Yes.<eos> Think, Luke.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> Yep.<eos> Sweet Mexican treasure.<eos> I was born in Florida, but thank you.<eos> So, you really think you're gonna buy it?
You got to sign it first.<eos> Okay, uh, in that case, I'm gonna need to get the pen back from -- Claire!<eos> - Got one right here. - Oh. Okay.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Oh. Hey.<eos> I didn't expect to see you here today.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> Turns out you don't even need an appendix.<eos> I don't even miss it anymore.
Could you throw that apron on me?<eos> You're not sleeping again.<eos> Maybe we should have another pot of coffee.<eos> [ Chuckles ] That's a weird word, huh? Coffee. Coffee.<eos> Coffee.<eos> [ Sighs ] Amateur. Gloria:<eos> Doctor!<eos> I need your help.<eos> I've been drinking this Tequila, and I cannot find the worm.<eos> I think I just swallow it.
- No, no, no.<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> [ Gasps ] Not that it changed anything.<eos> Okay, don't be mad at Phil.<eos> He's not the bad guy here. He is.<eos> Look at him, sitting over there like he's the king of the world.<eos> What father takes money from his own children?<eos> Not like he needs it. He lives in this palace.<eos> Meanwhile, our whole family's sharing a bathroom the size of his closet.<eos> I've paced it out.
But soon you're saying, "yes, dear," and, "whatever you need, dear,"<eos> without even thinking about it.<eos> Anti-glare plexi, reinforced podium.<eos> Stand up every once in a while, you lose all your power.<eos> It's even got a wrist pad for your knob hand.<eos> Before you know it, you're picking up a pink princess castle for your pedicured 2-year-old, saying goodbye to your last chance to have one red-blooded man in the family.<eos> And you're getting that damn game, Phil!<eos> What in the name of "Pac-Man" creator Toru Iwatani<eos> - have you done?<eos> ! - You deserve it.
I am fielding multiple job offers.<eos> One job offer.<eos> From a very prominent hotel chain weighed against the implied offer of staying<eos> - at my current job...<eos> - Working for you dad. Exactly!<eos> And I could never leave grandpa, so I am going to say "no" to the first offer...<eos> Only offer.<eos> Even though I would have made an excellent Regional Vice President in charge of promotions.<eos> She is great at promotion.<eos> That title gets longer every time I hear it.
Some things are just more important than money, and for me that includes my fam... [ buzzing ] Man, that smarts.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Just trimming the hedges.<eos> I saw a low-angle photo of me the other day.<eos> I looked like a snorted a rabbi.<eos> And... and... and you're using a picture of me as your mirror?<eos> [ Laughs ] Oh, it is you!<eos> Hey, is that my phone?<eos> Ah, yes!<eos> I found it while you were asleep.
She strung her along for eight years, now they're in a custody battle over two Labradors.<eos> Am I the only one that got stuck in the break room with her today?<eos> Okay, dad, look.<eos> If it'll help, I'll call the hotel people and I'll straighten all this out.<eos> I don't think more calls from you is the answer, and by the way, I don't think you're gonna get that job anymore.<eos> Fine!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I never wanted that job in the first place!<eos> Well, then why did you tell me about it in the first place?
Sames.<eos> So what if neither of us is going with the guy we expected.<eos> Doesn't mean we can't blow it out.<eos> Uh, I mean have a great time.<eos> I definitely want a blow out, sleek and chic.<eos> I'm still going with someone I love.<eos> You know what?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes to what you're doing there.<eos> My dream was to go to prom with Adam, but I messed that up and I am not going to mess up prom too by moping about it.
A people.<eos> An allegiance.<eos> A man should belong, Doctor.<eos> Believe me, please!<eos> I am happy for you.<eos> So happy.<eos> I don't... I don't understand this. Why...?<eos> Come closer again.<eos> Let me see your face.<eos> You've seen it often enough.
I really thought she jumped.<eos> You got a beef with anybody on your staff?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, petty stuff.<eos> No one who would do something like this.<eos> Mouse got a location for where the email was sent.<eos> Our guys are checking out a house owned by Jeanette Rutowski.<eos> You know that name?<eos> No.<eos> I never heard of it.
Hey!<eos> Let's show 'em what we got.<eos> [Groans] Dad!<eos> Come on, Tag, we'll do a few bars, a few dance steps, and Bob's your Uncle.<eos> Wait. We have another Uncle in the family I don't know about?<eos> This is like the "Secret Family" episode of "Cateline."<eos> No, son, it's an expression, like an idiom.<eos> Oh! I love idioms.<eos> Actually, I have a whole book of them.<eos> Do you want me to go get it and I can read you some?
- Yeah.<eos> - OK. Well, see where that leads you.<eos> I have to go to hospital.<eos> My mum's had a stroke.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm Alan Banks.<eos> - I'm looking for my mother.<eos> - Your father's with her now.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Have you made arrangements for removal, or would you like us to do it for you?
- So you are Greg's girlfriend.<eos> I'm guessing that's a yes.<eos> Thank you, tae kwon do.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Step away from the computer.<eos> Stop typing, Nancy.<eos> No!<eos> Erasing your hard drive?<eos> I don't think so, Nancy.<eos> It's private, don't touch it.
The Voice, especially.<eos> She would talk to me for hours and hours about who was safe and who'd been voted off...<eos> I was so happy Craig won.<eos> When he opened his heart and he sang that Johnny Cash song,<eos> I just, I cried listening.<eos> He was so...<eos> Please continue.<eos> Well, Nancy's cable always seemed to go out right before the show started and she'd panic.<eos> She had to watch it at a neighbor's.<eos> And I suggested to her that she DVR it, but she said no, she had to see it live.
- My birthday?<eos> - An English tradition.<eos> - Blow.<eos> What are you scared of?<eos> - l've never done this before.<eos> Will it blow up in my face?<eos> Make a wish.<eos> We have a present for you.<eos> - Bought or stolen?<eos> - Biscuit bought it.
Was he buying the pills?<eos> It was only supposed to be a one-off.<eos> We made the first batch in the lab at work, and I made sure they were safe.<eos> And then Josh sold them on to Fallon.<eos> But it wasn't just the one-off?<eos> Fallon wanted more.<eos> He threatened to turn us in if we said no.<eos> We couldn't use work any more, so we set up in my garage and worked from there.<eos> Where's the equipment now?<eos> Josh told me to dismantle it.
I might as well have been dead.<eos> The only thing I can remember is, driving to the store in a terrible storm, and I, uh, I went over a guardrail, and then... nothing for months.<eos> Uh, they said she drowned, but they never found a body.<eos> So, uh, we never gave up hope.<eos> What a touching story.<eos> Okay, well, You must wanna get back to your van house now.<eos> Oh, sweetie, don't be so rude.<eos> Maybe your friends are hungry?<eos> Oh. Uh, dinner's already made.<eos> Look lady, I don't know what game you're playin', but I want my book, and I want it now!
Look, these things are tricky.<eos> They can disguise themselves as human and just when you're comfortable, boom!<eos> It's just a storm, Pablito.<eos> Look, Ash, I think you're being really paranoid about this.<eos> If Kelly's mom is one of "them,"<eos> why wouldn't she have killed her before we got here?<eos> Because she's tryin' to reel in the bigger fish.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> If you snag a little fish, you're not gonna eat it.<eos> No, you use it as a bait fish, to catch the whale.
- You're so gay.<eos> Hey, check it out...<eos> Josh, meet the Pussy Wagon.<eos> Pussy Wagon, meet Josh.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is that it?<eos> And only 90 quid a day.<eos> But just, you know, transfer me the money whenever.<eos> What?<eos> I ain't... Why am I paying for it?
- Yeah, I guess.<eos> - Why he took the drugs.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Don't let Bigfoot scare you off.<eos> I want to thank everyone who helped me through this.<eos> Marjorie, Jill, Wendy...<eos> I could not have made it without you guys.<eos> And...?<eos> Oh, almost forgot...<eos> Stephanie, thanks for that hug when I needed it.
I need to speak to you.<eos> S hweta.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want Payal's new number.<eos> I am not going to give it to you.<eos> Shweta, please.<eos> I just have to talk to her, please..<eos> Shweta, please give me the number.<eos> I just want to ask her if she really has forgotten me.<eos> Do you need it in writing?
It will make your skin glow and make you the centre of attention at the wedding function that's in two days.<eos> Go from here.<eos> Even if I gave you the address for the wedding, will she agree?<eos> If she was to agree to come back..<eos> ...then why would she leave you in the first place?<eos> We had a fight once and she locked herself up in the bathroom.<eos> I stood outside the door and she stood inside for four hours straight.<eos> But she did not open the door.<eos> Till I..<eos> Till I wrote 'SOI'H/' 50 times on a piece of paper and slid it under the door.
I'll talk to the guy behind us.<eos> Sir, please sit in the car.<eos> Can you reverse the car a bit, we need to turn around urgently.<eos> Just a little..<eos> - Sir, please sit in the car.<eos> Take the car ahead.<eos> Move your car.<eos> It's creating a jam.<eos> I haven't got paid yet.<eos> Take it later, but move your car first.
Come here, I'll show you!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Leave me.<eos> What are you staring at me for?<eos> Shoot!<eos> Move away!<eos> Where's Payal?<eos> Where's Payal?<eos> Get Payal's boat.<eos> Don't you get it?
Hello again, gorgeous.<eos> Sorry about the peep show before.<eos> Actually, it wasn't much of a show. [Laughs]<eos> - Midnight show is better. - [Telephone rings]<eos> - I promise he's not gonna be here when you get back, okay?<eos> Hello?<eos> - Hey, D., it's me, Sean.<eos> - Oh, hi, Sean.<eos> Wait. How'd he get this number?<eos> - Because I gave it to him, that's why.
I take good care of my family.<eos> I live very comfortably, and I hope to die that way, too.<eos> That's exactly the shit he was talking about.<eos> He was saying you were getting too comfortable, too soft, too old.<eos> And why should any of that nonsense concern you?<eos> I live better now because I choose to live better.<eos> I want to live better.<eos> I work my ass off so I can live better and you can live better.<eos> My father and me worked hard for 40 years to build this goddamn business.<eos> That's why we came here to this country, and now you may have smashed it to pieces with one brainless act.
Can't be.<eos> If it's not on the list, it can't be one of Tedesco's games.<eos> - Your guy's gotta be wrong. - No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> This stoolie's information is always solid.<eos> The kid has never let me down before. I'm not buying it.<eos> Moose wouldn't pull that kind of shit with me.<eos> What about I just call him right now<eos> - and find out what the hell the deal is? - No.<eos> I've already checked in with the lieutenant. He wants to take it to Johanson.
Says it's too big.<eos> She can't park it.<eos> Says I should have bought her one of those little Volkswagens instead.<eos> You know, Corcoran, it's in beautiful shape.<eos> This is a goddamn gorgeous car.<eos> And it's only got 1.500 miles on it?<eos> She'll only take it across the bridge to her mother's and back.<eos> Like I say, at this price it's a steal.<eos> Corcoran, you got yourself a deal.<eos> I'm taking it.
So sit your fat ass down!<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> This isn't complicated.<eos> You've been doing this a long time.<eos> I know that.<eos> That's right, I've been doing this a long time, like my father before me.<eos> Then you know the rules!<eos> We didn't mix 'em up on you all of a sudden!<eos> And just like us and your father before you, you agreed to play by those rules, no?<eos> So here's the deal... we want our money, we want it now.

Let's go.<eos> Move it.<eos> John, what is going on here?<eos> You know you can't have what's going on upstairs without us having it on the list, and nobody at the office knows about this.<eos> Oh, it's not what you think, Terry.<eos> I-I-I just manage the joint.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> So, uh, who are you managing it for?
- Sophie Baines' house.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Nice to meet you Mr. Berger.<eos> - And you.<eos> What is it we're looking for, Inspector?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But I know Sophie didn't drop the burner by accident.<eos> I was thinking the same thing.<eos> She left it,
I'll get Ellie on it.<eos> A present from Ellie, hot off the press.<eos> There...<eos> "Sweet Muse,<eos> Mad about you: a life-changing moment, the Café Rosa at 14:00 yesterday."<eos> - That's 14:00 today.<eos> - It's a death sentence and we can't warn him because we don't know who he is.<eos> Yeah, but he knows who Sophie is though.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Her abduction was kept out of the press... nobody knows about it.
- Tom. - We're very sorry for your loss.<eos> We were actually hoping to speak with your sister.<eos> The doctor sedated her. Did she say anything to you before they put her under?<eos> She wouldn't talk to me.<eos> What can you tell us about BARN?<eos> They're lowlifes. The reason that Connie, Roy, and Ben flew in was because my parents called a family meeting.<eos> They were sick and tired of being terrorized.<eos> Terrorized how? It started when those scumbags went undercover at one of our processing facilities.<eos> Caught some animal abuse on camera.<eos> My parents didn't even know about it, but BARN publicly crucified them anyway.
But we're not.<eos> We have a lot of work left to do.<eos> Our attention goes to Solbak.<eos> The threat is not over.<eos> Costante?<eos> Costante, it's Dorn.<eos> I believe we have identified the assassin.<eos> Everything points to her attempting the murder of<eos> Solbak tonight, when he speaks at the theater.<eos> I have sent you a file and, ah, I would like you to examine it.
Yup.<eos> Just showed up at the hospital.<eos> With a hypodermic needle.<eos> He was gonna jab it into my little buddy.<eos> We haven't tested the hypodermic yet, but...<eos> You can't just keep me in here!<eos> ...Hale says that it was full of potassium chloride.<eos> Would have given me a heart attack.<eos> How did you get him to offer that up?<eos> We beat it out of him.
Got one of your great ideas?<eos> Two words, boys.<eos> Princivali Jewelers.<eos> Home to a very, very rare diamond.<eos> Medium rare?<eos> Passed down from Italian royalty rare.<eos> Tony Rosas will give us three mil a piece for it.<eos> - Oh! That's a lot of mils.<eos> - We're rich.<eos> So when do we boost it?
Get out of the way.<eos> Come to Uncle Stewey.<eos> Fred!<eos> It's not the vault, Fred.<eos> What do you mean it's not the vault?<eos> - It's not the vault, Fred.<eos> - It said so right on the map.<eos> - It's not the vault.<eos> - You said it was gonna be easy.<eos> Oh! I was reading it upside down.
Dad, what did you just do?<eos> I don't know. I don't know.<eos> I'll be honest, Zeus.<eos> I thought you were the dumbest one in this class.<eos> Apparently, I was wrong.<eos> You just wait until tomorrow.<eos> He can't even go on the teeter totter.<eos> Okay, mongrel.<eos> I'll play your little game but when I beat you, that collar is mine.<eos> And this time, I'll tear it to smithereens.
I know if I had a big trip to Hawaii planned, I probably wouldn't be able to concentrate either.<eos> Donut?<eos> No, Rick. I'm still a celiac.<eos> Which is why... I made sure to get one... that's gluten-free.<eos> Rick, you are so thoughtful.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Any time, buddy.<eos> What a jerk, huh?<eos> Don't be so hard on him, Deedee. Everyone makes mistakes.<eos> They repo'd the car already. - I don't have it anymore.
Lisa Wyatt's?<eos> We need to get a comparison sample for forensics to be sure.<eos> So her husband's dead and now she's nowhere to be found?<eos> Yeah. She's our best suspect.<eos> - We've got to get a B.O.L.O. out on her.<eos> - I'll flag her phone and credit cards.<eos> I certainly wish things were different, Lawrence, however I am happy Helen had insurance.<eos> You don't know how often I see people without it.<eos> Which, uh, account do you want me to deposit the check into?<eos> Neither. I want it in cash.
Lisa Wyatt is a person of interest in the murder of her husband, Rick Wyatt.<eos> Yeah, so, depending on how long you've been going around using her credit cards...<eos> Really?<eos> Nothing?<eos> Maybe you're responsible for his murder.<eos> Hey, I don't know anything about that.<eos> I found the cards at the bus station.<eos> You need to be more specific than that.<eos> There was a car in the parking lot. The purse was sitting on the passenger seat.<eos> So you just took it?
This place is Ung-am jeolbyeok.<eos> [Ung-am Jeolbyeok - bear's cliff]<eos> Bear, cliff, bear's cliff.<eos> If you're afraid, follow me down the mountain.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I am looking for that knife that you threw away.<eos> It's only a knife, why is it so important?<eos> No, I have to find it.<eos> It's more important than my life.<eos> Someone gave it to me.
Will you do that for me?<eos> Have you called your estate lawyer?<eos> Yes, he's not returning my calls.<eos> Think he wants to wait till I'm dead, and then...<eos> Keep all the money in-house.<eos> Who is your estate attorney?<eos> David Lee.<eos> The Good Wife 6x15 Open Source<eos> I didn't put the file up to hurt people.<eos> I put it up to protect them.
- You did not get me the job in California.<eos> - You made a phone call.<eos> - And I can withdraw that call.<eos> It's the kind of job that could make someone's reputation.<eos> So you're gonna bad-mouth me unless I pull back on the Black Business Leaders?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Wow.<eos> It's your choice, Jon.<eos> You want that job, you tell Alicia it's a bad idea to trash Peter, because it is a bad idea to trash Peter.<eos> You don't need it, this late in the campaign.
You believe him?<eos> Well, like you said, he's not really the affair-having type.<eos> So these other words he would use to describe your mother, would "forgetful" be one of them?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> When I was in London last summer, I received two phone calls from her.<eos> The first one, she was trying to track you down.<eos> She was unaware that I was no longer stateside.<eos> The second one was one week later.<eos> Before the question was out of her mouth, she admitted that my move had slipped her mind.<eos> I assumed you just hadn't mentioned it, thought she'd only forgotten once.
ELIZABETH: I've been talking to the French and Brits.<eos> If we can't get the statues,<eos> I think that we can tempt Prime Minister Georgiou with a better debt deal.<eos> Fine.<eos> Look, I've heard about the rumblings in the party.<eos> But did somebody really ask you not to run for a second term?<eos> My top bundlers are pulling their support.<eos> When the money dries up, the party looks for someone to throw overboard.<eos> Well, we won't listen to them.<eos> Part of doing the job is knowing when you're not doing it.
That, uh... job offer from the War College, Henry... it really wasn't a question.<eos> It came from your office.<eos> From me, to be exact.<eos> You're a top religious scholar with a military background who happens to have the highest security clearance.<eos> It's tailor-made for you.<eos> So what are you waiting for?<eos> I like the job that I have.<eos> (scoffs) You could be teaching your ethics class to a group of future military leaders.<eos> NSA work you did... you were good at it.<eos> You can't tell me you don't miss it.
This is a great book, by the way.<eos> This is funny. This is the woof woof doll... this was the most popular picture over the years,<eos> - I still use today.<eos> - Did they let you keep Wolfie?<eos> I didn't get him till about six years later.<eos> The prop master took me aside, and said,<eos> "here, take this home with you and don't show anybody."<eos> And lo and behold, I open it up, and it was woof woof.<eos> I even wound up getting a suit recently.<eos> My mom found it, believe it or not.
I even wound up getting a suit recently.<eos> My mom found it, believe it or not.<eos> That's what I had on display at the comic con we just came from.<eos> You have one of the suits with you?<eos> Would you like to see the suit?<eos> - I... - [Laughter]<eos> See at a minimum, wear at a maximum.<eos> [Laughter] - I'll be right back.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Oh, he still has it?

They're like "aah! Did they eat somebody?"<eos> "Of course." [Laughter]<eos> I'm dying to ask you this question.<eos> Okay.<eos> - If there was a real - Life Jurassic Park right now...<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Would you go?<eos> Well, just like any zoo I've ever been to, I guarantee you, you pay this exorbitant amount of money to get in there, you wouldn't see one dinosaur.<eos> You'd be like, "oh, well, where is it?<eos> Oh, I can't find it." He's sleeping.
Maybe you didn't expect it to burn as fast as it.<eos> - That didn't happen.<eos> - Eyewitness statements, physical evidence, a history of attacks.<eos> I think we've got enough, don't you?<eos> Hey...<eos> Yeah, we did the fireworks, yeah.<eos> But that was earlier, around teatime.<eos> Just a few fireworks.<eos> - What about the white spirit?<eos> - I didn't put it in the letterbox.

- Where's she?<eos> Nottingham, 10 minutes from the last Mullen's known address.<eos> - Have you spoken to her?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> You and Ken go to Nottingham, speak to her face-to-face.<eos> If she has any idea where he is, I want to know.<eos> OK.<eos> So, Mr. Hardgreaves, can you tell me what you were doing with this newspaper clipping?<eos> The one I'd thrown away?<eos> Someone sent it to me.
- That`s right.<eos> - Why would they do that?<eos> - To get on my right side, maybe?<eos> I'm a good friend to have.<eos> If that were true, why would they send it anonymously?<eos> You got the clipping.<eos> You knew Steven Cadley had changed his name to Marcus Leyton.<eos> You ordered the hit.<eos> I got the clipping.<eos> I decided I didn't give a toss and I put it in the bin.
Maybe we'll get a licence plate. Anything else?<eos> Anaan Kamel pawned some jewellery.<eos> It was in her file.<eos> The pawn ticket was sellotaped to some paperwork.<eos> It was an eternity ring and bracelets and she got £8,000.<eos> - When was that?<eos> - The day before she died.<eos> - Any sign of the cash?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> Not unless she's hidden it.
Just tell us.<eos> He wasn't a client.<eos> We spent the night together.<eos> I'm gay.<eos> How do we know that Anaan Kamel had an affair with Marcus Leyton?<eos> Well, we found the phone in Anaan's gym locker.<eos> And her brother confirmed it was Marcus he saw her with.<eos> Neither of which are conclusive!<eos> What if it wasn't her phone?<eos> What if she'd simply found it?

Now, that uncle died two years ago.<eos> Tidwell inherited the business and has been on the move ever since.<eos> Send us the specs for Done and done.<eos> He probably disabled the Automated Identification System, so we're forced to track the vessel by size.<eos> Let's see how many 75-foot boats are offshore.<eos> We need live satellite images.<eos> Already done.<eos> White and black boat, isolated from the others.<eos> There it is. Can you monitor from here?<eos> You got it.
But after she died, we wound up living in my car.<eos> Was it an Escalade?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Um, so, Isabella, does she live with you at the shelter?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> She is in a foster home.<eos> Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, they're really nice, and I get to see her a lot.<eos> But I will get to see her a lot more if I can just get this job.<eos> Well, let's make sure you get it.
No.<eos> What you said is something you don't say to your mother.<eos> So you must not think of me as a mother at all.<eos> So, from now on, you're on your own.<eos> Mommy-free.<eos> Sans mommy.<eos> You ain't got no mama.<eos> What's that, Francine?<eos> I think you dropped a challenge.<eos> And I'm pickin' it up.
You know what this would go great with?<eos> A big plate of loose hot dogs.<eos> That was Leonard's favorite!<eos> May I...shout at Maxine?<eos> Maxine!<eos> Loose hot dogs!<eos> Now, this is decorating.<eos> These heavy velvet curtains really keep out the natural light.<eos> The sun is the enemy, darling.<eos> I avoid it at all costs.
And you can, my darling Leonard!<eos> You can!<eos> You've come back to me, and I think you're feeling what we have to do.<eos> We must finish the picture with you as Leonard and me...as me!<eos> Okay, party's over.<eos> I'm not your dead husband.<eos> Pish-posh, of course you are.<eos> No!<eos> Because reincarnation isn't real.<eos> I mean, sure, Leonard and I like the same foods, and, yeah, if I grew a mustache, that's the thinness I'd keep it at.
You're D.O. Rothy, the queen of lonely housewife detective novellas, softcore.<eos> I'm F.R. Ancine, the competition.<eos> I have no competition.<eos> I've won this award six years in a row, and I intend to win it again.<eos> Wait, aren't we in a literary feud like, um, uh, um... Oh. Gee, um...<eos> I want to say Mary someone!<eos> That's right!<eos> Keep walkin'!<eos> Glad we didn't have to go all the way to Central Park to find this stuff.<eos> Well, sometimes a massive fire breaks out in a senior home across the street right when you need it -- and right when you set it.
Sir, if you will permit me, I know these men.<eos> Just a spell or two would have them embracing you like a brother.<eos> I only ask that I be the gentleman to introduce you to society.<eos> - Just one small piece of magic.<eos> - Like you did for the housewives in Yorkshire.<eos> I have never washed any linen in my life, by magical means or otherwise.<eos> Who invented this nonsense?<eos> I suppose it is no matter who.<eos> - So where's this book of yours?<eos> - You'll never have my book, nor even see it.
Well, at least now on it's all paid attention.<eos> Dad, what is it?<eos> Stool trap, traitor!<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - Congratulations, we are your new neighbors.<eos> - Sorry, we zapiznyuyemos. Good day.<eos> - Consider what we have here. New apartment.<eos> We found a relationship between Christensen and Birkeland.<eos> Last year he was the head student of Christensen.<eos> We have to take it with what we have.
I said and did a lot of things, mostly because I was hurt, but I'm better now.<eos> I'm trying to move on.<eos> And we should believe you why?<eos> When Pam filed that restraining order, it hit me pretty hard.<eos> I realized that I had a problem, so I got help.<eos> What kind of help?<eos> I joined a love and sex addicts support group.<eos> I go to meetings.<eos> They've helped me.<eos> I understand why I need to feel love and why I obsess when I don't get it.
Oh, my God!<eos> Father James!<eos> Father James?<eos> Darren: I didn't mean to hurt him.<eos> He tried to stop me, Pam.<eos> I just wanted to see you.<eos> Darren, what did you do?<eos> Any update on Darren Tyler's location?<eos> Not yet.<eos> We tried to ping his phone, but he must have turned it off.
Who's shoving what down whom?<eos> And if you don't have a story, I do.<eos> John, Max and I got roped into being bridesmaids.<eos> Stop.<eos> You had me at rope.<eos> You lost me at bridesmaids.<eos> I'll be at the hostess stand, looking at dresses and silently wishing for an asteroid to wipe us off the planet.<eos> If wishes made things happen, we'd been in the middle of a zombie apocalypse right now.<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> My dress just arrived from Poland and I'm bustin' for you to see it.

No, don't tell me.<eos> I understand sometimes people just need to slip through the cracks, just disappear.<eos> What?<eos> No, it's gonna be my blood.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What?<eos> Take this blade.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, wait.<eos> I'm gonna take the tube, I'm gonna put it right next to my wrist, and you're gonna cut me.

Picked it in college.
Thank you, I was aware of that.<eos> Help yourselves.<eos> And Talika Desai...<eos> drug squad any help?<eos> Not even on their radar.<eos> No drug debt, no history of dealing.<eos> But you know, I'm not even sure that this is about drugs, there's this missing necklace -<eos> We can't rule out the drug connection.<eos> No, but a jeweller that Maddox spoke to says this necklace could cost 30 grand.<eos> Talika didn't buy it, her sister thought it was costume jewellery cos it's not a family heirloom.
Back to that story?<eos> Why can't you just relax and be nice to your sister?<eos> My bed scares me.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Now, just close your eyes and nuzzle in under the big clown fangs.<eos> Attaboy.<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> She took my pencil.<eos> Lisa, there are plenty of mini golf pencils in the kitchen drawer.<eos> Tell Bart, because it's my pencil and he stole it!
You know how kids like to climb things.<eos> What are we gonna do? !<eos> They say you're supposed to get great strength when your kids are threatened.<eos> I'm kind of feeling it.<eos> We just bought them new shoes.<eos> You did it, Homie! Ah... Ah...<eos> Bart!<eos> Haven't you learned anything?<eos> I'm still learning our phone number.<eos> And I've almost got it.

Ooh! Mariachi skeletons.<eos> They're spooky, but they also teach you about Mexico.<eos> Psst! Hey, big man, how about this deal:<eos> you buy one from me-- in cash-- and I'll load three more into your car for free.<eos> That is a great deal.<eos> Just don't tell Old Man Squishee about it. Hmm. You got some great guys working here.<eos> They just gave me a really good deal.<eos> Really?<eos> Tell me of this deal.<eos> Okay, but don't tell Old Man Squishee about it.
I've got it.<eos> What if... we use these decorations to signal for help?<eos> You're right.<eos> I may not be the smartest dad or the bravest or the smartest, but I am great at one thing-- drawing attention to our home.<eos> If we're gonna get out of this, we're going to need every holiday you've got. ♪ Ay, ay, ay, ay ♪ ♪ Halloween is so bueno... ♪<eos> Ooh, the Señor Skeletinos.<eos> He must have leaned on the "try me" button.<eos> We're coming to get you.<eos> And no fancy ceiling door is gonna stop us.<eos> Almost got it.

That's not what this is.<eos> Okay, so what is it?<eos> It's, uh...<eos> Must be some kind of... copycat blood cult.<eos> I don't know, you call it what you want to.<eos> It was people who are recreating or are continuing the crimes committed by notorious killers from the past.<eos> March-- there was a guy.<eos> One guy called himself March, James Patrick March.<eos> You just check out the history of the hotel.<eos> That's the name of the guy who built it.
Now I think maybe growing up wouldn't have been so bad.<eos> It can't be worse than this.<eos> Wren, I don't understand.<eos> Are you telling me it's your father?<eos> He's the killer?<eos> No.<eos> He died a long time ago.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm so sick of this whole thing.<eos> I don't want it anymore.
"Honor thy mother and thy father."<eos> The hearts of two ungrateful children.<eos> They murdered both of their parents in order to inherit the family fortune.<eos> JOHN: The Rylance twins.<eos> "Thou shalt not bear false witness."<eos> Gossip mongers.<eos> After he nailed their slanderous tongues to their desks, he ripped out their vocal cords.<eos> "Thou shalt not take the Lord's name in vain."

I had enough credits to graduate last year.<eos> And I will bring you coffee at midnight if I want to.<eos> Medium Americano.<eos> Black.<eos> I told you he was up to something.<eos> We just spent three hours watching this dude play video games in his bedroom.<eos> He better be out here covering up a mass murder.<eos> Let's find out.<eos> You still got his scent?<eos> Don't need it.
Did it hurt?<eos> When you were looking at me... Your eyes kind of drifted.<eos> What were you thinking about?<eos> A dream.<eos> What dream?<eos> I've had it here and there for about six months.<eos> I'm walking in the woods, carrying a body.<eos> But it's completely burned.<eos> I can't see who it is or who it was.<eos> Where are you taking it?
A sacred meeting place for Celtic Druids.<eos> They were scientists and healers thousands of years ago.<eos> I've never seen this place.<eos> But that's why you're here.<eos> It drew you here.<eos> That's what it does.<eos> It's a beacon for supernatural creatures.<eos> It might even make them more powerful.<eos> What else happens?<eos> I put the body down... I... I lay it down on the rings of the trees and...
Keep counting.<eos> Four...<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> A werewolf with the talons of an eagle.<eos> Possibly a shape-shifter, known in eastern mythology as a Garuda.<eos> Tracy's claws.<eos> The unmistakable claws of a werewolf...<eos> But... A werewolf who also bears the venom and the scales of a Kanima.<eos> What do you even call that?<eos> Personally, I call it terrifying.
It's completely different.<eos> You know I get those rashes.<eos> You're allergic to balls! [laughs]<eos> Oh, is it not cool to smoke in here?<eos> What is that?<eos> What's what?<eos> The lightning bolt on your hip, the tattoo.<eos> This?<eos> It's just something I got back in the day.<eos> Well, I've never seen it before in my life.
- Funsies!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Holy shh...<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> Honey, I'm... just here.<eos> When did you get the Flash tattoo?<eos> - 1992.<eos> - That's bullshit, Mom.<eos> Watch your goddamn language with me.<eos> Why have I never seen it until today?
Gigi is my song, and you're getting all the royalties.<eos> Go write your own fucking song, huh?<eos> Your hair looks really awesome like that, by the way.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I just, I feel like this whole thing is my fault.<eos> Why, did you call mom and tell her what's going on between me and Flash?<eos> You think I'm that devious?<eos> You were against us from day one.<eos> Honey, I... it's hard for you to understand right now because it just...<eos> Hey, Dad, if you tell me that I'm too young to understand, I will take my boot heel and jab it into your balls right under this table.
I know, but you said it was complicated.<eos> You said that our relationship was complicated and how you felt about me was very complicated.<eos> I did.<eos> I just need more time.<eos> I need a little bit more time to feel safe because I want to make sure it's gonna last.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got it.<eos> I am going to get a tattoo, though, and I picked it out, and I want to see if you like it.
Lloris, take Mr Marlott's hat and gloves.<eos> Sir.<eos> - How is the girl?<eos> - Weary.<eos> After what happened.<eos> Mr Marlott has taken a charitable interest in a young girl who is with child.<eos> Sadly, she miscarried last night.<eos> There was nothing I could have done. I'm afraid.<eos> It was her clear intention that the child not be born. The body answered to the will.<eos> I have seen it many times.
No!<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> You got this, Doyle.<eos> You got this.<eos> Hey there, big guy.<eos> You know, I've been thinking.<eos> You and I, we got off on the wrong foot completely.<eos> That, that's on me, you know?<eos> And, honestly, for someone who would wear another person's face on top of their own face, you seem like a fairly reasonable, human thing.<eos> So why don't you just stop swinging the hammer, put it down and you and I can talk about it?
I have my doubts.<eos> Gibbs, your CIA friend was correct to doubt.<eos> Khosa didn't thwart anything.<eos> The terrorists accomplished their mission, and this is what they planted.<eos> A bug.<eos> An undetectable, voice-activated recording device.<eos> It's smaller than a-a hamster's bow tie.<eos> The only downside is that it can't be remotely accessed.<eos> It has to be physically retrieved.<eos> How do we know they planted it?
Click, click, click, click.<eos> You could hear the fan blades again.<eos> As soon as she flipped the switch...<eos> It stopped.<eos> This is ridiculous, right?<eos> So I got out of bed.<eos> He just stopped dead in his tracks.<eos> He was standing there looking towards the floor.<eos> The plug is laying right there on the floor.<eos> It's not plugged in, and yet we heard it and we felt it.

I was going to tell you people anyway.<eos> I lied because I was panicked.<eos> But I can't let Petros rot in prison.<eos> I was at his apartment that night.<eos> I left around 7:30.<eos> So he's innocent.<eos> He didn't commit the murder.<eos> I'm inclined to agree with you, Watson.<eos> Petros was framed.<eos> I told you I didn't do it.
When we spotted this home, the real estate agent told us that it was a foreclosed home, that's why the price was cheap.<eos> Hey, hey, be careful.<eos> Let 'em explore.<eos> It was, you know, a lot cheaper.<eos> You get good deals on foreclosures, especially if they, like, needed fixing up.<eos> It was spacious...<eos> And a great floor plan.<eos> It just seemed like too good to be true.<eos> I went ahead and purchased a camper trailer.<eos> I put it in the front yard.
That's atypical for an abusive boyfriend.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> There's a broken mirror in the house.<eos> Any of the victims' injuries consistent with broken glass?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Is the mirror significant?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've seen it before.
How can they be ghosts?<eos> Well, at least if I die, you know I really will come back and haunt you... all.<eos> OK, the sub is approaching the town square.<eos> - Which way is the church?<eos> - North-north-west, 150 yards.<eos> That's it.<eos> Starboard two degrees.<eos> What are we looking for, exactly?<eos> Something that has the power to raise the dead and turn them into transmitters.<eos> I expect we'll know it when we see it.
He's saying... "The chamber will open tonight."<eos> Clara, now the ghosts are out, go to the Faraday Cage.<eos> They won't be able to get you in there.<eos> Oh, there's a problem.<eos> Problem?<eos> What problem?<eos> Because everything else is going so smoothly...<eos> The phone signal won't get through.<eos> What you'll have to do...<eos> Clara, put the phone outside, and you can watch it through the little round porthole, and when you see it ringing, if it's safe to do so, go out and answer it.
Ooh, they got Lotion Monthly. Ooh. Ooh, ooh.<eos> Aw, Healthy Babies Digest. Aw... (quietly):<eos> Lin, th-they never send you the magazines.<eos> You will start receiving issues within 30 days.<eos> Uh, hold on one second, Sally.<eos> Quick conversation over here with my wife.<eos> Lin, no.<eos> They have Open-Toe Living.<eos> Linda, it's a scam.<eos> You give them money, and they just take it.
Say yes! Oh!<eos> God, I'm going crazy!<eos> Okay, do you have any magazines about cooking?<eos> We have Cooking in the Kitchen.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll get my checkbook.<eos> Get your checkbook. Get it!<eos> I'm getting it!<eos> Hurry!<eos> I can't find it!
But if you think you might, like, be happier with me, call me back.<eos> This is Josh, by the way.<eos> Oh, my God. Josh.<eos> I know.<eos> Pretty intense.<eos> Did you really leave me that message?<eos> Sure did.<eos> Huh. Can I ask you something?<eos> - Anything.<eos> - How come I never got it?
Pretty intense.<eos> Did you really leave me that message?<eos> Sure did.<eos> Huh. Can I ask you something?<eos> - Anything.<eos> - How come I never got it?<eos> Oh. Well, good question.<eos> And, uh, how come my message is on your computer?<eos> Another good question.<eos> Hmm... is it possible that you tricked me into giving you my phone, so that you could delete the message before I got it because you started dating someone new?
I'm glad you like it.<eos> It's from my family's vineyard in Bordeaux.<eos> You have a vineyard... in Bordeaux?<eos> Would it be awkward if I also dated you?<eos> You are so funny.<eos> Nicki said you had a stick up y...<eos> It's not important.<eos> You know, Sophie, I'm really glad we got together and not just because of this incredible wine.<eos> Yes, it's getting a lot of attention.<eos> They're serving it at a special dinner at some art gallery tomorrow.
Aha.<eos> There they are, the lovebirds.<eos> Stuart, it is so sweet of you to have us over for dinner.<eos> I hope you didn't go to too much trouble.<eos> No trouble at all.<eos> No trouble?<eos> There's a frickin' boat in here.<eos> It reminds me of Greece.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I was afraid you wouldn't get it.
Let me help.<eos> - I got him.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Got him?<eos> Didn't know blowing up helicopters was in the secret service handbook.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm a full service provider. What can I say?<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> You have a back door into D.A.R.P.A.'s mainframe?<eos> The division has a worm in its network.<eos> I need you to find it and track it back.
- OK.<eos> He screwed you out of everything.<eos> Your birthright.<eos> The entire Durst Organization.<eos> And you forgot?<eos> Right.<eos> He took over the family business.<eos> No doubt about it.<eos> OK.<eos> He took it from you.
The entire Durst Organization.<eos> And you forgot?<eos> Right.<eos> He took over the family business.<eos> No doubt about it.<eos> OK.<eos> He took it from you.<eos> He could have done it with you.<eos> There were a lot of choices he could have done, but no.<eos> He took it from you and his plan was to destroy you and embarrass you.
Prosecutors are gonna be pissed.<eos> Well, they won't be too happy with me.<eos> But at the end of day, with the data you gave us, they'll be able to make a RICO case and put Hector and his boys away for life.<eos> That's all they care about, so they'll let it go.<eos> Well, guess this is good-bye.<eos> Before you go, let me hear it one more time, for my own piece of mind.<eos> After Sheriff Barnes takes me to the bus station,<eos> I buy a ticket to Vancouver.<eos> Once I get there<eos> I go straight to the U.S. consulate, request a package from Cabe Gallo, and they'll hand it over to me, no questions asked.
Roscoe, we'll meet you in the car!<eos> It's actually a very funny story.<eos> - Oh, we'll talk at home.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You gambled away all her money?<eos> Not all of it.<eos> I used some of it to buy the NFL package on satellite TV.<eos> Christy, she was counting on that money to live on when she gets out.<eos> I know!<eos> That's why I've been saving, a little each month, so she has it when her sentence is up.
I'd like to submit some evidence in the case.<eos> This is Brit, our daughter.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> That is a case for good parenting.<eos> And that's someone who's gonna be,<eos> I mean, con-- contributing to society.<eos> She's looking into doing Teach for America in Atlanta next year.<eos> Maybe some modeling too, just to--<eos> Or modeling on the side, but-- we raised her with hopes and with dreams, and we said, "The world is your oyster,"<eos> and she's just grabbing it by the horns.
Weirdos were the first people to eat kale, the first people to try marijuana, to write poems, to fall in love.<eos> I plan to prove the innocence of these two by proving their guilt.<eos> Weirdos.<eos> Yes, they are weirdos!<eos> But weirdos should be allowed to be weird in peace.<eos> The real perpetrator of this crime--<eos> Check, check, one, two, two, two, two.<eos> How's everybody doing today?<eos> We want to confess to this crime.<eos> The weirdos didn't do it.

They say they are responsible...<eos> It's vindication for the weirdos.<eos> It wasn't the weirdos.<eos> It appears this message is political in nature.<eos> They don't like taxidermy.<eos> They feel it is offensive to the dead animals, that they should rest in peace.<eos> Down with taxidermy.<eos> ♪ we did the crime, not doing the time ♪<eos> ♪ we did it!<eos> we did it!

Search his place.<eos> Espo, pop the trunk.<eos> Hands on the car.<eos> All right.<eos> It's here.<eos> Who's in the bag, Mike?<eos> What the...<eos> Sampson's not talking... about Richie or the dummy.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why would Richie bury a crash-test dummy in the middle of nowhere, and why would Sampson steal it?
I mean, you know, it's, you know, it's, don't forget it's almost 20 years after the fact.<eos> And all of a sudden, Kathie's disappearance may be close at hand in terms of a solution.<eos> These two guys pulled up in a car, and they came onto the property and said they were detectives and could they come in and look at something in the house and ask me a couple questions.<eos> They looked into a closet, and they took a shelf down and they started pulling things out and dug back to an area that I didn't even know existed in my house.<eos> I guess they were looking for a weapon or, you know, bloodstains or something.<eos> No one had ever searched the house.<eos> No one had ever attempted to search the house, search the lake, search anywhere else.<eos> I mean, it was very telling that there was a whole area that needed to be investigated.<eos> That this case was not investigated the way it should have been.<eos> No one even looked at it.
So, to put a finer point on it, did you have anything to do with the disappearance of your wife?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know where she is.<eos> I don't know what happened to her.<eos> I don't know how it happened to her.<eos> I had nothing to do with what happened to her, except very, um, obliquely or whatever you would...<eos> It was a bad marriage and that was at least half, probably a lot more, my fault.<eos> But other than that, I had nothing to do with what caused her or what happened to her disappearance, in her disappearance.<eos> When he gives his original statement to the police, he leaves the car at home.<eos> Doesn't bring it into the city.
I felt my knees get weak.<eos> Because I, it was like, I told them, "Go out there."<eos> When I heard that Susan had been murdered, the first person I thought of was Robert Durst.<eos> Because we were about to speak with her.<eos> Susan Berman wasn't just killed.<eos> I mean, it was execution.<eos> Her death is a very questionable death, not just in terms of the fact that it was a homicide, but the timing is extremely curious.<eos> How did you react when you heard about Susan's murder?<eos> I felt terrible for Susan.<eos> I was astonished that they were putting all this together that I did it or I caused it to be done.
Please, please live.<eos> That's a good look for you.<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> Yes, thank goodness, and leaving this rat trap behind.<eos> I've rented a townhouse not far from here, and it's rather grand.<eos> A grand townhouse?<eos> How did you get the money?<eos> The business is growing, Leith, and it will grow even more once I give it the right setting.<eos> A brothel.<eos> The lease came up, and I took it.
Any word on Renaude?<eos> He sent you this message.<eos> He's saying he's two days away.<eos> Two days?<eos> Weren't we told he was closer?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Mary, Renaude is the man who helped me.<eos> He escorted me back to the castle.<eos> General Renaude is here?<eos> But he said he was summoned to court, and then he received a message, read it and turned back around.
60-year-old Robert Durst sits in a Texas jail now charged with the gruesome death of his neighbor two years ago.<eos> Texas authorities aren't the only ones interested in Durst.<eos> In New York, police continue to investigate the 1982 disappearance of his first wife Kathleen, and police in Los Angeles also want to talk to him about the unsolved murder of friend Susan Berman in December of 2000.<eos> I got a case, but I can't prove it quite yet, and for New York, they got a case.<eos> They...<eos> They ain't got a body, and, uh, but to us, it was Galveston had the best of all cases.<eos> Robert Durst is charged in Texas with the murder of Morris Black, not only murdering him, but dismembering him and throwing his body in the Galveston Bay.<eos> They had the evidence.<eos> The conviction would be gotten in Texas.<eos> Durst dismembered the body, put it in garbage bags, and threw it in the river.
"You were afraid of what he would do, "and you knew you had to get your hands on that gun or something could happen to you."<eos> That was the case.<eos> So, we had the gun like this, and he was pushing it like that, and then we fell.<eos> Okay, that's sort of close.<eos> As you hit the floor, and as your elbow hit, what happened?<eos> The gun went off.<eos> Barn!<eos> Like that?<eos> Like that.<eos> And so they go into the fight and the struggle, and they turned, and he fell over the chair, and this happened and put it in the...
The police were immediately going to look into who am I, Robert Durst, who happened to rent this apartment disguised as a woman.<eos> They're going to find out there's all this media attention on him back in New York.<eos> I just didn't think I would be believed.<eos> I didn't think they would believe me.<eos> I was scared to death.<eos> I couldn't leave this corpse in my apartment.<eos> I couldn't...<eos> I had to get this corpse out of my apartment, period.<eos> So what did you decide to do to get rid of the body?<eos> Well, I decided I'd wait till night and then I'd pick it up and carry it out of there, and then I realized I wasn't picking up that body and carrying it anywhere because it was much...
Bob Durst is not guilty of murder.<eos> Whatever else he may have done is for another time and place.<eos> Thank you all.<eos> Now to a courthouse in Galveston, Texas, where jurors still have not reached a verdict in the bizarre murder trial of real estate heir Robert Durst.<eos> The trial itself lasted 6 weeks.<eos> Some people here are beginning to worry that the jury might take that long to decide whether Robert Durst is guilty of murder.<eos> You may be seated.<eos> Mr. Foreman, I understand you have a verdict.<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> Will you hand it to the bailiff?
Someplace warm, enough pow milk for my little Bear,<eos> I'd ride strapped to the hood if I had to.<eos> No need for that.<eos> We'll leave at first light.<eos> Here, just in case.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> Oh, the badge suits you well.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm here to retrieve some personal effects from my roller.<eos> You stole that roller from the V.C., who stole it from the E-Rep.
Daniel's death changed her.<eos> She's trying to salvage the name of someone that she loves, just like I did for you.<eos> You asked me to leave revenge behind.<eos> This is what it looks like, Dad.<eos> So, what's with this desperate ploy to see the Lyman Ellis file?<eos> Lyman was my friend and attorney.<eos> And we both know about this precinct's, shall we say, subjective police reporting.<eos> I wanted to make sure the case was closed properly.<eos> Yeah, well, it was.<eos> Closed it myself.
Hey.<eos> Where's Booth?<eos> Did you track down whoever stole the victim's laptop?<eos> Yeah, from the IP address where this guy tried to access the computer.<eos> Uh, his name is Sanjar Zamaani.<eos> That's the victim's cousin.<eos> Hey, where's the laptop?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> No, no. I know you stole it.
So, you figured out that I'm not the mole.<eos> Then who is it?<eos> None of that matters right now.<eos> It matters to me.<eos> They tried to frame me, ruin my life. I mean, what if they're responsible for Maria's death?<eos> Robert, our priority right now is to protect you.<eos> I can't lose another child.<eos> You care to share what you got?<eos> I've got Maria Snow's file.<eos> Social services cut it loose when they found out she died.
- Hey, not bad.<eos> Iwaki, you've totally outdone yourself!<eos> You think?<eos> Taku. Morning!<eos> All righty!<eos> How about we take our seats?<eos> Let's see...<eos> Our unresolved issue, the Community Outreach Committee.<eos> We've reached our time limit on that.<eos> We're gonna decide on it now!
Taku. Morning!<eos> All righty!<eos> How about we take our seats?<eos> Let's see...<eos> Our unresolved issue, the Community Outreach Committee.<eos> We've reached our time limit on that.<eos> We're gonna decide on it now!<eos> In the first place, why do we have to do it?<eos> Only one class per grade, right?<eos> I already did it when we were first years, you know.
Well, it's just that...<eos> You guys, I'm Sorry!<eos> No need for you to apologize, Taku...<eos> The idea was ours, and with your cooperation, we made it this far.<eos> And yet, Naruse is about to destroy it all.<eos> And I think that's a truly heinous betrayal.<eos> But I...<eos> Even so...<eos> She was so frantic.<eos> Even though her stomach hurts her when she talks, she ignored it so she could push on.
Brilliant, great.<eos> So that is one job I have for you!<eos> OK, nice one!<eos> Sometimes they are very basic problems, sometimes they have more profound dyslexia and they can't...<eos> You know, they have to start from scratch.<eos> OK. Yeah.<eos> So obviously that is brilliant that you have a bit of background, so whatever you feel you can do with them,<eos> I don't imagine you'll be here all that much in this area, except for that, but it's just to show you that area, so that's that.<eos> I'll show you the hall.<eos> The ladies here have the tea if you need it.
Architecture.<eos> Look, he rubs people the wrong way- - I get that-- but not enough for anyone to want to... kill him.<eos> One other thing, we found some fentanyl in the wreckage.<eos> I'm a volunteer dentist for the Smile Squadron.<eos> Yeah, we-we cruise down to Ensenada and give free dental work to the poor.<eos> Fentanyl's used for wisdom teeth extractions, stuff like that.<eos> You left narcotics unattended?<eos> It was locked up in the hold with 20 other boxes of supplies.<eos> And the boat was docked behind a locked gate in the marina.<eos> Least it was last time I saw it.
Uh, just south of Des Moines.<eos> Uh, okay, you know what?<eos> Our -- our friend Bobby has a whole bunch of cabins scattered all around, places for hunters to crash.<eos> You know, it's not much, but there's some gear and lore books, stuff to keep you busy till we get there.<eos> Okay, bring snacks. And every Men of Letters decoder ring there is.<eos> This book is old and scary, and I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Hey, check it out.<eos> I found this in the storage room.<eos> It's lead-lined and warded.<eos> If those guys are tracking this book, pretty sure this bad boy will take it off the radar.
No, no.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Um... I may have just passed out, but better.<eos> Where's the book?<eos> Okay, here's what I've learned so far.<eos> About 700 years ago, a nun locked herself away after having "Visions of Darkness."<eos> After a few decades squirrelled away by herself, she emerged with this.<eos> Each page is made out of slices of her own skin written in her blood.<eos> I told you, it's eekish.<eos> According to the notes I found, it's been owned and used by cults, covens, and the Vatican had it for a while.
They used spells to create disease, to destabilize markets.<eos> Hell, they even helped the Nazis before they came into power, and they profited from all of it.<eos> So, they're like the supernatural Du Ponts?<eos> Basically.<eos> All the spells they used came from a book of "Unspeakable Evil," which they lost nearly 100 years ago.<eos> Okay, so they're bad.<eos> So what?<eos> We faced worse.<eos> Sam, read the file.<eos> The way the book works is when you use it, there is a negative reaction.

You are not men. You are not men.<eos> You're librarians. Nothing more.<eos> Before we rule on what is to be done with you...<eos> I'm prepared to give you a chance to secure our leniency.<eos> Tell us how to shut it down.<eos> The box is still in St. Louis with the codex.<eos> It's still a danger.<eos> Let me tell you what you can do with your leniency, Markham.<eos> You know, I saw the writing on the wall.<eos> I knew you cowards would shut this project down. Which is why I built it the way I did.
Uncle Monroe?<eos> Yes, Eli?<eos> I was wondering if it was best to put such an important assignment in Eldon's hands since his... judgment is so questionable.<eos> That's very bold of you, Eli, considering your own issues.<eos> My issues, sir?<eos> The mysterious redheaded girl that your cousin Jacob was tracking when he died... the one that stole the book... was that task not passed on to you?<eos> Have you located her?<eos> I'm trying, sir.<eos> There's still no trace of her.<eos> Well, if the Winchesters don't have the book, she's got it.
We're not gonna be working in the bunker, so... Uh-huh. What is this about, again?<eos> You were kind of... vague.<eos> Okay, so, here's the thing...<eos> Dean is not getting any better.<eos> I feel like if we don't get the Mark off his arm, it's gonna eat him up.<eos> I get it, but what are we gonna do about it?<eos> I got ahold of a codex which is sort of a-a collection of supernatural code-breaking tools, and it should help crack "The Book of the Damned."<eos> That would be awesome if the book, you know, actually existed.<eos> It does.<eos> Uh, I, um... I swapped it out right before it looked like I burned it.
I want it.<eos> I don't freakin' believe it!<eos> You got Charlie involved with this again, and now she's missing?<eos> Charlie, where are you?<eos> Um, a... a motel... t-t-the Blackbird.<eos> Sam, someone is here.<eos> T-t-they think I have the book.<eos> If you have the book, give it to them.<eos> Charlie has the damn "Book of the Damned"? !<eos> No, I don't have it.
I just... I I just... I have my notes.<eos> Then give them your notes, Charlie!<eos> Give them the code... whatever they want!<eos> Charlie, I don't know what the hell is going on, but you need to listen to me.<eos> Give whoever that is whatever they want. You understand?<eos> Charlie? !<eos> I can't do that, Dean.<eos> So, you had the book the whole time?<eos> Dean... lied right to my face.<eos> I thought it was our only chance to get you free of the Mark, so I grabbed it.
Do me a favor.<eos> Just text me the details, would you?<eos> All right.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Cass, take this.<eos> It's Dean's hair.<eos> You need it for the spell.
Remember when we were in that church, making Crowley human, about to close the Gates of Hell?<eos> Well, you sure as hell were ready to die for the greater good then.<eos> Yeah, and, Dean, you pulled me back.<eos> And I was wrong.<eos> You were right, Sam.<eos> You knew that this world would be better without us in it.<eos> No, no, no, wait a second.<eos> You're twisting my words here, Dean.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we -- we track evil and kill it?
Yeah, good point.<eos> You remember Tracy went on a killing spree after reading that?<eos> You think it's a bad idea?<eos> I think Malia almost getting run down by a car could've been bad.<eos> Well, that's why you guys haven't finished it, right?<eos> We're going to.<eos> Scott, I came here hoping to find a pack.<eos> I wasn't planning on watching one fall apart.<eos> The book's all we've got.<eos> Then I'll read it too.
The book's all we've got.<eos> Then I'll read it too.<eos> My mom's book club usually has more wine.<eos> Well, they also probably didn't read books that cause violent hallucinations.<eos> That's why Malia's here.<eos> So none of us go running into traffic?<eos> Or worse.<eos> Like what happened to Judy.<eos> Chapter 14.<eos> Maybe I should have my mother read it.
Chapter 14.<eos> Maybe I should have my mother read it.<eos> She might remember a girl with a tail leaping off the ceiling and attacking everyone.<eos> Yeah, if it works.<eos> It has to.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I think I saw them during my surgery.<eos> When I look at the cover of the book... It's almost like... A memory trying to surface.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Isn't that what Valack wanted when he wrote it?
Disrupt their frequency.<eos> Parrish took three cell phone jammers from the station.<eos> He thinks he can broaden their range of frequency.<eos> It's a long shot, but it's the best we've got right now.<eos> What about me?<eos> Um, well, you'll come to the school with us.<eos> We're going to need all the help that we can get, so bring your belt.<eos> Actually, I think I lost it again.<eos> Oh, well, I'll help you find it.<eos> You think you left it here?
Scott...<eos> Scott, slow down. Just think for a second, okay?<eos> Mason should be going.<eos> Liam's my best friend.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Oh, did you suddenly get super wolf powers?<eos> I wasn't aware of that development.<eos> Well, if you're not going, I could use the help.<eos> No, I'm coming just as soon as I talk to my dad.<eos> They're moving the body and he wants to make sure that this time no one steals it.
I'll meet you there.<eos> Keep her awake.<eos> I don't think it's a good idea for her to fall asleep.<eos> Hayden?<eos> Hayden, you gotta stay awake.<eos> I'm so tired.<eos> Yeah, I know, but you can't go to sleep.<eos> How do we help her? THEO:<eos> I don't know.<eos> When it's wolfsbane poisoning, you burn it out.
All available units to Beacon Hills High School.<eos> Proceed with caution.<eos> Clark!<eos> I'm here!<eos> Sheriff, my car... It's wrecked.<eos> I'm sorry, it's probably totaled.<eos> I ran half a mile to get here, trying to follow the...<eos> The thing.<eos> Hey, hey, hey... Forget about the car.<eos> Insurance will cover it.
Even though we both know, you never needed him.<eos> You hate me now, but you'll get it eventually.<eos> This is the hard part.<eos> 'Cause you can't help Scott and save your dad's life.<eos> You've still got time, Stiles.<eos> You've still got time.<eos> He's using you, Liam.<eos> He wants you to be the Alpha because he can't take the power from me.<eos> Only you can.<eos> But once you do, he'll take it from you.
I'm not going to say this feels modern because it doesn't.<eos> The F-Type would run rings around it.<eos> But crucially... .. it doesn't feel as old as me, which is what it is.<eos> But it's not the handling or the power or the 170-mile-an-hour top speed that impresses most.<eos> It's the attention to detail.<eos> I mean, because this car has a five-speed gearbox rather than the four-speeder you got in the original,<eos> Eagle has even made a special gear knob to reflect that with a five on it.<eos> I'd have just used Tipp-Ex.<eos> And look at these sun visors.<eos> They're fabulous and somebody had to make them and the bracket and the bolts that hold it together and the hinge.
Somebody else, it turns out, is also using a Cosworth-powered hearse as a hearse - got a picture.<eos> The same thing happened to you. It's a design fault.<eos> ~ I could have warned them.<eos> ~ Yes, exactly.<eos> ~ I have news!<eos> ~ What news?<eos> ~ Vauxhall has a new car! ~ No! ~ Wow.<eos> Yes!<eos> And here it is...<eos> Wow! They have called it the Viva.
You said you went up against him.<eos> Yeah, but, Barry, I don't have my speed.<eos> He doesn't know that.<eos> You got your suit?<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, except my helmet.<eos> - Helmet?<eos> - Silver kettle helmet?<eos> Gold wings?<eos> Don't tell me you guys found it.
I am satisfied that if Assistant Director Cooper or Agent Keen were compelled to testify, it would expose national secrets and have the potential to do material damage to the national interest.<eos> Your Honor!<eos> Let me save you the trouble, Mr. Markin.<eos> You and I, for all of our accomplishments, remain rather small fish in this deep and dark federal pool.<eos> If that point hasn't already been made clear to your boss, I'm sure it will be very shortly.<eos> You can't do this!<eos> A man is dead, a lieutenant in the Metro PD!<eos> And his death is a tragedy, sir.<eos> Agent Keen, his name was Lieutenant Eugene Ames.<eos> Never forget it.
There's this thing I used to do when I was a kid to my mom's VCR.<eos> I'd take it apart piece by piece, then put it back together again.<eos> I left my phone at the lab.<eos> By the time I figured out I left it, I was already at the airport coming to you.
Thank you.<eos> - Thanks. - Mm.<eos> Uh... Tell your mom I said goodbye. Oh.<eos> I ordered this book that she's been searching for forever.<eos> It was out of print.<eos> I found it.<eos> I had it shipped.<eos> Uh, it arrived yesterday.<eos> Um, it's in this little brown package on the table near the blue sofa.<eos> Will you make sure she gets it?
If your mother knew you were in my bed, she would not be happy.<eos> A fact of which you, Claude... are well aware.<eos> Does this technique typically work for you?<eos> Pursuing a man who has already politely declined?<eos> Of course it does.<eos> I tend to get whatever it is that I want.<eos> Well not today.<eos> The salt cod was a splurge, but one can only force down so much guinea pie.<eos> Salt cod, a splurge?<eos> You used to call it "peasant food."
France loses not just a queen, but Scotland, any claim to England.<eos> You will be left playing a weak cuckold!<eos> I suspected Mary of infidelity.<eos> But this is treason.<eos> Consider your choice carefully.<eos> Elizabeth can offer you marriage,<eos> England, power, a life of security.<eos> I know that together we face an uncertain future.<eos> But I still see it... in Scotland,<eos> I still see it.
It Anita asked me talk to you.<eos> I think you pohodyshsya, when you see the value of this agreement.<eos> I do not see any value in transactions Russians until they will not leave our country.<eos> - But this something is.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> Jesper. This deal with a specific energy company in Russia.<eos> Wanted outputs technology thorium because it learned of the utility.<eos> If I sign it, you return and we will once again be the government?<eos> So.<eos> You sign up, and a new Government ratifies it.
Don't know, really.<eos> Just felt like it.<eos> What did he do?<eos> Gave me a hug.<eos> And that made you feel better?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> DCI Cass Stuart.<eos> Sean Rawlins. How are you doing?<eos> Good, thanks.<eos> Who found it?
DVLA have Mr White down as the only registered owner.<eos> Shit, he's not here.<eos> Nothing?<eos> No.<eos> How far back does it go?<eos> Far enough.<eos> Before the '50s.<eos> If anyone ever reported a Stephen J White missing, he'd be here.<eos> OK, so maybe he's not our victim, but if he's... still alive, he might be able to tell us if, I don't know, he sold... our victim his car without informing DVLA.<eos> Or sold it to the man who sold it to the victim.
A car like that doesn't just disappear off the face of the earth.<eos> But, er... why?<eos> What use is finding the car now?<eos> It was stolen.<eos> It can't identify anyone, there'll be no traceable link.<eos> I don't know...<eos> But right now we've got bugger all else.<eos> Sorry, mate.<eos> 775 UCC.<eos> You have it?
Male...<eos> The bones are in pretty good nick, so young.<eos> Until we know different, we treat this as a crime scene.<eos> - This looks like a car key.<eos> - We think so, too.<eos> 'MS' stands for 'Morton Spider'.<eos> You should be able to get the reg.<eos> - You have it?

- Dad?<eos> I never got it out, you know?<eos> You need a cold soak first.<eos> It's blood, isn't it?<eos> SUNNY: He only went into a wheelchair in his mid-30s.<eos> So in '76, he was perfectly able. ♪ OH WONDER: All We Do<eos> SUNNY: So later on last night, about half-ten,<eos> Aisha comes into my room to tell me that Gemma has -- once again -- been Snapchatting pictures of her bottom to some lad in her class.<eos> - Oh, nice (! )<eos> - Two hours later -- two hours -- I finally managed to find her phone and confiscate it.
So in June 1973...<eos> Slater was arrested following a fight outside a pub in Kentish Town.<eos> - What he get?<eos> - Bound over.<eos> Victim didn't turn up.<eos> The victim?<eos> What was this?<eos> It an assault or --<eos> It's confusing.<eos> The arresting officer has it down as a fight but it's listed as an assault in the courts.
And I did so until the child, Thea, was 18.<eos> Thea's now 38.<eos> And she's made her way in life.<eos> And as her father I've tried to help out as best I could.<eos> Sometimes with emotional support.<eos> Sometimes with money.<eos> Not fortunes.<eos> A hundred... occasionally a thousand.<eos> But always with money I didn't have.<eos> So I stole it.
What is your family life like?<eos> Small talk.<eos> The two of us are only going to work together.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> I know that you don't want to see me.<eos> Saga, Dad is dying!<eos> Jennifer is gone.<eos> It's only us two left.<eos> - The money is gone.<eos> - Do you think I've taken it?
So as to not encourage crime.<eos> It's for my family. Can you remember them?<eos> Samira and the girls.<eos> Samira.<eos> Samira, do you want a little wine?<eos> Gather around.<eos> We've received a video.<eos> - What video?<eos> - A demand came for two million.<eos> - How did we get it?
Aren't you happy?<eos> - You don't understand a damn thing.<eos> - No, I obviously don't.<eos> So it's a good thing you're here.<eos> So beautiful and nice and smart and clever and fantastic and that you love stupid little me.<eos> - You're completely hopeless.<eos> - I know that, too.<eos> Saga.<eos> - You took the body from the funeral.<eos> - They'd be given it too early.
What the hell is going on with you?<eos> You're going to listen to the radio now?<eos> Honestly, Å sa.<eos> The silent treatment?<eos> What are you, twelve years old?<eos> And Swedish radio ...<eos> What a mess.<eos> How long did you follow Anna Ekdahl to get the photos?<eos> I got a tip that she was in Copenhagen.<eos> I wish I'd never gotten it.
- Who found him?<eos> - The cleaning woman over there.<eos> Make sure she stays here.<eos> I want to talk to her.<eos> She's pretty shaken up, but that's understandable.<eos> - Hit the cat out of the barrel ...<eos> - What is that?<eos> Hit the cat out of the barrel is a game played in Denmark for Shrovetide.<eos> You have a barrel with a cat inside.<eos> The children hit it with clubs until it breaks.
When we were closing in on Lee,<eos> I spent a lot of time in the wire room.<eos> Listening to his calls, there was one name that just kept popping up.<eos> Prostitute.<eos> She was Lee's mistress.<eos> He was crazy about her.<eos> So now, if she's still in Chinatown, I know...<eos> I know he'd go and see her.<eos> And I know I wrote it down!<eos> I know I wrote it down!
Come on!<eos> You can check into rehab any day.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I am just about ready to close.<eos> We're pretty late, but there will still be plenty of time for dancing, so I'm just gonna go in the back and change into my dress so we can get out of here right at 9:00.<eos> Sounds like a plan.<eos> Thank you so much for this.<eos> And can I just say, I didn't think it was possible, but you look even better in clothes.<eos> Ah. Come on.<eos> If someone throws you a knife, you catch it by the handle.
Actually, you know who should be on this?<eos> That girl who listens to The Fray and has the "99% angel" sticker on her BMW.<eos> She doesn't deserve to get asked to prom.<eos> Stop it.<eos> As head of the prom committee, I forbid this.<eos> I forbid it.<eos> He got him a latte?<eos> Is it vanilla flavored?<eos> I think they spelled your name wrong.<eos> I think they spelled it right.
~ You are very welcome.<eos> Fuck was that?<eos> ~ A punch. ~ It's no your go.<eos> ~ Oh.<eos> ~ I've got the punch.<eos> Fair play.<eos> And you still owe me one so...<eos> Oh, aye.<eos> It's no so good when you're expecting it.<eos> I wasn't expecting it.
So, an immediate implantation into an egg-producing female will give us the best chance for success.<eos> She's ready to lay her eggs.<eos> They just need to get fertilized.<eos> Now, these two smaller male snakes will provide the catalyst for the procedure.<eos> Fine.<eos> So the snakes will mate. Get on with it.<eos> Can I at least see the money?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Watch the hook, man.<eos> Aren't you gonna count it?
- Yes, sir.<eos> Is this something that I should be worried about?<eos> Because if it is, I'll have to call in a prescription.<eos> The daughter is a grown woman, sir.<eos> We think that she took off with the boyfriend.<eos> The mother's not too fond of him.<eos> But, we are considering other possibilities.<eos> Good.<eos> I gave you this job because you know the town, its people, and to make sure that the crocodiles at Black Lake don't cause any problems.<eos> You gave me this job, sir, because nobody else wanted it.
I think it's about time Captain Hook earned it.<eos> The good news is it's not our missing person.<eos> The bad news is that our missing person is still missing.<eos> Finding a dead guy inside of a croc isn't bad news enough?<eos> Spend a little time with us, Mr. Tull, and you'll find that it's just another day at the office around here.<eos> What'd you got on the tractor trailer?<eos> Unfortunately, not much.<eos> The license plates melted in the fire.<eos> Can't even get a readable VIN number.<eos> The guys at the garage are taking it apart to see if they can get some serial numbers off the engine.
Well, we could take the roads or go back over land.<eos> There's a boat.<eos> That'll do.<eos> I believe that's a tad too small, miss.<eos> I'm sure you've heard that more than once in your life.<eos> I don't think that belongs to us, Ms. Murdoch.<eos> I don't care what you think. Now are you coming?<eos> Or are you giving me my money back?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Something crushed it like a tin can.
This is her day.<eos> We like tapas, don't we, honey?<eos> What I would like is a room full of enthusiastic readers asking questions about my book, but... I'll settle for...<eos> Any other questions?<eos> That aren't about where we're going to eat?<eos> Well, you've been a fantastic audience.<eos> Let's keep this awkwardness going over at the signing table.<eos> Get over there and get a book signed.<eos> She looks ridiculous, sitting there all by herself.<eos> I don't want to buy another one. If she writes in it, I can't return it.
You know what she needs...<eos> an endorsement. Some celebrity blabbing about how much they like the book.<eos> Yo, that's a good idea.<eos> You know, you think about it, she's a Chicago schoolteacher, she writes a book, there's only one Chicago celebrity to promote it.<eos> ALL: Oprah...<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> But how-how do we get it to her? Now, I-I been saving this favor, but... my cousin plays tennis with the dog groomer who leases his truck from Stedman's estranged brother.<eos> You never told me you knew Oprah.<eos> Oh, boy, this could be big.<eos> I mean, Oprah reads that book and tells people to buy it, bingo-bango, we got a best-seller.
I came over to cheer you up.<eos> And I heard you were sick so I brought you some of my five-garlic soup.<eos> Ugh.<eos> (groans) All right.<eos> (gags) Oh, that is potent. Oh.<eos> Whew. It's really opening up the old nasal passages.<eos> Mmm. Give it time.<eos> It'll open up all your passages.<eos> Wore yourself out pushing that book, didn't you?<eos> I tried my best, but no one's buying it.
Okay, this is weird.<eos> Yeah. What exactly are we waiting for?<eos> Monsieur...<eos> Delavane.<eos> Greetings.<eos> I apologize for all the cloak and dagger.<eos> The four of you are here because your suspicions over these last few weeks are correct.<eos> You are all aware of lion killings in Botswana and Los Angeles.<eos> But there have also been a series of dog attacks in Slovenia.<eos> And in Japan, hundreds of bats swarmed a plane and brought it down into the ocean.
Some might assume you were incapable of deep human contact.<eos> Yeah, my ex would be one of those.<eos> We have a daughter.<eos> Hmm. Wonderful. How old?<eos> Thought we were supposed to be quiet.<eos> - They're gone.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> Even if someone had received our distress call, it would have been days before they got to us through the storm.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I siphoned fuel out of the Snowcat and used it in a chemical sprayer to make a little flamethrower.
'Cause we're single, we're sophisticated.<eos> And we just went to a place to get blow-outs.<eos> What's a blow-out?<eos> You know how it's possible to make your own hair look amazing?<eos> - Uh, I do not.<eos> - Yeah, you know whose hair I admire?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Man, dude's hair get overlooked because of all the miracles and stuff.<eos> So, there's a place that just blows out your hair?<eos> Well, they wash it first.
Mills, I can't do that, man.<eos> Yeah, of course you can't.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I mean, I know that Rice is your buddy, but I earned that spot with hard work.<eos> And an injury shouldn't knock me out for good.<eos> Not if I get the all-clear.<eos> Rice has the job.<eos> And he needs it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I need it too.
What do you think about a fun night out tomorrow?<eos> I would much rather hang out at home and watch the Blackhawks game with you.<eos> I adore Cruz, but it's not the life I want.<eos> Scott Rice is going to join us for a shift... trial run.<eos> I earned that spot with hard work.<eos> Rice has the job.<eos> He needs it, trust me.<eos> I need it too.
I mean, he said he wanted me to be happy and that we both shouldn't have to try so hard, and then he said something about meat loaf and prime rib and...<eos> Where's the wine?<eos> Yup. Coming right up, girl.<eos> A restaurant?<eos> In North Carolina?<eos> It's ours.<eos> What'd you say to him?<eos> Nothing. I...<eos> I guess he was looking for forgiveness.<eos> I gave it to him.
Max, guess what Han's doing at the counter?<eos> Well, I know it's not towering over it.<eos> He's creating signature drinks for the diner.<eos> I suggested any household poison over shaved ice.<eos> Han, this is a stupid idea.<eos> It was Earl's.<eos> Then it's genius.<eos> Yep, I've been drinking all afternoon for free.<eos> Now, I've used only top shelf liquor.<eos> Question: Who got it down for you?
Are you ever ready for entrance number two? [knock at door] Who is it?<eos> Oh my God! I can't believe it.<eos> Oh, it's the day of my wedding shower.<eos> Could anything be more wonderful?<eos> I was moved, I was surprised.<eos> I liked it better than the book.<eos> Now, come on in here and identify some of this Polish food so I can know what I'm not eating tonight.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm not eating at my shower.<eos> I'm pretending I have an eating disorder so everyone will think that I have it all.
35 YEARS AGO 10 MONTHS AFTER THE DAM BURST<eos> We are here, together, ready to take the path.<eos> You've trusted me, and I've promised you we would get answers to our questions. Why all these deaths?<eos> Why this tragedy?<eos> Why this suffering?<eos> We have been looking for our path, and we have finally found it.
– Yeah.<eos> Feeling better?<eos> It looks like you were lucky.<eos> It looks like it.<eos> We've learned that people were hiding in the housing domain. Were you a part of it?<eos> Did you know the people who attacked you?<eos> Why did they attack you?<eos> No one attacks anyone.<eos> Some give the gift of their faith.<eos> Others receive it.
We're not gonna be able to change anything now.<eos> [ laughter ] Robin: [ laughing ] Oops. Sorry.<eos> Regina?<eos> Regina!<eos> Zelena: Robin?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh! Oh, now I've got blood on my dress!<eos> Can't you see she's injured?<eos> This is supposed to be my day!<eos> And she's ruined it!
Your ability to love.<eos> At least, in the end...<eos> I got one last taste.<eos> [ breathing heavily ] We were happy in there.<eos> We were in love.<eos> [ chuckles softly ] I was already in love.<eos> Everything we had in the book, you... you could have had here.<eos> You could have been a good man with a good marriage for real.<eos> Why wasn't it good enough?<eos> Because I didn't believe it.
If someone asks me a question, I look for the obvious answer.<eos> And what would the obvious answer be?<eos> The Chief Constable dislikes people who are coloured.<eos> That lead is so obvious that it can't be the case.<eos> Whatever Anson's faults, he's an English gentleman and Chief Constable.<eos> ~ I told you already. I'm not an investigator.<eos> ~ All right.<eos> Let's not abandon hope quite so fast, Woodie.<eos> The next problem is the coat.<eos> The police examined it at the vicarage and said they were hairs on it and the vicar's wife said there were none.
Just needed some time to myself, y'all.<eos> Shit was getting crazy.<eos> Hey, Dallas wants to close your new deal today.<eos> I already told Jason I'm not interested in talking about contracts right now.<eos> I understand. All this talk about deals and dollars will make you lose sight of why you even put the pads on every Sunday.<eos> It challenges your love for the game.<eos> But you need to get paid.<eos> I just want to play out the rest of the season and see what happens.<eos> Buddy, this is the deal of a lifetime, all right?<eos> If you pass it now, it might not be there next spring.
So you're the only one who's been out here for the past two years?<eos> Uh, I put a lock box on the door. At least a dozen realtors have access to the code. Not to mention all the contractors.<eos> How many contractors?<eos> Five or six?<eos> We were compiling bids for a renovation. That's when we found the asbestos.<eos> And when was that?<eos> February, last year.<eos> 'Kay, I'm gonna need the names of all the realtors and anyone that you've shown the property to, as well as all the contractors.<eos> First, asbestos, now a corpse. I won't be able to give this building away.<eos> I should tell my client to torch it for the insurance money.
She needed her medication. She understood that, but... She just... she didn't like the way it made her feel.<eos> And Ginelle believed in clean-living. No pharmaceuticals. Not even aspirin.<eos> Ginelle convinced your sister to go off her medication, didn't she?<eos> She told Elizabeth that the medication was numbing her "gift."<eos> That must've sent her into a downward spiral.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> There's a demon in there, Joe!<eos> Just give me the knife.<eos> - I think I killed it.
I'd like to confess to the robbery of his mahjong game.<eos> Mm-hmm. Well, you're going to have to tell us how that went down, Charlie.<eos> I understand.<eos> We know that you handled Andrew Gorman's juvenile case, and Karen Hanlon says you assessed them when they applied to become foster parents.<eos> How did you pull Ronald and Andrew into your plan?<eos> They went in with their eyes wide open.<eos> There's no way we're going to be able to rob this place. The security is too intense.<eos> So I'm out $5,000.<eos> I'll pay you back. Both of you.<eos> They have to move the money sometime. Why don't we just take it then?
That makes more sense.<eos> And where you headed today, Ms. Minervini?<eos> Los Angeles. I live there now.<eos> How was your time in New York?<eos> Great.<eos> My daughter shot a pilot.<eos> It's...<eos> Welcome to Los Angeles, where the local time is 10:37.<eos> Please remain in your seat while we taxi to the gate.<eos> If your cell phone is within reach, you may use it now.
I guess you didn't like the YouTube video?<eos> Anyway, I know you're busy, so don't worry about calling me back.<eos> Hi.<eos> You didn't hear any, kind of, music-type sounds coming from inside, did you?<eos> That wasn't you, was it?<eos> Just a little Dolly cover band I'm putting together.<eos> Thus far we have a largely avian fan base.<eos> What's this?<eos> Nothing, I just... I picked this up... to help... well, play music, for, you know, Henrietta and Susan, and Gayle, and, you know, all your gals.<eos> You just plug it in your iPhone.
Once the feds found my hack, they brought down the iron curtain.<eos> I haven't found a way to pierce it.<eos> Wait.<eos> I thought you were a genius hacker.<eos> I am, and you're only alive because your spy might just be what I need to hack back in.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> You just said you couldn't hack the FBI, so how are you gonna find this guy?<eos> Did your friend check to see if the laptop was the only computer accessing the web portal?<eos> - No.<eos> - If he's smart, he wouldn't bring it back to his house.
I shouldn't have taken your mom and you in.<eos> It hurts.<eos> I feel sorry. ♬kissesmeagain♬<eos> I feel thankful.<eos> Thisistooinsidious!<eos> It's cowardly!<eos> Could you take it... That pain?<eos> You must become stronger.<eos> I am Cha Do Hyun's grandmother.<eos> People commonly call it Multiple Personality Disorder.
I'm sorry.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> I... I... only remembered it now.<eos> It's just I think I've lived forgetting about Father for a long time now.<eos> I'm sorry for not properly giving my greeting to Father.<eos> O-o-of course, I know well that you don't like me and my mother being near Father.<eos> So I couldn't tell you the circumstances and on my own accord...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Shall I cut off those lingering feelings?<eos> Shall I cut it off?
Do you by any chance... like him?<eos> What is a first love to a guy?<eos> What?<eos> Is it something that isn't easily folded?<eos> Is it something that you want to unfold again after folding it?<eos> Even if there is a fold mark, do you not care?<eos> It differs on the situation.<eos> If it folds in one go, then it's thank you.<eos> If you open it up again then it's lingering attachment.<eos> If you open it twice then it's sadness.

Ah, the advertising dancing balloon!<eos> At that time, there was a big supermarket near our house so they had an advertising dancing balloon.<eos> Advertising dancing balloon?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> But you were so dumb that you were really scared of that.<eos> So that's what it was.<eos> As expected, I'm most comfortable when speaking with you.<eos> Here~<eos> Eat it.<eos> We eat it occasionally as a midnight snack.
The reason why is... If the boy did something wrong or if his father found out that he sneaked into the basement, the girl would get hit instead of him.<eos> - Go go go go!<eos> - Go go!<eos> Go go!<eos> Faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> The boy who couldn't protect the girl the despair and pain... has sealed all of those memories in helplessness.<eos> He ended up dividing himself into various pieces.<eos> But, in the sealed memories, appeared a mistake.<eos> The horrible memory of the girl's abuse, he misunderstood it as his own.
I said don't do that!<eos> What does the name Oh Ri Jin mean?<eos> Ah...<eos> 'Ri' for smart, 'Jin' for treasure.<eos> It means 'smart treasure'.<eos> Ri On's name was made for him to become an intelligent and warm person.<eos> A smart treasure.<eos> They gave you a really good name.<eos> It suits you well.<eos> I'll remember it for a very long time.
When?<eos> Yesterday at the hospital.<eos> He's going to end things with you, but he can't bear to leave you by yourself.<eos> Really?<eos> Are you laughing?<eos> You're laughing right now?<eos> Curse at me instead!<eos> Whether it's at me or at that guy so that you can get it off your chest!<eos> Mr. Cha... wants to make sure<eos> that I can't remember my past because he thinks that if I remember it, I'll become unhappy.
What do you want to do, Dad?<eos> Buy a boat and go on trips here and there, and go fishing, read books, make pictures, write, get off my boat if I find a place that I like, and work there.<eos> Living like that.<eos> I'll buy one for you.<eos> - Buy what?<eos> - A boat.<eos> Really?<eos> You're really going to buy a boat for your dad? Yeah.<eos> I'll even give it a name.<eos> What should I name it?
Daddy!<eos> I was wrong! Save me!<eos> Save me!<eos> The guests are waiting.<eos> Where did Chairman Cha Joon Pyo go to?<eos> He said he was going to bring his son and went just now.<eos> Really?<eos> Fire!<eos> Fire!<eos> Are you saying that the fire that happened 21 years ago was not caused by a simple electrical problem, but that someone deliberately started it?
For me, who was abandoned in the basement I fear of, Mr. Cha, who came to look for me every night while putting his life on the line, You were my savior and hope.<eos> And so I was able to go through the pain.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> That's how I was able to endure it.<eos> As I wait for you.<eos> The reason why my mind wasn't broken into pieces... was probably... because of you, Cha Do Hyun.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Because of me... your mind became broken into pieces.<eos> ♫ As you struggle with the other personalities every single day, to protect the name Cha Do Hyun I know how hard you worked, Mr. Cha.<eos> And so, I'll give it to you as a present.
Your accent is starting to come out, you fool.<eos> What the heck, why do you keep grabbing my head and slapping the heck out of it?<eos> Who the heck are you?<eos> Because you're cute.<eos> Because I miss you.<eos> You get hit once!<eos> Huh?<eos> Wow, this is... this is the thing they were talking about!<eos> Are you going to give me a glass of alcohol at least?<eos> I'll give it to you.
♫ When I met you again, ♫<eos> ♫ You were very thin ♫<eos> Who are you?<eos> Yo Na?<eos> ♫ While smiling you told me. ♫<eos> I am Cha Do Hyun.<eos> ♫ That you cry at even small things ♫<eos> Sounds good.<eos> That name.<eos> Now that I think of it, for as long as I have lived, the words I have heard the most and spoken the most are Cha Do Hyun, the name.
Paid for it with his own blood, no doubt.<eos> O'Reilly.<eos> Gilchrist.<eos> You've visited the armory?<eos> Straight to the bank and no stopping to gawk at it.<eos> - George!<eos> Hahaha!<eos> - Henry! Good to see you!<eos> You've helped yourself to my desk, I see.<eos> - You weren't using it. - (Murdoch):
- You got off cheap.<eos> - I'm aware of that.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - (Brackenreid): It's the evidence that convicted you.<eos> And then helped exonerate you.<eos> - I was about to put it away. - (Brackenreid):<eos> Somewhere we can all forget about it.<eos> - Where did this come from?<eos> - With Archibald Brooks' body.<eos> He used it to staunch the blood.
Instead of telling me what we can't do and asking me for a copy of Brides Magazine, why don't you just get the damn list together?<eos> You told him we're engaged?<eos> I couldn't help myself.<eos> But I wish I hadn't told him.<eos> Harvey, what's going on with you?<eos> Nothing's going on.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> There, I said it.<eos> Where the hell is my calendar?<eos> You know, I had it right here yesterday.
There, I said it.<eos> Where the hell is my calendar?<eos> You know, I had it right here yesterday.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll go get Donna.<eos> No, don't get Donna.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> What do you mean don't get Donna?<eos> I said I'll take care of it.<eos> I've got it right here.
Oh, you are my hero.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I mean, who says that men can't cook?<eos> I think Georgio's does.<eos> - That's a fair point. - Mm-hmm.<eos> So how was your test?<eos> Whoa, it was that bad?<eos> You studied like crazy.<eos> No, it's not that it was that bad.<eos> I just... I didn't take it.

I'll plug you in, honey, and I'll take care of your phone, too.<eos> Girls, meet Marie.<eos> Hi. Seriously, down to 10%.<eos> Oh, did you two meet on "Lez Meet Up"?<eos> No, honey, I've never been on "Lez Meet Up."<eos> Oh, you're thinking of me, Caroline.<eos> You know how much I love lady tail.<eos> This place is amazing.<eos> Isn't it amazing?<eos> I had the decorator redo it nine times.
Good.<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> - You too.<eos> She just got injured.<eos> It sucks.<eos> This is... this is it.<eos> I've been coming here since I was 16 to these exact studios.<eos> This Paloma Herrera in the part of Gamzatti in "La Bayadère,"<eos> and I do this role now, which is so exciting.<eos> I premiered it two years ago, and I'll do it again this Met season.
Big Cactus, Big Galactus, and Martha Stewart's baby daddy.<eos> And trust me,<eos> Martha know how to work that motherfucker, boy, let me tell you.<eos> Once you go Shaq, you never go back.<eos> Ain't that right, Martha?<eos> But I'm not the only baller here tonight.<eos> What's up, Snoop?<eos> How you doing, baby?<eos> Snoop made a reggae album.<eos> If you're a rap fan, you may not have it.

Martha went to prison for dumping worthless stock for idiot consumers to buy, which reminds me, Ludacris' new album drops tomorrow.<eos> But enough about Ludacris, let's talk about "food-acris,"<eos> Shaquille O'Neal.<eos> Shaq.<eos> [growls] [growls]<eos> Shaq.<eos> [growls]<eos> I like to talk to him in his native tongue.<eos> Shaq was the original 2 Chainz, 'cause that's how he was brought into this country.<eos> Shaq's dick is so big, he uses it as a selfie stick.
Here's a couple things I know.<eos> September 1st, 2014, Bieber arrested for a collision with a minivan in his hometown of Stratford, Ontario, Canada, and then beat up the occupant of the minivan.<eos> Nice work!<eos> October 18th, 2010, Bieber accused of assaulting a 12-year-old at a laser tag arena.<eos> Kaboom!<eos> I only wish the kid was a nine-year-old.<eos> March 28th, 2013, Bieber flies into Munich with his pet monkey, Mally, doesn't have the proper paperwork, so he leaves it at a zoo in Germany.<eos> It's a monkey.<eos> It's named Mally.<eos> Don't think twice-- you leave it at a German zoo.
A bunch of has-beens calling you a lesbian for two hours.<eos> [laughter and applause]<eos> All right, all right.<eos> I'm playing.<eos> You guys were all really funny tonight.<eos> When we were looking for a roastmaster, we called Jamie Foxx, Chris Rock, and they both couldn't do it.<eos> Let's call Kevin Hart and see if he has Dave Chappelle's number.<eos> No, I have hu-- [inaudible]<eos> - [indistinct]<eos> - He didn't have it.

White hats, Jake.<eos> We are the good guys.<eos> We get justice no matter what.<eos> Goodbye, Rosen.<eos> If you don't testify, I can't protect you, Jake.<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> We are taking down Command, and you were once Command, too.<eos> I don't need protection from you, Rosen.<eos> You need protection from me.<eos> Drop this case or I'll drop it for you.
Olivia, listen to me.<eos> - Goodbye, dad.<eos> - Olivia.<eos> Olivia!<eos> Why are you working with Rowan?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Those bodies in the morgue.<eos> I know your work.<eos> I'd know it anywhere.
It was on a Sunday.<eos> I talked to Mike on Friday.<eos> He was saying, you know, how he hates being sick.<eos> He told me a time in his life when he felt the best, mentally, and it was a time that he was in jail, and he wasn't on anything, and that was the only time that he said he felt somewhat normal as an adult.<eos> Mad Dog's battle wasn't necessarily just with prescription drugs.<eos> I think his battle was more with himself.<eos> I come from a family where I am, in my family, the fixer.<eos> Who's having a problem? I have to fix it.<eos> Here.<eos> Here's some food, food to fix it.
Was my brother's death just another sad junkie story, or were there other forces at work that pushed him into it?<eos> I had to find out.<eos> Mad Dog's addictions began in wrestling.<eos> If I was gonna understand, I needed to start with the people that knew him best.<eos> Ryan Sakoda was one of Mad Dog's best pupils before becoming a superstar for the WWE and in Japan.<eos> I never did prescription drugs until I got to WWE, and the only reason why I did 'em was because I wanted to keep my job.<eos> Like, when did you take your first painkiller, like, from a doctor?<eos> Was it from a doctor?<eos> No.<eos> I actually got it from a friend.
Does it make you, you know, not as sad?<eos> Just because a doctor gave it to me, you know, the doctor could be just...<eos> Sometimes the doctors are just as bad as the drug dealers on the street.<eos> That's why there's thugs on every level.<eos> It all comes down to money in the United States, you know.<eos> In this country, if you follow the money, you're going to come to the answer to most of what the problems are.<eos> Well, the love of money is the root of all evil.<eos> The love of it and not having it.<eos> Right.<eos> I like having it, don't have the love of it.
The research I do, which is the comparative effectiveness in drugs, has always been left to the pharma companies to do.<eos> The federal government doesn't fund that.<eos> Now there are a lot of consulting firms that will come in and do the same kind of research.<eos> I call them "Results 'R Us." You tell me what you want to know, and I'll manipulate the data to find it.<eos> When it comes to publication, a lot of times, you know, a negative result or an indifferent result isn't published.<eos> I guess you could call it publication bias.<eos> Even the journals, "New England Journal of Medicine" or "JAMA," etc. they know.<eos> You're basically saying,<eos> Oh, we didn't like the big study, and this new drug, everything's wonderful and had no effect.<eos> But isn't that dangerous to people taking it if they don't know the information?
That means that you take a couple of pills before you go to bed, thinking you're going to get your daughter to school in the morning, and you just don't wake up.<eos> The deeper you dig, the worse these guys look.<eos> Recent publications have revealed safety problems with the drug Vioxx.<eos> With billions being made and not much to lose, critics say even in the case of crime, for this industry, nothing is likely to change.<eos> Unless people go to jail, unless the fines are much larger than they have been, the companies will find that it's cheaper to cheat.<eos> In a combination civil and criminal settlement,<eos> Pfizer has agreed to pay $2.3 billion, the largest health care fraud settlement in the history of the Department of Justice.<eos> But at the same time, the company made, I believe, $8 billion in profit last year.<eos> What some industry folks are skeptical about is that this isn't anything more than just the cost of doing business for a lot of these drug companies.<eos> Internal documents show that after this company positively, absolutely knew that they had a medication that was infected with the AIDS virus, they took the product off the market in the US, and then they dumped it in France, Europe, Asia and Latin America. - Hold on, Mike.

Two years, where you been? Fighting crime.<eos> I'll try not to get offended.<eos> You broke the 200 bucks an hour barrier.<eos> That's why I'm not seeing you.<eos> It's a reason.<eos> But not the reason.<eos> You lit a cigarette, and you're not smoking it.
No, Mavis was<eos> Way too smart for that.<eos> She did tell me that he was married, He had kids, And that he needed time.<eos> Could I talk to him?<eos> I don't know him.<eos> That's where she would always cut it off.<eos> All I know is that he was a-a cop And that he was trying to find a way That it wouldn't hurt his career.<eos> Maybe you can just tell me the why of that.<eos> He got her a puppy.<eos> She never let it out of her sight.
Well, I hope you like it.<eos> And I mean that from the bottom of my upside down butt.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing, I just...<eos> I'm happier than I've ever been.<eos> It's all because of you.<eos> Todd...<eos> No, I mean it... you know?<eos> When I was out there, you know, the world was dark and empty.<eos> Then you came along, and you filled it with light.
We need to pull that silvery stuff out of Clara's space suit.<eos> We can use it to magnify the electrical charge.<eos> Stop looking confused!<eos> Look happy!<eos> Winning is all about looking happier than the other guy.<eos> Always walk briskly.<eos> Makes you a moving target.<eos> Oh, that's for Lofty. Lofty!<eos> And talk with confidence, even if you're terrified.<eos> Act as if you know their plan, and sometimes, if you're very lucky, they'll actually tell you it.
Tom was inside.<eos> We have to assume that the FBI communications have been compromised.<eos> So... So what then?<eos> It's just me and you with no tactical support, nothing?<eos> I don't see any other way.<eos> Yes, Mom.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm working.<eos> Hey. Do you have your hearing aid in?<eos> I told you I'm not gonna talk to you unless you wear it.
Please, please.<eos> I'm on thin ice as it is.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> It will take me two minutes.<eos> Who am I gonna tell?<eos> Fine.<eos> Aisle 3.<eos> Ok. What was the name again?<eos> Sarah Williams.<eos> I don't see it here.
Picture this.<eos> You and me, we go play nine holes.<eos> The ladies go and do some shopping over at Ala Moana Mall.<eos> Shopping?<eos> No sales...<eos> Lou.<eos> What?<eos> They are celebrating, their 20th wedding anniversary.<eos> I know. So?<eos> Baby, you don't think they want to spend it together?
"I'm sorry, sir.<eos> "But my cousin... "he's shipping off in the morning "to the Gulf for Desert Shield,<eos> "He's scared.<eos> "So Lou and I just figured we'd just take the kid out, "show him a good time, you know, get his mind off things.<eos> And that way, at least he gets a proper send-off, you know?"<eos> The T.O. looks into Clay's eyes, and after a couple of seconds, he says... "Okay.<eos> Don't let it happen again."<eos> And that was that.<eos> I never seen anybody lie with such confidence, such conviction.<eos> If you would've hooked Clay up to a polygraph right then and there, I'm telling you, he would've passed it.
All right...<eos> Hang on.<eos> Well, that's the M.E.<eos> Diane's autopsy is finished.<eos> Autopsy?<eos> My God.<eos> Sweetheart, listen to me, listen to me.<eos> I need you to do something for me.<eos> All right?<eos> Now, when you're sure he's asleep, I need you to grab his phone and bring it down to me.
Hey.<eos> So how long was I out?<eos> Couple hours.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> No, no.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, well, if you're not gonna eat anything, I want you to at least drink something.<eos> Let me see what we have.<eos> You know, I was looking for my phone.<eos> Uh, thought I left it by the bed, but it's not there.

Three hours.<eos> The flight from Quebec to New York is two hours.<eos> He's already here.<eos> He's in the country.<eos> Alex, where are you going?<eos> Task force.<eos> They have to know the operative in charge of Black Dagger's here, and they need to know now.<eos> I'll pretend to find the file.<eos> We can't wait for the techs.<eos> You cannot be the one to discover it.
It's a hidden jpeg.<eos> It shouldn't even be here.<eos> Why is it empty?<eos> I have no idea, but I do know this.<eos> Nothing worse than cold mu shu.<eos> Hey.<eos> It wasn't there... the file.<eos> I opened the jpeg.<eos> It was empty. That's impossible.<eos> You coded it, right?
Everything.<eos> You've seen the operative who's running Black Dagger in person?<eos> I saw him kill two men in Rome.<eos> I have a picture of him from there.<eos> And rather than tell me or Sam or anyone, you pursue it on your own.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> There's a mole, I think, in the task force.<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> I planted a file about the operative on the FBI server so the techs would discover that he's here.<eos> They missed it, so I went to Brock.

No, please. Michelle.<eos> Back, back!<eos> This whole time, that's what this was about.<eos> You got close to me so you can use me!<eos> No, no.<eos> No, this is real.<eos> Everything about you is real to me.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I do.<eos> I know that... how your hair falls in front of your face like now, but you never move it, because you'll only have to move it again.
- 10BROAD36.<eos> We can use Ethernet encoding.<eos> Plus... plus, the cable's already hidden along the walls.<eos> We can just adjust it where we need to.<eos> We'll still need to hear a modem, though.<eos> - Bodie?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Do you still have that little recorder?<eos> Okay, go record the modem connecting.<eos> Then we'll pull out the recorder's power switch, we'll run wires up it,
Oh, it was in the newspaper then.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - But, but, but<eos> I really went...<eos> My plan...<eos> Don't say it. OK?<eos> I'm definitely not going to say it.<eos> But you told me what your plans were, and I told you that I knew, I had a feeling, I suspected.<eos> Remember?<eos> If I suspected, he knew it, too.
Palmer Station is a National Science Foundation's research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula.<eos> Palmer Station houses scientists from all over the world, researching everything from biology to glaciology.<eos> And for much of the last decade, they have employed new and innovative technology to collect all sorts of data from the ocean.<eos> So what are we about to do right now?<eos> This is going to be the first glider deployment for Palmer this year.<eos> So this is kind of like an underwater drone used for science. Exactly.<eos> We have turned her on for the first dive.<eos> So who's actually controlling this drone?<eos> There's a glider control center at Rutgers in New Jersey.<eos> Locally, you just kind of call them on the sat phone, tell them you're ready, and once they have contact they're controlling it from New Jersey.
Are you aware that this highway's a drug-smuggling route into Ontario?<eos> I wouldn't know anything about that.<eos> Good, then you wouldn't mind me taking a look in the back of the vehicle, would you?<eos> You want to remove the sheet, please?<eos> What the--<eos> Don't--<eos> _<eos> Honey, what's wrong?<eos> You left your cane.<eos> I didn't need it.
No.<eos> The season of the witch.<eos> Now we will complete your initiation.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> I spread word of another outbreak.<eos> All hide away, quaking with terror.<eos> Last night, I was behagged in my own home.<eos> My assailant used the water in this well to reach me, right here in the very heart of our domain.<eos> Last night, they had the element of surprise.<eos> Now we must take it from them.
Anne Hale told me you were desperate to know who completed the grand rite.<eos> Now you know.<eos> I alone succeeded where you failed.<eos> Oh, mighty queen of failure.<eos> I completed the grand rite, and I alone will open the gate for our dark lord.<eos> Tis my accomplishment and none of your own.<eos> No, that's where you are wrong, little sister.<eos> Your accomplishment is not only my concern, but my destiny.<eos> Listen, old thing.<eos> You gave up your birthright when increase Mather snatched it away.
- You heard.<eos> - What's in there?<eos> - The Fortune of War.<eos> It's where they keep their bodies.<eos> A porter wheeled one over to the Hospital around midnight, on a meat trolley.<eos> - Alice disappeared ten days ago.<eos> - The butcher's daughter.<eos> - I want to speak with her.<eos> - You'll speak to me first.<eos> That dress, where did you get it?
- Kid?<eos> All I care about is the goddamn money!<eos> Now where the fuck is it?<eos> !<eos> - It's right here. - You think I'm stupid?<eos> That don't look like $3 million, asshole!<eos> Now where's the rest?<eos> !<eos> I might have put that money somewhere safe.<eos> Now, where exactly did you put it?
I'm not your receptionist.<eos> Well, I should go give Paul a call.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I'll see you around, Sam.<eos> I haven't heard from you in a while.<eos> I was getting worried.<eos> - I tried to call last month.<eos> - My cell was stolen.<eos> I have a new number.<eos> I'll give it to you.
Cassie.<eos> What, really?<eos> Nick's gone too.<eos> Well, now we both don't know where our kids are.<eos> You think Grace is with Nick?<eos> I have a feeling.<eos> Well, your feelings are usually spot on, they're not exactly best buds.<eos> Yeah, I know, but...<eos> Did you try her cell?<eos> - She left it at home.
Good thing we have one right next door.<eos> Would you like me to go with you?<eos> I have to do this on my own.<eos> I called your developer friend to discuss some other properties, and he told me that he is no longer interested in Keating House.<eos> He said that you convinced him to take his business to Blairsville.<eos> Why?<eos> Because Cassie got me to see how to save us both.<eos> I don't need you to save me, Mr. Ryan Elliott.<eos> I needed you to do your job.<eos> I did my job, and I did it well.
Look on the bright side, the mayor's gonna get the storm she wanted.<eos> Mayor Martha Tinsdale.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, thank you, Chief Sanders.<eos> Please enact the first phase of my safety plan.<eos> I will be right in.<eos> We're getting a great big storm! Oh!<eos> Yes, Chief?<eos> We don't have a safety plan.<eos> We certainly do, I wrote it myself.
Is everyone still here?<eos> Yes.<eos> - And we were.<eos> - Amen.<eos> We were still here.<eos> Amen.<eos> We were--<eos> Michael has asked to say a few words.<eos> My mom tells a story.<eos> A lot of you have probably heard it.
And you know what?<eos> I couldn't have ne that without you.<eos> You know, the sad thing is, you're no better than he is.<eos> I'm gonna go get the rest of my stuff.<eos> You don't have to leave that up.<eos> Hey, you didn't tell me they were playing the Yanks tonight.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Can't wait to see Stanton go yard on them.<eos> - Where'd you get the glove?<eos> - Borrowed it from a neighbor's kid.

I make no apologies about it.<eos> It's the type of player I was back then.<eos> I'm well aware of that.<eos> It's football.<eos> Players are aware of the risks.<eos> What if it was you that got laid out?<eos> Would you want a handshake, a "no hard feelings"?<eos> Some show of respect?<eos> Dan, I didn't have that in me back then.<eos> I took that hit, I put it in a box and I buried that motherfucker.
He was using me for propaganda. Let's just hope<eos> - that's all you are.<eos> - You really think - he'd take me hostage?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Clearly, he coordinated the sub incursion with your visit.<eos> It's just optics.<eos> Lecturing the Secretary of State's husband while his sub is sneaking around Alaska?<eos> The message is:<eos> don't let NATO troops go into Latvia.<eos> Well, now that we've heard it, why don't you come home?
L.A.<eos> How long before we can physically engage?<eos> You mean threaten it, sir?<eos> Capture it and report it?<eos> I mean destroy it.<eos> Sir, our closest surface vessel is the Navy minesweeper Kirkland.<eos> It can be at the site within 90 minutes.<eos> Tell the Russians they have two hours.<eos> Two hours for that sub to be gone.<eos> Or we take it out ourselves.
We should believe that Ostrov lost control of the Yalta because your husband knows religion, and he saw Ostrov ask Santa for a wish?<eos> Actually, the secretary's husband has shown he can be a pretty effective operative on occasion, as well as a religious scholar.<eos> Well, what if I trust your analysis?<eos> Say Ostrov is scared, that he's operating in the blind, like we all are here.<eos> Then what?<eos> Then we don't push him to the brink.<eos> Not until we know more.<eos> Every second we wait lets those battleships get closer.<eos> Or lets the sub fire another missile... or six of them, all of them nukes.<eos> And if we hit it with one of ours, it's got a 10K reactor on board.
He knew, firsthand, what our countries could accomplish when they work together for the common good.<eos> I wear this in honor of mine.<eos> St. Nicholas.<eos> My grandfather's name-saint.<eos> Nikolai is an old family name.<eos> He, too, may have been happy to see us... here... in peace.<eos> Perhaps this is what he sacrificed so much for.<eos> I will call your president.<eos> ...after an accidental, nighttime collision between the Russian nuclear-powered submarine and the U.S. minesweeper Kirkland, the disabled sub then drifted into American territorial waters.<eos> U.S. naval personnel boarded it, in an attempted rescue.
Someone took over the building this morning.<eos> It's computerized to the hilt.<eos> Whoever hacked in has total control.<eos> Bulletproof security doors, labs where the nerve agents are stored, and a ventilation system that could spread gas throughout the facility, killing everyone who's trapped inside.<eos> How many?<eos> 23 very scared scientists.<eos> One of whom-<eos> - Jim Stone-- has been locked in a room that the hacker filled with sarin.<eos> And he's keeping Stone's O2 levels in his Hazmat suit so low, he's barely breathing.<eos> So, if Stone keeps the suit on much longer, he runs out of air, and if he takes it off, he's dead.

Nick's not even cold in his... hos-hospital bed.<eos> Wow, and I move on quick?<eos> People get replaced, Simon.<eos> The Army's kind of set up for that.<eos> Well, at times like this I think Nick would want us to...<eos> Oh, brilliant!<eos> My book!<eos> Oh, well, one of them at least.<eos> Fuck's sake.<eos> He's ruined it!
Do you really believe my death would win his release?<eos> I fear nothing short of a miracle will save him.<eos> It's strange.<eos> When I close my eyes I can only picture Alak as a little boy.<eos> I keep remembering this one day.<eos> The humans have this ancient ritual called a "picnic."<eos> Have you come across the term yet?<eos> No.<eos> You eat outdoors among the flies and rodents.<eos> Alak was very young, and insisted we try it.
Imagine if that was you - slung in a corner and ignored, because it's more convenient for everybody else.<eos> Shame on you, Les Cook!<eos> Yeah, do you not think you're over-reacting?<eos> No, I think I've just woken up.<eos> Ich hoffe sie fuhlen sich besser.<eos> Ya. Is he all right?<eos> Yes, just a little bit compacted, that's all.<eos> Too much beer and bratwurst, probably.<eos> That should get him moving again.<eos> Now, I really do think we ought to put the cadaver back where we found it.
Well, maybe he still likes you?<eos> I haven't seen him since I was 12, I barely remember him.<eos> "Roses are red, violets are blue What is that smell?<eos> I need a poo."<eos> His sense of humour hasn't changed much. I wonder how he got my address?<eos> Right, I need to go to my seminar.<eos> I won't be back until 7.30 if you want to have sex with Adam.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you remember your teddy, Christine?<eos> I'll bring it along next time.
Well, only this -<eos> I did spy Elizabeth Gadge fly out the window on a shovel, whereat she rode to the Sabbat and did kiss the devil's arse and eat a baby's face off.<eos> CROWD GASPS AND CHATTERS When... Just a moment.<eos> "..and eat... "a baby's... "face off."<eos> Continue.<eos> When was this?<eos> Last Tuesday night, about five past, ten past 11.<eos> Thank you, Mr Waterhouse.<eos> Tell us more of this arse kissing.<eos> How close did you spy it?
20 minutes ago, he made the same argument you just made.<eos> All our intelligence assessments are unanimous that Juliet is the last of the coup conspirators.<eos> There's strong evidence that she's still conspiring with opposition elements in Iran, which means she arguably poses a clear and present danger to American lives.<eos> We have a real shot at taking her out.<eos> We're going to take it.<eos> I know there could be blowback, but this is about national security.<eos> President Shiraz will be here to sign the nuclear treaty in two days.<eos> I'd like to put this behind us before I stand next to him in the East Room.<eos> In that case, you'll need me to pave the way with Algeria.<eos> You send in a drone without their blessing, they'll probably shoot it down.
- Oh, here!<eos> Be careful.<eos> Hey, that's my taxi.<eos> He's hot.<eos> You have great hair.<eos> Look, my friend is super drunk. Just let her take the cab.<eos> Where's she going?<eos> Uh, the West Side.<eos> Me too.<eos> Do you mind if we split it?
Let me think and I'll call you.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hello. Is your father home?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Please come in.<eos> The company said that if we find something, we need to report it to the police.<eos> And the state gives us 30% of its value.<eos> No.<eos> If we go and we find anything, then we get in the car, drive to Bucharest, and sell the gold to gypsies.<eos> They'll melt it down, and nobody will know it used to be coins.
There are two houses?<eos> There are now. In my grandparents' day, that was the house, these were the outhouses.<eos> This was a kitchen, the stables were back there.<eos> - Where were the stables?<eos> - Over there, at the back.<eos> - And you knocked them together?<eos> - Me? No, the Communists.<eos> They made a kindergarten here.<eos> See this archway?<eos> They filled it in.
In the east wall, facing the rising sun.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I worked a lot in this region.<eos> I dug up hundreds of landmines around Caracal.<eos> - German?<eos> - Some of them.<eos> They'd make a hole in the wall, hide the coins and seal it up?<eos> No, when building a house, they'd put a few coins in the east wall for luck.<eos> But we're not after change.<eos> We're looking for treasure. Got it?
You can also get them when they're flying.<eos> If you get them in a flock, you can get 4 or 5 at a time.<eos> It's like shooting ducks.<eos> - Ever hunted ducks?<eos> - No.<eos> You can get 2 or 3 with one cartridge.<eos> Of course, it depends how far off they are.<eos> If it's a long way, the shot's less effective.<eos> That's why I said it's best to catch them inside.<eos> I had a maple over there, and they've cut it down.

Google your own name to find out how awful the world can be.<eos> It is a great tool for being able to meet people like you, to know that you're not alone, something that I didn't have growing up.<eos> Cut there!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> My fucking legs are killing!<eos> You can make your stupid video now!<eos> Oh! Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> - Not looking forward to it?
Love.<eos> Neuroscience tells us it activates the same parts of the brain as habit-forming addiction.<eos> It makes us feel like we can do anything, be anything, achieve anything.<eos> And once we taste it... We want more.
Also, Catherine Avery is my mother-in-law, so I'll call her any damn time I feel like it!<eos> - Understood.<eos> - All right.<eos> Need something?<eos> 'Cause I was just headed out for the night.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I brought the thunder.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I brought the thunder.<eos> It's what I call it.
His child, Charlotte.<eos> She will not stop until I'm dead, and I refuse to give her that satisfaction.<eos> Margaux was right.<eos> I should never have left this room.<eos> Victoria.<eos> Just go.<eos> Hey.<eos> I knew you were out.<eos> Just wanted to check your security program to see if we located the drive.<eos> Well, Victoria hasn't plugged it in in the last week.
Things have gotten hairy... As in "S Truman."<eos> They're about to drop the big one.<eos> I intercepted a phone call between Margaux and Victoria.<eos> They're using the evidence.<eos> The feds are on their way to Victoria's hotel.<eos> It's going down now.<eos> Margaux arranged for the FBI to question Victoria at the penthouse.<eos> It's a smart move on her part...<eos> No chance for us to intercept them, and she knows that we don't have enough time to pull off an "Emily's Eleven" and break into the suite.<eos> Victoria won't let the drive out of her sight long enough for us to take it, anyway.
Oh, more lies!<eos> I know you helped her steal that drive back, and I know that this charade of an event is your alibi.<eos> Plausible deniability while Emily does her dirty work.<eos> Oh, wow, you're good, except for those pesky details.<eos> Oh, don't stand there and play dumb.<eos> You are kicking Victoria while she's down.<eos> What do you think that will do to her?<eos> Why don't you just be a man and admit to what you've done?<eos> Louise, you're in over your head, and you picked the wrong side.<eos> Oh, um, and while you were trying to record a confession on your phone right now, I was running an app that reset it to factory settings.
For 20 years, that was all I ever dreamed of.<eos> How was I supposed to ruin that moment?<eos> You know, since being back, uh...<eos> I always thought that I'd been given a new lease on life.<eos> Maybe I was wrong.<eos> Maybe it was all just a long setup to a sick joke.<eos> That's a load of bull.<eos> You didn't fight to survive that hell just to be fate's punch line.<eos> You're here for a reason, David.<eos> You may not believe it now, but you will, which is why you need to keep fighting.
Who knows him otherwise?<eos> Do not know.<eos> Just hope they find someone Which can spell.<eos> It's a lot of absence And then he has missed the samples.<eos> Now they have to put in Jonas Helle instead.<eos> I know it's worst for Oliver, yet...<eos> - Do you know who is his father?<eos> - No, it can be anyone.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Why do you ask about it?
Or if the body was pushed up against a rock wall inside a strong hydraulics system.<eos> Like a whirlpool?<eos> Exactly. Yeah.<eos> Meeting go okay?<eos> It's anonymous for a reason, okay, Aubrey?<eos> I just want to do my job.<eos> Where's the arm?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> But if it's still in there,<eos> Nautilus Jr.'s gonna find it.
Yeah, I'll show you.<eos> She was obsessed.<eos> Welcome to Mom's world.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> Wow, I thought I was a cookie fan.<eos> It was all about the jars.<eos> There was rarely a cookie in the house.<eos> A collection like this must be worth a fortune.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure some of it was worth some money, but mostly it's just sentimental junk.<eos> Man, she was really into this-- each jar had its own entry with a photo, description, the date she bought it, how much she paid.
Undo the spell, Kai!<eos> I can't.<eos> What's done is done.<eos> Ossox! Agh! Again!<eos> Unh! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!<eos> Fine.<eos> You know what's funny?<eos> I didn't even know werewolves were real until I got bit by one.<eos> The thing is, Bon, the only way a guy turns into a wolf is if it's magic, right, so technically, their venom's magic, too.<eos> So I just went ahead and siphoned it up.
So I became curious as to what you were really up to.<eos> Stealing from my family.<eos> It's my duty to turn you in, you know.<eos> Maybe you'll just lose a hand.<eos> Though more likely, we being the royal family and all you'll be hanged.<eos> Claude, please.<eos> Or we could come to an understanding.<eos> Your new duties will include escorting me to town to see whomever I like and covering for me with my mother.<eos> A sketch of me in the bath, naked, graphically detailed.<eos> I don't know which is more disturbing, the fact that you created it or the fact that you allowed it into the hands of other nobles.
How quickly I was thrown out of the castle when it was politically expedient.<eos> We need more.<eos> You want to keep the brothel.<eos> Greer, you don't have to.<eos> I swear that I will protect and support you for the rest of my life.<eos> What if you can't?<eos> This brothel is independence.<eos> Income.<eos> And that is safety in a very unsafe world.<eos> What if we take this money and invest it in the business?
It's not like you guys are getting any, anyway.<eos> Get out.<eos> Next time, you will call someone before going out on your own.<eos> Totally.<eos> And despite your slight errors in logistical judgment, good job.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm gonna grab our things.<eos> Okay, third time's the charm.<eos> Enough of a good job to warrant, say, a raise?<eos> You've earned it in more ways than one.
Creepy crawls.<eos> Except instead of the Hollywood Hills, it's all military houses.<eos> Latest one is from the Perkinses.<eos> Second tape, please.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Malik's never bragged about this online.<eos> Never mentioned it.<eos> He hasn't released these.<eos> Yeah, well, he's stockpiling.<eos> Easier to get away with a crime when no one knows you're doing it.
Don't.<eos> Damn, he's so fast.<eos> I'll report to my superiors that our work is done here.<eos> We've already spoken.<eos> Just so you know, Delilah made sure we had separate rooms.<eos> We're sharing a place while she's back in the States.<eos> I could tell you were concerned.<eos> More decoded transcripts and Delilah's chats with Malik.<eos> Ugh, your computer won't shut up.<eos> Oh, yeah, I set it to alert me on breaking news stories involving social media and terrorism.
All of them.<eos> Their cycle came to an end.<eos> And, unlike you, they won't be brought back to life.<eos> You had a job: lead the people to be cocooned so that the egg could infuse them with the life force.<eos> I tried.<eos> I did.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Why were we chosen to do this?<eos> You and I made first contact with the egg.<eos> When we touched it, we gained a complete understanding of the dome's agenda: survive and propagate.
But you died during the download.<eos> Three weeks ago, I came along.<eos> From inside my cocoon, I could see that this town was on the brink of destroying itself.<eos> What is that stuff?<eos> Oxytocin.<eos> It's a mood regulator.<eos> It, plus the alternate reality, was essential to shape these humans into a functioning collective, so that we could gain a foothold.<eos> Except... the transfer of the life force was interrupted.<eos> Because Big Jim destroyed the egg.<eos> Because you didn't protect it.
Even Barbie's buying it.<eos> So is my mom.<eos> Gather any picks or shovels you can find at Town Hall and meet back here.<eos> Christine has some sort of a schematic in her office.<eos> I don't know what it's for, but those amethysts are definitely part of it.<eos> Well, Joe and I can go find the schematic.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go now, while Christine's still here.<eos> Take my car.<eos> Once you find it, get it to Bird Island.
Hi.<eos> I never thought we'd meet in person, and now you're here.<eos> Obviously, I've got questions.<eos> What?<eos> I saw you fall.<eos> Satellite surveillance.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You've seen a lot of other stuff, too.<eos> Yeah, that file you sent me was everything Aktaion had on the dome from day one.<eos> Why'd you dump it?

Hey, who is that?<eos> Looks like Christine.<eos> Barbie?<eos> Julia?<eos> We're on our way back.<eos> We found something on the drone feed.<eos> It looks like Christine's left the cement factory with a ton of guards.<eos> Okay, we got to get over there.<eos> But we have the umbilical cord.<eos> I'll pick up the cord and take it to Bloom.
Everyone under this dome is innocent.<eos> Believe me, what I have to do, it... it breaks my heart.<eos> That couldn't have been my daughter.<eos> She's less than a day old.<eos> What'd you do to her?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Now, see, you're lying.<eos> If you really were human, you'd remember everything you did while you were infected.<eos> I do.<eos> I know there was a plan and I was following it, I just can't remember what it was.
Things have changed.<eos> When I made that promise, I was planning on taking the blame for you and running away from here forever.<eos> Still a great plan.<eos> Don't give up on yourself.<eos> Look, I'm not gonna put myself at risk.<eos> My father is alive now.<eos> I finally have the chance to be happy, to... Try to have the life I always wanted.<eos> Well, who knew that a side effect of happiness is naivety?<eos> I want the life I deserve.<eos> Then name the place, and I'll set it up.
Right behind you?<eos> Hmm? Uh... uh... behind?<eos> Yeah, well, a little back, a little beyond.<eos> I mean, o-of course, we're moving in opposite directions.<eos> And then I'm racing to the E.R. To prep it for the first casualties and just thanking god I'm alive.<eos> I mean, I knew that they were stranded out there, but what they went through?<eos> They gave Dr. Sloan a pericardiocentesis with, like, a drinking straw.<eos> They all almost died.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> It's real, and they had it.

- I do, actually, because you have been totally unreasonable at every level.<eos> And you are completely out of line.<eos> Listen!<eos> Okay?<eos> This story? It's all about me.<eos> When I tell it, it's about me.<eos> It's not about you or you or the fact that you two are messed up 'cause you can't figure out how to date or hook up or whatever it is that you're doing that I just don't care about. Me.<eos> I am the protagonist.<eos> You don't interest me.<eos> This story is about love and I will find it, that he is out there, and that even if I crash a plane, he is out there.
Yeah, maybe.<eos> What you need to know is that the media's saying that a dead Vago in Reno is probably part of a drug deal gone sideways.<eos> So now I've got Felix shoving a hot poker up my ass, because my chapter is giving the feds more reasons to turn up the heat.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Oh, well, that came in the mail from Reno.<eos> It was attached to the finger of the asshole who screwed you guys over.<eos> Reese, was it?<eos> Yeah, well... yeah, well, Felix's guys tracked him down.<eos> Apparently he's out of business now.<eos> The finger stank, so I threw it out.
No, I don't... No.<eos> His name is Michael.<eos> He's a little shy, but trust me, ladies, he is adorable.<eos> Plus, he cooked us the most amazing meal while we were setting up.<eos> But still, you know you're a lucky guy, Michael, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Nah.<eos> No, no, I'm the lucky one.<eos> So, Jamal, can we expect a new album, a new Jamal Lyon album, any time soon?<eos> You know we're all waiting for it.
It's a Jewish thing, a Hasidic dynasty.<eos> You see them all over this neighborhood, the crazy dudes with the curlicues and the big black hats.<eos> Dynasty, hmm.<eos> That's a dope name.<eos> So are you saying this space is available?<eos> The whole floor?<eos> Might be, if it means getting you out of my face.<eos> Yeah, this could work.<eos> As soon as you clean this place up, of course.<eos> Actually, since you'll be the one renting it, that'll be your ass doing the cleaning.
Yeah. I wrote this for you.<eos> I did.<eos> Come on home to Empire.<eos> We'll do more stuff together.<eos> That's what I miss.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> But I ain't coming back to Empire.<eos> What about your album?<eos> What about it?<eos> I put it out.

Go ahead.<eos> If I can make this all go away, will you let me back in Empire?<eos> How?<eos> It's a simple question, Pop.<eos> If I get the case dismissed, am I the CFO again?<eos> Dre, if you make this mess go away, you can have anything you want.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, baby boy.<eos> Look, I'm real glad you're doing this video.<eos> I'm only doing it 'cause I can't get my own stuff on the radio.
- something better now.<eos> - What?<eos> My album, that's what.<eos> This song that I just did... it killed.<eos> And it was equal parts Cookie and Lucious.<eos> So that's what my album is gonna be.<eos> Both of y'all, together.<eos> Lucious,<eos> Cookie... Equal.<eos> Might call it The Black and White Album. Who knows?
No, no, hold on, hold on, hold on.<eos> Look, before we go any further, I want to know that there's proof of life.<eos> Proof...?<eos> Proof that he's okay.<eos> Proof of life?<eos> Lucious and Cookie Lyon, I'm still alive.<eos> This video is proof of life.<eos> I'm still here.<eos> Yeah, I see it.<eos> We're good, so... where do you want it?
So that's where the "Poppa" comes from.<eos> A man's gotta show some love to Grampoppa for keeping me off the streets and letting me work on my music.<eos> You ever think about incorporating the Word into your music?<eos> You could reach a lot more people with the light than you can with the darkness, brother.<eos> Are you for real?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Let's do business.<eos> It's gonna be fun.<eos> You know this business, Cookie.<eos> Y'all damn near asked for it.
I didn't ask the board's approval when I risked my life to build the damn company, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna ask a board of directors how to move my pieces on my chessboard.<eos> Oh, you're a grandmaster, Lucious.<eos> Damn right.<eos> And when this deal closes, I'm cleaning house.<eos> Whoever stood against me is out.<eos> So the question is:<eos> is you is or is you ain't my Mimi?<eos> Because I always thought we saw the world the same way, darling.<eos> Mm.<eos> I'm learning to see the world the way you see it, Lucious.

If we wanna get back in the black, we need a bigger chapter and everybody's gotta pull their weight.<eos> Starting with...<eos> You.<eos> I thought we had money problems.<eos> I borrowed it.<eos> You're gonna invest it.<eos> In what?<eos> By "invest,"<eos> Schizo means he wants me to buy a kilo of pure cocaine from a new connection for 30 grand.<eos> The idea of it being that the newly patched members cut it and sell it retail for 200 grand.
Where you goin'?<eos> Out.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, Charlie.<eos> You just missed him.<eos> You know, I think I left my cell phone charger up in his office.<eos> All right, you know the way, go ahead.<eos> See you in court.<eos> Find what you came for?<eos> Oh yeah, I got it right here.
But as far as I'm concerned, the press shouldn't decide anything for us.<eos> Or about us.<eos> Ever.<eos> Yeah, you bitches better applaud.<eos> - Hey. Oph.<eos> - Hey, Gemma. Are you okay?<eos> Of course. Why wouldn't I be?<eos> - The car accident.<eos> - Oh, that.<eos> Our lawyers will fix it.
Not "we," you can't go anywhere near that crime scene, Alex.<eos> You have to go about your daily routines and just act normal, okay?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Sam, he... he knows something's wrong, that I lied, I can feel it.<eos> Alex, until we know who this mole is, you have to try to stay strong and...<eos> Hope I'm not arrested.<eos> Yes.<eos> Listen, why don't you go back to the hotel and try to get some sleep, okay?<eos> A quantum implant?<eos> How the hell did you get it on the computer?
Yes.<eos> Listen, why don't you go back to the hotel and try to get some sleep, okay?<eos> A quantum implant?<eos> How the hell did you get it on the computer?<eos> You went into his hotel room?<eos> All above board, sanctioned by headquarters and DOJ.<eos> Why go around me on this?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Alex's laptop is CIA property.<eos> Langley wanted to keep it inside until there was proof of wrongdoing.
Are you heading back to the office?<eos> I'm going to go grab a shower.<eos> Then I'll be in.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You are going to lose the battle, in here.<eos> I want to make this easier for you.<eos> Pain is my business.<eos> I know it like a mother knows her child.
No eye contact.<eos> We keep the lights off. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪<eos> Oh, hey, I thought you could use a little post-prom pick-me-up.<eos> I even had them do that thing where they make a little leaf in the foam.<eos> See?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I overreacted about that ridiculous threesome.<eos> I don't know what got into me.<eos> We both know you'd never go through with it.
I don't know what got into me.<eos> We both know you'd never go through with it.<eos> Right, and why do we know that?<eos> Because you're not that kind of girl.<eos> Not that kind of girl.<eos> Wow, thanks, Amy.<eos> Coffee and slut-shaming is such a nice way to start the day.<eos> That's not what I'm doing.<eos> Look, the threesome happened, and it was fun.<eos> I'd do it again, actually.
Now, that is fascinating.<eos> Someone committed this horrific crime, and then he went out of his way to piggyback it onto crimes I've been accused of.<eos> That was my initial response.<eos> And the red hair... [scoffs] Gingers are anathema to me.<eos> I prefer brunettes.<eos> No offense.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> And the body dismembered... it's so unnecessary.<eos> It's so barbaric.<eos> Well, any ideas why somebody would have done it?
Dr. Rudnick, just so you know, everything in this room is recorded.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Um, Yates is appealing his conviction, so this conversation may be discoverable as part of that process.<eos> Of course, I also record everything.<eos> Oh, Sergeant Benson.<eos> Yes.<eos> Dr. Rudnick, thank you so much for meeting us.<eos> Just have a few questions for you.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Okay, this file... do you recognize it?
Susie was blackmailing him, and Rachel... she was just easy pickings, crime of opportunity.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> So the judge thought that linking the three together would be<eos> - more prejudicial than probative.<eos> - Prejudicial than probative.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what do you need from me?<eos> A thigh, to establish cause of death.<eos> Susie Frain is our strongest case.<eos> The thigh is gone, but you don't need it.
I defended myself, resulting in these cuts on my hand and arms.<eos> Could you step down and demonstrate how you received those wounds, Dr. Rudnick?<eos> Objection.<eos> Prejudicial.<eos> What?<eos> How will the jury know what really happened if I can't demonstrate?<eos> Your Honor, I think a demonstration could be informative.<eos> I'll allow it, but don't milk it.<eos> Is this how she held it?<eos> She pulled the knife from the butcher block and swung it down at me.
And to the outstanding charge of murder in the first degree of Rachel Groves?<eos> I'm afraid I'm guilty on that one as well.<eos> Your Honor, at this time, the prosecution would like to withdraw its charge of murder in the first degree of Lena Grunwald.<eos> All right, Counselors, thank you for your time.<eos> And now that justice has been served, I declare this court adjourned.<eos> Wait.<eos> He gets away with Lena's murder.<eos> Well, he'll still do 25 to life for the other two charges.<eos> Maybe you two will be roommates one day.<eos> He did it, you know.
Flag on the play there.<eos> She's not talking to anyone.<eos> Maybe she will.<eos> So what's your plan?<eos> I want to see if the unsub's signature has any effect on her.<eos> We don't know his signature.<eos> Scopolamine and sevoflurane are both odorless and tasteless, but he introduces the smell of sage to the drugs.<eos> Clever.<eos> But why her and not the others?<eos> The act of recounting a false memory hardens it into fact.
Leaning out of the driver's seat would leave him about there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I saw an empty bottle of Pascal's on the curb around the corner.<eos> Hadn't been there for very long.<eos> Could be the cabbie threw it out the window after he did this.<eos> I'll have our guys bag it and get a swab of that.<eos> The department reached out to the TLC to try to find out if any cabs came in with front-end damage this morning.<eos> Looks like we got a hit at a fleet in Queens.<eos> Driver said he lost control on some ice and hit a pole.<eos> He brought it in like this at around 6:00.
We can meet later at the brownstone to review it.<eos> Uh, what about Agatha?<eos> All that de-stressing?<eos> I think a homicide takes precedence, don't you?<eos> Oh, you must be Agatha.<eos> And you must be Joan.<eos> Oh, no, no, please, sit.<eos> I was hoping we'd cross paths at some point.<eos> When Sherlock told me he'd exiled you on my account, I was mortified.<eos> If the Lutece is exile, I will take it.
Your husband's firm do any criminal work?<eos> Maybe Mr. Meadows is a client.<eos> I don't think so, no.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Give us a moment.<eos> Joan?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Gordon Meadows's phone.<eos> CCS already checked it out.
That way, I wouldn't have wavered or gone crazy.<eos> I think the time for me to tell you has come now.<eos> - What? - The reason why I gave you up back then, and the reason that I shook you up again, and the reason why I'm rejecting you like this after I did that.<eos> If you're just going to give me some ridiculous excuse, then just stop. It's not long.<eos> Just one word is enough.<eos> "Cha Do Hyun was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)" at Johns Hopkins Hospital.<eos> DID?<eos> That well-behaved Cha Do Hyun has Multiple Personality Disorder?<eos> The reactions of the people who know my secret vary.<eos> They get terrified, or they feel good because I disclosed it to them, or feel relief because they are normal, or use me, or sympathize with me, or treat me as a monster.
I'll even write a name on the boat.<eos> What should I write?<eos> Perry Park.<eos> It's Perry Park.<eos> Okay!<eos> 'Perry Park' boat!<eos> You really made a promise with me.<eos> You have to buy it!<eos> If it's 'Perry Park' boat, could it be...<eos> I remembered it recently.
- It's my bad.<eos> Please, just keep it going.<eos> Please.<eos> You sure?<eos> Do you have any idea how much I miss just hearing his voice?<eos> Okay.<eos> Stop bitching, please, and just see if you can get the ring.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Uh, Yeah, I think I got it.
Bea!<eos> We believe in you!<eos> How do you feel about your sentencing, Bea?<eos> Do you have anything to say, Bea?<eos> Governor Ferguson, for the last four months, she's-- She's taken away all the inmates' privileges she's been punishing the women for what I've done, and it's gotta stop!<eos> You're our hero, Bea!<eos> You're our hero!<eos> The Chairman of the Board of Correctional Services - Victoria, Maintains that Governor Ferguson has their full support.<eos> Have you read this report?<eos> I compiled it, Mr. Chairman.
Ferguson!<eos> You freak!<eos> Maxine!<eos> Stay with her!<eos> Stay with her!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Hey Lucy.<eos> You're in H Block, eh?<eos> That's your cell, there.<eos> You know where the duress button is if you need it.
I will not throw it out, but I will open a window because I'm a nice person.<eos> And I'm an even nicer person!<eos> Bye-bye, salad!<eos> No!<eos> Yo!<eos> Still no movement.<eos> How was the snack machine?<eos> Ah. Snacks abound!<eos> Told you this place was awesome.<eos> My theory is that Olson and his brother have been using it as a home base while they rob places up and down the coast.
- Keep pressure on that.<eos> - Yes, mother.<eos> That was on Justin's disk.<eos> I'm not sure I like your tone.<eos> The "you're the only person left who could have leaked the code" tone?<eos> Yeah, that one.<eos> So, did you leak the code?<eos> Linus, remember when we met?<eos> You were just 19, answered that ad in your school paper.<eos> The agency posed a math problem and whoever could solve it earned the right to apply to an elite government position. Remember that?
Fine... Except for Carlton.<eos> Again?<eos> He keeps leering at me...<eos> Gives me the creeps.<eos> Well, he's your boss.<eos> Sooner or later, you have to report him to H.R.<eos> I'm so glad you're back.<eos> I have a surprise for you.<eos> You're giving me a drawer?<eos> Only if you want it.
I was talking to Larry the Cable Ferret.<eos> Hey, yo, George. You in here, man?<eos> You got a-- you got a second?<eos> Yeah, I'll be out in about ten minutes, guys.<eos> Uh, yo, uh... how would you like to get promoted again?<eos> That's great.<eos> Listen, let's talk when I get out of here, please.<eos> Look, this is what we were thinking.<eos> We were thinking maybe you make another hilarious video, okay?<eos> But this time, we post it on YouTube, maybe make a channel for the company.
You got a-- you got a second?<eos> Yeah, I'll be out in about ten minutes, guys.<eos> Uh, yo, uh... how would you like to get promoted again?<eos> That's great.<eos> Listen, let's talk when I get out of here, please.<eos> Look, this is what we were thinking.<eos> We were thinking maybe you make another hilarious video, okay?<eos> But this time, we post it on YouTube, maybe make a channel for the company.<eos> It goes viral.<eos> The bosses see it.
- Ok, let's go.<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> I don't know what to do with their fanny pack.<eos> Their passports. All their money is here.<eos> I don't know. I don't think they can get very far without it.<eos> This might work in our favor.<eos> - You guys have a blue car?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> We didn't take it, we don't know how to drive it.
- Let me just see it.<eos> - Where's the passport? Right here.<eos> We're good, we're good.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - We can do this.<eos> - Ok. Back in.<eos> Laura and Tyler are leaving the premises.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Did they not even know it was in there?<eos> No. Did you shove it under the seat?
- That is what you did, Jack.<eos> Except I didn't run away.<eos> I ran to something... my son.<eos> What would you be running to?<eos> I wanted to look in on an old case.<eos> It's personal.<eos> Stan Gardner.<eos> Love obsession case.<eos> Stan's wife was seeing other men, and he strangled her.<eos> I just would really appreciate your fresh eyes on it.
Where would you like to start?<eos> With your alibi... Mr. Barry Newly.<eos> He just came forward.<eos> Why wait 5 years?<eos> The guy's a drug dealer, and so was I.<eos> He was running from the law, and they found him.<eos> And this man is a beacon of truth.<eos> He's got no stake in this.<eos> Why would he lie, hmm?<eos> He recounted my original testimony word for word, and he's never heard it before ever.
He's outside. Who sent you?<eos> !<eos> I'm a chicago police officer.<eos> My partner is with your son.<eos> Now, step away and put your hands over your head.<eos> I didn't tell anyone.<eos> (mcintire) i was broke, okay?<eos> A driver i know hooked me up with these guys, mexicans.<eos> I'd drive the trailer down to texas, They put me up in a hotel. They load the trailer the next day<eos> And i just drive it back up here.
She suggests the minnow.<eos> I'm like, "no, i mean, someplace nice, with steaks. Gibson's."<eos> - She's like-- - i like the minnow.<eos> I say, "michelle, i've been to the minnow twice,<eos> "got sick two times.<eos> And the drinks are worse than the food."<eos> Course, little did i know--<eos> Auntie francine owns the minnow.<eos> But your mom did things for the right reasons.<eos> Never took a nickel when she needed it most.
Me!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Job.<eos> Take.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - I mean, is no one hearing what I'm saying?<eos> Is this thing on?<eos> Take the job.<eos> Okay.<eos> I guess I'll take it.
Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> It's just-- all your stupid, crazy, drama--<eos> I missed you!<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not all stupid, crazy drama.<eos> Gabi, open the door quick!<eos> Gabi!<eos> Gabi!<eos> Gabi!<eos> I flew a drone into Kal's penthouse and I crashed it and I need you to get it back for me.
What?<eos> Look at the texture.<eos> It's almost... zero porosity.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Steve, you're gonna want to see this.<eos> The asteroid GX210 was being tracked by the International Satellite Program when it suddenly disappeared.<eos> Did the meteor storm have anything to do with GX210?<eos> I can't answer that question at this time.<eos> We're still in the process of investigating this phenomenon.<eos> This phenomenon, as you call it, killed 12 Americans and injured dozens more.
The rest of you are with me.<eos> Okay, so you got... You got everything?<eos> I got the rocket, I've got the computer.<eos> - We're good. - You're good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> There's a lot of people here.<eos> Whoa!<eos> That is some rocket they got there.<eos> Yeah, well, it sure made the students who designed it rich.
It's fully loaded for launch.<eos> I think I can access its operating system.<eos> Here is all the data, including trajectory.<eos> Okay, help me brace this.<eos> Can you hold it?<eos> Right there.<eos> We only get one shot at this, don't we?<eos> We'll make it count.<eos> General, the... The asteroid is too damn big.<eos> Even if we do nuke it, the resulting debris would kill us.
Connor and Lance deny.<eos> And what about the fourth assailant?<eos> Zach Franklin.<eos> He's 20.<eos> He's a multi-sport scholar athlete.<eos> He's on a culture tour of Cuba right now.<eos> - Can we get him back?<eos> - From Cuba?<eos> Sarge, Taru just found a video that Connor made that night.<eos> He erased it from his cell, but they found it on his computer's hard drive.
Hey, Liv, you know about this?<eos> I'm John Buchanan, attorney for Zach Franklin.<eos> Star athlete, scholar, and unequivocally innocent of any and all charges in the so-called Hudson university gang-rape.<eos> Of course he is.<eos> That's a big bluff, even for Buchanan.<eos> Think he's got something?<eos> Tell them where you were December 12th, 2014, the night of Heather Manning's alleged assault.<eos> I was nine hours away, in Kimball, West Virginia, on the W.V. Hillmen soccer field.<eos> The championship game was televised live on sen until 11:40 P.M. eastern time.<eos> If you missed it, you'll be happy to hear Hudson won, 3-zip.
Hi. Alicia.<eos> Bit of a problem.<eos> From NPR News in Washington, I'm Lakshmi Singh.<eos> Another salvo in the ongoing cultural dispute over same-sex marriage in America, this time involving a gay couple in Idaho who were turned down by a wedding planner.<eos> Same-sex marriage is legal in Idaho, and the couple sued and won.<eos> But now prominent conservative activist Reese Dipple has agreed to fund the wedding planner's appeal.<eos> Do you have a dollar?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I need it.
Got something special for you.<eos> Something special?<eos> I hope you've got a tennis bracelet down your pants, 'cause there sure ain't nothing special about your cock.<eos> It is a cock, right?<eos> It's not just like a little puffy pussy?<eos> Back off, bitch.<eos> Oh, is that the best you got?<eos> You're never gonna get laid with game like that, Chief.<eos> Get a job and a nice car, not that piece of shit I see you driving around in.<eos> If you want pussy, you're gonna have to pay for it 'cause I really can't see anybody fucking you for free.
I'm done.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> I'm not gonna be handled again. Not by anybody.<eos> I mean, you trust someone, you let them in, they fuck you up.<eos> Fuck that, you know?<eos> And the cops won't help you.<eos> Nobody will help you.<eos> You have to do it yourself.<eos> You have to walk out and never look back.<eos> And if that doesn't work, you take a paring knife and you fillet it like a fish.
We got her all scared.<eos> I don't know if she was weak and just very good at hiding it or if she was outmaneuvered.<eos> That's an interesting choice of word.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> Just that maybe things didn't go as she planned.<eos> Well, what do you think she had planned?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Not being dead.<eos> She wasn't weak.<eos> A history of abuse doesn't mean she was some fucking loser who brought it on herself.
Well, if you change your mind, I'm a good listener.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oscar.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just wanted to make sure you were okay.<eos> Do you have a few minutes?<eos> I read about your daughter's case.<eos> They really botched it.
So you were eight blocks north of there.<eos> I got lost going home.<eos> Thought someone was following me.<eos> Guess I panicked.<eos> Why not a gym in your own neighborhood?<eos> Can't afford it.<eos> All right, well, the gym explains the change of clothes.<eos> You found my bag, good.<eos> But not the lighter fluid.<eos> I was returning it.
Find the enemy.<eos> But there was no enemy to find.<eos> Clear.<eos> Clear. Go, go, go, go! Whatever it was was actually, like, holding a gun next to my ear and just opening fire.<eos> I'm gonna die on this God forsaken rock out in the middle of Afghanistan.<eos> _<eos> All I remember was hearing the noise. Ah!<eos> All of a sudden, it was completely silent like there's nothing even there, and I couldn't even explain what was going on.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Everyone heard it.
But they did come up here every now and then.<eos> Yes, naturally.<eos> If the man or men or women were here to do arduous work, the hours would have been long. They would have needed to eat, hydrate and, of course, expel waste.<eos> Toilet seat was up, so I'm guessing at least one person was a "he."<eos> Also we found this in the fridge.<eos> "Doogh."<eos> Carbonated yogurt drink popular in Arab countries.<eos> It's hard to believe bubbling yogurt is popular anywhere.<eos> I figured it didn't belong to the Ayers, so I called the American distributor.<eos> No place on the island sells it.
You just seemed a little off these last couple of days.<eos> I know it wasn't the credit.<eos> You and Holmes don't care about that stuff, but... whatever it was...<eos> You know what? She just got excited.<eos> That's all.<eos> I don't think you should help her again.<eos> She is what she is.<eos> She wants what she wants.<eos> I love her... but I love this job, too.<eos> The people who do it.
You saved my life.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Boys, there's no time.<eos> Oh, and Caleb, we also borrowed a few of the prototype 128 gig multi-state RAM chips from Project X.<eos> You knew about Project X?<eos> Really needed it.<eos> Thanks again. Huh.<eos> Look what we have here.<eos> A phone hooked up to my mesh network.<eos> Detective Riley and company commandeered it for themselves.
The Machine can't be here because there's simply not enough room.<eos> If the Machine's not here, then why are we?<eos> That's what we have to find out.<eos> Looks like a computer I made as a teenager.<eos> What is it for?<eos> No idea.<eos> Just following orders as fast as I can.<eos> That cable, first transformer.<eos> Hurry.<eos> You find it, Harry?
Just need to get her a little job.<eos> ~ She's ready now.<eos> ~ Good.<eos> Good.<eos> Do you want to give me a hand moving this cake, Pat?<eos> ~ I just want to make some more room.<eos> ~ Righty-ho.<eos> Oh, before I forget, I've got that Countdown video you lent me.<eos> ~ Don't worry about it.<eos> ~ No, no, I'm sure you'll want it back.
I want to show her that I built a settlement.<eos> Oh, she won't be long. She's just running an errand.<eos> It's got pigs and everything.<eos> I think I'd like a drink now, Jim.<eos> ~ Can I have a gin and tonic, please?<eos> ~ Yes, right. Do you want ice?<eos> ~ Yes, but don't be putting willies in it.<eos> ~ What?<eos> Pat has these ice cubes at his house in the shape of willies.<eos> You fill the tray with water, put it in the freezer, and out comes 24 little ice willies.
Do you think we can get away with that?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Right.<eos> 'Oh, Terry, while you're there, can we get you to do the link 'into part two please? '<eos> Yeah, could I get a cold Diet Coke please, Gemma?<eos> ~ 'Sure.' ~ I'd like a Diet Coke as well, please, Gemma.<eos> So, am I actually going to be on telly?<eos> Yeah, you'll be part of a montage.<eos> We do it a few times to get the best reactions.<eos> Brilliant, cos I thought they cancelled it.
We can start in a new world with new names... a chance for us to have something of our own.<eos> I remember Magistrate Hale talking of the West Indies... warm waters and soft beaches everywhere you turn.<eos> No mercy or pox.<eos> Oh, Isaac...<eos> What a sweet dream.<eos> One that we don't have to wait for sleep to see true.<eos> Dollie, I've got means.<eos> Your money?<eos> I heard them talk about it in the clinic.<eos> Where did you get it?
I don't know where she kept her journal.<eos> Well, you are the expert on teenage girls.<eos> Um, I've got to go.<eos> Th-they're making me see some, ah, bereavement counsellor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, don't we need a warrant?<eos> A student invited us in.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, she really didn't want her journal found.<eos> Maybe she took it home.
Besides, I don't think you really care about those files you stole.<eos> The one you... need, the one you want, truth about your brother. All you got to do is let me in.<eos> Keep your hands up.<eos> Inside.<eos> Move. Now.<eos> How is he?<eos> He's lost a liter of blood.<eos> You got the file on my brother?<eos> I do.<eos> And I'll show it to you.
I found it.<eos> In the street.<eos> Oh, I wanna know the street where I can find a $400,000 watch.<eos> Sounds like a place I wanna visit.<eos> I'm just lucky.<eos> Debatable.<eos> Since this watch was stolen from a murdered man's wrist, just yesterday.<eos> I... I don't know anything about a murder.<eos> - I... I didn't kill anyone!<eos> - Then who gave it to you?
Señora Pacetti's receiving a call.<eos> It's from a prepaid phone.<eos> Mama?<eos> - Carlo, where are you?<eos> - I'm tracking him now.<eos> - Police came to visit...<eos> - I should be able to get his location.<eos> - ... asking me questions about the money.<eos> - I can explain.<eos> Why did you need it?
Hey. My real name is Angela Montenegro.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Okay. Then who is Pookie Noodlin?<eos> You know what, don't say that name out loud here.<eos> I cannot believe that after all of this time, I finally know my wife's real name.<eos> It's like something you name a pet.<eos> That you hate.<eos> Why didn't you ever get it... get it, you know, legally changed? My dad.<eos> He...<eos> It just meant something important to him, and he begged me to leave it un-until he...
Keep moving.<eos> Hi.<eos> What happened?<eos> You look shocked like your entire World turned upside-down.<eos> Didn't I say...we'll definitely meet today?<eos> And what did you say?<eos> "Don't come...it's dangerous."<eos> Actually...the danger you were talking about...<eos> That danger is me.<eos> You didn't get it.
When asked, He said that he owns the car.<eos> Yeah... When the dog's about the die the Thakufis manager says, "Thakufls dead".<eos> That's nothing orginal.<eos> It's a dialogue from Karan-Arjun (Bollywood film).<eos> Maybe you don't know who I am.<eos> I am King.<eos> King. So do you want me to make your adhaar card, son of burger king.<eos> This car...<eos> Don't even dream about this car.<eos> I won't sell it at any cost.
Maybe you don't know who I am.<eos> I am King.<eos> King. So do you want me to make your adhaar card, son of burger king.<eos> This car...<eos> Don't even dream about this car.<eos> I won't sell it at any cost.<eos> And anyway, Oscar never deals with the likes of you.<eos> Have your food and leave quietly.<eos> Forgive me...it's not my fault.<eos> Mani stole this car and brought it to me.
I love you, too.<eos> But right now, who cares?<eos> This is bigger than us.<eos> 'So you had me spring my own aunt from jail without even realising.'<eos> Very funny, God.<eos> Very funny.<eos> I haven't worked it out yet, but you are up to something, aren't you?<eos> Playing a game.<eos> Giving me a taste of my own medicine.<eos> That dream I had about freeing Rhonda, didn't understand it, did I?
That's all right.<eos> Morning, everybody.<eos> I apologise for the delay but as you can imagine we've been somewhat busy today.<eos> Scotty McNeil, Senior Adviser, Special Situations Group, will run briefly through our timetable and then we'll take any questions.<eos> Scotty. Erm... Erm...<eos> The Operation Saviour launch will take place today at 1700 hours.<eos> Assuming the launch succeeds it will take seven days for the craft to reach the comet.<eos> We are not trying to destroy the comet.<eos> It's too big.<eos> We just want to deflect it enough so that it safely misses Earth.
Six, five, four, three, two, one.<eos> Trajectory is good.<eos> Thrust is good.<eos> Saviour is in the air.<eos> Repeat, Saviour is in the air.<eos> - Jude, you hold on so tight!<eos> - Because you're a terrible driver!<eos> It's the Saviour launch.<eos> I forgot all about it.<eos> We missed it.
We're not "nobody."<eos> Yeah, thank God I'm out of that car.<eos> You two have the worst taste in music I've heard in my life.<eos> You found the pimp.<eos> Pimp by night.<eos> Tattoo artist by day.<eos> The purse?<eos> In his trunk.<eos> There was a DNA tube sewn in to the lining.<eos> I'm running it down to Abby now.
I told you Vito wasn't gonna be a good boss.<eos> He dug his grave.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> It's time for something to happen.<eos> Luciano knows Vito Genovese has become a major liability.<eos> And he needs to find a way to keep him in check.<eos> But before Luciano can get to Genovese, a mobster looking to reduce his jail time comes forward with information on a murder that has the potential to destroy Luciano's crime family.<eos> I have some information.<eos> I saw the hit.<eos> And I know who ordered it.
There was an alliance, and that stuck in his heart.<eos> To Luciano,<eos> Rothstein is a father figure, and everything he aspires to be.<eos> Who does he report to?<eos> He reports to.<eos> Rothstein is the epitome of sophistication and self-control but every man has a weakness.<eos> And for Rothstein, it's high stakes gambling.<eos> Without a doubt, the Mob will eat away at your personality and at your soul.<eos> You have this weight that you're carrying around with you.<eos> Now, some guys are able to shed it with alcohol.

We'll do it gratis and off-site.<eos> Nowhere near the stench of the oil business.<eos> I think they'll love it.<eos> They'll never have to see a suit and tie.<eos> Do you have the zoning records on Mutiny's current address?<eos> Just to take that further for a second, where they are now, east side, neighborhood's a little rough, house itself hasn't seen a coat of paint since the invention of the Model A, but the heart of the company is sewn up into its walls.<eos> We could save some coin and embrace that motley spirit.<eos> There's nothing stopping us from buying up the house, the entire block.<eos> We could turn the place into a mini campus.<eos> Let them design it, grow it as they see fit.
That was smart.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I, um...<eos> I went by the house.<eos> They told me.<eos> We don't know who did it.<eos> You probably never will.<eos> Sixth grade, first day of school.<eos> Someone wrote "fag" on my locker.<eos> I got some paper towels from the bathroom, wet them down, and scrubbed it off before anyone could see.
Hi, can I see your pass, please?<eos> Oh, it's not around my neck?<eos> Oh, it was there just a second ago.<eos> It must have slipped down.<eos> Can you see it?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Take a look.<eos> Take a long, lingering look.<eos> Nope, still don't see it.
I spent years recovering obscure artifacts from all over the world.<eos> This is what I do.<eos> Okay, so as far as I can tell, the message and that satchel ended up as part of Colonel Prescott's estate.<eos> They were passed down from owner to owner, until eventually being sold to an entertainment franchise company. Huh.<eos> It's in Colonial Times.<eos> We need it in the here and now.<eos> No, no.<eos> I mean it's actually in Colonial Times.<eos> The deeds of so many brave men and women, signposts of history, reminders of our hardship and the ultimate sacrifice...<eos> They've taken it and used it to decorate an eatery.
Don't cut that up, Chef.<eos> Don't you see a live one right there?<eos> So, Mrs. Lau.<eos> When will you show us the chalice.<eos> Your husband bought at Sotheby's.<eos> For $280 million?<eos> It is 600 years old,<eos> Emperors drank from it.<eos> Your husband was brash enough.<eos> As soon as he got it, without wiping.
I've often eaten geoduck.<eos> But never a whole one!<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Ouch!<eos> It hurts!<eos> Ouch!<eos> Excuse, how do I pee with this?<eos> Rub it on me.<eos> Well?<eos> Do you want it?
No wonder your acting is so realistic.<eos> You draw from real experience!<eos> The King of Gigolo was just rising to fame.<eos> Can this still get a rise out of him?<eos> Good timing, look at this footage.<eos> I've finished editing two-thirds of the film.<eos> I really think you did a great job acting!<eos> The part about servicing a rich woman is just...<eos> You're sure to get next year's New Actor award!<eos> Have you seen it?
You're focusing on the wrong thing.<eos> Well, what the fuck should I be focusing on?<eos> Well, why don't you tell me, Pernell?<eos> Who are you really mad at? Julio.<eos> You have to bring him back.<eos> I think it starts with figuring out where to put all of the anger.<eos> Put the body where it belongs.<eos> The rest will fall into place.<eos> Where?<eos> Where do I put it?
I don't want you here alone when KD's working.<eos> So, if you're gone the whole day, I just don't come in to work?<eos> At least not for now, while we're getting a feel for him.<eos> Paul, he's been coming here for six months.<eos> I think we know him by now.<eos> KD is a harmless, God-fearing man.<eos> He's a convict and an addict.<eos> You mean ex-convict, ex-addict?<eos> KD's damaged goods.<eos> You can feed a stray dog, but you don't take it home to your family.
If you found the Machine, I'd be the first to know.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We have scoured every network device on the planet without success, until I realized, you are the last piece of the puzzle.<eos> The answer is in your head.<eos> I don't have the slightest idea where the Machine's located.<eos> Not in your brain.<eos> In your head.<eos> Your direct line to the Machine.<eos> The cochlear implant.<eos> Your little girlfriend told us all about it.
Hey!<eos> You failed to mention they were gonna take our guns.<eos> You said you don't like me pointing out the obvious.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Nasim Chaikin, Ahmad's number two man.<eos> Handsome... in a terrorist kind of way.<eos> Honored guests, please follow me.<eos> I lived up to our arrangement.<eos> You can take the collar off.<eos> When the mission's over, I'll find you, and I'll remove it.
Please, come in.<eos> The Vice President's expecting you.<eos> Madame Vice President, I'm Diana Hood.<eos> After Gray Lawson's untimely death,<eos> - I have been appointed acting director of the CIA.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> I'll try not to judge you by the actions of your predecessor.<eos> - Is that the antidote?<eos> - Yes, Madame Vice President.<eos> But before I hand it over, Agency council has asked me to clarify that this transaction is not to be construed as admission of wrongdoing or illegal activity.
She's gonna find all that out.<eos> I'm...<eos> Well, I...<eos> Gentlemen, as you know, I've been incubating my next big idea in my Taco Tank.<eos> You mean hot boxing in a storage container?<eos> After careful study of eating, Taco Tank has discovered that over the past few centuries, there have been many advances in food technology.<eos> However, there have been very few advances in napkin technology.<eos> Oh, I thought this was gonna be stupid.<eos> Introducing... the napkin glove.<eos> Put it on when you're having a meal.
Did everyone get a napkin glove?<eos> What's going on, Raf?<eos> No food.<eos> Everything here looks like shit.<eos> Plus, I bring my own food, bro.<eos> Oh, pocket dog.<eos> That's right.<eos> No, this is a crotch-et dog.<eos> Oh, got it.<eos> I keep it in my crotch so it stays hot.
Of course.<eos> A present from Ellie, hot off the press.<eos> There...<eos> "Sweet Muse,<eos> Mad about you: a life-changing moment, 14:00 yesterday."<eos> - That's 14:00 today.<eos> - It's a death sentence and we can't warn him because we don't know who he is.<eos> Yeah, but he knows who Sophie is though.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Her abduction was kept out of the press... nobody knows about it.
Amen, there.<eos> So please come, break bread with us and share in the blessings our good Lord has provided.<eos> You ever seen The Wicker Man?<eos> No, why?<eos> I think this is the sequel.<eos> Maui said you chose these symbols yourself.<eos> Why this design over any other?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's been in my head for years.<eos> I kept sketching it over and over and then finally had it done.
Okay, nigger.<eos> You know what it'd take to get me onboard for the Brook's grid expansion?<eos> Everything I've already asked for, plus a separate budget allocation from the discretionary fund.<eos> Let me know if you can make that happen, nigger.<eos> Brother Harris called.<eos> He says he needs to talk.<eos> - He's on his way.<eos> - Good.<eos> You can give him his check back.<eos> Yes, I still have it.

Yeah, exactly.<eos> Forget it, okay?<eos> We'll... we'll do this later.<eos> Shit.<eos> That's gotta be it.<eos> That's gotta be the fucking book.<eos> Where is that book?<eos> It's right there.<eos> Jocelyn was flipping out about it too.<eos> She brought it back from her house.
He didn't feel what ordinary people feel.<eos> In his eyes, everyone was a puzzle.<eos> He took immense satisfaction figuring out what a person wanted and then giving it to them.<eos> As if we were all computers...<eos> Waiting for the correct code.<eos> Alistair could be anything a person wanted him to be.<eos> In your case, it appears you craved romance, a good old-fashioned love story.<eos> He gave it to you.<eos> Meanwhile, he continued giving other kinds of stimulation to other kinds of people, men and women.<eos> If he was involved with someone who hankered after risk, he would have provided it.
Well, I had made a decision, but then wonder boy had to go and fail, and then, Maddie passing -- well, who saw that coming, huh?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sneaky smart.<eos> Almost impossible to detect.<eos> Okay, so, wait. When are you gonna decide, daddy?<eos> Well, given the -- the weightiness of this decision and the way it will impact the rest of your lives...<eos> I'm gonna need at least an hour.<eos> This is so awkward.<eos> You know, one of us isn't gonna get the job, and the other one's name is already on the sign.<eos> You know, Maddie, if I get the job, I earned it.
Thank you so much.<eos> You know, our pilot is also a huge fan.<eos> You think you could sign a book for her, too?<eos> I'd love to. All I ask in return is that she deliver us to Heathrow safely.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Enjoy your stay in London, Mr. Castle.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I got bumped out of my assigned seat.<eos> You said you'd fix it.
Either way, Castle, you're gonna have to interrogate him.<eos> Me?<eos> You've been with me in hundreds of interrogations.<eos> Yeah, just never when my life depended on it, along with everyone else's.<eos> Hey, guys, I have more bad news.<eos> According to the airline,<eos> Haddad has a checked bag on the flight.<eos> F.B.I. needs you to locate and search it.<eos> Great. And if we find something?<eos> In the event there's an explosive device, the bomb squad will talk you through it.
Great. And if we find something?<eos> In the event there's an explosive device, the bomb squad will talk you through it.<eos> We need to find his luggage.<eos> - I'll go with you.<eos> I need you and Farrah upstairs keeping things calm.<eos> The passengers are starting to ask questions.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> That a gentleman had too much to drink, but I'm not sure they believed me.<eos> I'll go.<eos> The faster we find it, the safer we'll be.
Dad?<eos> Could I see you for a second?<eos> Anything?<eos> We checked his luggage.<eos> No gun, no device, nothing that speaks to terrorism.<eos> Look, state can confirm the story about the sick mother, but part of Haddad's story checks out.<eos> Turns out that air marshal Ford had a second phone on the flight.<eos> It was his personal cell.<eos> Well, we didn't find a second phone on the body.<eos> Well, if it had evidence on it, it's possible the killer removed it.
Ready. Farrah and I are in coach, and Jim is in first class.<eos> Watch for anyone reaching for their phone.<eos> Ford's phone could be in the killer's hands. Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go.<eos> Pinging now.<eos> Over there.<eos> False alarm.<eos> Do you hear anything?<eos> If someone removed the battery or even turned it off, Tory's not gonna be able...
"It's not a threat if I follow through and take down this plane."<eos> Whoever's behind this is still on the plane.<eos> - Beckett, I've got something.<eos> - Yeah, hold on.<eos> Those texts on the marshal's phone, they were sent<eos> - from a pre-paid cell.<eos> - Can you trace it?<eos> No, it looks like it's been turned off.<eos> Okay, run down that number.<eos> See if you can find out who bought it and from where. Castle?
The real celestialis is self-winding.<eos> This watch has a knob.<eos> Which means this was never about terrorism, it was about a heist.<eos> I don't... I don't understand.<eos> You're wearing a knockoff.<eos> It got switched out while you were sleeping.<eos> You weren't supposed to realize it until you were off the plane and the real watch was long gone.<eos> That obnoxious guy who had his seat changed.<eos> Was this originally where he was supposed to sit?<eos> Yes, but Mr. Ford put in a request for that seat two days ago, and air marshals get priority, so the system assigned it to him.
Fortunately, I'm really good at holding my breath.<eos> Ungrateful peasants.<eos> The Black Death, 1348.<eos> I meant to warn you.<eos> I got sick but I got better.<eos> Of course, your immune system is learning too.<eos> There's another bout coming.<eos> - And a big fire that tears through London.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> - Maybe I start it.
"I cannot...<eos> "will not suffer such heartbreak again."<eos> "From now on, it's me against the world."<eos> Quiet, my friend.<eos> We have a visitor.<eos> I didn't get it, but I will.<eos> If your promise stands, I'll have it by dawn<eos> My visitor can help me.<eos> Don't worry, he doesn't know about you, only about the artefact.<eos> He has no idea what we intend to do with it.
You are not of this world, or part of my plans.<eos> I have no quarrel with you.<eos> Then tell me why you are here and what you intend to do.<eos> Otherwise, get on with trying to kill me.<eos> But I advise you -- be very quick and very sure.<eos> I am from Delta Leonis.<eos> My tribe was overthrown, my world destroyed, my wife killed as we escaped.<eos> Using the amulet?<eos> That's your means of travel?<eos> I lost it when I crashed to Earth.

I do, now, but...<eos> You still won't take me with you.<eos> You gad about while I trudge through the centuries, day by day, hour by hour.<eos> Do you ever think or care what happens after you've flown away?<eos> I live in the world you leave behind.<eos> Because you abandoned me to it.<eos> Why should I be responsible for you?<eos> You made me immortal!<eos> I saved your life.<eos> I didn't know that your heart would rust because I kept it beating.
'Four.'<eos> 'Three.'<eos> 'Two.'<eos> 'One.'<eos> Spencer, he says there's no such ***<eos> Charles DiLaurentis in our family.<eos> Ali, I'm gonna say this is delicately as I can.<eos> Your father's a liar.<eos> That was the delicate way?<eos> He didn't say, let me think or ask you where you heard the name or who asked about it, he just shut you down.
- Em...<eos> Paige did the right thing, leaving town.<eos> I won't drag her back into this.<eos> She deserves to be happy.<eos> So do you.<eos> Hey, roomie.<eos> You forgot to make the bed.<eos> I will.<eos> A nice blank canvas here.<eos> Any idea what you wanna do with it?
- Another world.<eos> - So it seems.<eos> Of course, I was away at the war in the middle of that.<eos> - Why are you leaving now?<eos> - It seems like the right time far a mane.<eos> Does it'?<eos> Does it, indeed?<eos> Tell me, Mr Moore, what exactly is an assistant butler?<eos> - I'm not familiar with the term.<eos> - No, well, we made it up.
I ought to do some shopping while I'm here.<eos> I haven't had anything new in ages.<eos> - Why not go shopping together?<eos> - With Mary?<eos> Not likely.<eos> - That was a delicious dinner.<eos> - Oh, I have a new cook.<eos> She won't stay, the good ones never do, but we shall eat well until she goes.<eos> What have you decided to do about your flat?<eos> I think I'm going to keep it empty and see if I get any use out of it.
Don't push us out, m'lord.<eos> We've been here since before Waterloo.<eos> I'm not pushing anyone anywhere.<eos> I want Lady Edith to be happy, I want Miss Marigold to be happy and as a matter of fact, I would like your wife to be happy, too.<eos> I can manage her, I promise.<eos> - Very well, if you're sure you can.<eos> - I am sure.<eos> Then we'll leave it at that.<eos> Did you manage to raise the subject?<eos> His Lordship brought it up.
- Am I?<eos> - I was right about London.<eos> You've been very bouncy since you got back.<eos> It did you good.<eos> It did.<eos> Now let me get on.<eos> I'll see you down here, just before ten.<eos> - How long can we stay there?<eos> - Good question.<eos> I must have a staff to serve tea in case they want it.
Why did you convince her to drop out of school?<eos> What makes you think that was my idea? And that tattoo?<eos> I bet that was your idea as well. God, you really don't know Ali, do you?<eos> Look, she dropped out of college on her own, okay?<eos> It was holding her back. She wants to be an event planner, not a biology major.<eos> Obviously I'm all for college. It's why I'm there. I need it.<eos> She can blaze her own trail. Thank you, Jack Kerouac.<eos> [Crumbling]<eos> What's wrong?<eos> The bridge is closed. What if they closed it Because of the earthquake?
Loosen your collar.<eos> I told Annie it was probably nothing, but she worries.<eos> I do worry.<eos> And that's not a bad thing.<eos> - Stop talking.<eos> - Her or me?<eos> Both of you.<eos> - Has it increased in size?<eos> - No.<eos> Like I say, I only saw it a couple of days ago.
- Not Mr Bellant?<eos> - No show again.<eos> - Typical.<eos> What is the matter with you people?<eos> Come through.<eos> You let him speak to you like that?<eos> He speaks to everyone like that.<eos> Well, I hope he pays you well for the privilege.<eos> You know, a great woman gave this book to me.<eos> And told me when I was finished to pass it on to someone else.
Is he even alive?<eos> He's alive!<eos> He's still breathing.<eos> Well, let's get him down.<eos> - I need a saw.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I can't get the bracket from this angle.<eos> Mills, I need you to get it from above.
Yeah.<eos> Total surprise, actually.<eos> Boden just sprung it on me.<eos> Come say hi to the guys.<eos> Actually, is there somewhere we can go for a little privacy?<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You could throw a stone and hit the water, it's that close.<eos> I'm telling you, a little revamp, and this place could be the beachfront hot spot.<eos> Okay, so then we renovate it and we sell it.
That one's bleeding pretty good.<eos> (Boden) Battalion 25 to Main, we need two additional ambulances at Ashland and Cermak.<eos> (Boden) Severide, check the hatchback for pin-ins. - Truck.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Triage the other two.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> You got a name?<eos> Viri Sanchez. Is my dad okay?<eos> Guy wasn't wearing a seat belt.<eos> He took it off.
Someone remotely hacked into the car's computer and took control of it.<eos> So Dani's crash wasn't an accident.<eos> Dani Fox and Sebastian Zuber got a $4 million grant from the Lanwell Foundation.<eos> Do you like eating out of a carton?<eos> 'Cause you know, I got you a plate.<eos> Food tastes the same either way.<eos> Their hypothesis is that deep trans-cranial magnetic stimulation can speed up recovery from brain injuries.<eos> That is why you need a plate.<eos> That's what I saw in their lab.<eos> They built it themselves.
That we've had since the '40s.<eos> No fuel, no flame, no combustion.<eos> A simple electromagnetic field.<eos> Technology kept secret for 70 years while the world ran on petroleum.<eos> - Oil companies making trillions.<eos> - What I'm gonna show you next is the most unbelievable part.<eos> Gravity warp drive... but how?<eos> Element 115.<eos> Ununpentium.<eos> Where did you get it?
Get him on oxygen and start cutting off the jacket, but wait to uncover the wound.<eos> - I'll be right there.<eos> - All right.<eos> (Mills) Hey, you guys, I need the room.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Look at me right here. What's your name?<eos> You know my name.<eos> I'm the one that helped you...<eos> I know that I know your name.<eos> I'm making sure that you know it.
Fair enough.<eos> I'm not gonna remove the bone from your chest.<eos> Why?<eos> I also got 5 milligrams of Midazolam if you need it.<eos> Would you like a sedative, Jim?<eos> I want this damn thing taken out.<eos> (Will) Believe it or not, you're fine for now.<eos> If I remove that from your chest, that's when you're gonna be in trouble.<eos> So I'm gonna cut down the bone so it doesn't move and damage your lung.<eos> And then we'll wrap it and secure it, and you're gonna keep calm until I can get you to an OR.
No, no!<eos> Samira!<eos> Abu Omar.<eos> - I should have known it was you.<eos> - You know him?<eos> I want to help you liberate Abuddin from the apostate Al Fayeeds.<eos> I said there was to be no gas.<eos> Yesterday in Ma'an... a thousand people dead.<eos> The legal team representing the Al Fayeed trust is contesting the will.<eos> Okay, so how do I get it?
We can meet at our apartment. We'll figure this out, okay?<eos> - Has anybody seen my laptop?<eos> - Are you sure it was in there, Mom?<eos> Yes, Tom.<eos> I was writing here this morning.<eos> And this is everything?<eos> This was everything in the hallway?<eos> Mom, Mom, calm down.<eos> My book was on it and I don't have a backup.<eos> You didn't email it to yourself?
- Has anybody seen my laptop?<eos> - Are you sure it was in there, Mom?<eos> Yes, Tom.<eos> I was writing here this morning.<eos> And this is everything?<eos> This was everything in the hallway?<eos> Mom, Mom, calm down.<eos> My book was on it and I don't have a backup.<eos> You didn't email it to yourself?<eos> That motherfucker took it.
Fuck!<eos> Please.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Tell your mom Meg says hello.<eos> It's a great piece.<eos> A special occasion?<eos> Oh, it's for a meeting.<eos> With a publisher.<eos> I wrote a book.<eos> I mean, I just sent it to some places.
- Whoa, hold on.<eos> Do not park your vehicle here.<eos> There's a table up the road for volunteers.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You woke up down there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I came up that embankment.<eos> That's when I saw the car.<eos> You should get down there.<eos> If someone else finds your phone, you can say you just lost it today.
- Because I do.<eos> How?<eos> Before I worked in benefits in the DSD, they had me in the fraudulent claims department.<eos> People who said their family members departed so they could get a check.<eos> My beat was secondary departures.<eos> I got assigned this woman.<eos> She and her husband used to walk their dog together every morning.<eos> It was about a year and a half after the 14th.<eos> And as they're walking out the front door, the phone rings.<eos> So she goes back inside and she picks it up.
We do it every six months or so to see if there's been any change in her condition.<eos> - Was there?<eos> - Sorry?<eos> Any change in her condition.<eos> N-no.<eos> Except for the pregnant part.<eos> What?<eos> You-- you went through Mary's bag?<eos> It fell out.<eos> One of the rangers picked it up.
- We signed a...<eos> - nondisclosure agreement.<eos> What are y'all wearing tonight?<eos> To the fundraiser.<eos> I'm wearing whatever I want.<eos> Okay, well, then I'll see you tonight.<eos> Emily, you smell like alcohol.<eos> _<eos> Order up.<eos> Hey, you found it.
Why would I do that?<eos> Because I have plans tonight and I don't want to miss them Because I'm back in here fixing you up again.<eos> Let me get you some ice.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing out here, miss lily?<eos> Oh, let's get out of there.<eos> Oh, oh, okay.<eos> Hey. Aw. "researchers found themselves intrigued<eos> They never confirmed that fucking carousel.<eos> Some genius in German tourism cooked it up.
- Yeah, just a minute.<eos> I know you go out there to pray with him.<eos> Who?<eos> Don't make me say his name.<eos> Do you know what your father would do if he found out?<eos> Shoot him again?<eos> Michael, you can't go out there anymore.<eos> - He deserves forgiveness.<eos> - No, not him.<eos> Everyone who asks for it deserves it, Mom.
- Excuse me.<eos> I've got to record this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We're gonna go ahead and get started.<eos> Thank you.<eos> On behalf of me and Sam and Loretta And John and Erika, We are so grateful for y'all coming out to support our girls so we can get them back to that beautiful choir real soon.<eos> If Taylor and Violet and Evie are out there, we're gonna find them.<eos> Our girls were such good friends ever since they were little.<eos> Emily and I put together this little slide show.<eos> I hope you enjoy it.
- I can't.<eos> Agata.<eos> - Yes. - Yes what?<eos> Gustavo, hang on a minute.<eos> - Again?<eos> - Just a moment.<eos> Are you married?<eos> Agata.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> All night you talk about your frustrations, about what they make you write, your thesis on Melville's short stories,
People going, "I love America!<eos> "It's raining gravy!"<eos> Shit, give them a Whopper, it's only 99 cents.<eos> Shit, we call ourselves humanitarians, meanwhile we're dropping 50-pound sacks on 40-pound people.<eos> But I love America, man.<eos> We got a lot of freedom in America.<eos> For instance, abortion's legal.<eos> It's beautiful that abortion's legal, man.<eos> I love going to abortion rallies to pick up women.<eos> Cos you know they'll fuck you.
"OK."<eos> Bitch, you gonna get us killed!<eos> The fuck is wrong with you?<eos> You won't last five minutes on the streets.<eos> Now I don't cheat, man.<eos> Another big reason I don't cheat is cos I never meet any girls that wanna fuck me.<eos> I'm just not that celebrity.<eos> I don't bring it out of them.<eos> Women see Denzel Washington, they go, "I'm gonna fuck him."<eos> They start kicking off shoes soon as they see his ass.
Mother, you stay in corridor for a while.<eos> I'll talk to him myself.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> Why did you get kicked out of school?<eos> Bakha said, "Do you wanna bonk Anelka?"<eos> And you?<eos> I said, "I do."<eos> And then what?<eos> And then<eos> Bakha pushed me into the cloakroom with the girls and they bonked me themselves on the head.
There's an art of finding anything to do that isn't work.<eos> That was their final warning for pursuing something to do other than their job.<eos> A few weeks earlier, Barry and Matt had been reported for what they called<eos> "helping the ladies".<eos> It was these shampoo bottles that sent them on their quest.<eos> Barry and Matt knew what they look like... and they knew that the women in the supermarket knew what they looked like.<eos> Their theory was that even though it was a sex toy masquerading as a bottle of shampoo, women would like to try it as a sex toy but were embarrassed to buy it,<eos> because they knew what it looked like.<eos> The decision to buy it would be an easier one if they were already at the checkout.<eos> If they didn't object then Barry and Matt knew they helped the bottle to find an happy home.
Those girls did nothing wrong.<eos> I was watching.<eos> - It's Ryuji!<eos> - Ryuji.<eos> It's...<eos> Unicorn Ryuji.<eos> Even if they were cheating it's up to you to catch them.<eos> It's still your fault.<eos> Those are the rules of this game.<eos> But they're underage.
Why did you kill him?<eos> This bandit is a follower of the Niratta cult, practicing physical invulnerability... and committing crimes without conscience.<eos> I f I'd let him live, a larger number of Taxila people would be dead.<eos> It's the power of deities and celestial beings that has helped us kill him.<eos> They wanted us to kill the bandit?<eos> Guru...<eos> What is the matter?<eos> I don't want these goats to be dead.<eos> They will be reincarnated into a higher caste.<eos> They will be reincarnated?
Are those things in life you need to do to force... but then puts in the drawer cazzate of... where you live, too.<eos> And it ended there.<eos> But with this one behind... what the fuck we have ever found?<eos> What we have seen in this here?<eos> +ADw-I was inconceivable+ACE- I can not understand their own+ACE-<eos> It's beyond+ACE-<eos> That is... Waves of destiny+ACIAIQ-<eos> Perhaps because I I could make it talk?<eos> Because if you are not you ever noticed, women need to talk+ACE-<eos> Not only they, the human being itself is made of language.
The senior partners are behind you 100%.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> I'm looking forward to working myself into the mix. Angel.<eos> Spike.<eos> Welcome to the team.<eos> Well, he's not so bad.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I breathe easier.<eos> The walls don't press in as hard when you can't see them.<eos> - But they're still here.
Which is?<eos> The Red Sox.<eos> For years, many years, they have, at one time or another... made each and every one of us insane.<eos> Last October, when they lost the seventh game to the Yankees, crime went up in this city.<eos> It's already been predicted we'll have a flood of August babies next year... from celebration-induced pregnancies.<eos> The Red Sox make us lose ourselves.<eos> And in the wake of that team giving us what our hearts have yearned for all our lives... our parents' and grandparents' lives... we have fallen victim to a delirium... that makes us believe anything... anything is possible... including, but not limited to the notion... that God put a fetching, one-legged woman... in this man's path... to commemorate the end of a wretched, horrid curse.<eos> You know me, Bill.<eos> I have hookers all the time.<eos> They come to my house.
Oh, my God.<eos> Wendy was such a prude, she'd cover the mirror when she got out of the shower.<eos> People confuse your obsession with sexuality as an obsession with sex.<eos> Imagine being three years old, tormented by the sensation that you had the wrong parts.<eos> Your body's like a foreign country and you're stuck without a passport.<eos> All because in your first trimester your "X" and "Y" chromosomes split off and went different directions;<eos> girl brain, boy body.<eos> It's like the Guiterman poem:<eos> "Amoebas at the start Were not complex.<eos> But then they tore themselves apart And started sex. "
But there must be something angelic in the way I look, because even on their last breath, they didn't think I'd actually do it.<eos> Am I disappointing you guys ?<eos> I mean, are you looking at me, wishing I was...<eos> - scarier ? - No.<eos> I was wondering what happened to your glasses.<eos> Stupid Lasik.<eos> It's what got me caught.<eos> Is it ?<eos> When that Debby bitch busted my glasses...<eos> I decided they were a liability.
How is he intentionally "locking" them in? Skillfully.<eos> I'd imagine first, he'd have to sedate the subject, put them in a docile state in order to locate specific arterial pressure points.<eos> He wasn't getting more violent. He was perfecting his maneuver.<eos> LeAnn Goodman was found... first, but she had bedsores.<eos> The Russian woman we found second, died first.<eos> She had no bed sores.<eos> She died quickly.<eos> This means we found the bodies out of order.<eos> Our first two victims were failures.<eos> That's why they were discarded.
I'm not one to fall for tricks.<eos> This isn't a trick.<eos> Hands off me.<eos> The witches have double-crossed me.<eos> They want to keep me against my will.<eos> So do I.<eos> Yeah, let me guess.<eos> To lure them here so you can kill all of us?<eos> Yeah, see, you're not the first demon to try that and fail.<eos> They've got good karma.
Well, that's because i respect you.<eos> No, seriously, what's going on inside your head?<eos> I just want to know.<eos> A car Wash? ! You asked.<eos> Staffed by policewomen and nurses?<eos> Women in positions of responsibility.<eos> I'm very pro that.<eos> Can we go back to bed now?<eos> What is it about policewomen?<eos> Except that they're about as right-wing as you are.
Okay.<eos> So you're cool?<eos> Oh, yeah. Totally cool.<eos> Oh, my fucking god, that's hot.<eos> So maybe I was a virgin when it came to the sex thing...<eos> I'll se you.<eos> But he was a virgin too... first big death.<eos> And you never really know what death will make you do...<eos> How you try to defy it... To reach past what's possible.<eos> How you struggle to fit the pieces together even though they're way too broken to bother.
Huh? Who are they to judge you?<eos> They're jealous.<eos> Did you see that Liz Sharpe the other night?<eos> Whoo-hoo. She'd only want your dress if it was deep-fried and covered in sprinkles.<eos> Liz is pretty skinny.<eos> - She's a cow.<eos> - You think?<eos> Moooo. That's a cow.<eos> So you shouldn't let those women get you down.<eos> They're just a bunch of uptight, catty hausfraus who only get exercise when they wrestle ham from each other.
So it seems Troy was a very desirable city, desirable to the Mycenaeans because of its wealth.<eos> But its position also made it desirable to someone else, because Troy stood at the edge of another great civilisation of the day.<eos> They were called the Hittites, their empire covered much of the territory of modern day Turkey.<eos> The Hittites were a super power of the late Bronze Age.<eos> They'd sacked the ancient city of Babylon and fought the mighty army of the pharaohs to a standstill.<eos> But the Hittites have also left behind clues about what really might have happened at Troy.<eos> It is all contained in a vast collection of written tablets.<eos> Trevor Bryce has studied this astonishing collection.<eos> Remarkable accounts of what was happening to cities across the Hittite empire more than three thousand years ago.<eos> They have really unlocked the key to an understanding of the whole history and civilisation of the Hittite world.
In Dutch.<eos> So what are your two fictional Dutchmen talking about?<eos> Mickey said no.<eos> I know.<eos> We got two art dealers gossiping about this new painting.<eos> One guy says to the other one, "Keep this to yourself."<eos> Now if that don't create a buzz, nothing will, will it?<eos> So you wanna draw Meredith Gates into this?<eos> If word gets to her that there's this mysterious new Mondrian out there... then suddenly it'll be a lot better for us.<eos> Marks are so much softer when they think they're the ones doing the running.
It was a woman.<eos> You ever watch pornography?<eos> You don't have to answer that.<eos> You know, we spend our whole lives watching' porn.<eos> We never see the warning. There it is.<eos> You know that scene, where, uh, two women are gettin' it on?<eos> Guy comes in, he's all hard, y'know, he's gonna give it to 'em, he's gonna fuck 'em good.<eos> We think that's what those chicks want. The meat.<eos> They're having a good time without him.<eos> They're going down on each other, you know, they're, uh... they're up in there, they're licking everything, a guy comes in, he's ready to unload... that's not what they want.

What were you doing during all of this?<eos> Me and Paige were just standing there.<eos> We couldn't believe it.<eos> (Stabler) And you didn't help Brittany?<eos> You didn't hold Emily down, maybe take a few shots yourself? No, I swear.<eos> Brittany did everything.<eos> No, they didn't do anything.<eos> (Cragen) I'm glad you're saying that, Brittany.<eos> Because it's consistent with your friends' stories.<eos> That they're innocent and you killed Emily all by yourself. They're not saying that.
I think this is a bad idea.<eos> Why are you saying that?<eos> Because I thought of it?<eos> No, I'm saying that because I think it's a bad idea.<eos> A lot of marriages are like this bouquet.<eos> Ah.<eos> Look at these roses.<eos> Aren't they beautiful?<eos> And everyone admires them.<eos> But they'll be dead before you leave here Sunday night.
The first orchid hybrids were produced in 1858... and since then the process has accelerated.<eos> But because of their... artificial and unnatural evolution... they're unable to attract a suitable pollinator... and hand pollinization is so unreliable... and time-consuming.<eos> There are mysteries to be solved.<eos> You retired from medicine to become a botanist?<eos> I retired from medicine because my work was done.<eos> Every orchid here has been altered.<eos> Each one evolving right before our eyes into new species... changing their very identities.<eos> You mastered the technique on humans.<eos> Why turn to flowers?<eos> Because they never leave.
You're just a kid, Luke.<eos> Part of me says that you are too young for this, I know I'm too young for it.<eos> You know this isn't about me wanting to leave you, right?<eos> Because it's not.<eos> Then what is it about?<eos> Explain it to me again, why you want to leave.<eos> Do you remember when I first joined the team?<eos> You know, the boosters treated you poorly.<eos> You wanted them to see who you'd become.<eos> And they could only see who you used to be.

The only thing that I know for sure is that if I stay here,<eos> I'm screwed.<eos> Where did I put that picture of Darwin?<eos> You, um, said they weren't real people.<eos> Haley, what are you doing?<eos> I'm a real person. I have feelings, I have problems, I feel vulnerable, and self-conscious and...<eos> - I'm just like every other person.<eos> - I know that.<eos> Well what happened to sex just being magical, and being this amazing expression of how much you love someone?<eos> These cyber girls, they're just like triple jointed and waxed, and always turned on, and it's just a lie.
- All right.<eos> - Or, you know, cocks.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Hi.<eos> We were just talking about...<eos> - Cocks.<eos> I heard.<eos> - No, no. Not our cocks.<eos> - These girls...<eos> - They don't have cocks.
That is so much more convenient.<eos> What's potassium iodide?<eos> Anti-radiation.<eos> If you take it in time, it blocks the thyroid's uptake of airborne radioactive iodine from a nuclear accident.<eos> Let's not worry today, dad.<eos> We're okay today.<eos> Of course we are.<eos> Okay, I'd like to talk about this morning.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, besides the fact that your attitude to therapy is totally medieval. You have really big emotions, Nate, and they're not that easy to live with.
All right.<eos> I've known you all your life, and if there's one thing I've noticed, you are a stone sucker for the damsel in distress.<eos> - I am not.<eos> - Come on, Alan.<eos> Every woman you've ever been involved with has been damaged and needy.<eos> Wait, what about...<eos> Okay, go on.<eos> You devote all your time and energy into fixing them up instead of doing the humane thing, which is to have sex with them and run away.<eos> Exactly how is that the humane thing?<eos> My way, they have a good time, you have a good time, nobody suffers.
I just thought of it.<eos> If you three, us three, Twila and if we got Eliza, whose neck's on the chopping block, it would be five-four.<eos> If she's, has any brains at all, she'll...<eos> I mean, I just thought of this.<eos> TWILA:<eos> Chad said if I went on their side and they could get Eliza to go with us, we could knock the women out. I'm willing to play wherever, however<eos> I have to play this game to get ahead, I'm gonna play it.<eos> ¶ ( rain pouring down )<eos> In this game, your strategy changes just immediately, and since the ladies got here,<eos> I learned real quick, from the first night, that you got to watch what you say, that they're a tight-knit group and that if you want to survive, you're gonna have to please them.
I mean, it's just my... my nature. JEFF:<eos> The reason I bring it up is dating back as far as, I think, the very first<eos> Tribal Council, it seems like you've been struggling with this group of women. Are you still fighting a little bit?<eos> I'm the only woman tonight who came with a bag packed because even when I think that it's absolutely certain,<eos> I don't want to have, you know, Rory syndrome and start to feel confident and then get booted, So, yes.<eos> This is a game. It's always on my mind.<eos> I always feel vulnerable.<eos> Sarge, are you starting to sense some division within the women?<eos> I see it every day.<eos> There's a four-way and there's a two-way here, and if they would jump away from that group and take that chance, then maybe they have a better shot at something later.
Oh, praise the spirit for the sun.<eos> LISA: Just rub it on?<eos> It's scrub, deodorant. ( laughter )<eos> Shampoo.<eos> SCOUT: I call all these sorority girls bowheads.<eos> That's what we call them back in Oklahoma.<eos> They all like to hang together.<eos> They're like cattle.<eos> I mean, really, cows, they just cluster.<eos> And those sorority chicks, they aren't paying attention to any damn thing but themselves.

If you cross your heart to someone<eos> You're not supposed to tell a lie<eos> Before you say a wrong<eos> Or either do wrong<eos> It have to be so long<eos> Or either goodbye<eos> I remember hearing Sonny Boy Williamson's song...<eos> "Cross my Heart".<eos> I always thought that Sonny Boy had Uncle Buddy in mind.<eos> He couldn't be truthful around women and they knew it.
We don't know much more than that.<eos> It's just imperative that we get our equipment and get out of here.<eos> What's in there?<eos> Stuff.<eos> Get a light.<eos> Where's your spaceship?<eos> Docked on the other side of the station.<eos> Be careful!<eos> Okay, those warheads over there-- Here's the deal.<eos> They would've brought a nice price on the open market.
Give me fever<eos> When we kisseth Fever with a flame in you<eos> Fever...<eos> I'm on fire<eos> Fever, yeah, I burn and soothe<eos> Now that you listened to my story<eos> Here's a point that I have made<eos> Chicks were born to give you fever<eos> Being Fahrenheit or Centigrade<eos> They give you fever
I like it down here.<eos> I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines.<eos> These machines are keeping us alive while other machines are coming to kill us.<eos> Interesting, isn't it?<eos> The power to give life and the power to end it.<eos> - We have the same power.<eos> Yeah, I suppose we do, but sometimes I think about those people still plugged into the Matrix.<eos> And when I look at these machines I can't help thinking that, in a way, we are plugged into them.<eos> But we control these machines, they don't control us.<eos> Of course not. How could they?
- Yes.<eos> - And you did testify that you haven't loved anyone but yourself for a long time.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No further questions.<eos> The witness may step down.<eos> Closing arguments.<eos> Your Honour, members of the jury, people come to me because what God has given them isn't enough.<eos> They want more.
The newer well was called the "back well."<eos> The new well was nearer the village, so more people used that one.<eos> After my father arrived... Mother started to use the old well.<eos> She had to pass the schoolhouse to get to it.<eos> The village had another custom.<eos> When putting up a new building... each family prepared a dish for the workers' lunch.<eos> Everyone contributed.<eos> Mother prepared all her best dishes... hoping Father would eat what she made.<eos> Back then when something was built... women were not allowed to participate.<eos> Superstition said they would bring bad luck.
Make them believe the right choice is the one we want.<eos> All right.<eos> Yes, machines are tools. They're made to be used.<eos> - It's their nature.<eos> - To be slaves.<eos> That's why we can show them a better world, why they convert.<eos> - But that world we show them isn't real.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> I'm afraid they'll figure out that we've made up the thing in our heads.<eos> They can't tell the difference.
Do you feel hatred too?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Good evening. It's a hot one!<eos> I'm French.<eos> I don't speak Turkish.<eos> - Do you think I'm good-looking?<eos> - You're very good-looking.<eos> Will I be good-looking enough to attract girls?<eos> Without paying.<eos> In a few years, they'll pay for you.
Unbelievable!<eos> Two weeks ago, I was decorating this place.<eos> I love this kitchen.<eos> - Champagne?<eos> That'll be Rick.<eos> - My school has suspended me.<eos> That's great.<eos> You should have left years ago.<eos> Teaching snobby-arsed girls.<eos> They're only going to work for Daddy anyway.
I've written me speech.<eos> - WI .<eos> - Right.<eos> I did it about me job.<eos> And all this.<eos> You read it to me.<eos> Flowers of Yorkshire are like the women of Yorkshire.<eos> Every stage of their growth is more beautiful than the last.<eos> But the last phase... is always the most glorious.<eos> Then very quickly they all go to seed.
Flowers of Yorkshire are like the women of Yorkshire.<eos> Every stage of their growth is more beautiful than the last.<eos> But the last phase... is always the most glorious.<eos> Then very quickly they all go to seed.<eos> Cheeky beggar.<eos> A while ago, I asked John Clarke to give us a talk here at Knapely WI .<eos> Annie asked me to read it to you here tonight, and this is what he wrote.<eos> "The flowers of Yorkshire are like the women of Yorkshire."<eos> "Every stage of their growth has its own beauty, but the last phase is always the most glorious."<eos> "Then very quickly they all go to seed."
Well, they sponsor us, we do their advert for washing powder.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> George Clooney.<eos> Can I have it straight like Jennifer Aniston?<eos> You know, in Fri4nds.<eos> Why would I dye just part of my head?<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> I do not dye my hair.<eos> You may have heard about my first guests.<eos> They went from living a quaint, peaceful life in a small British town to becoming nude calendar girls.
Give us a break.<eos> Will you get out?<eos> You won't?<eos> Go on.<eos> Okay, I'm gettin' out.<eos> What's this girl shit?<eos> Let these people talk together.<eos> Loser!<eos> What's up?<eos> They're gettin' out, so am I.
Okay, I'm gettin' out.<eos> What's this girl shit?<eos> Let these people talk together.<eos> Loser!<eos> What's up?<eos> They're gettin' out, so am I.<eos> Leave me be.<eos> Hands off!<eos> What're you doin'?<eos> They're gettin' out, so let me out too.
Why are you doing so far from me?<eos> Be closer.<eos> Oh, yes, this is much more romantic.<eos> You see that girl at the bar?<eos> She's a whore.<eos> How can you tell?<eos> Whores are sexy.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Because it's their job?<eos> Because they do it for love.
If she's faking it, she's done so since she was 10.<eos> I also found something crucial to merge the personalities, something neither of us had seen.<eos> The thing that Claude and the legend have in common.<eos> The Minotaur was born of a rape, just like Claude.<eos> Like him, her mother either adored her or hated her, according to whom she saw, her child or her rapist's.<eos> Look,<eos> I can't really advise you but I'd forget this merging business.<eos> Because... if these personalities truly exist, some of them will die in the process.<eos> What gives you the right to choose?<eos> They won't die. They'll dissolve into each other.
Not for you, not for Chicka, not for fuckin' anyone!<eos> You understand me?<eos> Jesus, Barry.<eos> Handle it, will ya?<eos> Fuckin' handle it!<eos> So you're worried about the little bastard, are ya?<eos> Yeah. I promised my mum I'd never let him end up in boob.<eos> Your mum, eh?<eos> Yeah, that's the thing about mothers, isn't it?<eos> You go inside and they do every day of it with ya.
A nursery?<eos> For what?<eos> The queen.<eos> What?<eos> That creature.<eos> Esikhulu.<eos> It's ants.<eos> The ants on Titus... they were solid, man, like flesh.<eos> That's it!<eos> They just want the bones.
I don't know what you want.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Hurry up, we'll be too late.<eos> Is there something up?<eos> Go without me, I don't feel too well.<eos> Don't do that to me now.<eos> - I think I'm getting the flu.<eos> Are you angry?<eos> - People say these things... which they don't want to say.
Lee, Jin-sung<eos> How many times did I tell you that it's "Kim" Jin-sung?<eos> You're Kim, Jin-sing, got it?<eos> Jin-sung.<eos> I'll knit you something nice, so stand up.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Now raise your head.<eos> This tree asked those ants to come<eos> Those ants are protecting this arcacia tree<eos> If there's any animals or insects that harass the tree, they attack them and chase them away
So he might make it If somebody drops by his house.<eos> Adam ferrara.<eos> You filthy Guinea motherfucker.<eos> You lucky little whore, That i fucking hired you and Bought your fucking house.<eos> And this photo confirms What we've all been Suspecting for years.<eos> This is adam napping after A post-goat barbecue During The annual splinter cell And terrorist picnic And hidden-explosives expo.<eos> Last but not least, Lenny clarke.<eos> My old friend.<eos> You know, we actually Had a tough time With this category, Because there were So many fucking stories.<eos> And they're all true and They're all hilarious.
How is my sister?<eos> Well, let's just say she's not being as cooperative as you are.<eos> No.<eos> But however much I help with the money I'm not going to testify against her.<eos> I can't do that, I won't.<eos> I really did have no idea.<eos> I'm just gonna say goodbye.<eos> To the birds?<eos> I don't think I'll ever feel free again.<eos> But they can be.
Standard perpetuity clause.<eos> You broke in here for my contract?<eos> - I'm here to release you from it.<eos> You've suffered enough.<eos> I want you to find some peace.<eos> Gallant to the end.<eos> But I knew what I signed up for.<eos> It's done.<eos> Look in the drawer.<eos> Flames wouldn't be eternal if they actually consumed anything.
E4-117.<eos> Your assigned parking space.<eos> It was written on a movie schedule we found in Ms. Hilden's home.<eos> Well, look, I meet a lot of women.<eos> She a dancer?<eos> She work for me before?<eos> Hey, Michelle.<eos> Mmm!<eos> I'll tell you guys something:<eos> This show is very hot, all the chicks want to be in it, and actually, they, uh, got to go through me.
A $10,000 gold chip?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If it was a tip, you wouldn't have had to lose the bellman's outfit to cash it in.<eos> Now where'd you get this?<eos> I found it, sort of.<eos> You found it sort of.<eos> Tavian is always surrounded by women.<eos> Guys, too, but they want autographs.<eos> The chicks...<eos> they want something else.
Enough to get your whitelighter status stripped and your soul sent back down to Earth for recycling.<eos> - You do what you have to do.<eos> - I already did.<eos> I arranged a hearing with the Elders tonight.<eos> I expect this will be your last day as a whitelighter.<eos> That's... quite possible.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Why are you making a vanquishing potion?<eos> To help the sisters.<eos> - Why aren't they making it?
We'll go take care of them, you guys go start the summoning spell.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Oh, thank you, mother.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Witches?<eos> You lost him to witches?<eos> - Just let me speak.<eos> - Do they know about me?<eos> - No, I swear.<eos> I can get to the sandman before they ever do.
- Don't get nervous, man.<eos> - You'll make me nervous.<eos> - I'm not nervous.<eos> I'm psyched. - Psyched?<eos> - Bruce, you should have seen me today.<eos> I walked right up there on that stage, I touched the podium and I saw everything that was going to happen. So?<eos> That's what you always do.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> That I'm in control of this thing? The visions have a life of their own, man.<eos> I work for them. But today, up there, they worked for me.
CEO... website designer...<eos> You know what this wallet says?<eos> Here is a man whose life is stripped down... unstructured... and very, very complicated, because your life is more focused on other people than yourself.<eos> In that regard, you and I are a lot alike.<eos> I like your wallet, John.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I suppose you already know what's in mine.<eos> Not without looking.<eos> My abilities don't tell me everything.<eos> They just kind of lead me to where I'm needed, or where I can be of use.
- She coded.<eos> Shocked her twice, intubated her, and she converted.<eos> Guess this rules you out as a second signature for her DNR.<eos> - It's what she wanted.<eos> - I need to talk to you about Helen.<eos> Keep her systolic above 90, and let's get her up to the MICU.<eos> - It may not be the disease. - What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Helen hated those girls.<eos> And they weren't too crazy about her either.
The lights should be out by now.<eos> The procedure's success depends upon the swift transfer of the fetus.<eos> Therefore, we should open both the subjects simultaneously.<eos> I'll go check it out.<eos> Right.<eos> Listen to me, Karohm.<eos> Two, possibly three, females are being held against their will on the Scarran freighter.<eos> Halt.<eos> Prepare to begin.<eos> They pose the Scarrans no threat.
- Okay.<eos> Delphine, a seer.<eos> I can also see.<eos> Now that we have defined Can you take care of this?<eos> These three girls I know where they are.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Under the trees where children play.<eos> - In Palmer Park.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> They told me.
We've got him on GPS.<eos> This system can track him within six feet.<eos> So you can tell us where he is right now?<eos> (Dr. Sheldon) See the moving dot?<eos> 56th and Broadway.<eos> Two blocks from work, on his way home.<eos> (Stabler) What are the red zones?<eos> Known areas of prostitution.<eos> Most of his victims were hookers.<eos> Well, they're now off-limits.
Jenny and Nancy?<eos> The girls on the sloop over there.<eos> They're sailing that beauty all the way down the intracoastal waterway to miami for her owner.<eos> All the way to miami...<eos> They're going to be there by the time you tell me how they were helpful.<eos> When they docked yesterday, there was someone on this boat.<eos> Did you get a description?<eos> Late 20s, glasses, short hair.<eos> Gay or low on testosterone.<eos> They waved.
I don't know why you come to me in the first place.<eos> I'll call my realtor, Gloria.<eos> I'm sure she'll be able to help you find something.<eos> Thanks, you know.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> So, how did the girls take the news ?<eos> Julie and I decided to... to table that conversation until Monday.<eos> You haven't told them yet ?<eos> Julie's at her mom's with Caitlin and Marissa's going to Mexico this weekend so, we thought'd it'd be easier, cleaner if we did it that way.<eos> They come back, I'm gone, and then we tell them.
Where are you going?<eos> I've got an early court date, then I'm in and out of the office.<eos> I have to set up for Casino Night.<eos> What about Ryan?<eos> I called the private investigator about his mother.<eos> Yeah, but what am I supposed to do with him?<eos> Take him with you.<eos> Spend some time together.<eos> - With all those women there?<eos> - Sure. They'll love him.
But not here, follow me.<eos> Light.<eos> That's what this is all about.<eos> That's what makes everything happen.<eos> Not just in this room, but everywhere on the planet, in every corner of the universe, light generates life.<eos> But that's coming to an end.<eos> What are you talking about, how?<eos> When suns and stars explode they create new suns, new stars.<eos> And each time, these new entities are smaller, containing less energy.<eos> And so when they too explode, as they must, the next stars and suns are even smaller, even weaker.
Later, on her lunch hour, Miranda checked her Blackberry. There it was.<eos> The uncomfortable e-mail Berger had predicted.<eos> Then, when they get busy, it's like, "I can't call.<eos> I'm so stressed." But he's gonna call. - And his kitchen's being rewired.<eos> - It's all so complicated.<eos> - At least. Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation... and I hope what I'm gonna say will save you a lot of time and energy.<eos> He's just not that into you.<eos> So move on.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> Having passed on the gospel to these New York women... Miranda could only hope they would spread the word far and wide.
By all means.<eos> - Why have we brought them here?<eos> - That was our mission.<eos> - Why was I not told?<eos> - We knew you would disagree.<eos> Go ahead, tell Ishta of our success.<eos> So, Teal'c, who are they?<eos> My knowledge of the Goa'uld Moloc is limited.<eos> However, I am unaware of any Goa'uld that permits women Jaffa to be warriors.<eos> They seem to be well trained.
And then there was one.<eos> - You don't have to do this.<eos> - No? Anything you're gonna say I already said to Spiros.<eos> You called him a Greek asshole?<eos> You think we wanted this?<eos> I don't know what the fuck you people want and don't want.<eos> All I know is, I got a can full of young girls suffocating to death on my docks.<eos> - This was a mistake.<eos> - A mistake?<eos> They fucking died in that can... while this stupid son of a bitch sat there with his dick in his hands.
With her in the game, if someone ends up against her, they're not going to win.<eos> Right.<eos> All right.<eos> JON: All three girls are as dumb.<eos> There's no... they share a brain... I don't even think they share a whole brain or obviously they would figure out,<eos> "Hey, we can get rid of these guys."<eos> They're foolish.<eos> I mean, uh, the girls in this game have... have done nothing to, uh, nothing for women's rights or anything like that.<eos> I mean, like, uh, they'd be better off, you know, scrubbing potatoes and mopping floors, uh, to... to get bills passed at this point.<eos> Uh, they, they've shown they're nothing more than followers in this game.
A Roman candle?<eos> A box of matches?<eos> Will you be gone long?<eos> You know the fireworks you see in the blackouts?<eos> They say it's him, planning his operations.<eos> His women love to kill.<eos> It's an event.<eos> Then they fuck for three days.<eos> Ezequiel too.<eos> He just does what he wants with them, and they let him.
On the clearest of nights when the winds of the Etherium were calm and peaceful the great merchant ships with their cargoes of Arcturian sura crystals felt safe and secure<eos> Little did they suspect that they were pursued by pirates
So, you really think that's hot?<eos> Cos I'II show you hot.<eos> Now try.<eos> You have helped me reach the next level.<eos> And here I was starting to think you were just a sadistic psycho bitch.<eos> So, what are you guys doing later, huh?<eos> I was just going to hang out, but maybe we could get a pizza or, you know, scam some chicks or something, right?<eos> Cos, um... I don't know.<eos> I do like the ladies, you know. I do like 'em.<eos> I Iike-a them and they Iike-a me back.
That's good.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Mr. Portokalos, Khristos Anesti.<eos> - He likes you.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I told you to watch the boys.<eos> They'll be fine with the video games.<eos> - You turn their brains to mush.<eos> - I can't do anything right.<eos> Ian, if you're going to be in this family, I'll get you some earplugs... because the Portokalos women, if they're not nagging somebody, they die!
I did all kinds of these things because a guy's balls... are the biggest reservoir of hope this world has ever seen!<eos> You know, trying to get laid by fixing her fan belt is your fault, Holden, yours!<eos> Sam, you're so full of man gravy!<eos> Listen, you need to be more like me and take matters into your own hands.<eos> Why do you think they call it "masturbate"?<eos> Because it allows you to be the master of your own fate.<eos> And it's not just a physical release.<eos> It's a release of women's control over you!<eos> Jason!<eos> You don't need them, they can't manipulate you.
a story of the town's beginnings.<eos> It's the story of the Santa Rita Number One, birthplace of West Texas Oil.<eos> Now, as with most Texas legends, there was a man who thought oil was right beneath his feet.<eos> And as with most such stories, no one else believed him.<eos> Except in this case for two nuns, who in 1923 met the man and believed so much in him and his dream that they invested money no one knew they had.<eos> Now, when the nuns told their parish priest about the man's dream and their investment in it, now, he counseled them to try and get their money back.<eos> Sheepishly, they admitted that it was too late, that the money was already spent.
He said, Dr. Gilmore was his name,.. ..he said it's not so much that, well, never mind what he said,.. ..I lied to him all the time because I didn't want him..<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Frankie?<eos> We got squirrels.<eos> - Squirrels, Frankie?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Big squirrels.<eos> They tend to overeat.. ..preparing for a difficult winter, and sometimes they bloat.<eos> And often they get caught in the walls.<eos> And to get out of the walls,.. ..they have to deflate.
-Yes, they do. We never had trouble with them before we started hanging out with you.<eos> Now we get it every single day.<eos> Besides, everyone thinks you're weird.<eos> Only a bit, though.<eos> Okay.<eos> 'Bye.<eos> There you have it.<eos> I was having a shit time at home and a shit time at school.<eos> It was fine deciding single mums were the future but the frustrating truth was I didn't have their numbers.<eos> Where did they hang out?
May I help you?<eos> Hey, Vin.<eos> Suzette?<eos> Yep.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is that really you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, no.<eos> I mean, the tits aren't me.<eos> They, um...
Come on, babe.<eos> And you know what?<eos> You used to, like... you know, flash them... and they were famous, those tits... and I was flat as a pancake.<eos> So I made, you know, bigger... ones.<eos> So... but if it makes you feel any better...<eos> I don't feel bad.<eos> I don't need... to feel better.<eos> They're too big, and, you know...<eos> I overdid it.<eos> Well, I wasn't going to say anything... but they're too big.
OK, All right, Well, what happened?<eos> Um, I got stuck in the chair,<eos> You used it in a chair?<eos> Well, yeah, that's what's on the box,<eos> Different ways.<eos> I've never...<eos> Not in a chair.<eos> Well, gift-giving-- you know, it's an art,<eos> You should have the person in mind--<eos> OK, I'm sorry, I thought you'd like it, I like it-- Well, that's-- but you should give people... what you think they would want-- you know, something personal.
I thought we had a deal.<eos> If you prefer, put people's lives at risk.<eos> Are people's lives at risk?<eos> Yes, mine is.<eos> I don't want to be hit by a golf ball.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - I don't have my probes.<eos> Three boxes are missing.<eos> They got left at Toronto Airport.<eos> They'll arrive tomorrow.
They have left for Hong Kong<eos> "I know.<eos> Nawlekarjust told me.<eos> Chandrakant is abroad, honeymooning"<eos> His mother told me<eos> But one thing I don't understand.<eos> None but the three of us... ever knew of the raid. How come they knew? .<eos> That was the question... on my mind when I asked for a listing from the telephone department. Guess<eos> Which number called Chandu's residence just before the raid?<eos> "internal injuries don't show up, but they hurt like hell"
Okay, I'll tell you, but only because you insist on us so much.<eos> Yesterday I went out to jog for a while, the sky was gray-blue..<eos> ..the wind was spiriting away remaining leaves.. ..and it was as cold, as if someone was nailing my face with thousands of needles.<eos> I guess that's the last time I felt happy.<eos> For Boris health!<eos> The only happy man in our company!<eos> Who else ?<eos> It's impossible he's the only person who was happy in the last few days.<eos> Today I was watching two flies.<eos> They were flirting with each other.
- Sex, of course.<eos> Love.<eos> - I said: love.<eos> - We heard you, darling.<eos> Does that help ?<eos> Charlie claims I've got fattened soul.<eos> Interesting, some people suffer from that.<eos> For example Felix - he's got loads of fat, running down from his stomach.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Women do not, because they eat tofu.
At least I heard you, Charlotte.<eos> Love.<eos> They say it's just a matter of smell. Phoremones, or something..<eos> I told you about it. It's called pheromones.<eos> Right.<eos> You nose them, and that's what helps you in finding your partner.<eos> We sniff our DNA.<eos> If we don't like it, we don't fall in love.<eos> But if women take pills, their smelling sense changes.<eos> If they stop taking pills, it might happen that they won't be able.. ..to tolerate the smell of their dream man any longer.
College girls with their hair in curls.<eos> Girls are warriors!<eos> In magazines or in person...<eos> Girls are warriors!<eos> Girls are warriors!<eos> Girls are warriors!<eos> Playing with them is like handling... nitroglycerine.<eos> More voltage than a nuclear power plant...<eos> And less radiation.<eos> They're in charge from the start, driving a stake through your heart.

Excuse me.<eos> Hi. I'm looking for this really good-looking brother with cornrows.<eos> - l heard... - Shh.<eos> I heard he made the drumline.<eos> Oh, so now you gotjokes.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You know I can't wait to see you move to my beats.<eos> Do women actually respond to the way you come at them?<eos> Well, actually, they usually come at me.
Let's stick together, we'll make it.<eos> I don't care, bring us back !<eos> I don't wanna rot in here !<eos> Calm down !<eos> I don't wanna die in here !<eos> Bring us back, bring us back !<eos> We did exactly like Picus.<eos> He must have come here.<eos> How did he go on ?<eos> Those pages ... they didn't exist.
Take your time.<eos> So how's it goin' with the troublemakers?<eos> They aren't troublemakers.<eos> They're Jane's friends.<eos> Ah, same thing.<eos> Personally, I don't trust anyone who wears clothes.<eos> What are they hiding', anyway?<eos> I like Jane's friends.<eos> They smell nice.<eos> Yeah, well, they can smell all they want.
I just think it's a shame because I've come to rely on her for everything.<eos> And I trust her completely, and she's funny.<eos> Not deliberately, of course.<eos> Hey, you know, it's probably for the best though.<eos> Oh, yeah? Why is that?<eos> Two things I know is chess and women.<eos> Chess, it has rules, pieces, rooks, knights, bishops.<eos> They move in predictable patterns.<eos> Somebody wins, somebody loses.<eos> But women, they don't have no rules, man.
One brother survived... while the other perished in Babi Yar.<eos> Luidmila Zavorotnaia Ukrainian Eyewitness<eos> Two girls lived nearby, Rosa and Tsilia.<eos> They got away.<eos> They were running toward my house.<eos> Two young Germans caught them by the arms.<eos> The girls were stumbling and screaming.<eos> What could I do?<eos> I was scared.<eos> The Germans dragged them away as they screamed.
Dr. Thorsson, could you spare us a minute, please?<eos> - Your name keeps coming up.<eos> - So I should hope.<eos> I was Elena's supervisor.<eos> - And?<eos> - And what...?<eos> And nothing!<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> I don't have affairs with my students.<eos> Not even when they offer themselves to me, which they do with tedious frequency.
May -- don't touch it.<eos> Oh , I'm sorry.<eos> "Young stand-up Orny Adams destroys."<eos> is that you?<eos> Orny Adams?<eos> That's your real name?<eos> Get out of town .<eos> No mom would name her kid Orny Adams.<eos> There was a time in America -- women -- they didn't even have the right to vote.<eos> Then there was a vote to see if they could vote.
only then was this boy born<eos> Your work is over. Go away<eos> "That he's your son's offspring, you'll know only if I tell you"<eos> And I'm telling you now.<eos> Listen carefully!<eos> He is not your son's offspring...<eos> he's someone else's baby<eos> Take her away and dump her in some corner.<eos> Take her away<eos> These bloody women... they only understand the language of violence
Move out<eos> We didn 't have to march to and from that group<eos> Meditation!<eos> Don't open your eyes!<eos> Keep 'em shut!<eos> End meditation!<eos> 3 biscuits left<eos> There was a glimpse of the distant mountains from the window<eos> As winter approached they turned white, with summer, green<eos> They foretold the changing seasons
It's fertilizer anyway<eos> I'm sorry I'm sorry<eos> Oh... my god!<eos> Sure we can see fireflies here?<eos> Yeah But I think we came too late<eos> Thought they'd still be here<eos> Hey, let's call the fireflies<eos> How?<eos> I saw it in some book<eos> If you close your eyes and call them inside, they'll know to come to you
It's been five years, so she might've moved<eos> And I'm also curious as to who you're looking for<eos> You see<eos> It's two people<eos> One is Kyung-hee Kim Kyung-hee<eos> The other is Soo-in?<eos> Shim Soo-in?<eos> Do you know them?<eos> So that's who you were looking for<eos> Sure, I know them since they were famous
Boy!<eos> Isn't that a bit too small?<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> This stick is waiting for you!<eos> Tell you what, one thing I hate the most is big dick<eos> You won't believe this, the Tomato Brothers wrote back!<eos> Really! ? They wrote!<eos> Honestly, women are tender and fragile they are something you cuddle up for sleep<eos> No matter how ferocious some women are if they don't have a dick, they're not men

Now, look, you're just having problems adjusting to the fact that your daughters are becoming women.<eos> That is ridiculous.<eos> They are not becoming women.<eos> Hey, you still have Rory, the boy.<eos> He's gonna get older and you guys can hang out at Hooters and drink beers and come on to waitresses.<eos> - That's true.<eos> - There you go.<eos> But I want the girls to love me too.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, Paul, whatever's going on in their lives, you just have to trust that they love you too.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?<eos> HAVE YOU LOST MY KIDS?<eos> NO, OF COURSE NOT.<eos> THEY ARE BEING CARED FOR BY A RESPONSIBLE ADULT,<eos> A FRIEND OF YOURS.<eos> I JUST DON'T KNOW HER NAME OR WHERE SHE LIVES.<eos> BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE IS SHE'S NOT ASIAN.<eos> RIGHT.<eos> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.<eos> IF THEY WERE A BOX OF SNACK CAKES, HE'D KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE.
I highly recommend it.<eos> I'll keep that in mind.<eos> Harper's rigged a slipfighter so we can get up close and personal with the black hole.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't always share the little professor's unswerving confidence in his own engineering ability.<eos> Tyr, you don't have to come.<eos> I know how hard it is for you to beat that nietzschean self-Preservation gene.<eos> You know, that nietzschean self-Preservation gene, as you call it, can't be passed down unless a breeding partner makes herself available.<eos> Proving one's worth as a husband and father requires taking risks.<eos> So all these dangerous, macho things you do, it's to impress the chicks?<eos> So are they back?
I wanna warn Angel, but the words won't come out.<eos> Why can't I tell him?<eos> I feel it.<eos> The thing in my dreams. It's real and it's almost here.<eos> DEMON:<eos> What is it?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Cordy!<eos> Snakes? Uh-huh.<eos> And they came out of your what?
Something his employees would definitely know.<eos> Get any addresses?<eos> You bet.<eos> Let's go check it out.<eos> We're looking for anything in the picture that might give us a way to find her.<eos> Something in the background that determines location, a useful reflection, anything.<eos> Huh... Oh, I get it.<eos> This is like a test, right?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Individual hair shadows are amorphous when they should be distinct.
16, actually.<eos> Excluding the five nasal markers.<eos> Like I said.<eos> This one's very interesting.<eos> The occiput... the bump on the back center of the head... unusually flat.<eos> The eyes have epicanthal folds... a triangular flap of skin that gives a vaguely Asian appearance.<eos> You see how the bridge of the nose is poorly developed?<eos> Almost too small for the size of his head.<eos> The ears seem slightly odd.<eos> Like the nose, they, too, are disproportionate to the head.
On your mark, get set<eos> Let's go<eos> You got to move now, before she explodes<eos> Look out the window, look out below<eos> Back away from the glass<eos> Well, there she blows<eos> The city's been leveled<eos> The hills are in flames<eos> The streets cracked open<eos> And they're pushing up clay
It's a match.<eos> It also means that we're going to be here for a while.<eos> I don't know how that ATV got off property.<eos> Access is strictly limited to instructors.<eos> What about this young lady right over here?<eos> Senior Cadets are considered part of our staff.<eos> Okay, we'll need a list of those names.<eos> These girls are minors.<eos> I can't give you anything without parental permission.<eos> Okay, we'll get it right after we inform their parents... they're part of an ongoing murder investigation.
Listen to this.<eos> "Tell Q.B. No more.<eos> You have to get the hell out of there."<eos> This girl has a secret, doesn't she?<eos> Our leeches just gave up their secret.<eos> You recovered the rest of her blood?<eos> In over half the samples.<eos> And lord knows how many more are burrowed out there, digesting. It was death by leech.<eos> It was death by leech.<eos> Well, they may have killed her ... but they didn't move her body, did they?
I couldn't<eos> Grief is grief; work is work<eos> Don't confuse the two<eos> You're thinking... You're thinking that maybe I've missed something.<eos> Well, did you notice Lauriana's hair and nails?<eos> Acetone and peroxide Base elements of TATP<eos> Also of nail polish and hair dye<eos> Those two women didn't bat an eye when they got on the elevator<eos> I'm a woman, and I'm telling you they don't know each other<eos> They probably had no idea the other exists
- Why don't you let me help you?<eos> - It's heavy.<eos> Well, see, that's kind of why I wanted to help you with it.<eos> Piper, when are you gonna accept the fact that you're pregnant?<eos> When are you gonna stop being so overprotective?<eos> All I'm suggesting is that you slow down.<eos> Okay, Leo, I'm not gonna be one of those women that sits on her ass and eats bonbons throughout her entire pregnancy.<eos> That's just not the woman you married.<eos> Besides, generations of Halliwell women raised perfectly normal children before me.<eos> They all got through it, and so will I.
No, I'm melting.<eos> I'm melting!<eos> I'm melting!<eos> You saved me.<eos> Are you the Keeper?<eos> No, his apprentice.<eos> Or at least I was.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Wait, if he didn't come back to life, does that mean my sisters won't either?<eos> No, no, they were victims of fairy-tale magic, so when you saved the fairy tales, you saved them too.
I found some bags labelled "pig's feet," "rabbit blood," "frog tongue."<eos> So I decided to take a little look around.<eos> I found more than what I bargained for.<eos> Look, I can explain everything, okay?<eos> I really can.<eos> I'll just have to explain it later because if Piper<eos> - finds us up here she's gonna freak.<eos> - Piper's gonna freak?<eos> I just found out that your new sisters have been messing with the occult in a serious way.<eos> And you're worried about how they're gonna freak?
We had our lives mapped out.<eos> It wasn't hard.<eos> All we wanted was each other.<eos> Think about it.<eos> 30 years from now,<eos> I'll be that old, funny biology teacher, you'll be headlining at the Grand Ole Opry.<eos> Think about what a pair we'll make.<eos> We still share each others' lives even though she has a husband and a family now, and I have...<eos> memories and visions.<eos> And if they sometimes seem more real to me than they actually are, it's because I wish they were.
Hey, hey, keep your voice down, will you?<eos> His mother did terrible things to him, painful things.<eos> He is impotent, except when he kills.<eos> He only kills... when it rains outside... to wash away any evidence.<eos> Jimmy crack corn... And I don't care<eos> Jimmy crack corn and I don't care...<eos> You never even found a scrap of tissue from the girls under their fingernails or anything, did you?<eos> No.<eos> There was no sign of a struggle at all.<eos> Oh, no, they struggled.
Their culture is different.<eos> It's... their way.<eos> Are you married, crewman?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I would have told you.<eos> I'm married.<eos> You are?<eos> Three times.<eos> So, you have two ex-wives?<eos> I have three current wives and they each have two husbands not counting myself.
Give me that.<eos> I need your answer.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> What kind of man are you?<eos> A practical one.<eos> You have 24 hours to bring me the rest of the fragments.<eos> Otherwise, your unfortunate mother will remain like this forever.<eos> And where will I find these relics?<eos> These gems are attuned to the mystic vibrations of each fragment.<eos> They will lead the way.
Then from what you've told me about Jackie's behavior, and her little sister's, I'd say dad is a sexually obsessive narcissist.<eos> You telling me this guy gets his kicks from prostituting his wife and daughters?<eos> HUANG: His family is his own little cult.<eos> They devote themselves to making him happy.<eos> BENSON: You think he's abusing Sally, too?<eos> I don't know if she's sexually abused, but I wouldn't be surprised if she knew exactly what went on.<eos> Well, there's sex education for you.<eos> Dad doesn't even have to touch his daughters.<eos> Just treating them as adults turns them into his own vicarious sexual partners.<eos> They don't tell because he's their dad, and they love him.
I don't understand.<eos> I'm his wife.<eos> He should be buried with me.<eos> well, unfortunately, he stipulated in his pre-need contract... that he was to be buried with his former wife.<eos> That's gotta be a mistake.<eos> He must've made those arrangements before he married me.<eos> This is dated October of '98.<eos> I never even knew he had done this.<eos> Neither did his daughters.<eos> God, I'm sure they just love it, though.
- You're looking kind of familiar.<eos> Have you ever been in any TV or film or anything?<eos> - Me?<eos> I used to do acting in junior high, but...<eos> - Well, that's acting experience.<eos> - You look like the type of ma that could really take charge of this, handle it<eos> - You want me to be in your adult video?<eos> - It's just a tape for the girls. Nobody will see it.<eos> No one will ever see it ?<eos> - Uh-uh. Just a tape for they selves, gonna stay on the shelves.
Okay, listen -- you were right, well, you were wrong and right.<eos> He is a woman.<eos> He wasn't always, but he is now, transgender, not transvestite --that's important--he's gone the whole hog, had the operation.<eos> And the torture machines...<eos> He straps them down so he can reveal himself.<eos> Or herself.<eos> He is a woman, but he still has a man's strength, so my point still holds there, you're not completely -- it's the cake icing, the attachments, they're the key.<eos> there was a message there, but not one she wanted to send.<eos> She used them on Damien when she felt angry, felt insulted by us, by life, whatever.<eos> The torture machines, they're all classics out of a history book, but -- the cake-icing stuff-- it's personal, Carol.
You need to freeze some of your ass off.<eos> Oh, at least I have an ass, Jew!<eos> What?<eos> Come on, you stupid baby cows!<eos> You have to get out of here!<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - They aren't leaving!<eos> See?<eos> Maybe they want to become sweet, juicy veal steaks.<eos> Hey, they've never been allowed to walk before.
Tweek is right.<eos> It isn't fair for those asshole directors To keep changing their movies and making them different!<eos> Movies are art and art shouldn't be modified!<eos> Yeah, what if they had modified The roman colosseum every year?<eos> It would just be another big "douchie" stadium now!<eos> We have to do something! Let's form a club!<eos> Yeah, we could form a club<eos> That takes food stamps from poor people And then sells them back to the government for a profit!<eos> No, fat-Ass!<eos> I mean a club to protect films from their directors So they can't be messed with!
I see.<eos> Major. I tapped into the special investigation unit's signal. They're getting pretty impatient.<eos> Why can't we make a move?<eos> He's right in front of us. Well, Nanao wasn't disposed during the assassination announcements. This is the result.<eos> Isn't that the responsibility of you guys at central office? !<eos> Because of the matter of the interceptors, we couldn't get enough people...<eos> Chief. How are things there?<eos> I've got it.<eos> According to the Special Investigation Unit's data, Nanao's criminal activities support that possibility that he be the Laughing Man.<eos> However, there were a number of odd thing in the people's testimony that knew Nanao at the time. After Checking those 43 people more in depth, I found that they all had praised him in some way.
So that leaves you, Warrick.<eos> What were you?<eos> Oh, I was short. I had big feet, thick glasses.<eos> - You?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I got pushed around by all the guys and never got any play from the girls.<eos> The girls didn't even notice your eyes.<eos> No.<eos> They used to tease me about my eyes, call me names.<eos> Well, what do they know?
No.<eos> No, not really.<eos> Well, in a way you did, right?<eos> What way was that?<eos> Were you friends of hers, a friend of her sisters?<eos> No, not friends.<eos> Then what?<eos> Okay, look. I know you know something.<eos> I can see it in your eyes.<eos> Just like I know they know something too.
Oh, okay. This is so exciting!<eos> This is going to be a whole new beginning!<eos> And to think, when I was committing suicide, I'd very nearly given up hope!<eos> An arse beach?<eos> Why not? Why not an arse beach?<eos> There are many dedicated breast beaches.<eos> "Topless beaches," not dedicated breast beaches.<eos> They're not like nature reserves.<eos> The fact is, some women don't have large breasts,<eos> And they're people, too.
I'm just gonna put my best foot forward.<eos> Shall we? -After you.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> So then I was like, " No way, that is so not possible in a Dodge Neon."<eos> What's the matter, Potter, no personal experiences to contribute?<eos> The amount of pleasure the average girl gets from the average guy in some random keg party hook-up is negligible at best.<eos> Unless you're doing it with a man who knows what he's doing.<eos> See? I rest my case.<eos> Girls have it way easier than guys do, right?<eos> There's no performance anxiety and once they decide to do it, all they have to do is ask.

Now he, he's got a brain.<eos> But you, you're a bit of an idiot.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> - But I'm bigger.<eos> Ow, ow! All right, sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> All right, all right, have you spoken to your females yet?<eos> I bet you haven't spoken to them yet.<eos> Have ya. No, we haven't spoken to them 'cause they might be sleeping.<eos> They could be...
She used us, man. So it is not our fault.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Why not?<eos> Too many inconsistencies.<eos> Too much obfuscation.<eos> Obfuscation?<eos> How the hell does that translate?<eos> Fine, you know what?<eos> Look, you don't wanna believe me, go ask the girls.<eos> Chiana and Jool are still sleeping off whatever it was they did, and I'm not inclined to wake them.
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, that's what it is.<eos> No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.<eos> She didn't say anything to you?<eos> - Maybe it's something you ate.<eos> - It could've been...<eos> - Please, just go and talk to Rachel.<eos> - Yeah, I guess I should.<eos> Man, you know what I have to realize?<eos> Maybe I'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with.<eos> They always seem to want a little bit more.
Maybe it was good that you hid your personal life when I was a kid... but I'm not a kid anymore.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> You're a 40-year-old divorcee.<eos> My mistake.<eos> - I can't believe you're blaming this on me!<eos> - I'm not blaming you!<eos> You made up these stupid rules... about the way the Gilmore women would run their lives.<eos> Now you're following them even though they're crazy.<eos> My crazy, stupid rules are the reason we are doing so good in our lives!<eos> They're the reason you grew up the way you did... the reason you're in this school... and the reason you're going to go to Harvard.
I thought the medical examiner ruled the death accidental.<eos> No harm in taking a second look.<eos> Justin's a good pathologist but not very imaginative.<eos> You find something?<eos> Female autoerotics are rare, so it's hard to rule on cause of death.<eos> Which is why the first suspicion was homicide.<eos> But in this case, that's what it should've been.<eos> What did he miss?<eos> Most women don't use porn.<eos> They fantasize.
- Thorkild Buchardt.<eos> He's 52, director and founder of the chocolate factory.<eos> Happy, popular, smart.<eos> Not smart to put your head in a bag.<eos> Not if he did it. Who was with him?<eos> A girl, it appears. Buchardt was into young girls.<eos> - A rumour or a fact?<eos> - A rumour, but convincing.<eos> And the girls?<eos> Did they like him too?
You don't know.<eos> This is gravel. Okay? Gravel.<eos> This is...<eos> That's more gravel. Okay. Oh!<eos> This is... That's more gravel.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh! This is a shell that, to me, this is just me talking.<eos> It looks like a helmet for a mouse.<eos> Now, that sounds crazy, right?<eos> But if you ask the mice about it, they don't say nothing.
That shirt makes you look like... a stick of Fruit Stripe gum.<eos> God, what did you have for breakfast this morning...<eos> Carnation Instant Bitch?<eos> Okay, that one was out of the park.<eos> I am so bored with you two.<eos> You know what?<eos> I actually want to talk about Fez.<eos> Fez, why don't the women at ballet love you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They let me touch their thighs but not their hearts.
Well, hon, why do you like sleeping on the couch?<eos> What?<eos> Lloyd said that you liked to sleep on the couch.<eos> Is it for your back? Is that it?<eos> Yeah. We both know how lloyd is terrified to sleep alone.<eos> See you soon.<eos> I don't understand. What was wrong with the girl who walked out of here this morning?<eos> Don't you feel bad about what you do to these girls?<eos> No, actually. I feel quite good about what I do to these girls.<eos> You don't think that maybe they might want more than just sex?
- So everything's fine.<eos> - No, there are still some problems but I'm not worried because the federal government's coming to the rescue.<eos> - Look...<eos> - You think pay disparity is because some sexist in human resources hired two people for equal positions...<eos> - ... and paid the man more?<eos> - Oftentimes women...<eos> And oftentimes women make less money over their lifetime...<eos> - ... because they choose to.<eos> - Oh, good night, nurse.<eos> They don't choose to make less, they're financially punished for having kids.
You sent her spirit in peace, Gabrielle.<eos> Forward.<eos> Come on.<eos> Queen Mawu-Ka...<eos> Queen Gwyn-Teir...<eos> Your friend Bane... Their blood... on the shores of this land.<eos> Our sisters have died but death is not an end to their spirits.<eos> Death it's a pathway... to an afterlife.<eos> And when it is my time to join them I want to know that I can grasp them by the hands..., ...I can look them all in the eyes and tell them... that their blood... was not shed without purpose.<eos> ...That we finished the job that they began.
There's no part of that sentence I didn't like.<eos> - Is everyone present?<eos> - Definitely.<eos> Here's the plan.<eos> We enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel.<eos> There, we'll irritate the splenic ganglion and cause a spasm, expelling, among other things, the parasites.<eos> - I'll tell Fry to wash out his ear. - No!<eos> Fry can't know about the mission.<eos> If he finds out, the worms will defend themselves.<eos> - They know everything he knows.
This is when they are most at risk, and so this mother protects them by hiding them in the dense undergrowth.<eos> While the females are absent, the brothers are spotted dangerously close to the hiding place.<eos> The cubs' lives hang by a thread.<eos> Now their only hope is to remain motionless.<eos> Out on the plains, there are large herds of Macrauchenia.<eos> Unique to South America, this species is the last of their kind.<eos> They are prime targets for Smilodon.<eos> Macrauchenia are fast, wary animals, and getting close enough to kill one takes endless patience.<eos> The females hunt together as a pack, inching forward to set the trap.<eos> They have been closing in on this herd for two hours now.
Come on.<eos> I know what's gonna cheer you up.<eos> Mommy knows.<eos> Tears?<eos> Could this be guilt for threatening our great work?<eos> Put him down.<eos> I want you to see this boy... who has jeopardized everything we've worked for.<eos> Serves him right.<eos> Why don't you go talk to your computers, Basil?<eos> They understand you.
We don't dance?<eos> When the slow ones come on, you can cop off.<eos> You serious?<eos> !<eos> Ask a girl to dance and she says no.<eos> Say you weren't asking, you were taking a piss.<eos> You get your hand on the arse of a girl, she don't move it, you're in.<eos> Guaranteed.<eos> Don't buy her mates a drink.<eos> They take advantage.
They're breaking you.<eos> Now come on, all right?<eos> Everything's changing, man.<eos> What the fuck do they know about being normal?<eos> I have friends in here.<eos> Who?<eos> Them?<eos> Those girls... Susanna. They're eating grapes off of the wallpaper.<eos> Okay? They're insane.<eos> If they are, I am.
We'll keep you warm.<eos> I don't want to live like this anymore.<eos> It 's too painful.<eos> I wish I was...<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> What you've been doing has been so wonderful for us.<eos> What have I been doing?<eos> Your stories.<eos> They've been keeping us alive... me alive... but most of all the children.
Not tell myself they'll go to college.<eos> I don't believe that now<eos> It's just to give them affection, because I'm attached to them<eos> That's the only hope I have left<eos> If you could see those kids... they're in a sorry state<eos> So small, so vulnerable<eos> The mothers don't tend to them.<eos> As if they want to be rid of them.<eos> They send their kids to school sick!<eos> They watch TV all day then they... stick the kids in front of the TV.
We made mustard...<eos> We made all sorts of things.<eos> Sun-dried tomatoes... Bread from figs.<eos> We were fine.<eos> We had wire netting!<eos> Those were places for malaria, most of the time.<eos> With cigales!<eos> I believe that they were responsible for the malaria, those cigales!<eos> Maybe that's why you've caught so many?<eos> But I think that it was their singing, the malaria, not they themselves...
He'd better given me a hand instead of crying.<eos> What could he have done?<eos> What? What he could have done?<eos> Don't you do anything, when your wife is giving birth?<eos> Eh well, I was with her...<eos> You see, you do something.<eos> But he, he wasn't even there.<eos> I was all alone in that solitude, and there were so many things to do, like preparing the hot water,<eos> but he didn't know better than to cry. Or he ran to the neighbour's house to call the women from there.<eos> That, that he liked, having other women in the house, but they didn't come right away, and I needed help,
He was a kind man.<eos> And if one had a lovely name, like for example Manon, he seemed to have gone mad, a ridiculous thing at his age.<eos> Whose name was Manon?<eos> The circus rider.<eos> I threw him out because of her. Because her name was Manon.<eos> But he always treated them like queens, the bad thing was that he treated them like that and not like dirty cows.<eos> They came to me, wives of railroaders, farmers, and they were audacious, calm, they didn't lower their eyes, they looked at me<eos> as if they were who knows who.<eos> And I couldn't stare at them! That was the trouble!<eos> He, he made them think that they were worth much more than me. And they looked at me as if they were worth much more than me!
Pretty persuasive in an odd kind of way, though. It could be...<eos> Ah...<eos> Lord Hollingford, I'm to bring Mr Gibson to your mother.<eos> Oh, you remember Mrs Kirkpatrick?<eos> Come and find me before you leave.<eos> I'll be in the lab.<eos> But surely... we've...<eos> I expect you remember me as Miss Clare.<eos> I was here years ago as the girls' governess.<eos> Oh, yes, and you caught scarlet fever when they did, I remember.
Your Majesty was wrong about me.<eos> You thought I wanted to be powerful and rich, just as a whim.<eos> It's not true. I wanted to be strong, yes;<eos> I wanted to be very strong.<eos> Because early on I discovered that is the only way to survive.<eos> I soon discovered that my life, my future... would be linked to Brazil's destiny.<eos> If Brazil grew, I'd grow with it.<eos> I wanted to be powerful, to transform the Empire... to stand up to powerful nations man to man... and the interests of the elite.<eos> Many times my fortune was in your hands.<eos> At the decisive moment, they failed me.
Let me just once Pass my fingers through the hair Of Esmeralda, Esmeralda<eos> My friends, the gargoyles, are watching over you<eos> They'll protect you from any fool<eos> Whenever you need shelter<eos> Come to me, I'll protect you<eos> The Notre Dame of Paris ls my house, my nest lt's my city, my life<eos> My air, my roof, it's my bed lt's my song, my voice<eos> My reason, my folly My passion, my country lt's my prison, my homeland<eos> Your friends the gargoyles are my friends too<eos> They make me laugh on days when I'm bored
I'm not going to tell you first what I do as an undercover officer tracking down dealers and the source of their illegal drugs in the streets of our cities and corridors of our schools here in Orange County.<eos> I'm going to tell you what I'm afraid of.<eos> What I fear, night and day, is that our children your children and my children--<eos> I have two little ones, very little but not too little to be addicted.<eos> Calculatedly addicted to Substance D for profit by drug terrorists.<eos> As many of you know, our military and their associates are actively engaged in countries where it is believed the organic component of Substance D a small, highly toxic flower, originates.<eos> And while our troops are down there fighting for us it is up to each and every one of us here to do our part in eliminating the demand for this drug.<eos> It's important you as citizens continue to report all suspicious activity and individuals for, simply put, if there were no demand in our society there would be no market for these leeches to exploit.<eos> Each day, this disease takes its toll on us.<eos> And each day, the flow of profits and where they go... .
Pl-Pl-Please, Weaver.<eos> Please.<eos> Switch jobs with me just for a day.<eos> Th-Think of all the things that I've done for you.<eos> Hm.<eos> I can't think of any.<eos> Okay. So, think of all the things that I'm gonna do for you.<eos> Would I meet some worker girls?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> They always go after the new guy.

-It's true.<eos> I hate it when someone gives away the ending. You piece of dirt! No, I'm wrong.<eos> You're an ant!<eos> Let this be a lesson to all you ants.<eos> Ideas are very dangerous things.<eos> You are mindless, soil-shoving losers, put on this earth to serve us!<eos> You're wrong, Hopper.<eos> Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers!<eos> I've seen these ants do great things.<eos> And year after year, they somehow manage... to pick food for themselves and you.
We are waiting!<eos> Take heed, mistress... or these coins are as good as hers.<eos> Morning, Madame... Marguerite, Jacqueline.<eos> I trust you slept well.<eos> What kept you?<eos> I fell off the ladder in the orchard, but I am better now.<eos> Someone's been reading in the fireplace again.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Ash and soot everywhere.<eos> Some people read because they cannot think for themselves.
A village shouldn't embrace the idea of women as objects.<eos> But it's after-hours in a club.<eos> Where men salivate over women slithering around in the mud.<eos> Should all mud-wrestling clubs go?<eos> They shouldn't be in residential areas.<eos> Strip clubs too?<eos> - Theaters that show sex scenes?<eos> - Some, if it has something redeeming.<eos> Who decides what's redeeming?<eos> There's a difference between sex scenes and what they do.
They're treating us as if we were still a colony.<eos> Everything has to go through Earth:<eos> Supplies, money transfers, documents.<eos> They couldn't kill us with bullets, so they're drowning us in red tape.<eos> Frankly, I preferred the bullets.<eos> At least there I could shoot back.<eos> Well, that's the problem when you go from being a soldier to a politician.<eos> You have to listen to people you would've shot six months earlier.<eos> When we were fighting we were able to put our internal disagreements on the back burner.<eos> Now they're all coming out, and we've had some violence.
I am asking you to let this job slide.<eos> You leave these girls alone.<eos> - That can't happen.<eos> Money's been paid.<eos> - You knew me. What I was then.<eos> - You was a great guy.<eos> You had cogliani,<eos> - I was a dirtball, lowest of the low.<eos> These girls gave me back my life.<eos> They asked for nothing, which I didn't for one second deserve.
All right, guys, just get him something with whatever money we have.<eos> Mike, about that press conference this morning.<eos> What would you say if people decided that they didn't like squirrels and just started killing them off?<eos> Squirrels are just rats with good p. r.<eos> You can't play God, Mike.<eos> Oh, no, that's what attracted me to the job.<eos> Young college graduate to play God.<eos> I just don't think we had a right to kill all those rats.<eos> We just put the poison out.<eos> They killed themselves.
Get rid of them and you can walk out of here a free man.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Save yourself.<eos> - Ben?<eos> - Got to cover it up.<eos> Bury it.<eos> Ben, what are you doing?<eos> It's for your own good, Benny.<eos> Wipe away the words.<eos> Destroy them before they destroy you.
Jack, relax.<eos> There are three things in this world you can count on:<eos> death, taxes, and... me.<eos> Thanks, Will.<eos> - Just so we're clear--<eos> - I'm paying it!<eos> Okay.<eos> I went to culinary school for three years.<eos> I don't know, I just always loved to cook-- five sisters.<eos> And it turned out great, because while I was making Sunday dinner, they were out mowing the lawn.
He roams through the countryside...<eos> Oh, not that song again!<eos> I can't get it out of my head!<eos> The meter is awful!<eos> Kill him!<eos> Now, wait a minute.<eos> Hold on, hold on, hold it, hold it.<eos> Look, I realize you haven't been real happy with my services..., ...so, I've recruited two great warriors for you.<eos> Meet Xena, the Warrior Princess and her sidekick, Gabrielle!<eos> They're gonna defend our village?
You understand, don't you?<eos> We're all scared!<eos> We can't sleep at night! You're not the only one.<eos> Can't someone tell him to get out of this hotel?<eos> Tell Vash the Stampede to get out?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> What happened, Mr. Vash?<eos> So those scars are the price you paid for dealing with your opponents without killing them?<eos> It's not something I really want girls to see.<eos> They'd run away.

Underneath most of those there would be a thermal, and that's one of those indicators of lift, that's one thing we look for, and that's what birds look for also when they fly, I'm sure.<eos> Feel that!<eos> Now there's a big rocky outcropping. Just look at that.<eos> Now you can see the altimeter winding up.<eos> Look at that.<eos> - How high could we go with this?<eos> - Probably up to 14-15,000 feet with no problem.<eos> - And do the birds go as high as that?<eos> - I've seen birds up to 16-18,000 feet.<eos> - They are just out there flying for fun.
You know what's funny?<eos> What's funny?<eos> To die, that we all have to die one day.<eos> Oh, what's strange about that, Justuz?<eos> Take a look at the trees or the birds or the beetles.<eos> God has created everything to take it back to him one day.<eos> Who are we to question his plans.<eos> We live, we die and we return.<eos> What about the people killed like Elvira, Abel and all the others?<eos> They too live with God now.

the Parcae, the Norns, all the figures devised by men to say life's thread unravels and breaks.<eos> Do they spin Kinjo's life still?<eos> What would Kinjo think before fractal islands and Klein blue?<eos> Before the Goddess of Mercy?<eos> A few visits to Heiwa Dori, Naha's indoors market, and you become aware:<eos> it is run by women.<eos> All are connected with the War.<eos> They are widows and orphans.<eos> Sometimes survivors.<eos> Most little girls of that age experienced mobilization, propaganda, a feeling that they too must fight.
I was held up.<eos> Affairs of the heart.<eos> You?<eos> Affairs of the heart?<eos> My heart still beats, you know.<eos> I'm still very much alive.<eos> Why have you never got married, then?<eos> It isn't as simple as that.<eos> We men do everything we can to get what we want.<eos> But women don't. They get romantic... after we've got them into bed.
Did you know Topanga lied to me?<eos> Then she had this coming.<eos> And Mary Beth is beautiful, and she's here, and no one's ever going to know about it.<eos> Except for Mary Beth and you.<eos> You know, Eric, we had this whole weekend planned out, okay?<eos> Why didn't Topanga want to come with me?<eos> And, tomorrow, Mary Beth will be gone, and so will 16 years of a great relationship with somebody you really care about, somebody you love, somebody who's worth waiting for.<eos> Listen to me, Cory.<eos> Throughout your life, there's going to be a lot of opportunities that come up.<eos> And they're going to seem great, and they're going to seem wonderful, and they're going to seem like they make your life a heck of a lot easier, but you have to walk away.
Insects only have six.<eos> Why does everyone make that mistake?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Has anything like this ever happened before?<eos> When?<eos> Lots of times.<eos> Ew, you must hate spiders more than I do.<eos> I don't hate spiders.<eos> I love them.<eos> They hate me.
People who think their problems are so huge craze me, like this time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike.<eos> It was the most traumatizing event of my life, and she was trying to make it about her leg, like my pain meant nothing.<eos> Well, Cordelia's raised an interesting point here...<eos> Which we'll pursue at a later time.<eos> Ms. Miller?<eos> Good observations today, Cordelia.<eos> It's always exciting to know someone's actually done the reading.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I want to talk to you about my final paper.<eos> I'm real unfocused. I have all these thoughts, and I'm pretty sure they all contradict each other.
I should climb back up on that horse.<eos> I'm too great a catch to give up now.<eos> - No, I think you should give up.<eos> - What?<eos> Well, I don't really want to give up.<eos> I was just saying that to get your sympathy.<eos> Look, this happens sometimes.<eos> When you're on a really bad streak, you start to get desperate.<eos> Women can sense that.<eos> They can smell it.
It's the Russians.<eos> So that makes "Magog" America.<eos> That was a nice call, to copy it down incorrectly.<eos> An obsessive personality would never be able to stand the glaring errors in his work.<eos> It's just ajump-start to get him talking.<eos> It's still up to Frank to draw him out.<eos> Do you have any idea what you have here?<eos> After the second great struggle between the nations will come the Third World War, which will determine everything.<eos> With eyes open, will the world's nations enter into these catastrophes?<eos> They shall not be aware of what is happening, and those that would, and will tell, shall be silenced.
Please, someone feed me poison.<eos> Amanda, I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> You're not a Betsy Wetsy.<eos> Was that fresh air?<eos> You're not a Betsy Wetsy, are you?<eos> And up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up... I hate my life! You know, Sabrina, we've all been out of the box.<eos> - Really?<eos> - The problem is, you're still only 10 inches tall and real easy to step on. I spent two weeks in a vacuum cleaner once. Ate a penny to stay alive.<eos> Dr. Rafkin, superheroes don't whine. I'm not a superhero, I'm a periodontist. I drive a station wagon.<eos> Watch my nine, I'm ticklish. I'll just call my aunts and they'll fix everything. Love the gingham.
He's new here.<eos> Hey, your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro.<eos> You've been an enormous help.<eos> You ran over some pigeons?<eos> How many?<eos> Whatever they had.<eos> Miranda thinks I'm a butcher. But it's not my fault, is it?<eos> Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?<eos> Of course we have a deal.<eos> They get out of the way of cars we look the other way on the statue defecation.
Did you tell them about your little girlfriends?<eos> - Did you tell them how you were in love?<eos> - No!<eos> Did you show them your pictures?<eos> No.<eos> What do you think those girls thought of you, Harold?<eos> Do you think they loved you back?<eos> No one could love you, Harold.<eos> Look at yourself.<eos> They looked at you and saw an ugly toad.
I understand that but something is happening to me... something extraordinary.<eos> I have to see it through.<eos> What do you mean you're not going to let Dr. Bashir operate on you? You have to.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> These visions are gifts.<eos> I can't refuse them.<eos> I cannot believe what I'm hearing.<eos> Listen to yourself, Ben, sitting there telling us that this mystical journey of yours is more important than watching your son grow up.<eos> Dad, please think about what you're doing.<eos> These visions... they're not worth dying for.
It really gets to the mother, did it get to you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Did it make you feel jealous? My client has answered your questions.<eos> - Angry?<eos> - No. Please don't browbeat my client.<eos> Kim and Sarah.<eos> The same injuries.<eos> The same anger.<eos> The same person grasped these children in his hands and crushed their ribs.<eos> - What? - Then they died.
Why are they shaking?<eos> Because the water was freezing.<eos> - No, that's not normal!<eos> - It's OK.<eos> You're just cold.<eos> You just need to get warm, OK?<eos> All right?<eos> Hey, look!<eos> You see the butterflies there?<eos> If there was radiation around, they wouldn't survive, would they?
Yes.<eos> You know what I thought?<eos> I thought... that if I saw him, I'd arrest him or shoot him.<eos> - What happened at the museum?<eos> - There was a long line.<eos> Lots of confusion.<eos> Inside... a strange atmosphere.<eos> It was really weird.<eos> The paintings...<eos> They... they seemed to be floating.
Yeah.<eos> Lucy.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Welcome.<eos> How are you?<eos> I remember all of this exactly,<eos> Just from one week.<eos> The bees.<eos> You don't bother them, they won't bother you.
- at the Bamboo Lounge at 6:01?<eos> - You got it.<eos> - All right?<eos> - Sure. Hey.<eos> That was so fuckin' money. That was like the Jedi mind shit.<eos> See, that's what I'm trying to tell you, baby.<eos> Girls love that kind of stuff.<eos> They don't go for the sensitive shit.<eos> You start talking to 'em about, uh, you know, puppy dogs and ice cream.<eos> They know what you want to do.

This way, young man.<eos> Sorry, kid.<eos> Hey, wait a second!<eos> You'll wait right here. You got me?<eos> So this is my pathway to paradise, huh?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And the girls are waiting for you.<eos> Ah, the girls.<eos> Let them eat a guy named Cake.<eos> They also like crumpet too.
How are you doing?<eos> - Have you been in Sao Paulo?<eos> - How come she has a phone?<eos> I was here already.<eos> How did my girls behave?<eos> - Weren't you the only child?<eos> - l am.<eos> What about these girls?<eos> The girls?<eos> They work with her.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - It's been hanging here for three months.<eos> - Really?<eos> I'm taking them all home.<eos> - Art?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You still haven't paid me for the last two.<eos> Wha...<eos> You should thank me.<eos> Manny, if Vincent van Gogh... had been paid for his paintings... they would be worthless today.
He went to Cambridge as a research student under the supervision of Professor John Coates.<eos> I've been very fortunate to have Andrew as a student, and even as a research student, he was a wonderful person to work with.<eos> He had very deep ideas then, and it was always clear he was a mathematician who would do great things.<eos> But not with Fermat.<eos> Everyone thought Fermat's last theorem was impossible, so professor Coates encouraged Andrew to forget his childhood dream and work on more mainstream math.<eos> The problem with working on Fermat is that you could spend years getting nothing.<eos> So when I went to Cambridge my advisor John Coates was working on<eos> Iwasawa's theory on elliptic curves and I started working with him.<eos> Elliptic curves were the "in" thing to study. but perversely, elliptic curves are neither elliptic nor curves.<eos> You may never heard of elliptic curves but they're extremely important.
These worlds live on different planets.<eos> It's a bridge.<eos> It's more than a bridge; it's really a dictionary, a dictionary where questions, intuitions, insights, theorems in the one world get translated to questions, intuitions in the other world.<eos> I think that when Shimura and Taniyama first started talking about the relationship between elliptic curves and modular forms people were very incredulous.<eos> I wasn't studying mathematics yet.<eos> By the time I was a graduate student in 1969 or 1970, people were coming to believe the conjecture.<eos> In fact, Taniyama-Shimura became a foundation for other theories which all came to depend on it.<eos> But Taniyama-Shimura was only a conjecture, an unproven idea, and until it could be proved, all the maths which relied on it were under threat.<eos> We built more and more conjectures stretched further and further into the future,<eos> but they would all be completely ridiculous if Taniyama-Shimura was not true.
In short, I can't deny the possibility that someone prepared this as a murder.<eos> Would it be okay if I took a little look around?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It was... just so cute...<eos> Even if it is cute...<eos> Come in.<eos> Touching my butt is a crime!<eos> In criminal law, this sort of thing is the worst and, yeah, you could even spend a year or whatever in prison.<eos> Moreover, there's the shock it gives to the women victims!<eos> There've been cases where they can't even ride buses or trains anymore, you know!
You made this?<eos> T-This can't be...<eos> D-Did you not like how it tastes?<eos> You cook better than me.<eos> so it has completely closed up already.<eos> It's rather remarkable.<eos> I don't see a swordsman.<eos> He's perfect for babysitting my grandchildren.<eos> Miss Kaoru?<eos> they're Dr. Gensai's granddaughters.
God bless you.<eos> Roop!<eos> Remember, I'm Patel.<eos> I have three hotels.<eos> Lady.<eos> Ma'am, what happened, ma'am?<eos> I do not know what happened.<eos> When I saw the touching girls ..<eos> ..parecían They intertwined snakes around you.<eos> They were hypnotizing you, biting.
- Really?<eos> Who came to you?<eos> - I woke up to find this-- how best to say this?<eos> Presence in my room.<eos> I looked up, and I saw the springer spaniel.<eos> - Albert?<eos> - Oui.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - He spoke to Bob, madame.<eos> He said, "Go live with my people. They have of you the great need."
I didn't listen.<eos> And when they came, I lost him, our home... the colony where we'd grown up, a woman I was quite fond of.<eos> I escaped with only the clothes on my back and went off in search of these Rangers... that he'd been going on about.<eos> Because he believed in them.<eos> And in you.<eos> Everything I was, everything I had... all of it, died that night.<eos> I don't have anything left to give.<eos> Then that is exactly what you must give up.<eos> Yes, you have lost much... endured much, sacrificed greatly... but you cling to the memory of your sacrifices... of all the things you have lost or left behind.<eos> They drag behind you like chains of your own making.
By the way, I just love what you've done with your bedroom since I was here.<eos> You're in my bedroom?<eos> How did you get in the house?<eos> Come on, silly. I still have the key from my last visit.<eos> Listen, Ginger, this may have slipped your mind, but as far as everybody around here is concerned, we're not supposed to be friends anymore.<eos> I know, Val, and I hate to blow your cover, but I don't have any place to stay. Any ideas?<eos> Are you telling me if I don't accommodate your little whims, you're gonna go back on our deal and tell everybody we scammed them?<eos> Okay, I'll come over there, then.<eos> It will be nice to see the girls.<eos> And I'm sure they would love to see me.
Yes, and the trees are happy too because, for most of them, it's their only chance to see New York.<eos> After you've delivered the drinks, take the tray...<eos> Gunther, please.<eos> I have worked here for two and a half years.<eos> I know the empty trays go over there.<eos> What if you put them here?<eos> You know, that's actually a good idea.<eos> They'll be closer to the mugs.<eos> You know what? You should have the other waitresses do that too.<eos> They already do.
You don't know any inns that're offering discounts to the elderly, do you?<eos> -I mean, an old guy like me.<eos> -You said "doom"!<eos> Now, tell me what's going on.<eos> I thought this festival was just a celebration.<eos> They bless the new wine. Everyone gets drunk. No big deal.<eos> It is if Dionysus wants the king to rule for another year.<eos> And if he doesn't?<eos> Wellll, then the festival becomes my kind of bash!<eos> The new wine drives the maidens into a murderous frenzy and they slaughter the king!
It's definitely you.<eos> What are these people doing?<eos> Kelly, they're background dancercisers.<eos> Thanks for the gift.<eos> No one's ever given me panties filled with potpourri before.<eos> Where did you find them?<eos> - In the lingerie department at--<eos> - Oh, not the panties, you idiot.<eos> - The girls.<eos> - They found me.
Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> George?<eos> Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?<eos> There's nobody I can go with.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't have one female friend left.<eos> Well, no, of course, you don't.<eos> You're a man's woman.<eos> You hate other women and they hate you.
Then this shit heel up and dies on you, huh?<eos> Well, that's just plain rude.<eos> I don't fully understand why I found it now.<eos> - But I did.<eos> - I know why you found it.<eos> He was alive when you started to cut him up.<eos> You thought that you could get the soul gland out of dead people, but, by then, it's already disappeared.<eos> See, souls don't just hang around.<eos> No, you were wrong about that.<eos> They go on to their just reward.
- Shut up!<eos> Jefferson, it was awful.<eos> Some guy came in here and tried to rob me.<eos> He tried to make me open the register and it had been so long I'd forgotten how.<eos> Then he took me in here and he tied me up and I had to sit here all night surrounded by shoes.<eos> Oh, it was awful.<eos> Hey. Hey, I just had a thought.<eos> Have you ever heard of stress-related illnesses?<eos> No. What are those?<eos> They're bull, but they've made people millions of dollars.
Since the last harvest until tonight, the moon has been full six times.<eos> I've almost forgotten how to sleep alone.<eos> When father was alive, he sold six parcels of land to the Chinaman to have the money to buy the breeding seeds.<eos> Now we have only 14 plots.<eos> Not one more to leave to our seven daughters.<eos> Two plots each.<eos> And if we have another child, what will we have to give?<eos> If we have a boy, he could take over for us when we're old.<eos> Coming home from the paddies, he'll bring wood and honey for the house.<eos> When our daughters have husbands, they'll have children.
Isn't that Mama?<eos> Just keep working.<eos> Where did she get those clothes?<eos> Crazy widow with many daughters!<eos> Shameless widow!<eos> Crazy widow who catches cobras with her bare hands!<eos> You see?<eos> I'm all alone.<eos> Our children are too young.<eos> They don't help me.
Three minutes for you to speak and three for me.<eos> You've lost your three minutes;<eos> Now only listen...<eos> Amar and Prem full of purity and devotion.<eos> Your names had suggested that you were glamour-struck vagabonds.<eos> But you're useless parasites, too.<eos> While you do certainly look like illiterate bums you proved to be greater fools when you thought I'd agree to this match.<eos> My three minutes are not up.<eos> I've brought up these girls with a lot of love and affection.<eos> But I think they need medical help because they've chosen rascals like you.
Smoke.<eos> - Don't touch him.<eos> - Ha-ha! Little punk.<eos> - Come here, John.<eos> - Go see your father.<eos> Ohh! Disappearance in the family.<eos> It's funny.<eos> You know, I... I thought immortals couldn't have children.<eos> But it seems that while I'm the master of illusion, you are turning out to be the master of deception, Highlander.<eos> How did you do it? How did you convince all those lovely women of yours... that they were the ones that couldn't bear children?
"I hasten to inform him or her, it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.<eos> "I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-washed babe...<eos> "... and I am not contained between my hat and my boots<eos> "And peruse manifold objects, no two alike... "<eos> How did you get just a one-year sentence at Wretchmont?<eos> "I am not on earth nor adjunct of an earth... "<eos> Just lucky.<eos> "I am the mate and companion of people...<eos> "... all just as immortal and fathomless as myself.<eos> "And they do not know how immortal...
The maestro.<eos> What I shall tell you will never leave this room?<eos> On my word ot honor, Contessa.<eos> There is substance to the rumors.<eos> I was the great love ot Luigi's lite.<eos> I first heard the name Beethoven when I was 17.<eos> I had heard that his music aroused such passion as to be dangerous.<eos> Some thought it obscene and unsuitable for the young.<eos> I wrote to my cousins, Theresa and Josephine.<eos> They lived in Vienna, the great music capital of the world.

It never would have worked between you and I.<eos> You never could have given me what I wanted.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - To be number one in your life.<eos> How would you know that?<eos> You never gave me a chance.<eos> - Hello, Shame.<eos> I hope I'm not interrupting.<eos> You should take better care of your women.<eos> They might fall into the hands of another man.
Thanks.<eos> What a great woman.<eos> She's a White Sox fan!<eos> Such a nice personality.<eos> I bet he loves the idea of me sitting out here in the bullpen.<eos> Really sexy, too.<eos> I've met the woman, Rube,<eos> I don't need a description, alright?<eos> A White Sox fan.<eos> Women... you can't live without them, and they can't pee standing up.
The easter bunny.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Bye-bye now.<eos> You don't think he's nuts, do you?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Well, he believes he's Santa Claus, absolutely believes it.<eos> Maybe that's why he's good at it.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> Look at our stocks.<eos> They're through the roof.
- I-I tell her everything.<eos> - Mariel! Oh, you look beautiful!<eos> Oh, isn't she beautiful?<eos> She is wearing the make-up, isn't she? Smile. - I was tryin' to hide from you.<eos> - I saw your wheels.<eos> - I didn't think you'd come.<eos> - I had to see it for myself.<eos> Just the bridesmaids were worth it.<eos> I didn't call them.<eos> They came crawling back to me.

Are you innocent?<eos> But who else could it be?<eos> Was it you, Martin?<eos> I'll talk to Rolf instead.<eos> Why?<eos> It's 1:30 a.<eos> M. You're under arrest.<eos> How could you?<eos> What have you got against hookers?<eos> Do they offend your respectable mind?
- Peace be with you, Father.<eos> I know what you're thinkin':<eos> Any minute now, he'll take his pants off.<eos> Peace be with you.<eos> It wasn't a sermon. It was a party political broadcast on behalf of the Labour Party.<eos> - There's social sin and there's personal sin.<eos> - It's just sickening !<eos> - I think we should put more emphasis on the social.<eos> - There's just sin.<eos> Matthew, you can't change the rules just because they don't suit you;
[ chuckles ] it's as light as a feather.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> This thing was big.<eos> Anything?<eos> uh-uh.<eos> You know those japanese balloon bombs?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Made of rice paper.<eos> About 30 feet in diameter.<eos> They don't come apart when they land unless the bomb goes off.
Now, I know that some of you just abhor beauty pageants, but... having been a puff-puff girl myself, way back in '39...<eos> I just couldn't resist, girls, and one, a two, a one two three.<eos> ♪ Beauty and glamour and breeding unmatched.<eos> ♪ Princesses is on parade.<eos> ♪ Lovely, enthralling, and all unattached.<eos> ♪ The hoi polloi and those well-bred agree. ♪ Each enjoy a royal pedigree.<eos> ♪ Born for success, ♪ Each possesses a spark.<eos> ♪ Each a remarkable maid.<eos> ♪ Boy, oh boy, these royal highnesses.<eos> ♪ All have plusses, they've no minuses.
No sea, no earth either...<eos> Fuck you.<eos> What have you done to the sea, to the earth?<eos> My life is<eos> Tango...<eos> Tango, tango...<eos> My mother's the sea,<eos> That was it.<eos> And to the sweet sound of an accordion, the pub spiders launched their last attack.<eos> They wove loose webs on top of the glasses, the cups, the ashtrays, around the legs of the tables and the chairs.
Now you're through. You can close down.<eos> Go home, will you?<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> My husband was the same, didn't know what's right.<eos> Then where did he end up?<eos> On a rope in the loft.<eos> Stop bugging me.<eos> Bug yourself.<eos> Go get your daughters or they might go with them.<eos> They'll never.
And now, you pull this.<eos> - Wow. The most ever?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> All right, relax.<eos> Shut up!<eos> We're already on the F.A.A. hit list.<eos> You pull a stupid stunt like this, it hurts everyone here.<eos> Now you listen to me. Until we pass the next inspection, there will be no more base jumps off of radar towers.<eos> No more bungee jumps off construction cranes while they're operating.
And you wore those cute little mailman shorts.<eos> Kept delivering me things from the Home Shopping Network.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> We'll have to analyze that someday.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm just waiting for my French Cinema class to start.<eos> I was just thinking about women and men.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I think you were right about me being afraid of women.<eos> All men are afraid of women because they're inherently better creatures.

I think you were right about me being afraid of women.<eos> All men are afraid of women because they're inherently better creatures.<eos> They can bear children, they can nurse them.<eos> They have an infinitely higher capacity to be compassionate.<eos> It's like they're a different species.<eos> You were just sitting there thinking about this?<eos> Yeah. It's dumb, I know.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I feel like I understand women more.<eos> They're more inclusive and open.
- With Fausta.<eos> - I admit it, she drives me crazy.<eos> Why hold back at my age, eh?<eos> Or cultivate illusions?<eos> I had to pay her that shameless little--<eos> At times paying isn't as sleazy as doing it for free.<eos> Maybe, but I haven't had to do that for ages. Anyway, believe me, there's nothing like it.<eos> - Paying women?<eos> - No, fucking them.<eos> Which is basically what they really want too.
- She did it.<eos> - Who? - She did it!<eos> - She did it!<eos> Right.<eos> In bed, right now.<eos> Ah, don't you hear those kids fighting?<eos> I haven't eaten all day.<eos> It's 10:00.<eos> - Why don't you put 'em to bed? - I did.<eos> They just keep poppin' back up.
And things at work...<eos> Basically everywhere...<eos> I can't get a handle on things.<eos> Everything's loose and... fuzzy.<eos> I look at her now when I drop off the kids at the house... and I see what a wonderful job she's doin' with the kids, and I wonder why.<eos> That maybe she never really needed me... as much as I thought she needed me.<eos> She thinks the girls need more watching after.<eos> Especially Casey.<eos> She's our youngest.<eos> You think they're growin' up fine on automatic pilot.

Alice, you really made me cry.<eos> Me too.<eos> Me too.<eos> My wife is an alcoholic.<eos> Best person I ever met.<eos> She has 600 different kinds of smiles. They can light up your life.<eos> They can make you laugh out loud just like that. They can even make you cry just like that.<eos> That's just with her smiles.<eos> You'd have to see her with her kids.<eos> You'd have to see how they look at her... when she's not looking.
"We say: 'This is what I am.'<eos> And we act accordingly.<eos> But these are just our masks.<eos> We forget that we are wearing them.<eos> And we run from the ones which others wear."<eos> "So, really these wrathful deities are just part of us?"<eos> "Yes, that's why I say it's impossible to run away from them.<eos> They are the sharpness of your own clarity. They are all in your head."<eos> "But still it's hard not to find them frightening."<eos> "Maybe they can understand why you are always running away."
Be willing to release any connections with the life you have been living, and release the people with whom you have associated.<eos> Whatever fear or terror that might come to you during the experiencing of the reality of your mind, keep these thought in your consciousness and go forward.<eos> Recognize that any mental image, pictures which occur, are of your own creation.<eos> Maintain that recognition and you will achieve liberation."<eos> 9 days have passed since Paldem Sering's death. According to the Bardo Thodol, if the deceased still fail to recognize his basic nature, and if he's failed to recognize the peaceful deities as the projections of his own mind, then they transform to terrifying wrathful ones.<eos> "Paldem Sering, listen without distraction.<eos> Now, the blood drinking wrathful ones will appear.<eos> Their bodies are dark red or dark blue, with 3 heads 6 arms, and 4 legs spread wide apart.<eos> Their 9 eyes gaze into yours, with a furious expression.<eos> They hold human skulls full of blood, and they roar like thunder. They are accompanied by repne of their own kind in many colors, and they fill the whole of space.
- Who?<eos> - She did it! - She did it!<eos> Right.<eos> In bed, right now.<eos> Ah, don't you hear those kids fighting?<eos> I haven't eaten all day.<eos> It's 10:00.<eos> - Why don't you put 'em to bed? - I did.<eos> They just keep poppin' back up.<eos> They miss their mother, Michael.

I want a second opinion!<eos> Oh... no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I've been down that road before.<eos> Better-educated and equipped doctors telling my patients they're fine and then what? !<eos> They never come back!<eos> I have proof-- proof-- of your condition.<eos> Here's your EKG. Here's where I remembered to plug it in.<eos> I didn't get around to a blood test, but, hey, the sight of that stuff makes me blow lunch anyway.<eos> I did run cat scans, MRIs, and urine tests.<eos> And as you can see, they are all conclusive.
[Speaking foreign language] What do you want?<eos> Maria Gonzales.<eos> We can wait.<eos> (Maria) Felix?<eos> You are here about Mrs. Bauer.<eos> I am very sorry for her.<eos> (Briscoe) Really?<eos> How'd you know there was anything to be sorry about?<eos> I have friends who work on that street.<eos> They told me.
That's pretty much it.<eos> Wyatt, this is all men.<eos> Where are the chicks?<eos> - That is a chick.<eos> - Oh. Nice pecs.<eos> Look at this.<eos> I'm pathetic.<eos> What girl would go out with a guy who looks like this?<eos> Women today want more than just a good body.<eos> They want humor, compassion, and sensitivity.
That's good!<eos> You look more like a woman now!<eos> Smells good too!<eos> Worth tasting!<eos> Worth tasting!<eos> Why are you dressed like this?<eos> ! You look like a hooker!<eos> Officer Lee, I think I look better than your dates.<eos> That's different...<eos> they really ARE hookers!
Come on, put them on!<eos> The police has solved the babies case.<eos> Most missing babies have been found.<eos> Here's our live report.<eos> We heard that 3 heroines solved it.<eos> How are they related to the police?<eos> They are close friends of the police.<eos> What are their positions?<eos> No comment.<eos> When will they come again?
Oh, sorry!<eos> We don't get very many visitors!<eos> Hm, would a sherry do?<eos> Any port in the storm...!<eos> Any port in the storm... I can see right down your dress, Flo.<eos> God, you've got great tits!<eos> They were big before, but now they're great big whoppers of things!<eos> You're just being nice!<eos> No, seriously, Flo.<eos> They're the sort of tits a man can really lose himself in. Bury his face and forget about the troubles of-
I'd just as soon keep workin'.<eos> Keep a little change in my pocket. Rather than listening' to some dipshit who doesn't know what he's sayin'.<eos> I know what you're talkin' about.<eos> So you're a freshman?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How's this year's crop of freshman chicks lookin'?<eos> You're gonna end up in jail sometime really soon.<eos> - No, man.<eos> That's what I love about these high school girls:<eos> I get older, they stay the same age.
We have flapjacks in small mountains.<eos> Fresh butter, bacon, wagons of ham, apple butter, ripe cherries.<eos> You really ought to pitch in, sir.<eos> Courtesy of our host, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.<eos> Has there been any trouble from the local population?<eos> Oh, no, sir.<eos> No trouble with them.<eos> The men are behaving very well.<eos> But there are some local women who claim we have taken all their food.<eos> And though they don't complain of our having paid for it in the good dear coin of mighty Virginia well, sir, they do object to starving.
- Is it?<eos> Or sophistry?<eos> All I'm saying is--<eos> - What has this to do with a pig?<eos> - All I'm saying is... that in a world where nothing is reasonable... in the end, nothing can be truly mad.<eos> [ Boniface ] Let me understand this, Courtois. In order to disprove the count... that the woman suborned the rats to cause her neighbor's death... it is your wish that we call those rats as witnesses?<eos> And how would the maitre have us execute a warrant?<eos> Do we send armed sheriffs to arrest them?<eos> No, Maitre.<eos> They must testify of their own free will.
If she goes too, I'm screwed.<eos> Trust me, sir.<eos> You don't want a women like the others.<eos> The surprise is awful.<eos> You are leaving.<eos> Why desire, if you need a body?<eos> This is our first little war.<eos> We've expected it.<eos> I'll tell the poppies.<eos> They'll blush with emotion.
Exactly.<eos> Let's have another round.<eos> There is no difference between men and women.<eos> They are all the same.<eos> So long as they carry a light deep inside them.<eos> Fire!<eos> What I have to do is--<eos> We must learn not to worship women all the time.<eos> Oh, man, that's bullshit.<eos> They really eat that shit up!
To make the pond, the house had to be squeezed down.<eos> When you think of that matchbox house... this is indeed as big as a palace. Right?<eos> Indeed it is. We're flattered.<eos> Still, I do flatter myself with this doughnut-shaped pond.<eos> It's a brilliant idea.<eos> The Pacific may be vast... but swimming straight... you'll reach the shores of America.<eos> Swimming round in this pond... the distance is limitless.<eos> I want to keep carp in this pond.<eos> Big ones you only see in dreams.<eos> They could be as big as rowboats.
Won't you sit down?<eos> The sisters tell me your last posting was at a women's prison facility in the Louisiana bayou.<eos> - What?<eos> - It wasn't?<eos> No, no, it was, it was.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> The prison was really rough on me. I'm trying to wipe this experience from my mind. It was so traumatic.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They led me to believe that you enjoyed it.
I can't believe you guys just hopped on a plane.<eos> Talk about good friends.<eos> - lt's more like a family.<eos> - Get used to it.<eos> You're just not marrying Brenda, you're inheriting a whole family.<eos> Take all the girls, for instance.<eos> They're inseparable.<eos> They're either talking on the phone or at each other's house.<eos> And you'll get to know all of them just as well as you know Brenda.<eos> - They will get to know you.
Well, it's not so easy.<eos> I mean, I wear my heart on my sleaze.<eos> Daddy, what makes men cheat on women?<eos> Women.<eos> Pumpkin, don't take it personally.<eos> See men are different.<eos> We're loners, rogues, great white hunters roaming wild and free, like our ancestors, the mighty monkey.<eos> We need variety.<eos> In fact, women like us that way.<eos> They want us to be that way.
It is the same locket which you had out around that innocent baby's neck!<eos> Around my neck!<eos> Recognize this locket.<eos> You didn't, right?<eos> Go away from here!<eos> None of you are worthily of being called my mother!<eos> I'll spend the rest of my life in the filth where I have been raised!<eos> Go away!<eos> Did you see these "society women"?<eos> They rejected you!

Good day, Ms. Sakai.<eos> Ambassador.<eos> While I was out there, I saw something.<eos> What was it?<eos> What is this?<eos> - An ant.<eos> - Ant?<eos> So much gets shipped from Earth, it's hard to keep them out.<eos> I have just picked it up on the tip of my glove.<eos> If I put it down again and it asks another ant:
- Why can't I think like this?<eos> - If it was easy, everybody would do it.<eos> Hey, copy boy.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Who's Kyle Griffin?<eos> Wait a minute. Wasn't he busted five years ago for selling high-tech weaponry to the Third World?<eos> His firm did the selling, he did the designing.<eos> Why would he be after you?<eos> My first big story was an exposé on the illegal arms business.<eos> It led to the FBI arresting 12 people.
This minster am dedicated to the immaculate Virgin, why I should not to be examined here?<eos> Of what are you scared?<eos> Of the potency of maidenhood?<eos> She cannot avoid in consequences of his crime.<eos> It is virgin by my eyes...<eos> they cannot carry it out in this city.<eos> She lies to us and deceives us all.<eos> It is virgin by my breast...<eos> they cannot carry it out in this city.<eos> In the presence of law, it is in suffering.
What else?<eos> (Sobs) 'Can you turn that fucking thing off?<eos> 'Again?<eos> The box.<eos> 'I don't know what it's for 'or who made it, or why.<eos> 'I only know what it does. It hurts.<eos> 'It hurts.<eos> 'It kind of... opens itself.<eos> 'Your fingers move and you learn.<eos> 'It wants to open, that's the thing, 'and it helps, and then they come.
She who once gave you life and being to subdue death and folly<eos> sends you this day, as a last token of a mother's blessing,<eos> the first kiss of love.<eos> Amfortas!<eos> The wound!<eos> The wound!<eos> It burns within my heart!<eos> O sorrow, sorrow!<eos> Fearful sorrow!<eos> From the depths of my heart it cries aloud.
They don't always look barmy.<eos> Sometimes they can look just like you and me.<eos> - Yes, I suppose they can.<eos> - Now, sometimes it's the war or something, and they've never been right since. I don't hold with wars.<eos> - I don't hold with plague and sleeping sickness and famine and cancer, but they happen all the same.<eos> - Ah, but war's preventable.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I expect you was in the war. - Yes, yes.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> And it did... unsettle me.
All right, damn you!<eos> I'll throw you out. I'll ruin you. You'll see.<eos> I had hardly gone any distance at all when I heard a terrible scream. I ran back down and found my father lying on his side.<eos> Did you see anyone else?<eos> No one.<eos> No movement anywhere?<eos> No, my attention was entirely on my father. He was terribly wounded. You would not tell the coroner about this quarrel with your father.<eos> It was something private. It was no business of his.<eos> Was it not because this confrontation with your father might seem to incriminate you?<eos> No, no, it was because it concerned Alice. It was no business of the coroners or anyone else's. I wasn't going to have her name bandied about in the courtroom.
You don't have loyal fans.<eos> The only person on your side is me!<eos> And that's starting to look like a real bad career mood.<eos> Your Honor, defense requests a change of venue.<eos> -Are you nuts?<eos> -l see no way that my client...<eos> -...can get a fair trial in Central City.<eos> -Leave Central City?<eos> You are crazy. I love this town.<eos> -And it loves me.

Ah, Miss Tudsbury.<eos> His lordship's being taken to the plane.<eos> A car's waiting for you.<eos> Very well.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Dearest Victor, I'm writing this en route from new Delhi to London carrying Duncan home, very much against his will, for further medical treatment.<eos> He was terribly injured when his plane went down in a thunderstorm... broken collarbone, fractured ankles, and after a week on foot in the jungle, a high fever that won't seem to go away.<eos> During the past weeks, he's been very low and so dependent on me.<eos> Now in a quiet way, it almost seems as If we are maried.<eos> Now, Victor, about your proposal, it fell on me like an avalanche just this morning.
Thanks, guys. Let's beach it, babe. You know, Peg, Steve just gave me a great idea.<eos> We're gonna have Bundy Day at the beach. Peg, what're you doing? [SNIFFING]<eos> There's a new odor in this house. Al?<eos> [SNIFFS]<eos> No, that's the old one.<eos> I think it's coming from this envelope.<eos> Hey, I smell it too, Mom.<eos> It's money.<eos> But I don't recognize the denomination.<eos> Well, then it means that it's more than five.
Maddie!<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> I want to introduce a few people here.<eos> Maddie's mother, Rhonda Henry.<eos> Rhoda Henry.<eos> Welcome to Hollywood.<eos> War hero son, Byron.<eos> Byron, I'll watch out for you.<eos> Lots of nice girls here. Hughie, I never get over this house.<eos> It's so beautiful, isn't it, Mom?
What happened to the pushy furball?<eos> Who cares?<eos> At least he's gone.<eos> Alf: yo!<eos> Point those cameras over here.<eos> Ohh. Oh, no.<eos> Not that.<eos> [Fanfare] Friends,<eos> Are you getting too fat for things you used to fit in, Like your house?<eos> When you get on the scale, does it say,
More, though I have nothing to give you.<eos> Now, the soldier had but a single biscuit in his bag... and he was hungry as heck, so he thought on it.<eos> But I have a biscuit you can share with me.<eos> And the soldier held out his last dry biscuit and broke it in two... but it didn't feel good, did it, dearies... to give the old boy less than the others?<eos> So he gave him both halves.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> And deserve more luck than to be on your last biscuit.<eos> Here, take my cards, your honour... and may they never lose for you.<eos> Take this sack also... an ugly thing, but remarkable.<eos> Order a bird in or a beast... or anything you like, and it will be there in a twinkle.
- She is not the woman of garotinho?<eos> - Yes.<eos> A woman alone, here in the night, has that to be it.<eos> We can use it.<eos> - Only this time. - It would be my coffee of the morning.<eos> - We go this way. - Well.<eos> Certain, the superior light if lights some times.<eos> - That beautiful sight has daqui.<eos> - He is already vi.<eos> It finds that it is stealing the maps all time?
Becker.<eos> It waits a moment.<eos> They must have listened it.<eos> The machine gun, Ruiz.!<eos> These are our weapons.<eos> We are not in war?<eos> It is at least we advance a little thanks to you, Horn.<eos> Now we must find this girl to see if it has activity VC in the village.<eos> Charlie goes to think that traiu it them.<eos> The only place that it will be the saved one is in the monastery.
Knitting to stay at the the fireplace?<eos> When my time comes, the world will know that I'm gone!<eos> There is none.<eos> You can leave.<eos> For the next month,<eos> Alan Brewster and his team will try to climb the Le Diable the"Devil's Mountain,"the South.<eos> The mountain was climbed only once, in 1938 the north side, the team led by Sir David Squire.<eos> There was one woman in team, Young Bess Sedgwick.<eos> What a coincidence!<eos> - It is in this hotel.
Energy, that's what the doctor was talking about, we must destroy all his energy<eos> We are asking all the residents not to carry ant unnecessary objects that could difficult the evacuation<eos> Take with you whatever you consider essential.<eos> You will be taken to the shelters in San Francisco.<eos> General Turball!<eos> You have to get us some seats in that bus, While I talk to the General<eos> General, I have to talk to you, I know how to finish with the monster.<eos> With electricity.<eos> We plug him in and he becomes a Christmas Tree.<eos> We found one monsters nail and it had electrons in it... that moved much faster than usual.
Appreciate that.<eos> Well... I promise you... I'll come back to see you every year.<eos> Don't you laugh at me now.<eos> We'll just sit out under that old warm sun, you and me together and we'll, you know...<eos> Well, you be good, now.<eos> And I want you to be nice to dogs that pass by in the night, okay.<eos> MURDOCK: Hey, B.A... don't you want to go say goodbye to the little guy?<eos> I don't talk to no plants, sucker.<eos> But he's almost a member of the team.<eos> He used to watch over the van when it was afraid and alone.
And if you change your mind, we'd love to have you, sir.<eos> Phil has the final script.<eos> Energetic.<eos> Is he married?<eos> He has a wife and three children.<eos> When does school start?<eos> Oh, Dad, I'd be so miserable.<eos> I feel like I've joined the Navy. And I want to stay in.<eos> What attracts you to this flimsy business?<eos> It's the furthest thing from your mother's interests or mine.
- Well, they moved to my house.<eos> - And then?<eos> She moved out on her own.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Shojiro, I acted on my own.<eos> You keep out of this.<eos> Even if she wanted to, you shouldn't have let her.<eos> You yourself said the Kugenuma house was worthless.<eos> You remember that.<eos> You knew it was too old to live in.
The law bars addressing the public.<eos> Back to your seat.<eos> This trial is just starting, not ending.<eos> The braver the man, the harder they try to destroy him.<eos> Go on, Danton.<eos> Listen.<eos> When they decide to destroy a man, they throw the book at him.<eos> An old trick, but one I see they've brought to new refinement.<eos> You dismiss the law while claiming to serve it.<eos> It makes those in power think that they have nothing to fear.
"I'll go anywhere you want me to go as long as it doesn't cost me a few measly dollars."<eos> 100! Well over!<eos> After I yell at you!<eos> Dr. Scott, do you have any personal wealth?<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> If you can find any property in the world I own, with one exception, you can keep it.<eos> I don't have any real estate, no property, no stocks, no cash, no bank account, no house.<eos> I own nothing.<eos> Everything is owned by the church.<eos> It pays all my expenses. The church can vote me out, it's not some shady operation.
- It would've matched her rotissomat.<eos> - Mom, Dad, can I--<eos> - You're going to bed in good time tonight.<eos> - I was thinking of going to bed now.<eos> - Now ?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> -You must wait for your food to go down.<eos> -I haven't eaten any food.<eos> Well, you must eat your food.<eos> And then wait for it to go down.
The day you see the reality... you'll shoot yourself... because you'll be honest and will see the harm you've done us... with all this "got to organize", "up the working classes"... with all this "History" crap!<eos> And we're are in the shit!<eos> In jail, all beaten up, sweating away in the fucking plant... with no other future than dying on the lathe!<eos> You're upside down, Tião.<eos> Upside down, my ass!<eos> Upside down, my ass!<eos> I'm better off than you!<eos> I see the shit we're in.<eos> And you say that we gotta see that shit flows.<eos> We must reinforce that door or it'll give away.
At his funeral were liberal Ministers... housewives, and Indians with cassette recorders.<eos> A colorful moment was provided by Neide... a famous gay Congressperson... a famous gay Congressperson... who sang at the graveside... the song "Babalu"... to console the government officials in attendance.<eos> Meanwhile, in Nova lguagu...<eos> I LOVE YOU<eos> You know how you make me feel?<eos> Like I am obeying orders... like you always wanted me to leave you... so that you could cry like this afterwords!<eos> "She left me!"<eos> - Don't leave me, Barbara.<eos> - And the factory?<eos> You always wanted it to go bankrupt... so that you could say "I'm ruined."
Is that why behind every door I find a spy?<eos> They know if I'm sad, If I'm happy.<eos> If I eat meat or decline wine.<eos> They know all, and they tell all.<eos> To whom?<eos> To whom?<eos> In this house Camilo has servants who are more his than yours.<eos> He pays them to know how we live.<eos> Tomorrow he will say that you beat me, and the entire Oporto will know it.<eos> Take that letter, and let it burn the air that you have in your chest, the same air with which you utter such hateful words.
Don't haunt me with Fanny's memory.<eos> Your sense of humanity does not coincide with mine.<eos> You are a perfect example of the chaotic state of society.<eos> Full of noble principles but without the spirit to apply them.<eos> Sensibility and selfishness that feigns it. Pompous speeches and miserable experience.<eos> Some organizations are so susceptible that it would be difficult to believe in their truth.<eos> If I were to ask myself who I am, I would be in great difficulty.<eos> I am not to be believed; I cannot go any further than this.<eos> Yet this is not about me now, but about Fanny and her mystery.<eos> Let silence fall over that insane story that was her life, my sister's life with you, and perhaps it can still. be of some use.
"I couldn't see my hands." You coward!<eos> Lower me down the hole. Even a thousand devils cannot frighten me!<eos> Hey, come on!<eos> Well, let me try my luck this time!<eos> Pull me up only if I tug the rope three times!<eos> Hello, Goblin.<eos> - Easy, you!<eos> - Give me back my beard.<eos> You see, I can hardly walk.<eos> It posessed the little strength I had.
El Señor de H., Knight of the Order of Malta and Spanish envoy to the Holy See.<eos> Since this person is also attracted by young L., he provokes the jealousy and rivalry of the Marquis de E.<eos> E. and H., being friends of long standing in view of their affiliation to the same secret society,<eos> agree to settle their quarrel through a game of chess with the loser undertaking to renounce all claim to the hypothetical favours of the boy L.<eos> The betrothed girl happens to witness this scene. Perceiving the disquieting implications of the scene without really understanding, she tells to her aunt.<eos> The latter, we learn in Chapter Four, is now resolved to act.<eos> In pursuance of her plan, she therefore summons the Marquis.<eos> Arriving at the appointed place, the Marquis finds the Marquise partially unclothed challengingly exhibiting herself before his eyes.<eos> Understanding the allusion to his lack of interest in the fair sex, he loses his temper and offers to strike her.<eos> The girl, witnessing the scene, assumes it to be a lovers' quarrel.
What do you doing?<eos> At the reception there is none.<eos> - Get Lost!<eos> - Do you have you do, damn it!<eos> You need to explain anything!<eos> What do you get up?<eos> Nothing!<eos> The pipe once beat water, with English key.<eos> I will understand that it is our signal.<eos> Turn on the water, it enters the shower and ....
I'll alert all my teachers to be prepared for the worst.<eos> I appreciate your thoughtfulness in asking us to this briefing.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Crane.<eos> - You're welcome, Ms. Schuster.<eos> Any further comment?<eos> What's our timetable?<eos> Eight-hour shifts, round the clock.<eos> I meant, what's the length of our program?<eos> How long can we expect to be here?<eos> Until we have destroyed the African bee or it has destroyed us.
The book.<eos> The everlasting book.<eos> Very well. We will go to the terrace and rehearse you in the ceremony.<eos> What ceremony?<eos> The one that precedes your being made the keeper of the book. Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> I don't understand.<eos> This is the seat of harmony, Cord.<eos> There seems to me to be nothing but harmony on this island.<eos> Yes, it, uh, permeates everything here.
He doesn't know about naval battles.<eos> (MARCELLUS) Well, it Wasn't much of a battle, was it?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> One wine-soaked lover and his Egyptian whore?<eos> I could have put up a better show myself.<eos> Now, now, Marcellus.<eos> - Let's not fool ourselves.<eos> - You know all about it, do you?<eos> Yes. I've studied that battle and I'm not impressed.<eos> It wasn't a famous victory.
But you know what a printer he is and how he's helped Buchholtz?<eos> That's all true.<eos> But he might just make it.<eos> - Where'd you get this much?<eos> - That's my secret.<eos> I see in your eyes some new rascally trick.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> I finally got the money from my father.<eos> Now his factory won't last a year.<eos> When it fails, my father won't survive either.
I just hope you don't lose them back in the Colonies.<eos> Safe trip.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How about a lift, Yank?<eos> Jim!<eos> Jim! I'm all right.<eos> Over here!<eos> Get behind that car!<eos> Well, I'm going to miss this old town.<eos> It's going to miss you.
He can't raise the money, Barney.<eos> Ziegfeld can't raise the money?<eos> Not even from Buck?<eos> - Things are tough.<eos> - Even the grocer is suing us.<eos> It'll look lousy going to court over corn flakes.<eos> Fanny, darling, I think I'd better make you a loan.<eos> " Dollink," I better sell my house.<eos> What can I get?<eos> Not anywhere near what it's worth, with the mortgage it carries.
Surely He could stop them.<eos> Unless ofcourse, He is the sadist.<eos> No !<eos> He is Love, all Love.<eos> Then He is impotent.<eos> You can't have it both ways my dear !<eos> You see what is around you.<eos> We see another world, Just as real :<eos> Our life with GOD.<eos> Everyday... it gets deeper and stronger.
It's easier than you think, Chief.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> You're a lot bigger than me.<eos> Why, Chief, you're about as big as a goddamn tree trunk.<eos> My poppa's real big.<eos> He did like he pleased.<eos> That's why everybody worked on him.<eos> The last time I've seen my father he was blind in the cedars from drinking.<eos> And every time he put the bottle to his mouth he don't suck out of it.<eos> It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk so wrinkled and yellow, even the dogs don't know him.
Maybe I can land you someplace before the shootin' starts.<eos> Old man?<eos> - Are you goin' across?<eos> No.<eos> We're goin' down river. We're loaning' the raft.<eos> That ain't loaning', that's stealin'.<eos> Am I gonna have trouble?<eos> - Not a bit, as long as you got that.<eos> I'm securing' this for the law.<eos> I ain't got much use for the law. It ain't got use for me, neither.
Of Nazareth?<eos> Can any thing of good come from Nazareth? ..from that miserable pile of hovels?<eos> Come and see.<eos> Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.<eos> Whence knowest thou me?<eos> Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast.. under the fig tree, I saw thee.<eos> Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God.<eos> Thou art the King of Israel.<eos> Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believest?<eos> It is written, "My house shall be called the house of prayer.." "..to all nations," but you have made it.. a den of thieves!
What do I do, stick a grenade up my nose?<eos> Not that it hasn't got room for it.<eos> Come with me, Danny.<eos> The sending of you to me only reinforces my opinion of Colonel Blake.<eos> Oh, just wanna mark my place.<eos> "Jawbone of an ass."<eos> Baker, all a nose is is a nose.<eos> It takes in air, and it breaks up the space between your eyes and your mouth.<eos> It has nothing to do with a person's value or quality.<eos> It's there to catch a cold through, or at which to look down on people from.
"intangible things as well as by tangible things," that reaches its absolute fulfillment in the spectacle. where the tangible world finds itself replaced... by a selection of images which exists above it, and which at the same time has made itself... recognized as the tangible par excellence.<eos> The world at once present and absent... that the spectacle makes visible... is the world of the commodity... dominating everything that is lived.<eos> And the world of the commodity is thus shown as it is, for its movement is identical... to the distancing of men... from one another and from their global production.<eos> The domination of commodity... was at first exercised in an occult fashion over the economy, that itself, as the material base of social life, remained unrecognized and misunderstood, like the familiar which remains nonetheless unknown.<eos> In a society where the concrete commodity... remains rare or in the minority, the apparent domination of money presents itself... as the emissary with full powers... who speaks in the name of an unknown power.<eos> With the industrial revolution, the division of labor in manufacturing... and mass production for the world market, the commodity effectively appears... as a power that actually comes to occupy social life.<eos> It is then that political economy comes... to constitute the dominant science and the science of domination.<eos> The spectacle is a permanent opium war... to enforce the identification of goods with commodities, and of satisfaction... with survival increasing according to its own laws.<eos> But if consumable survival is something which should... always increase, it's because it never ceases to contain privation.<eos> If there is nothing beyond increased survival, no point where it ceases to grow, it's because it is not itself beyond privation, but rather, it is enriched privation.
The only two classes which effectively correspond to Marx's theory, the two pure classes towards which the entire analysis of Capital leads, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, are likewise, the only two revolutionary classes in history, but under different conditions:<eos> the bourgeois revolution is over;<eos> the proletarian revolution is a project, born on the basis of the preceding revolution, but differing from it qualitatively.<eos> By neglecting the originality of the historical role of the bourgeoisie, one masks the concrete originality... of the proletarian project... which can accomplish... nothing save by carrying its own colors... and by knowing "the immensity of its tasks".<eos> The bourgeoisie came to power... because it is the class of the economy in development.<eos> The proletariat can become a power itself only by becoming... the class of consciousness.<eos> The maturing of productive forces... cannot guarantee such power, even by the detour of increased dispossession that it brings.<eos> The Jacobin seizure of the State... cannot be its instrument.<eos> No ideology can... be of use to disguise partial goals as general goals, for it can maintain... no partial reality which actually belongs to it.<eos> The ideological alienation of theory... can longer recognize then the practical verification of... unified historical thought which it betrayed, when such a verification arose... in the spontaneous struggles of workers; it can only conspire to repress... the appearance and memory of such a thing.
What's the matter?<eos> She's out to get me!<eos> She's out to get me!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My science teacher.<eos> Every week, she makes me bring in a new exhibit.<eos> I'm going to have a nervous breakdown before I'm 6 years old.<eos> I don't see what that-- This week, it's gonna be something from nature.<eos> Why don't we leave nature alone?<eos> It's not bothering us.
One of us?<eos> It's likely.<eos> Approximately 82.5% in favour of the possibility.<eos> But it doesn't matter if we reach the Soul.<eos> Apparently the others didn't get this far.<eos> I'm not built for that sort of thing.<eos> I'll wait for you down here.<eos> The planet is geologically unstable.<eos> This structure is inherently flexible, enabling it to withstand earthquakes.<eos> It can, but what about us?
Don't you think that first the people have to be raised, and rights should be given later?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He's Dead!<eos> Assassins!<eos> Brigands!<eos> You killed him. You killed him!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Only the ignorant fears and the uneducated frets<eos> The sage learns the nature expects to be studied, to be approached<eos> It slowly opens up its secrets you learn its laws, , and the dominating great
But who shall do the deed?<eos> Not even Bismarck knows the answer.<eos> The monarchy is in danger.<eos> We mustn't hesitate to use the Press.<eos> The intellectuals must act too.<eos> We'll have to arrest him.<eos> I'm afraid there'll be some dirty washing.<eos> I'm a scientist and we need facts.<eos> The monarchy is in danger and the monarchy's all we have.<eos> it is our livelihood.
O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!<eos> Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow, thy element's below.<eos> Where is this daughter?<eos> MAN: With the earl, sir. Within.<eos> How chance the King comes with so small a number?<eos> An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question, thou hadst well deserved it.<eos> We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no labouring i' th' winter.<eos> All that follow their nose are led by their eyes but blind men;<eos> and there's not one nose among twenty but can smell him that's stinking.<eos> Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down the hill, lest it break thy neck with following;
- do you remember any little things about the van?<eos> - it was empty.<eos> except for some papers.<eos> there was a picture on it.<eos> - do you remember what it looked like?<eos> - uh...<eos> - we're looking for this logo.<eos> we've got something.<eos> we walked cadaver dogs over the whole area.<eos> they led us to this spot, and the guys started digging.
So what is it we're doing out here?<eos> we're gonna cut down a tree.<eos> oh.<eos> god damn it!<eos> want me to give it a try?<eos> Stand back.<eos> So about the kids, Uh, one of them doesn't wanna do Any of the things I suggested.<eos> what do you mean?<eos> they're just children, kyle.<eos> If you let them do whatever they want, They'd suck their thumbs and diddle themselves all day.
- well, i-it sounds like you're very excited<eos> About this conference. - not to mention how it will look<eos> When my salary revue comes up.<eos> We could start paying for your college.<eos> - i love your dedication... To work, to this family.<eos> It's one of the reasons why i married you.<eos> - one of the many, right?<eos> - right.<eos> [harrison coos]<eos> You know, and, actually, Elliot's taking the kids fishing, So they'll be busy at least one of those days.
Their beautiful daughter hanna, and their son, uh...<eos> Spencer!<eos> - hi. - sit, sit.<eos> There's plenty of room, right, bob?<eos> - i guess.<eos> - i've been telling them about our--our morning.<eos> - what about our morning?<eos> - you know, how we visited my childhood home.<eos> I showed you the bathroom where my sister died.<eos> - kids don't need to hear any more about that- bob, they should learn to speak the truth.

But damn, it's good<eos> Eko, why don't you just spend the night here?<eos> Uh, sure.. yeah<eos> Mother, may I be excused?<eos> Ladya, try this<eos> Let me try that<eos> T astes rather unique<eos> Don't think I can finish this I 'm quite full<eos> The other guests...<eos> They never finished either
I think I saw him yesternight.<eos> Saw who?<eos> My lord, the king your father.<eos> The king my father!<eos> Season your admiration with an attent ear, till I may deliver, upon the witness of these gentlemen, this marvel to you.<eos> For God's love, let me hear.<eos> Two nights together had these gentlemen,<eos> Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, in the dead vast and middle of the night, been thus encounter'd.<eos> A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, appears before them, and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them.<eos> This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, and I with them the third night kept the watch where, as they had deliver'd, the apparition comes.
And for a robe, about her lank and all o'er-teemed loins, A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up.<eos> Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd, 'gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced.<eos> But if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,<eos> the instant burst of clamour that she made, unless things mortal move them not at all, would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven... ..and passion in the gods.<eos> Look, where he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes.<eos> Pray you, no more.<eos> 'Tis well.<eos> I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.<eos> Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed?<eos> Do you hear, let them be well used, for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time.
# All flaxen was his poll # He is gone, he is gone... #<eos> And we cast away moan<eos> God ha' mercy on his soul!<eos> And of all Christian souls, I pray God.<eos> God be wi' ye.<eos> Do you see this, O God?<eos> Laertes.<eos> I must commune with your grief, or you deny me right.<eos> Go but apart, make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.<eos> And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give, our crown, our life, yea all that we call ours,
And I don't like the tone of your voice.<eos> And we don't like being lied to, so...<eos> Why are you people always so ready To think the worst of me?<eos> You've seen My facilities for yourself.<eos> You don't honestly expect us to believe That you are running a detox clinic?<eos> Yeah, you're, uh, You're not exactly the philanthropic type.<eos> I never said I wasn't making a profit, But in return, I provide a public service.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> Wealthy parents Ship their drug-addled teenagers to me.<eos> They arrive, Their poor little bodies wracked By the best designer drugs trust funds can buy.
Although I'll be very happy to be rid of this one.<eos> Little warmer than I'm used to.<eos> That's what you get for transporting a Tunisian Fire Elemental. I have a cryo-container in the van.<eos> Magnus, we got company.<eos> Two cars headed your way.<eos> I got 'em.<eos> All right, fan out.<eos> They can't be far.<eos> Eight scary-looking dudes.<eos> They're searching the area.

Then what are you doing here?<eos> I realized I wanted to keep him.<eos> She agreed we would talk about it after the baby was born.<eos> But when I got back to the hotel room, she was gone.<eos> I knew she planned to leave the state.<eos> This is right off I-95.<eos> This is a mess.<eos> Do your parents know what's going on?<eos> Have you talked to them?<eos> When I got Crystal pregnant, - they just...
The Solomons have only a quarter of the reptiles and birds that New Guinea has.<eos> For mammals like echidnas and kangaroos, the water proved too great a hurdle.<eos> But some mammals did make it here.<eos> When it comes to reaching new islands, flying must surely have been the easiest way to get there.<eos> But the 60 miles between New Guinea and the Solomons still proved a formidable challenge for many winged creatures.<eos> With their four-foot wingspans, giant fruit bats succeeded where other fliers failed.<eos> Carrying undigested fruit seeds from New Guinea in their stomachs, they inadvertently helped sow the Solomons' rainforests.<eos> By day, these nocturnal fruit bats roost communally in the safety of the tallest trees.<eos> From the few bats that made it here, there are now 18 different species.<eos> They have become the most widespread native mammal in the South Pacific.
Every day, large waves beat down on tiny islands across the Pacific.<eos> Imposing as they may be, these have little impact on island life.<eos> But every year, much larger waves rise out of the ocean.<eos> They're generated by underwater landslides and earthquakes.<eos> Known as tsunamis, they can flatten coastlines.<eos> Yet these destructive forces may have also brought life to some islands.<eos> As tsunamis strike the coast, rafts of vegetation can be cast adrift.<eos> Perhaps animals were caught up in those rafts, too.<eos> Could this have been the answer to how these animals made it to Fiji?<eos> After all, they are the hardiest of their kind and could have survived long sea journeys.

Pacific coastal fish live and breed in the most fragile of habitats... coral reefs.<eos> But many reefs have been trampled on, smashed by boats, and even dynamited in the quest for fish.<eos> And damaged reefs support fewer fish.<eos> This could be why the fishermen are catching less.<eos> In Fiji, biologists are working with fishermen to bring the fish back by replanting the reefs.<eos> This is a coral nursery.<eos> But with wild corals already struggling, where have these coral seedlings come from?<eos> The coral gardeners monitor the reef, looking for corals that need a helping hand.<eos> Despite all this real estate, many corals end up clustered together.<eos> Crowded out, they will eventually die, so the gardeners uproot them, creating more space for some, and giving the uprooted ones a fresh start.
His bird catch is now virtually zero.<eos> This leaves more hooks free for his target species - bigeye tuna.<eos> These are powerful fish, and can weigh well over 100 kilos.<eos> It may look brutal, but the most humane way to kill one quickly is to shoot it.<eos> The future of the albatross still hangs in the balance.<eos> The birds around New zealand are benefiting from a law that states all long-line fishing vessels must use bird-friendly methods.<eos> But albatross are great travellers, so they're still at risk throughout the rest of the South Pacific.<eos> Only if all fishing vessels adopt the same bird-friendly techniques will the story of the albatross... like that of the whale - have a happy ending.<eos> Saving sharks is not so straightforward.<eos> They're not just caught accidentally... their fins are worth a fortune, thanks to an oriental taste for shark-fin soup.
Over 70 million sharks are killed every year, many in the South Pacific, where shark finning is neither outlawed nor properly regulated.<eos> This is a bigeye thresher, a shark that's almost never been seen in the wild.<eos> Shark finning is a wasteful and often cruel practice, and one that may ultimately disrupt the balance of life in the ocean, proving catastrophic for other marine life too.<eos> So how can sharks be saved?<eos> In Beqa Lagoon, in Fiji, the local people are proving that sharks can be more valuable alive than dead.<eos> Tourists will pay good money for an encounter with real live sharks.<eos> This is a community-owned reef, and some of the money goes to the local villagers... a big incentive not to kill the main attraction.<eos> Fijians have long had an affinity with sharks.<eos> Their ancestors worshipped a shark god, who they believed kept them safe from harm.<eos> They would feed sharks, not hunt them, and these divers continue the tradition.
The fishermen want to get them out of the water as quickly as possible.<eos> When starved of oxygen, a build-up of lactic acid in their muscles causes the quality of their meat to deteriorate.<eos> The fish are scooped up from the water, a tonne or two at a time.<eos> Every last fish from this school of 7,000 yellowfin and skipjack tuna is plucked from the water.<eos> With fishing techniques now so efficient, and with ever more vessels plying the Pacific, there is real concern among biologists that even the resilient skipjack may begin to decline.<eos> This vessel is not one of the newcomers.<eos> It's a Papua New Guinea-flagged ship, fishing in their territorial waters.<eos> So it is subject to catch limits and regulations that are amongst the strictest in the Pacific, designed to ensure that tuna fishing remains sustainable.<eos> But New Guinea's fishermen are concerned about the increasing numbers of foreign vessels now fishing for Pacific tuna.<eos> They were the first nation to propose that the high seas pockets beyond their national waters be declared marine reserves, as now advocated by Greenpeace.
After our cameraman left the Esperanza,<eos> Greenpeace continued theirjourney, and captured these images of the world's biggest purse seiner, with a capacity almost four times larger than the New Guinea vessel.<eos> It's a Spanish ship fishing for Pacific tuna to stock European supermarkets.<eos> The presence of such large vessels, from countries that have already over-fished their own tuna stocks, has riled the operators of local fishing fleets, perhaps with some justification.<eos> Some biologists have recently warned that tuna populations in the Pacific will be crashing within five years unless urgent action is taken.<eos> Perhaps it's time to think again about the ways we fish.<eos> These pole and line fishermen are Solomon Islanders, and this fishing is a local industry.<eos> They target specific species, and mature individuals.<eos> There's almost no by-catch - no seabirds, no sharks.<eos> And they can be selective - flicking juvenile fish off their hooks so they can grow and breed.
No other ocean has had a greater impact on the lives of so many different animals and cultures than the South Pacific, and it's all down to its massive size.<eos> The whole Pacific ocean is so large, you could fit the world's continents inside it with nearly enough room for another Africa.<eos> Ten thousand miles wide, less than one per cent is land.<eos> Best known are the Hawaiian islands.<eos> They sit 1,500 miles north of the equator, but their story was shaped by the south.<eos> The South Pacific is made up of thousands of islands united by cultures and bound together by ocean currents.<eos> Most of the land sits in warm waters, but travel south and the character of the islands change.<eos> New Zealand is not tropical but temperate.<eos> The ocean currents which cool New Zealand's waters occasionally bring icebergs.<eos> Starting in the Antarctic, they've drifted for nearly eight months on the way, passing the most southerly outpost in the South Pacific.
Most of the land sits in warm waters, but travel south and the character of the islands change.<eos> New Zealand is not tropical but temperate.<eos> The ocean currents which cool New Zealand's waters occasionally bring icebergs.<eos> Starting in the Antarctic, they've drifted for nearly eight months on the way, passing the most southerly outpost in the South Pacific.<eos> Where New Zealand's temperate seas merge with the icy waters of the Southern ocean, lies a solitary piece of land...<eos> 85 miles of wave-lashed coastline.<eos> It looks desolate, but it's not deserted.<eos> At certain times of year, there's more life here than on any other island in the Pacific.<eos> In August, after months at sea, elephant seals arrive.<eos> They depend on this island for breeding.
By comparison, animal colonisers first arrived on these shores over 30 million years ago.<eos> Yet by the 12th century, people had colonised almost every habitable piece of land.<eos> Surrounded by water, the ocean became embedded in their culture - sometimes in surprising ways.<eos> In the Banks Islands, women use the sea to make music.<eos> And their songs celebrate the creatures that live in it.<eos> No matter where people settled in the South Pacific, their survival depended on a deep understanding of the ocean and its wildlife.<eos> And one ocean event has featured in the Pacific islanders' calendar since they first arrived here.<eos> It happens on just one night a year, in November.<eos> Armed with torches and homemade nets, these islanders prepare for a harvest.<eos> They gather in the reef shallows, watching and waiting for what will soon be a flurry of activity.
As the moon rises, it triggers a natural phenomenon and a very strange spectacle the rising of worms - palolo worms.<eos> These are actually the worms' rear ends - their reproductive segments.<eos> The part with the head remains in the coral rock.<eos> When they reach the surface, eggs and sperm will mix.<eos> The tide washes the wriggling worms into the shallows where they are scooped up by the bucketful.<eos> The whole event lasts just a couple of hours, but in that time, hundreds of kilos can be gathered.<eos> Rich in proteins and fats, palolo worms are the caviar of the South Pacific.<eos> This may be a short-lived feast, but living in the South Pacific means making the most of anything going.<eos> Every year, in June, tiger sharks appear in the shallow waters around this scattering of tiny, sandy islands.<eos> They've travelled hundreds of miles in anticipation of an event that lasts less than two weeks.
They've travelled hundreds of miles in anticipation of an event that lasts less than two weeks.<eos> And their timing is impeccable.<eos> Albatross chicks are sitting ducks.<eos> The sharks may have lost the element of surprise, but their high visibility will make little difference to the albatross chicks' behaviour.<eos> Right now, the focus is on flying.<eos> For fledging albatross, that's not as simple as you'd think.<eos> The problem is the island's runway is a bit short, especially for a bird with one of the world's longest wingspans.<eos> The maiden flight often ends in a wet landing.<eos> And that's why the sharks are here.<eos> With their highly acute senses, they're onto the chicks within a few moments of touchdown.
Anuta is so small that no matter where you are the sound of the waves is ever present.<eos> Life on Anuta has changed little since these people's ancestors arrived here nearly 400 years ago.<eos> Many Anutans still spend their entire lives on this remote speck of land.<eos> Anuta's isolation has meant that the 300 people who live here have had to become completely self-sufficient.<eos> Almost every square metre of the island is cultivated to grow staple crops like taro or breadfruit.<eos> Some food will be stored in the ground - an insurance policy against cyclones.<eos> With few trees on the island, their wooden outrigger canoes are treasured items. Some have been in continuous use for nearly 150 years.<eos> Without them, these people would struggle to survive here, since it's the sea that Anutans look to for most of their needs.<eos> The men have a plan for whichever direction the wind takes them.<eos> They know the location of every one of their reefs, lining up landmarks on the island to gauge their exact position.
These chicks won't have their first splash in the ocean until they're three months old, when they'll finally set off on their first fishing trip, alone.<eos> 1,500 miles from the nearest continent,<eos> New Zealand is beyond the reach of most mammals.<eos> Marine mammals aside, the only ones that did succeed, before humans arrived, had wings.<eos> Bats.<eos> This is the short-tailed bat.<eos> It roosts in tree cavities and comes out at night to feed.<eos> So far, so normal.<eos> But these bats have been living the island life far too long not to have become a little "different".<eos> And they're not the only ones.
My dad's in the bathroom again.<eos> Mom just went to get me something to eat.<eos> Actually, they make a pretty good burger down in that cafeteria.<eos> I like cheeseburgers.<eos> Me too.<eos> They're my favorite.<eos> I think it's because when I was a kid, - I couldn't eat them.<eos> - Why?<eos> Were you allergic?<eos> My parents came from a different country, and they had a different religion and had a lot of rules.
- Why?<eos> Were you allergic?<eos> My parents came from a different country, and they had a different religion and had a lot of rules.<eos> They didn't think it was right to eat meat.<eos> Even cheeseburgers?<eos> Even cheeseburgers.<eos> Even though we lived here in America, where there's all kinds of people, all different colors and different religions, they wanted me to do things the old way.<eos> - Did you get mad?<eos> - No.<eos> I love my mom and dad, and they taught me how to do a lot of great things.

Okay, Bobby. You're gonna be okay.<eos> - Just wait here.<eos> - We can't just leave him.<eos> Just don't move.<eos> I've got questions.<eos> - Sammy, we gotta go.<eos> - No.<eos> No way, Dean.<eos> Demons heard where the sword is.<eos> We gotta get to it before they do, if we're not too late already.
- Sammy, we gotta go.<eos> - No.<eos> No way, Dean.<eos> Demons heard where the sword is.<eos> We gotta get to it before they do, if we're not too late already.<eos> Come on.<eos> I see you told the demons where the sword is.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> The angels are here.<eos> And to think, they could've grabbed it any time they wanted.
What are you talking about?<eos> Our life has been so good, and... before Trevor, I was just so worried about T.J. and Finn having a good home.<eos> And now they do.<eos> And?<eos> And... what happens if there's a new baby?<eos> You think Trevor is gonna favor the new baby over T.J. and Finn?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess, maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He loves those boys like they're his own because they are.
Here.<eos> I'm Lieutenant Colonel Burton.<eos> Sergeant Leblanc suggested we talk.<eos> Let's take a walk, okay?<eos> People always stand up for you like that?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I'm a lieutenant colonel.<eos> I'm in charge of 1,400 soldiers.<eos> For real?<eos> And they gotta listen to you?
Fine.<eos> Bye. Thanks again.<eos> So...<eos> - How was it?<eos> - Fine.<eos> {\pos(192,225)} - Did you dance?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> {\pos(192,225)}With boys?<eos> {\pos(192,225)}They are so immature, mom.<eos> {\pos(192,215)}All they want to do is see who makes the loudest fart noises with their arms.
Is that so, sir?<eos> Flew the flag every day of the year, proudly sang the national anthem at ball games.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've got to buy a new car, and it's got me thinking.<eos> There was a time I would have died happy if I'd have gotten my hands on a '69 Pontiac G.T.O.<eos> Dual exhaust, hood tachometer, hurst shifter.<eos> That's the one.<eos> Now Pontiac's out of business, and I'm thinking hybrid.<eos> - Times change.<eos> - That they do.
- but if you were to offer the people of hajipir Your water, then they could feed their families,<eos> Their children.<eos> Just like this one. and you could have peace.<eos> What?<eos> what did he say?<eos> The last thing he said there.<eos> - he said, "the line of control is insurmountable.<eos> - well, so much for oneness.<eos> - you know, i thought by this point, You'd given up, that you'd realize that These lowlifes don't want peace.<eos> They feed off of the hate.
And if you're watching this...<eos> I thought about how much you guys miss Nate, how much I do.<eos> I don't know, I just...<eos> I thought you could play this, you know, if you were really missing me one day.<eos> Mom, I love you.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry your boys are gone.<eos> Dad, uh, I still keep your dog tags next to me every night, along with Nate's and mine.<eos> Semper fi.<eos> When they, uh... when they bring me back, just have them bury me next to Nate, and that's it.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, Walter, just give me the bat, huh?<eos> Or would you rather I call the police?<eos> Now I'm gonna go upstairs, and I am gonna break every bit of glass that I can find, because you owe me for this long night's journey into dawn, for the bruises on my kisser,<eos> but most importantly for Mr. Hertz and all his bloody cars.<eos> Yeah, uh, Teddy.<eos> I walked you to your room.<eos> Hey, don't worry. It's not your fault. They were inside the room.<eos> Who are these clowns?<eos> They're the car window smashers.
Hank, this is Julie, the writer...<eos> Oh, and my wife.<eos> I just went to the hospital and all they'd tell me is that you checked out.<eos> They sent me home. So I found a private doctor.<eos> Check him out.<eos> Hot veggies, tea, and a Hank are no substitute for a hospital.<eos> The Hank tried to tell him that.<eos> Well, I'm feeling Zen, which means it's time to get back to work.<eos> Our little guys look bored.<eos> Yeah, well, they didn't just have an adventure called Zoomer and Jewel Take a Ride in an Ambulance.
Divya? I'm going to need a microscope and... A giemsa stain?<eos> I think you have a case of leishmaniasis.<eos> It's caused by the bite of tropical sand flies.<eos> One of them probably hitched a ride to America on a tree, then bit you upstairs and downstairs while you romped and frolicked.<eos> Luckily, it's treatable and you're going to be okay.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I'll go tell my wife she still has a honeymoon to look forward to.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oh, my nephews are big fans.<eos> They're over there waiting for the reading to start. Oh.
Twerps smurfs. I need a nap.<eos> Enough already!<eos> I must go.<eos> I must return the Jewel of Life to Arceus.<eos> But how are you going to get yourself out of here?<eos> I have friends as well.<eos> Thanks so much.<eos> -Thank goodness your safe, Piplop.<eos> What a relief.<eos> Oh, so they helped you out too, did they?
Believe it or not, this knucklehead actress might actually be worth it.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Good.<eos> Haley?<eos> Not good.<eos> It just sucks, you know.<eos> Everything was going so great for us, and this woman comes along and just turns our whole world upside down.<eos> I've been in the tabloids as much as anybody.<eos> They lie all the time.
This place is safest for you.<eos> We can not leave like this.<eos> - What will happen to these bastards?<eos> - Calm down. They will pay for what they did to us.<eos> I promise.<eos> No, but you do not understand.<eos> They kill children.<eos> Did you know?<eos> Héctor, Susana was not a suicide.<eos> It was an assassination. They killed her.
- We're done!<eos> - Yeah, can we go now?<eos> T.J., don't be rude.<eos> Can we go get pizza tonight like you said?<eos> Yes, yes, I think we can.<eos> Well, I guess we gotta go.<eos> But... we'd like to come visit you, if that's okay.<eos> Well, you know where to find us.<eos> Enjoy your children.<eos> They really are a comfort in old age.
That was nice of Charlie to pick up Chase last night.<eos> Oh, are you kidding?<eos> Charlie was so happy to go, he was out the door 30 seconds after your husband called. I just wish he would have come home in as good a mood.<eos> What?<eos> Well, apparently Chase's broken leg doesn't affect his aim.<eos> He shot circles around Charlie.<eos> At the firing range.<eos> - The firing range?<eos> - You know our Delta boys.<eos> They just can't get enough target practice.
Just once, i wish you would step out in front on something, just once.<eos> Okay, look here.<eos> If the three of us are gonna do business together,<eos> We all got to be more careful.<eos> We got to be smarter.<eos> We got to take our time, come up with a good plan, dante.<eos> Look, we know what we're doing, all right?<eos> Trust me.<eos> We copied the whole thing from the cartels From the ransom, the grab, the safe house, everything.<eos> We copied it just like they do it.
* Play that thing<eos> 313!<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> Hey!<eos> No.<eos> No! - It's done!<eos> Don't blame him.<eos> Tell me the dreams are true.<eos> They're true...<eos> They're all true.
Where are you taking her?<eos> Hey!<eos> No.<eos> No! - It's done!<eos> Don't blame him.<eos> Tell me the dreams are true.<eos> They're true...<eos> They're all true.<eos> There are dreamers...<eos> They meet...
Are you sure?<eos> I think i would know.<eos> you're kinda strange, six.<eos> I like it.<eos> You can ask.<eos> It's okay.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> There's nothing wrong with my eyes.<eos> I was six years old.<eos> I woke up one morning, and they'd stopped working.
- Dad!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - She's gonna be okay, dad.<eos> Ready for surgery in trauma one.<eos> Dad, I'll be out to talk to you as soon as I know anything, all right?<eos> Hey, can I go?<eos> Hey, Rudy, we got to let the doctors do their thing now, okay?<eos> Well, aren't you gonna go with her?<eos> Sure.<eos> They'll take care of her.
I let it go a long time ago.<eos> And you should, too.<eos> Just let them rest in peace.<eos> The thing is they can't.<eos> Look, I know that you're gonna find this hard to believe,<eos> But I have a gift.<eos> And so does Eli.<eos> I can see ghosts and he can hear them.<eos> My parents spirits are still here.<eos> They can't move on until we clear up what really happened.
Looks like he might have hurt Don.<eos> - There's blood and.... - Blood?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Strawberry.<eos> It's jam.<eos> Somebody's here. I gotta go.<eos> Wait...<eos> Eli, what are you doing here?<eos> Oh, uh, just looking for your parents.<eos> They're not here.
Yes, but not on that day.<eos> And the lights were off, too.<eos> And dr. milano sat behind his desk.<eos> And he wouldn't answer any questions.<eos> And so i moved right up next to him on the floor<eos> Because all my friends were telling me -<eos> Excuse me. your friends?<eos> That's what i call them.<eos> When i'm off my medication, i have friends.<eos> My father says they're not good for me.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you to the airport?<eos> But it was too dangerous.<eos> The serum had an unintentional byproduct.<eos> We had discovered that after it built up in human tissue.<eos> It reacted in a very unexpected way.<eos> It turned people into bombs.<eos> Yes.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Doctor Yusef, how many other people knew about this?<eos> Five doctors, a dozen U.S. officers, and whoever they reported to, I suppose.
Hey, looks like we may have some leads on how to identify the shape-shifters.<eos> Walter has an idea, and I have a thought about the device.<eos> But in the meantime, can you check in with Broyles, see if there's something new from the crime scenes?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Hmm...<eos> Starting your own pharmacy?<eos> You found another one.<eos> Peter says this device is streaming loads of data, and he also believes it's possible that these devices store a pattern of their last victim.<eos> Our scientists have the same theory.<eos> In fact, they thought they might be able to extract an image.
Hanging out?<eos> Slacking, you know, off?<eos> Slacking off?<eos> Are you a cop?<eos> Not technically.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Hey, we got time.<eos> And we love stories.<eos> Well, i was suffering from what the doctors called A psychotic break...<eos> Mr. Monk, they don't care.
Explain it to me.<eos> When i was ten...<eos> Nigel threw a plastic shovelat my best friend holly. It cut her rightabove her eye.<eos> I grabbed the first aid kit. I cleaned the wound.<eos> I applied antibiotic creamand put a band aid on it.<eos> Then i grabbed the shovel,hit nigel with it,and started the processall over again.<eos> That's what i call full service.<eos> It was a great day.<eos> It was the day that i knewi wanted to practice medicine.<eos> When i told my parents thati wanted to attend med school,they told me what they wanted. A daughter withan mba from wharton who would become vpof development and acquisitions at katdareproperties international.
I heard there was an FBI field office which appointed themselves solely responsible for investigating the blackout.<eos> If there's another office or agency that had a vision of this investigation and has more information than we do, let me know...<eos> And I'll send 'em our case file.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Problem at my daughter's school.<eos> So what were they doing when it happened?<eos> They were playing Blackout.<eos> It's the same kind of role-playing that we saw after 9/11 and Katrina.<eos> Sorry, I-I can't believe she's all that different from the other children.<eos> Well, the other children-- they're talking about what they saw, just like the rest of us.
Until I cracked the encryption.<eos> See, this... here... here's what the government doesn't want you to see, man.<eos> Come. Look.<eos> This... Construction sites working around the clock installing generators and water filtration systems. And... and...<eos> There's a word for that.<eos> It's called government pork. Oh, no.<eos> All this construction is goin' on underground.<eos> Under, beneath the eyes.<eos> The eyes of the world, man.<eos> They don't want you to see.
It's exciting.<eos> OK.<eos> Let's pretend there aren't any bunkers.<eos> - There aren't any bunkers.<eos> - You're a horrible liar.<eos> In these bunkers that don't exist, there's going to be panic.<eos> - Who's panicking?<eos> - The special people.<eos> And you know what you could use?<eos> A familiar face from the media. A face that they trust.
When the chips are down, they're all you have.<eos> All in?<eos> Wait.<eos> I don't even know your name.<eos> It's Victoria!<eos> We don't have time for this!<eos> We're gonna make time. Now, you tell me who's behind the game!<eos> I work for some nasty guys. They don't exactly have an H.R. Department.<eos> It's my job to knock their targets out.<eos> If you hadn't taken that pill, they would have killed me.
This is one of them, so I suggest you back off.<eos> Sorry, but backing off...<eos> not exactly my strong suit.<eos> Where's Oliver?<eos> I prefer to make my own luck.<eos> I guess your luck hasn't run out.<eos> I'm disappointed.<eos> You lack the killer instinct after all.<eos> Toss the gun.<eos> True gamesmen... they don't cheat by stacking the deck.
She's an up-and-comer from the central valley.<eos> Please put that down.<eos> Anything to the rumor Kristin was having an affair with Batson's husband?<eos> Elliot Batson.<eos> He's Melinda's chief of staff.<eos> We've heard the rumors.<eos> Everyone denies it.<eos> - There's no evidence anything happened.<eos> - Media seem to think there is.<eos> Wanna get me started on what they believe?
Sergeant.<eos> Colonel O'Neill, sir.<eos> I'm retired, Kawalsky.<eos> Lose the salute.<eos> Me and Ferretti didn't tell them anything.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Hey, those kids on Abydos saved my life, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Those kids...<eos> I mean, they're the whole reason we kept it secret.
"The faintest ink is better than the best memory. "<eos> Come on.<eos> We've failed before.<eos> Okay, we really looked for advantages.<eos> One of them is, phone calls happen every day.<eos> A telegram's a big deal.<eos> Something like, "She's getting married.<eos> "Are you really just going to give her a call?"<eos> Sounds like you're talking to her parents.<eos> They should really be at that wedding.
Would they attack you?<eos> I knew it was just a matter of time before you started with the questions.<eos> I bet you have a nightmare where you end up in Sing Sing, right?<eos> Everybody does.<eos> - I do.<eos> - So what's it like?<eos> You're outnumbered, but you got the power.<eos> Kind of like being a king.<eos> - Except your subjects want to kill you.<eos> - Maybe, but they don't, 'cause they know I'm dangerous, and I got a badge, which they respect.
Shabbir.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Mushtaq, sir.<eos> - Hi Mushtaq.<eos> I'm Ramesh. - And this?<eos> Kabir.<eos> - He's called Kabir formally, sir.<eos> His friends call him Kuku.<eos> Where did you meet these boys, Maahi?<eos> Papa, they are my friends.
We must be hand in hand.<eos> My beloved shouldn't be annoyed with me.<eos> I have found God.<eos> What can I do, Sushma?<eos> Even that lawyer is doing nothing much.<eos> If there was a way of finding out, he would have known by now.<eos> He doesn't know anything.<eos> After all it is about his daughter.<eos> Just pray that wherever the kids may be, they may be safe.<eos> They shouldn't face any problem.
In the last few months, he has fulfilled his responsibilities..<eos> ..entirely as an adult. He hasn't fled from his responsibilities, your honour.<eos> He took complete care of Maahi.<eos> In fact, he truly loves Maahi.<eos> The love that my daughter received from Kabir..<eos> ..maybe I couldn't give her that through her life.<eos> Your honour, if someone is guilty in this case, it's me.<eos> These children came to me with their petition. They asked for help and a way out.<eos> Due to my stubbornness, I pushed them into such trouble.<eos> If they would go through some accident through this.. ..if there would be a misfortune, who would be guilty?
When Fletcher was supposed to be in the Arctic.<eos> Looks like Mr. Wheeler was in on the scam.<eos> Okay, I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause clearly, you're pretty good at it.<eos> Listen, I realized that Fletcher was faking it when I discovered that the pictures in his promotional booklet were photoshopped.<eos> So, you figured you'd make a few bucks rather than, I don't know, protect your students?<eos> No.<eos> I know this sounds crazy, but the kids were learning.<eos> Fletcher loved those kids and they loved him.
What "guy"?<eos> This guy, sanchez -- He's a ghost.<eos> Runs his whole business from afar.<eos> Can't find him.<eos> That hasn't stopped him from putting together the biggest smuggling ring on the west coast.<eos> Drugs, guns, counterfeits --<eos> And it all goes through a warehouse somewhere.<eos> What about following the stuff he's shipping out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe. But, man, my guys -- They only know what they do.
You'll be fine.<eos> But it's true, right?<eos> You doubting me?<eos> No, I'm psyched to be a part of it.<eos> I just want to hear an answer, a yes.<eos> Here it is, brother - Yes.<eos> Two friends of mine flew in from oregon yesterday and made a little care package for Mr. Darnell wallace, c. e.o. Of the 28th street true-blue lokes.<eos> Homeboy will not know what hit his black ass a.<eos> Your friends gonna stick around for the fireworks?<eos> No, they're halfway back to bend.
She got to L.A, had a joyful reunion with her mother, and then had to go through the trauma of finding her dead.<eos> I mean, I'm not surprised she's a little shaken up.<eos> Did you just tell me Violet is Sydney's daughter?<eos> I'm not a little fuzzy from my two rum and cokes?<eos> They wanted to get to know each other better before they told people.<eos> Riley, in our own little personal slasher flick here, this is the part where the audience stands up and starts screaming, "Um, hello?<eos> She's the killer!"<eos> I ran from the police because of what happened back home.<eos> My parents who adopted me weren't exactly Brad and Angelina.<eos> Did they hurt you?
You don't want to know, it's...<eos> It's not exactly party chit-Chat.<eos> Well, I've never really been very good at, uh,<eos> Chit-chat.<eos> Last spring...<eos> My parents' car drove off of a bridge<eos> Into the lake.<eos> And I was in the backseat<eos> And I survived, but...<eos> They didn't.
Gonna need full benefits.<eos> Fine.<eos> Good.<eos> When we gonna do this?<eos> Oh, baby, sorry I'm late.<eos> Been busy?<eos> Uhm, yeah.<eos> Say, we got a, er...<eos> We got a, er... Got a tip about a stash house, right...? We took it down...<eos> I gotta say, babe, working with these guys, they really know what they're doin'.
Meth... Ecs...<eos> So you do know him?<eos> Yeah, he's an informant of mine.<eos> So you go after a dude like Tumi, but you let a supplier like Isaiah operate?<eos> Isaiah feeds me information.<eos> He's more valuable to me on the streets than he is in jail...<eos> And as soon as that changes, well, uh... We'll blow him out too.<eos> So why did Tumi say Isaiah was pulling your strings?<eos> You gotta give these fools their pride...<eos> I let 'em think they're calling the shots, for now...
The battle's gonna torch half the planet.<eos> Look around you, man.<eos> half the planet's better than no planet,<eos> Which is what we have now.<eos> If i could do it over again, i'd say "yes" in a heartbeat.<eos> So why don't you?<eos> i've tried!<eos> I've shouted "yes" till i was blue in the face!<eos> The angels aren't listening!<eos> They just...
- The head.<eos> - I was a head, you know.<eos> And I said I would do it.<eos> I started doing it and I could have as much gear as I wanted, which was all I was interested in.<eos> The funny thing was... this is what I noticed first of all when I got into it... was everybody else was into making money, except me.<eos> I mean, me and Timothy Leary, you know.<eos> I believed that this was a revolution of consciousness and there was gonna be an evolution taking place.<eos> And we were gonna find out all these discoveries about the brain and the future and how to be high and stay high and how to be magical, how to live in the world in this sort of new way.<eos> But all these other characters basically were into bread.<eos> They made money and I ended up just becoming just another criminal like them because of force majeure.
No... I'm done.<eos> You got any last words?<eos> Any thoughts?<eos> - I'm tired.<eos> - Yeah, you have a sleep, mate.<eos> I'm sure you'll pull through.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> - The doctors said...<eos> - Oh, Dave... don't listen to what the doctors say, mate.<eos> What do they know?
First of all, We don't have the same father.<eos> Secondly, our Norwegian parents agreed that they wouldn't keep in touch.<eos> And thirdly...<eos> My brother's father, he was a terrible man.<eos> And our mother had to suffer because of him.<eos> Who wants to remember that?<eos> Could you pass me the soy?<eos> But what about you?<eos> Did you agree that you should forget each other?<eos> They never asked me.
Well, yeah.<eos> They are.<eos> It's, uh, conductivity is vastly superior to other coolants. Why?<eos> Well, that chamber was pumped full of radiation.<eos> Yeah, that's why we use the shield.<eos> The cooling pipes are inside the shield.<eos> Could--couldn't that affect the water?<eos> I just talked to Manlius.<eos> Your water isn't the problem, But the isotopes may be.<eos> Now, could they be affected when the water is exposed to radiation?
Yeah, like, um, high school.<eos> Oh, man, that was a long time ago.<eos> Um, I guess like every other high school kid.<eos> Dumb as dirt.<eos> Thought I knew everything, really knew nothing.<eos> I mean, but, you know, there... there are some high school kids that are mature, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they think they are.<eos> I mean, but, come on.<eos> How mature can they really be?<eos> They haven't done anything.
What I worry about has changed, but... I'm still worrying.<eos> I'm gonna need you to stay very still.<eos> Okay.<eos> And what good has all this worrying done?<eos> None<eos> With or without it, my kids are doing just fine.<eos> What did you make?<eos> What did I make?<eos> Oh, I happened to make your favorite.<eos> They're happy
Week?<eos> It was amazing.<eos> stop blocking your face.<eos> you're making meself-conscious.<eos> Your face,it is powerful and soft... like you.<eos> What do you know about me,except for my inabilityto read a map?<eos> Your expressions--it tells me many things.<eos> For example...your brow,your jaw... sarah,you're a womanwho's in control.<eos> You like control.<eos> Your eyes and your smile... they say something different.
(lf God created humans,) (and they created robots.)
Hey, what's wrong?<eos> What happened?<eos> Hey.<eos> There was a man.<eos> A shadow man.<eos> He disappeared.<eos> phillip.<eos> Hi.<eos> The kids aren't here.<eos> They--they went over to sadie's.
I-i'm st taking a quick shower and heading back to work.<eos> What?<eos> i just got here! Now you're turning around and leaving?<eos> Really? daddy, i have a murder!<eos> now where are you going?<eos> Charlie, it was sweet of you to stick up for me, but --<eos> I'm not ready to go home yet. Well, i guess i'm just a chauffeur, come here to take charlene home.<eos> Charlie, you can't stay here.<eos> your parents -- No, my parents don't understand me at all.<eos> My dad thinks i'm still 8, and my mom -- they just --
[ sighs ] I stayed with her for a while.<eos> Did you?<eos> Something special about a woman's body When the life... drains out of it.<eos> There's a quiet there that's... Soothing.<eos> That's everyone?<eos> You're absolutely sure there's no one else?<eos> No, 16 is all.<eos> People, that is.<eos> You don't want to know about the cats or dogs.<eos> I mean, they were just practice, really.
Life is good on Bannerman Road, even if you sometimes have to work at a weekend.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to see me on a Sunday, Mr Yorke.<eos> No problem, Miss Smith.<eos> Nanotechnology is the science of molecular engineering.<eos> This is where we grow the nanoforms... our microscopic engineers.<eos> Please.<eos> Robots.<eos> Too small to see with the naked eye, but with the potential of giants.<eos> Incredible.<eos> One day they will build us anything we want, everything we need from simple atoms.
These guys know what they're doing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> I can understand vandalism escalating into violence, but that's usually gradual.<eos> And assault, a single murder maybe, but come on, this?<eos> This feels fully evolved.<eos> September 3rd, 15 luxury cars had their windows smashed.<eos> September 14th, a new upscale clothing boutique was vandalized.<eos> September 24th, two different restaurants, both catering to a wealthy clientele, had their front windows smashed and their interiors torn apart, and finally, October 1st, a newly renovated townhome was ransacked before the family could move in.<eos> So they went from attacking public property to a private residence, but no victim.
Because of the physical nature of the murders and the amount of control these unsubs exert over their victims, we believe that these unsubs are large or at least extremely physically fit.<eos> And they have a pack mentality.<eos> Canvass the local bars and restaurants.<eos> See if there's a group of men who fit this description.<eos> And these men will be obsessed with the media coverage.<eos> Any chance to relive their crimes.<eos> So stake out the past crime scenes.<eos> There's a good chance that they'll revisit them.<eos> They most likely come from troubled backgrounds, broken homes, youth detention centers.<eos> They probably bonded over their anger.
Mmm.<eos> Only if they can prove that any of my followers aren't true believers.<eos> Well, you seem pretty confident that they all are.<eos> Take a look around. Keep an open mind.<eos> You might find yourself moved.<eos> Come on. I'll show you around.<eos> So, other than you, I've only seen 2 other men your age here.<eos> Mm-hmm. Those are Chris and Ken.<eos> They helped found the church.<eos> When our boys turn 16, we encourage them to explore the world, though they're always welcome to return.
"lines of influence, dominance and suasion."<eos> Go on, Sweets. Just let him go on.<eos> So we can look at the community as a single dysfunctional personality, dealing with sexual infidelity, indebtedness, resentment...<eos> That's what I just said.<eos> Both of you - it's murder, okay?<eos> We're either dealing with money or sex here.<eos> That's what I just said.<eos> And this is where psychology can provide an insight that anthropology cannot.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> Well, suburbanites will not only lie to outsiders, they'll lie to each other and to themselves.
The evidence indicates that we caught the murderers.<eos> Yeah, I believe you did catch the right people.<eos> Okay, then what's your problem?<eos> Motive.<eos> James Perry was angry that Kurt poisoned the dog.<eos> Elliot Lindbergh was ripped off for $5,000.<eos> Right. My problem is, all these motives were a long time cooking, right?<eos> These weapons- a sign, the hedge trimmers, kicking him- all suggest... heat of the moment, right?<eos> Not premeditation.<eos> So you want to know why they all snapped at that precise moment.
It's all been paid for.<eos> Oh, but you -- you can't go without me.<eos> Oh, I'll just drop joel at home, And I'll e-mail you some pictures -- yeah.<eos> Oh!<eos> Have a nice murder.<eos> hey.<eos> We bought massages?<eos> In the seven weeks doris osgood spent impersonating a nurse In order to care for charles billings, She forged her signature on 23 checks<eos> In all, she managed to steal almost $55,000.<eos> Uh, billings had five grown kids, Uh, but none of them noticed the theft Because they were ripping him off, too.
Nowadays,they frankenstein bacteria witplants. Makes them resistant tto aphids and stuff.<eos> What was bixton shooting for?<eos> Well,you know how coris hard to digest,right?<eos> Yeah,because of the cellulose.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Well,bixton's scientists found a bacteria that eats the cellulose,theh clostridium dermacellum. Se.<eos> So,they added one of its genes to the corn's dna sequence,<eos> So that the co would expresses a protein that breaks down that cellulose.<eos> So,they made digestible cn.<eos> Exactly,but then they obviously ran into a problem.
Nayak's patient files are gone.<eos> The server at the data-storage facility was wiped some time within the last 24 hours.<eos> Can we trace the hacker's I.P. address?<eos> We don't think there was one.<eos> There's no sign of a D.D.O.S. attack, and given the level of online security in the facility, we think whoever wiped the files must have had a password.<eos> So it was someone in the clinic?<eos> It would seem that way.<eos> It's not possible.<eos> My employees are good people.<eos> They've all worked here for years.

My name is... my name isn't Adler.<eos> I'm Rufus and Lily's son.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I hope everyone's policies are paid up, because it looks like we're on a collision course.<eos> My parents told me I was adopted in middle school, but it wasn't until this past spring that I decided to find my biological parents.<eos> And when I told my folks of my intentions, they said that they'd ready spoken with them, and they wanted nothing to do with me.<eos> They lied to you, Scott.<eos> Rufus and Lily went looking for you, and your parents said that you were dead.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> Yeah. They said you were killed in a boating accident.
Now, if I could just get a look at the actual car.<eos> Abbs, I need to see the inventory of Arnett's personal effects.<eos> Hey, boss. Got to know if he had a rail pass.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you record the serial number?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, McGee.<eos> Boss, we know that Lieutenant Arnett had inside information on McAIlister Industries' stocks; we also know that Will Sutton made $2 million the day after the contract was announced.<eos> The SEC tried to connect both men, but they couldn't.<eos> What if they took the same train to work every day?

- Her?<eos> For the last four years, that slot has been filled by Mossad Liaison Officer Ziva David.<eos> - Mossad.<eos> - Mossad.<eos> - And, uh, NCIS...<eos> - That's right.<eos> the organizations responsible for the deaths of my men.<eos> Oh, geez.<eos> Well, all I can say is, if we killed them, they must have been bad guys.<eos> They were martyrs for the cause!
Jimmy...<eos> Thanks,guys.<eos> Seeing your kid brother die right in front of you...<eos> So he's upset about his brother's death,and blames it on the people who sold him drugs.<eos> And now he's out for blood.<eos> Guys,that middle man leon mentioned,john torres, his name comes up in connection with the steele brothers.<eos> The steele brothers.<eos> I've heard that name before.<eos> Yeah,real up and comers.<eos> They allegedly run the coke trade this end of town.

Indoor pool, got to fuck, fuck.<eos> Sauna.<eos> Fucky, fuck.<eos> Go upstairs, champagne glass, bubble, bubble, fuck, fuck.<eos> If you're still going at 5:00 in the morning, open the closet.<eos> There's a ball gag and a swing.<eos> I told my parents I got the gig there, and my mother- they're 83 at the time- goes, "We're going with you!<eos> I've always wanted to see that place."<eos> Now I'm in the woods with my 83-year-old parents.<eos> They are in one fuck hut.

Many congressmen said that they felt the problem was created by those who- those sons of bitches who didn't read their mortgages.<eos> Um...<eos> Who ever has?<eos> You don't read your own mortgage.<eos> That's why we have lawyers.<eos> You hire a lawyer or a paralegal.<eos> Or if you're really broke, you hire somebody who's fucking a paralegal.<eos> But you're not gonna read your mortgage.<eos> That's why we have lawyers.<eos> They study a language for three years that- and they learn it, and it's a language that if a normal person read it, they'd have a stroke.
I know what an area rug is.<eos> It's a rug that covers an area.<eos> If I spent $87,000 on an area rug, that rug should be woven from the pubic hair of virgins.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I should have a leather-bound book with photos of the women who contributed to my rug, and I would keep that leather-bound book in my credenza.<eos> The big argument now is, how do we regulate capitalism?<eos> Should we?<eos> There are many people who still argue that there should be as little regulation as possible.<eos> And I say that those fuckers are full of shit.<eos> And the reason that I say that- and I will not argue with them or discuss it with them, or when they talk, I go, "Ahh."
And when you're young, son of a bitch, there's nothing better than hope.<eos> Really, it's the best drug there is.<eos> There's no better drug than hope.<eos> That's for sure, and I tried them all.<eos> But I'm 60, and fuck hope.<eos> I mean, to be honest, I'm not even sure I believe in Bob Hope.<eos> Hope was the greatest thing on Earth when I was young.<eos> Hope's what allowed me to craft a little basket, and I filled it with my dreams and my visions of all the things I wanted to be and I wanted my country to be and I wanted the world to be.<eos> And my father and mother said,<eos> "Take that down the street, "and those folks down there, they'll help you.
- All I'm saying is the white boy was chalk ready when I got there.<eos> - Right.<eos> And you could have called it in, done your civic duty,but you opted for the cash and prizes, which makes you a candidate for some jail time,Willie,my man.<eos> Oh,this is such BS,man. How do you steal from a dead guy?<eos> Sorry I'm late. The sitter was stuck in traffic.<eos> Whitesnake,huh?<eos> Baby threw up on everything else.<eos> So,what is all this?<eos> Flack got one of the suspects to turn on his peeps.<eos> NYPD rounded them up as well as all the evidence they stole.
Hey,looks like three of your prints got hits.<eos> Yeah,but which one's our shooter?<eos> Well,we could use the car door as a scale.<eos> Create a ratio and then determine the height of the shooter.<eos> See if it matches one of these three jokers.<eos> 54 inches.<eos> So,the height of our shooter is 1. 36 times the height of the door. So,that's about 70 inches.<eos> And that puts our shooter at about five foot,ten.<eos> Well,that rules out these two mutts. They're both over six feet.<eos> Yeah. They may have helped strip the car.
Really? That's great. Maybe we can rebook the church.<eos> But I'm over you.<eos> Over me?<eos> Our wedding was yesterday.<eos> I'm still in the tuxedo.<eos> I don't live in the past.<eos> Yesterday. 12 hours.<eos> Sorry. I made up my mind. And once I'm done, I'm done.<eos> That's why you've never heard about my past boyfriends.<eos> It's because they don't exist for me once I'm through with them.
(KIDS CHATTERING)<eos> JESS:<eos> Lunches.<eos> Pop, pop, pop. Hey, hey, hey, come on over here, boys.<eos> Come over and give me something.<eos> (SCREAMS) Go get them.<eos> Bye, Dad. Hurry up. Catch them.<eos> Catch them now! Go get them!<eos> Daddy, they got Pop Warner practice after school today.<eos> Okay, you take your brothers, and I'll make sure they get a ride from Mrs. Turner, all right?
This is Dr. Cal Lightman.<eos> He's a deception expert and he works along with the police in the United States. In the United States, yeah.<eos> - This is Mexico.<eos> - No, I knew that.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Um, now, I saw some news footage, and I think that the bartender at Marla Seeger's hotel is giving false information About her disappearance.<eos> Dr. Lightman, there is no case here.<eos> Ok?<eos> We spoke to several resort employees.<eos> They said she seemed unstable, more than likely a drug user.
Rader and Foster busted a drug lab.<eos> He's saying she's brilliant and has... All right, keep it to yourself, huh?<eos> Uh, Lou from the embassy asked me to stick around...<eos> Lou from the embassy?<eos> That's Lou from the embassy. That's nice.<eos> Yeah, he asked me to stick around for a couple extra days.<eos> So I said yeah. Is that all right?<eos> And here I was thinking we were happily married.<eos> The two techs were making designer fentanyl in the hospital lab.<eos> They were using the blood as a means of transport.
Give her a bell? Let her get some flavour?<eos> What, like start a message then be like, "Stop it, Julio - grab your own cocaine.<eos> "I've got too much tit in my mouth"?<eos> Exactly. Gosh, everyone's going mad for the lasagne.<eos> Who knew? Your mates are loving the tuna!<eos> Yeah. They're not my mates.<eos> Gatecrashers?<eos> What, they're just some men who forced their way in here and are eating my lasagne?<eos> Dude, it just means we're a hit.<eos> Jeremy, they weren't invited. If there was no-one here but us and them, it would be a police matter.
* I like you so much better when you're naked *<eos> * I like me so much better when you're naked, yeah * * whoo *<eos> - Excuse me. [sirens]<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Trying to get to work.<eos> Hey, what's up with the cop convention downstairs?<eos> - Oh, didn't you hear?<eos> Team of undercover detectives raided a crack house Early this morning, and there was a shootout.<eos> Four men were killed.<eos> - Who were they?
- You didn't tell me.<eos> - Chris...<eos> I'm just really upset and confused right now.<eos> So I kind of just need to press the pause button for a second--<eos> - Stop, veronica.<eos> Just stop.<eos> I need to-- I gotta talk to you.<eos> How is your parents' insurance?<eos> - What?<eos> - They need to make sure that their policy is paid up.
She is the mother of the groom.<eos> She would be willing to help you with some of this.<eos> Yeah, yeah, she would help me, and then she would rub it in my face.<eos> If I ask Nora for money, it's like nothing's changed.<eos> After all these years, I'm still dependent on William Walker's money.<eos> You're gonna land on your feet.<eos> I promise.<eos> And it's not like this is the only thing that the kids need help with.<eos> What else do they need?<eos> They have an apartment.

I meant in the future.<eos> They're starting a life together.
His mistake is mine.<eos> I have to kill him.<eos> He is like my brother.<eos> What do you think I will do to you if I have to kill my brother?<eos> You will fix your mistake.<eos> No.<eos> It is for him to do.<eos> How much, darlin'?<eos> I've got the results on the DNA from the rape kit, three males, one of whom was the driver of the crashed car.<eos> They all belong to a specific ethnic group.
No.<eos> Can you tell me what happened?<eos> I'll try.<eos> There were three of them.<eos> Foreign.<eos> They woke us up.<eos> OK, so these three men, what do they want?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Well, they must have said.<eos> I mean, they they said they wanted Mr. Polat's money.
It's summertime, birds are singing And the crickets play with dew,<eos> One ear seems deaf to you.<eos> Sometimes both, all two.<eos> So true...<eos> Children grow up around you Each one grows clever, too.<eos> They have homes and good jobs start, Then their children steal your heart.<eos> Your grandchildren are precious bloom That inherit life and overcome doom.<eos> Think the world of them, my friend, From now till the ruthless end.<eos> Even though you have no choice And get weary of their tinkling voice,<eos> Follow your thoughts, old and wise, For they are your next lives.
How to have sex...<eos> How to protect themselves... this kind of things.<eos> This is education nowadays.<eos> Thank God they don't teach our cows the same thing, otherwise they wouldn't reproduce...<eos> I'm happy my children and grandchildren love me.<eos> How could we not?<eos> Yes, they only have one grandpa... one great-grandpa.<eos> -One grandpa.<eos> -And great-grandpa.<eos> They always ask "How's grandpa doing?"
I see why you went with gang execution.<eos> Chinese gangs were at war back then.<eos> Lot of casualties.<eos> This kid was a good student.<eos> I couldn't find the connect.<eos> Which gang came out on top?<eos> Dragon Boys.<eos> Gun-toting punks prided themselves on having no limits.<eos> Extortion, kidnapping, murder....<eos> Well, they still running things?
He never understood.<eos> Jack never understood.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You're using Dad's trucks to ship heroin.<eos> I know when and where.<eos> I'm just making a little extra money for the store.<eos> So Dad knows?<eos> We already pay hundreds of dollars a week to those punks.<eos> Why shouldn't we get a piece of the pie?<eos> Because they're lowlife criminals, and we're not.
THOSE HALF HIDDEN<eos> In the 17th and 18th centuries, family portraits were in fashion.<eos> In these paintings, the man sits with his wife in his home surrounded by his children.<eos> The children were always depicted as small, grave-faced adults.<eos> Like their parents, they stare out of the paintings at the viewer.
Unless you have a better idea, Kristoffer. No?<eos> In view of the tragic event that took place in Trollhättan it's been decided that we are to observe a moment of silence for those who died in the fire.<eos> Would everyone please stand up.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Thank you for showing your respect.<eos> You may now be seated.<eos> Yes, Emma?<eos> I just want to say I think it was terrible, those kids dying.<eos> It could've been us.<eos> They didn't get to live their lives.
Melinda: previously on "ghost whisperer"....<eos> Zoe: that book is the key to everything. The book is always changing.<eos> new things are written, old things are erased.<eos> You know, carl said that aiden Would have powers that i don't.<eos> What if that means seeing things things that i can't, Things that are real?<eos> Tell them why your friends shine.<eos> Because they don't have faces.
Aiden, what are you doing?<eos> Playing.<eos> Playing what?<eos> teacher.<eos> Is that the teacher?<eos> Who's not supposed to talk to him?<eos> You.<eos> Who doesn't want me to talk to him?<eos> Well, my friends.<eos> They say the shadows don't like it when you do.
You've been a loyal and trusted member your whole life.<eos> That's why I want to ask a favor.<eos> With Edgar gone, will you do me the honor of being my right-hand man?<eos> Or should I say men?<eos> The honor would be all mine.<eos> Good, 'cause I need you to start by retrieving some files from the apartment of a Mr. Noah Bennet.<eos> They'll be in a box marked "Primatech. "<eos> Who should I give this to?<eos> Do I get to use my friends?<eos> I think they will lend themselves very nicely to the job.
Please make it-<eos> No!<eos> - Tell me what happened.<eos> - Don't come any closer!<eos> - Okay, I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> What happened to your parents?<eos> - I killed them.<eos> I was angry, and I just- I touched them...<eos> And they died.
- Not what?<eos> - A virgin?<eos> Wow!<eos> We could not be more different.<eos> Maybe we're strange attractors.<eos> - Strange attractors?<eos> - It's a physics thing.<eos> Everything in the universe has a magnetic charge, right?<eos> So strange attractors are particles that end up together That don't really belong together,<eos> But when they're together, they're super-powerful.
In my defense, i was sort of hating you at the time<eos> Here, let me...<eos> Don't help me<eos> - Betty, don't be like that - you know,every single time<eos> I think there is a glimmer of A decent person in there You always seem to prove me wrong<eos> And now, i have go back to the office just like a hot dog Where everybody all already thinks i am a joke<eos> Thank you<eos> Close the door, please.<eos> Why do we have to Accept that our loved ones are gone<eos> They are with us, always
are youstill angry with me?<eos> I wasn't angry.<eos> I'm justsensitive about... our past.<eos> Sometimes,I think I made mistake.<eos> You were married,I was married.<eos> It's sad,but... that child hadno place in this world.<eos> people always ask mehow I got involved with an organization that helpstibetan refugee children.<eos> They usually say I'm in itfor the tax break,which I am.<eos> but the real reason-- my heart goes out tothose motherless children.<eos> They have no oneto fight for them,and that'swhat a mother does.

It's like he became... this guy, Leo.<eos> And he started a whole new life... and family.<eos> A family?<eos> Yeah, he was living, uh, with this woman named Anna.<eos> She had two young boys.<eos> For how long?<eos> Two years.<eos> He just bounced back and forth.<eos> I didn't know about them.<eos> They didn't know about me.
If you were growing up in the '60s, '70s and '80s, you could go to the movies, listen to the radio and music and you could play pinball.<eos> And now here we are 20 years later and if you wanted to relive a song that you remember from your youth, you can put it on your iPod.<eos> If you remember a movie that you particularly liked as a kid, you can get the DVD of it.<eos> But when it comes to pinball, since it only exists in the real world and can't be digitally duplicated, there is no place to play pinball and yet in everybody's mind they remember those games from their youth.<eos> And they come in here and they see something that they haven't seen in 25 years.<eos> Something that was a major part of their youth.<eos> "The first time I kissed a girl I was playing this machine."<eos> And they see that and they just get this look on their face of pure nostalgia.<eos> Kids today don't really understand pinball.<eos> They come in looking for the Dance Dance Revolution machine or the fighting video game or the really fast driving game.
Run and gun.<eos> Ball's coming down.<eos> Boom.<eos> You just pound away and just do it.<eos> It's pure adrenaline.<eos> It is pure reflex.<eos> It is the spontaneity of that reflex.<eos> Now what you have are players who control the tempo of the game.<eos> I see it with my sons, in all honesty.<eos> There are times when I stand back and marvel at the fact that they have the ability that they have.
We were ready to go again.<eos> That's what I want to do and I'd barely really gotten started.<eos> It seemed silly to only do it once.<eos> You can have a great game. Next game look like you never played in your life.<eos> There are a couple of people who are high-quality players.<eos> Very focused when they play, tough to beat.<eos> When they have an off day that's the day you hope you have your on day.<eos> Because they don't have off days very often.<eos> In the final rounds, players put up huge games.<eos> Just because of the situation, they rise to the occasion.
Oyster Bar's good, right?<eos> It's got three stars in the thing, and it's quiet -- you can hear people.<eos> Too much sugar.<eos> You want to have something with at least 25 grams of protein.<eos> Okay?<eos> Probably should have picked a place with a buffet. This way, you're up, walking around -- less eye contact. You should probably smell better than you usually do, too, okay?<eos> Ah.<eos> Condoms.<eos> No. Condoms?<eos> Yeah, you remember condoms, Joe. They go on your dick. This is not gonna end up in sex.
Okay,lindsey,you take social services, find out what they did on this case.<eos> Walter,you're with lindsey.<eos> Everybody else,we're going back to that school.<eos> Uh,what if they won't talk to us?<eos> 'Cause I thought that P.K. S don't talk to anyone outside their own circle.<eos> Li talked with dana.<eos> Somebody will talk with us.<eos> Parachute kids-- I-I've heard the term, but all of the kids here at lincoln rhodes have registered guardians.<eos> From what we hear,those guardians may not be doing their jobs.<eos> They're doing fine in their classes.
my sister was murdered.<eos> That's right.<eos> We think we know who did it.<eos> Mei.<eos> That's who we're trying to find.<eos> We kw it wasn't you.<eos> Grace,please.<eos> We're fine here. Okay?<eos> Quon,think about your parents,all right?<eos> They've already lost one child.
You don't understand.<eos> My sister and I are P.K.S.<eos> There are people who take advantage of that.<eos> They kidnap us and ransom us back to our parents.<eos> You thought she was kidnapped?<eos> I thought maybe someone grabbed her,then she tried to escape.<eos> Did you call your parents?<eos> No.<eos> I couldn't face them.<eos> They'd blame me for not protecting li,and they'd be right.
It's mei'S.<eos> It was on the ground.<eos> We thought it was one of the things that fell out of li's purse,but it wasn'T.<eos> Li must have ripped it off your neck right before you killed her.<eos> I warned her.<eos> But she wouldn't listen.<eos> she never listened.<eos> I just wanted to go home.<eos> she came from a small town,like I did.<eos> She said all the right things to my parents, and they believed she would keep us safe.
Maybe they know.<eos> Maybe they know that you are with me.<eos> They too are sharing my joy.<eos> earlier too, the breeze would blow.<eos> But the ambience wasn't so alluring.<eos> AII the sceneries were present.<eos> But they were never so attractive.<eos> Maybe they know that you are with me.<eos> Maybe they know that you are with me.<eos> They too are sharing my joy.
This is a period of vast Greek expansion and colonization.<eos> The Greeks themselves, in Homer's day, wanted to go out into the world for many solid, economic reasons but also because they were simply curious.<eos> Odysseus selects his 12 best men to explore the island with him.<eos> Just before he sets off, he grabs one last item, a goat skin full of wine.<eos> It will prove to be a life-saver.<eos> Priority number one for the explorers is to find something to eat.<eos> Just offshore, the men hit the jackpot.<eos> They come across a cave filled with food.<eos> Only one thing is missing, the cave's owner.<eos> When they get into the cave, Odysseus' see wonderful stores of food and they're ready to steal it and take off and get out of danger.
The winds are the motive power of ancient shipping, so this is a very great gift because the winds can bring you home.<eos> For nine days and nights, the Greeks sail straight for Ithaca aided by favourable winds.<eos> Finally Odysseus is on his way home.<eos> He stays awake the whole way working his ship round the clock.<eos> On the tenth day Ithaca appears on the horizon.<eos> But in the last mile, fatigue finally overcomes the hero.<eos> As Odysseus dozes, his crew seizes the chance to find out what's in the mysterious bag.<eos> His men immediately decide "there's gold, there's silver, there's treasures,<eos> "and Odysseus doesn't want to share it with us."<eos> They want it for themselves, so curiosity tinged with a bit of greed leads to their undoing.
You don't have to explain.<eos> Perhaps when you are King... things will be different.<eos> This is horrible.<eos> So disgusting.<eos> Well, perhaps you'll think twice about lying to me in future.<eos> - There's something on your face.<eos> - Where?<eos> - It's magic.<eos> - What about the druids?<eos> They help people like you.
Face him. How do you like that?<eos> You know, you really are a schoolboy.<eos> You know that?<eos> You just...<eos> Now, we're gonna do exactly as the kidnappers have asked.<eos> That is the best way to insure that your sister will get home safely.<eos> But we're gonna do one thing.<eos> We're gonna put this small transmitter in the suitcase.<eos> Why?<eos> - If they fail to return her this is the best way to follow them.
Life's like that, it goes so quick you don't even notice.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Been to see your dad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'm expecting a client.<eos> Do you live with your mother?<eos> My uncle and aunt.<eos> They look after you, do they?
Just get out of here.<eos> You don't need that.<eos> You don't know what I need.<eos> Seriously, it's best if you just... leave.<eos> You want to throw away all your progress for a stupid drink? What progress?<eos> In a few weeks, I'm going to be in jail, so none of this even matters.<eos> Don't talk like that.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm a drunk with a record who can't even convince his own friends he's innocent.<eos> Who cares what they think?
Did any of the accident victims work overtime the week before the Lakeshore crash?<eos> I don't recall.<eos> Any of them routinely put in for overtime?<eos> - I don't recall.<eos> - Are you married?<eos> I don't re... Oh, I'm so sorry, Ms. Conley.<eos> I've got three clients who lost their husbands.<eos> Must have been a Freudian slip.<eos> The truth is, these three employees had gone 24 hours without rest when this accident occurred.<eos> No, no, they worked hard, sure, but...
Why it's especially for me<eos> That is the king's law he hates the magic better than anyone.<eos> That's what you think what's been happening to me<eos> The dreams, the fire, you think it was the magic.<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> But it could be, couldn't it<eos> I really don't know, but there are people who do.<eos> Who<eos> What about the druids.<eos> They help people like you.
Come on!<eos> There!<eos> I can't go on.<eos> We won't leave you behind!<eos> Please!<eos> They're coming.<eos> We had Lady Morgana!<eos> I was... I was so worried about you.<eos> You were right.<eos> It was the druids, they kidnaped her.
You mad woman, how dare you insult the Captain?<eos> Captain, please leave now!<eos> These two robbers are dangerous.<eos> You're in cahoots with them!<eos> That's not true!<eos> Captain!<eos> Take a good look, Captain.<eos> Look, these two robbers are so ruthless.<eos> I've been in charge of this village for over thirty years...<eos> And I've never come across anyone as brutal as they are!
Not the lurid, pulp fantasy They drilled into this unstable mind, But something more insidious,<eos> More than millions,<eos> And has cost me Everything.<eos> This hearing is adjourned until further notice.<eos> Senator, look over here!<eos> Daniel!<eos> Daniel!<eos> Daniel, please.<eos> Madeline, these men are from the fbi.<eos> They need to speak with you.
Daniel!<eos> Daniel!<eos> Daniel, please.<eos> Madeline, these men are from the fbi.<eos> They need to speak with you.<eos> No.<eos> Echo's just gone.<eos> And we're certain she wasn't apprehended with perrin?<eos> My sources say no.<eos> They don't have her.
So, did you get to the stuff I sent you?<eos> You know, there's not a lot to see.<eos> I mean, there's a serious dearth of data in these files, which is why I began looking for answers in the desert.<eos> That was on Larry's desk, right?<eos> He's got me babysitting it. - He's a restless soul, huh?<eos> - Sure is.<eos> Sort of like your three victims.<eos> Like everyone, they move through the city leaving trails, forensic data, marking where they've been, like ATM visits, cell phone calls, credit card purchases.<eos> But serial killers are very opportunistic;<eos> They choose victims where they see victims, like around where they live or around where they work.
Type? O-positive. Matches our boy.<eos> Same as a hundred million other people.<eos> A hundred million other people didn't get shot with a .223 round this morning.<eos> I pulled this out of the wall over there.<eos> All right, well, check the hospitals.<eos> - A bleed like that you're gonna have to take care of fast. - Okay.<eos> We got 20 witnesses, 20 different stories.<eos> Here's what we know for sure:<eos> three robbers, four FBI agents.<eos> They got two of ours, we got two of theirs. What about Wilson?
Using Newton's laws, they have to figure out how each star's gravity acts on each one of the others to determine where each star's position will be at the next point in time.<eos> Number 1.<eos> These students would need to work for 300 years nonstop to do what a supercomputer can do in one second.<eos> Calculations for galaxy clusters ramp up to millions, even billions of "N" bodies.<eos> But fortunately, supercomputers are increasingly available to astronomers eager to simulate the past, present, and future of the universe.<eos> The current state-of-the-art supercomputers are actually off-the-shelf computers that you and I use at home, desktop computers. The only thing is we put them all together.<eos> They're easy to build, they're cheap to build, so there's many available.<eos> Among the most complex of the current simulations is the Millennium Run in Europe, where 10 billion galaxies were manipulated in a supercomputer, running continuously for 28 days, utilizing 343,000 processor-hours.<eos> One result is a remarkable 3-D fly-through across 2.4 billion light-years of space, showing hundreds of millions of galaxies clumped together in clusters along vast strands of dark matter.<eos> Using supercomputers, scientists not only study the past, but they can predict the future of the universe.
We lived, four of us, on eight sq. M. For nine months.<eos> That was enough...<eos> So it has taken ten...<eos> Eleven years to get to this stage.<eos> And now...<eos> Now it will be taken from us.<eos> Is Helgi back home?<eos> - No.<eos> Those politicians have never been responsible for anything they do.<eos> That's just the way it is although they will not admit it.
What is left, really, is just dead men.<eos> The horrors of war were first exposed in the precursor to The Lord of the Rings,<eos> The Hobbit.<eos> The story culminates in a battle of five different armies, all vying for the dragon's treasure.<eos> The main character, Bilbo Baggins, sees many of his companions killed on the battlefield and comes to understand the futility of war.<eos> Like Bilbo, Tolkien himself watched his companions die in battle.<eos> In France, he fought alongside three of his oldest and closest friends.<eos> But by November of 1916, two of them were dead.<eos> It seems obvious, when one reads the story where you have comrades in arms facing a seemingly insurmountable foe, in the fear that they feel and the sounds of the battle approaching.<eos> They know they're going to tested and probably die that night and so on, and yet the way they find a way to express both humour and courage and to keep each other's spirits up in a time like that seems to be drawn directly from his battle experience.
for the first years of their marriage, she submitted to his torture.<eos> look for wives who came into the e.r. repeatedly and with obvious signs of spousal abuse, but you are gonna have to go back about 5 years.<eos> that's because around the time of the first abduction, the visits stopped.<eos> the sexual sadist can't find satisfaction from a willing participant.<eos> he eventually got to a place where he couldn't escalate his violence against her without killing her, so she made him a deal.<eos> he gets to kidnap, rape, and kill each of the runaways, and she gets to keep the children.<eos> she's been giving the victims a series of prescription prenatal drugs.<eos> so you're gonna want to look at the obstetric fields, uh, nurses, o.b.s.<eos> the wife needs these children.<eos> at first, they were the lifeline that kept her alive.
she's great.<eos> she was adopted by a young couple.<eos> no reports of physical or emotional trauma.<eos> so when can we take her?<eos> right now we're in touch with her adoptive parents' lawyer, but the law is on your side.<eos> can we talk to the parents?<eos> we could discuss this with them.<eos> they don't want to initiate contact.<eos> they've been through a lot right now.<eos> they're her parents.
we profiled there'd be a type they'd keep and a type they'd put into foster care.<eos> they're keeping the boys.<eos> it's time.<eos> julie:<eos> what are you doing?<eos> ! hey, where are you going?<eos> come back!<eos> you have to come back!<eos> you're not actually-- yes...i am.<eos> they never stay for this part.
Denver.<eos> I don't see any ponchos,<eos> Which means either the kids don't wear them<eos> Or the ones who do wear them disappear.<eos> We're doing the right thing.<eos> I support manny no matter what.<eos> Children need to know that you believe in them.<eos> It's the most important thing.<eos> If you tell them they have wings,<eos> They will believe they can fly.
So, uh... do you need a ride to school?<eos> Nope.<eos> I have a ride.<eos> With that guy you been hanging out with?<eos> Um, Jasper... is that his name?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> I don't know, he just... seems a little sketchy, that's all.<eos> Do you even know him?<eos> No, but...<eos> He doesn't hang out with the West Beverly kids because they're all judgmental lemmings... like you.
Why would you give me immunity?<eos> Believe it or not, I don't think you're the brains behind this operation.<eos> Playing on my vanity.<eos> Please, you have some video that proves nothing.<eos> Search warrant helped us find this in a townhouse of one of your puzzle girls.<eos> I think that proves something.<eos> Well, if you're asking for my expertise I can tell you that a crime like this often has a benefactor.<eos> The entire operation, from delivery route to exit strategy, is handed to someone.<eos> Tell me something I don't know.<eos> Men with privileged information often hire people with certain skills to do what they can't.
It's a buyers' market, so this place is steel.<eos> And the owner's wife died, so he's motivated.<eos> I'd be surprised if another agent doesn't already have an offer.<eos> Um, what's that smell?<eos> Probably the neighbors.<eos> I hear they love to barbecue.
Why are you laughing?<eos> Do you think this marriage will not happen?<eos> It will happen.<eos> Stay here and watch how it happens.<eos> He's our guest, take his luggage.<eos> - Yes boss.<eos> I wanted to kill men here but now I'm getting welcomed by them.<eos> Whatever it is, we must be careful from our side.<eos> - Okay boss.<eos> We trust them, but do they trust us?
Opened two days ago in the name of Leah Baisley. His daughter.<eos> Christ.<eos> He's bargaining.<eos> He's blackmailing Perrot.<eos> This is him sending Perrot his account details for him to transfer the money into.<eos> It's suicide, Perrot's men will kill him.<eos> Does the account have an address?<eos> 15 Dreydon Road, Camberwell.<eos> You start talking.<eos> Look, I just want a bit of what they have.
As part of nbc's annualgreen week initiative,has to reduceits carbon footprint. I'm putting youin charge that effort. Global warming, sir?<eos> I'm sorry, that's justa bunch of scientist talk. Same peoplewho'd have you believe that my greatgrandfatherwas a monkey.<eos> If he was a monkey, then whywas he killed by a monkey?<eos> You're preachingto the choir, kenneth.<eos> I mean, I love the earth.I have these rarekadupul blossoms flown in every morningfrom sri lanka on a private jet.<eos> That's the definitionof green.And yet they force usto do more.<eos> More sacrifices.Why?<eos> For the children.<eos> What have childrenever done for us?<eos> Well, they makeour shoes and wallets.
Today we consider freedom of speech a cornerstone of our Constitution.<eos> but in the 18th century, talking this way could've gotten you killed.<eos> This forced the Masons to meet secretly in taverns and basements.<eos> - The Masons are talking about democracy or liberty or<eos> - self-determination or free speech. - Well that could be perceived asa a threat to an aristocracy - to a king, to an emperor, to a Church that has power.<eos> The book depicts our forefathers wanting to establish a new country on the principles of scientific advancement, not religious dogma.<eos> That is also TRUE.<eos> But were most of them were Deists as the novel describes?<eos> - The religious beliefs of the founding fathers was generally deistic.<eos> - They believed there was a God,
I'm not guilty, your honor.<eos> I'll hear the people on bail.<eos> Remand, your honor.<eos> The defendant is a flight risk with no community ties.<eos> Your honor, my client has not had the good fortune to be married, but is that any reason to incarcerate him?<eos> No, but three counts of murder are.<eos> I'll remand the defendant.<eos> The parents of this city will sleep better tonight.<eos> Oh, well, you know what?<eos> They shouldn't, because the real criminal's still at large.
With what?<eos> You. [chuckles] [chuckles] And now...<eos> Don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I can show you.<eos> I can show you exactly what i did to them.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Children are so precious.<eos> So clean.<eos> But they need guidance.
Apparently I have the ability to he whoever I want. So does he.<eos> Doesn't mean you have to do what Fife's asking you to do. It's still your practice.<eos> Yeah, if he's being such a jerk, why don't you just tell him off?<eos> I can't.<eos> He's in that chair. What?<eos> I know it doesn't seem right, but telling off a man who's... it feels wrong.<eos> Can't.<eos> Then I think you should go to the little people.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> They're your patients now.
If we'd agree on these proposals I've jotted down-<eos> Mom!<eos> Mom!<eos> -Someone's taken our toys!<eos> Ah, another thing I wanted to discuss.<eos> I made an informal assessment of their development and they are retarded...<eos> developmentally speaking.<eos> Boys at their age need constant nurture to grow into healthy individuals.<eos> -You took away their toys? Toys promoting violent behavior, stunting their cerebral growth.<eos> They'll go nuts if they don't get their toys back!
I just add your name to a list, and you get one delivered.<eos> There has always been a link between us, hasn't there?<eos> Eh...yeah, sure.<eos> [Salvation Army]<eos> Good day to you.<eos> -Can I help?<eos> I need clothes in the current style.<eos> A jacket, a shirt and blue nankeen trousers.<eos> The shoes are very important.<eos> They're named Buffalo.
That will have to wait. - Do it voluntarily Or else we will arrest you.<eos> Yesterday you said that no civilians were killed at the village.<eos> According to Thomsen 3-2-Alpha reported otherwise.<eos> Yes, but that turned out to be wrong.<eos> - You had lost three of your people.<eos> Maybe you focus elsewhere. - What was the soldiers' explanation?<eos> They had received a message from a patrol in distress behind enemy lines.<eos> They argued that had been a Danish officer, Perk.<eos> He was under fire.<eos> They had come to his rescue.
And it's gorgeous.<eos> He's a genius.<eos> Annie's my inspiration.<eos> Jasper, what else do you do besides filmmaking?<eos> Uh...<eos> Not a whole lot.<eos> And who are your friends at west bev?<eos> Well, it's... pretty much just annie.<eos> Yeah, 'cause the kids at west bev suck.<eos> All right, they're all
Two guys, they got out, ski masks, both with rifles, bang the driver, bang bang the guard, then make off with 900 grand.<eos> - So what do you think?<eos> - I can't believe Anderson got reinstated.<eos> - He shot his own partner.<eos> - Any fingerprints?<eos> No, nothing. The cab was clean, the doors.<eos> They were probably wearing gloves.<eos> Open the meter.<eos> Pardon me?<eos> Well, you said the armored car was running late, if they didn't want draw attention to themselves they were probably feeding the meter.
- What... what story? - It doesn't matter!<eos> He's a bear!<eos> You're probably wondering what we're doing here.<eos> Here's what happened.<eos> See, an armored car was robbed, and the guard was killed, and the police recovered some shell casings from the crime scene.<eos> And if they could match them to the casings found in that clearing, they'd have an airtight case.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And those two men... they weren't hunters, they were killers.<eos> They must've been target practicing up here, and someone must've spotted them.<eos> That's why they came back. 'cause they knew that those shell casings could tie them to the crime scene.
Alpha, do not do this.<eos> There's a part of you that knows this is wrong.<eos> There are many parts of me that know that this is wrong.<eos> None that care.<eos> And six That just find it funny.<eos> You know what's not funny?<eos> Is that she actually cares about these guys.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> She loves.<eos> But they're just using her.
Thank you.<eos> Wouldn't want to end up in the attic.<eos> But this is the attic.<eos> Rossum's been watching me closely Since I moved here to tokyo<eos> Ningyo kaoku.<eos> Have you seen my friends?<eos> I thought I saw them, but I was imagining it.<eos> But I do think they're really in here.<eos> Well, I wouldn't worry.<eos> I'm sure they're enjoying themselves.
You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?<eos> Me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid ass whales.<eos> When all the whales and dolphins are gone, people are going to wish that at some point, they took the time to care just a little goddamn bit!<eos> I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be<eos> I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree<eos> I heard you're looking for people who care about the slaughter of whales!<eos> Butters, you wanna help?<eos> No. I got stuff to do.<eos> But I wanted to tell you, there's these fellers on TV.<eos> They go out in the ocean and try to stop the Japanese wherever they are! Really?
Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Look, I think I can make everything OK here.<eos> Can I just use a phone?<eos> Dude, are you sitting at your computer?<eos> I need you to do something for me.<eos> Mr. Prime Minister, Japanese officials...<eos> There's something you need to know.<eos> The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored.<eos> Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they simply pointed the finger at somebody else.
Homie!<eos> You two are going out?<eos> I thought I told you the Flanderses were coming over to dinner.<eos> Sorry, I have a tea party at Janey's.<eos> And I'm having a stink bomb party at the house next to Janey's.<eos> No connection.<eos> I guess it'll just be dinner for four.<eos> Hi, Ned.<eos> Where are the boys?<eos> They're grounded.
Doctor said she just had a severe case of dehydration.<eos> No worm.<eos> She wasn't infected.<eos> She says they came for work and a better life.<eos> She asked if we're gonna arrest her.<eos> I told her we're just here to help.<eos> I didn't know you spoke cantonese.<eos> Get to know me a bit.<eos> She says she doesn't know.<eos> The men on the boat... they knew.
That's fine.<eos> I'm just glad you didn't end up inviting more of the motor...<eos> What the***?<eos> - What the hell?<eos> Give me some warning.<eos> - I saw a quail.<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> You snooze, you loose.<eos> I think this is gonna be a really good bonding sesh for me and Ron.<eos> Guys love it when you can show them you're better than they are at something they love.
And you know what? We like it!<eos> Yeah,we like bein' fags!<eos> So go ahead,america. Whenever you pass by harley riders like us, roll down your window and yell 'faggots'!<eos> All you kids out there,when you see us,walk up to us and say 'hello,fags!<eos> No,really.<eos> We want you to. At least we're cool enough to embrace who we are.<eos> Right,guys?<eos> - That's right!<eos> Come on fags,let's roll out!<eos> And that,mr.Editor,is why they are the true definition of fags.
Seems to be some kind of burn on the interior surface.<eos> Get that to Hodgins.<eos> Just up ahead.<eos> That's it.<eos> Right there.<eos> Pull over.<eos> - Booth? - Yep.<eos> Santa's cohort is inside that house.<eos> These men use explosives.<eos> They want to destroy the Federal Government. Shouldn't we call in backup?
What did lance corporal Lozada guard around here?<eos> Um...<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Here.<eos> This way.<eos> He guarded a day care center?<eos> This isn't a day care.<eos> This is our intelligence testing center.<eos> You test the intelligence of these kids?<eos> No, they test ours.
I'm ready, mr. Norvell.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Mistakes.<eos> Would you care to elaborate?<eos> First, the sun.<eos> It's almost 30 degrees, Directly into our troops' eyes, Blinding them while concealing the bad guys on the rooftop.<eos> Go on. They should never have been In an open, exposed area like this plaza.<eos> It gives the enemy gunners a clear, Unobstructed angle of fire.<eos> Yeah...<eos> But they were headed to rescue a unit under attack.
I live with my-- with our-- Two children in a three-bedroom apartment<eos> At 3001 n. Dearborn street.<eos> And is there room for mr. Florrick there?<eos> Yes.<eos> And should he be granted a pretrial release, Are you prepared to have him at home?<eos> Um... Do you want him there?<eos> I think Peter should be home with his children.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, you mentioned the apartment Is a three bedroom, and you have two children.<eos> Would they share a room?
in other words, strictly political and economic motives for the bankers and the politicians.<eos> Once you've granted that power to a group<eos> -- the Federal Reserve system -- the economic crisis was inevitable.<eos> This has happened before.<eos> Every time in history when the government was given the power<eos> -- or a group of banks in conjunction with the government -- was given the power to expand the money supply at will, those economic systems always wound up in crisis and always collapsed.<eos> So there's no reason to believe that the United States was given some kind of a "get out of jail free" card, an exemption from the processes of history.<eos> So the economic crisis began at the very beginning and, as a matter of fact, when the founders of the Federal Reserve system met on Jekyll Island back in 1910, and were drafting the... the Federal Reserve Act,<eos> one of the things they discussed was how to pass on the inevitable losses to the taxpayers.<eos> They knew that inevitably something like this would happen and they knew that there had to be some way to... to get out of it without destroying the banks, of course, because they were the banks, and they said,
They're due to the old guy, and I'm cleaning house and I'm gonna bring in a new team, and don't blame us for the things we've inherited."<eos> Can't say, "You know, those policies of the past, that came before were insane,"<eos> because you've got the guy that was one of the key architects of those policies.<eos> People need to stop having allegiance to their political party.<eos> They need to have allegiance to the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and what has made our Republic so special:<eos> the basic human rights and dignity that every citizen of this country inherently has.<eos> Not because it's some right given to us by government, but because our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, enshrines that these are inalienable rights given to us by God, that we inherently have as sentient, free, conscious beings.<eos> But instead the public cheers on the Republicans as they win or cheers on the Democrats as they defeat the Republicans.<eos> It's an endless, staged, gladiatorial event.<eos> Special interests own both parties and they project this false left-right paradigm up as like a movie screen and behind that, behind the throne the establishment is able to control our society and engineer it into this high-tech police state.

It doesn't cost them any money.<eos> And if they do make a mistake because they're, as George Bush said,<eos> "Oh, the bankers on Wall Street are drunk."<eos> Yes, I'm certain.<eos> There's no question about it.<eos> Wall Street got drunk.<eos> That's one of the reasons I asked you to turn off your TV cameras.<eos> Let's say they walk in one day and they push the wrong button and they loose the bank a billion or 5 billion or 100 billion, they can appeal to the government to bail them out.<eos> It's a totally asymmetric relationship between bankers and the rest of the economy.<eos> If they make a mistake, they get bailed out.
It is unacceptable to me that that goes on.<eos> Behind me the Federal Reserve is probably the least transparent agency in the federal government.<eos> One could even argue that the Central Intelligence Agency is more transparent than the Federal Reserve.<eos> The fact is, is that the American people want to know more of the "secrets of the temple", as the book was, before you were born:<eos> The Secrets of the Temple.<eos> The Fed, as you know, is just a monopoly by the bankers.<eos> This is simply putting the foxes in charge of the hen house.<eos> Personally, I'd be in favor of Congress just nationalizing the Fed.<eos> And... and getting the bankers out of there.<eos> They're... they're, you know, they're just stealing from the American people.
We're all tribal to an extent; that's why we even bother to vote for a tribal leader.<eos> This is well understood.<eos> That's why we're supplied with these leaders.<eos> And because the... the average man was to become more disengaged from his own destiny as the expert class arose, it was decided that... that the males would get the... their... their outlet basically, being... gradually becoming helpless as... as males through sports.<eos> Therefore they'd have a tribal team they could identify with;<eos> they could cheer them on as they were winning.<eos> In their own personal lives, they were getting nowhere;<eos> they were getting disenfranchised, in a sense, as experts took over decision-making for them in all kinds of fields.<eos> So this was psychology at use, planned before they even implemented the sports.<eos> When radio came along of course they... they used that to the maximum.
]<eos> You mean George Washington?<eos> [Oh yeah!<eos> ]<eos> Paul Revere?<eos> [Yeah!<eos> ] These guys right here...<eos> Let me ask you something:<eos> Did they try to scare people?<eos> [Oh yeah.] They tried to intimidate the British.
It helps to talk about it.<eos> Look, i don't want to talk to you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> And i'm late for practice.<eos> I can see why he's so popular.<eos> You just got something off that car, didn't you?<eos> Good car.<eos> I think those kids are harassing officer ramsey.<eos> You're sure it's not the other way around?<eos> How can they harass him?
Right, and this time the patterns were overwhelming,<eos> Like a giant neon arrow pointing at the next job.<eos> If your numbers say it will happen here, I'm sold, charlie.<eos> Well, that's the thing...<eos> Uh, they don't say it'll happen there.<eos> What?<eos> I pointed out to charlie<eos> The big arrow was pointing directly away From the charm school boys original target-- The federal reserve shipments of old cash.<eos> And so then I asked myself What if the new robbers Had studied the old robbers' tactics?<eos> Could it be at all possible That they were anticipating our methodology-- choosing banks Specifically to divert our attention
I'm supposed to ask what the most important thing is, right?<eos> That nothing happens to wesley's uncle.<eos> Should a piano fall on his head, worse things fall on yours.<eos> I mean, that was a little bit funny, right?<eos> Bloom wouldn't even listen.<eos> Wouldn't even listen. I mean, it was like Being in the, uh...<eos> In the '60s<eos> All over again.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> We'd marshal arguments, and they impugned our patriotism.

I mean, it was like Being in the, uh...<eos> In the '60s<eos> All over again.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> We'd marshal arguments, and they impugned our patriotism.<eos> They hated us Because we stood up against the establishment.
Lying lands right here.<eos> Smack dab in front of me.<eos> When it comes to lying, I'm your man.<eos> That makes Dr. Lightman very special.<eos> So, since you dragged me away from my work, who can tell me what a lie is?<eos> When my mom tells my dad he's not getting a big belly?<eos> Yeah. Right.<eos> We learn to lie from grown-ups.<eos> They think you don't notice, but you do.
Now the target of the entire might of the central pacific fleet.<eos> Seven of us are assigned to all the explosives.<eos> Our job is to shuttle them ashore to the troops whenever they are needed.<eos> So instead of actually fighting, it looks like I'll be the man behind the man behind the gun.<eos> It's damned frustrating.<eos> I want to be in the action.<eos> While Werner's group waits behind with extra ammo and explosives, the rest of the 7th infantry division will assault the southern section of the atoll and the 2-mile long Kwajalein island.<eos> The fortress island, guarded by 5,000 Japanese defenders, hosts a formidable array of fighting positions and bunkers.<eos> Our men's mood is one of expectation and some tension.<eos> They know that new combat is ahead of us and that our enemy will be fought under new, perhaps tougher, circumstances.
Fuck Babe Ruth."<eos> Try to piss us off, hope we fire at them and give away our positions.<eos> Les tells me, if I see a Jap, to use my knife, and go for the throat.<eos> We keep pushing forward, but theses grasses are so thick and barely go anywhere.<eos> Rookie Marine Nolen Marbrey and his veteran comrade<eos> Les trudge deep into the jungle of New Britain.<eos> Marbrey has survived his first several nights on the enemy held island.<eos> He and his platoon are now setting out on their mission.<eos> The objective is to secure a nearby hilltop where Japanese observers are calling down artillery on the surrounding area.<eos> We are falling behind the tanks, and they blast our path forward with round after round of shells.
Within the past hour, our army and navy announced new air blows against the Japs in the north and south...<eos> But the base will be of no use, unless we can get the supplies to it...<eos> In the months following the Tarawa battle, final casualty reports of almost 1,000 Marines killed and more than 2,000 wounded, prompt Americans to ask why so many had to die invading such a tiny atoll when it could have been bombed into oblivion.<eos> The implications of all this are enormous.<eos> At the same time, the Marines edit the footage shot by Norman Hatch and his team, turning it into a documentary film.<eos> But the pictures are far too graphic to meet the standards set by Hollywood producers and distributors.<eos> Only president Roosevelt can grant permission for its release.<eos> To help him make a decision, the President seeks counsel from the only man who was there that he personally knows and trusts, Robert Sherrod.<eos> I tell the President the truth.<eos> Our soldiers on the front want people back home to know that they don't knock the hell out of them every day of every battle.
I translate for my captain, telling them if they walk to the rear of our lines and turn in all their weapons and maps, they'll get hot food.<eos> Then they can find their own way home.<eos> An outburst of emotion sweeps through their ranks.<eos> They start swarming over us with pictures of their wives, mothers, children.<eos> Some even try to hug us or at least shake our hands.<eos> These men want no part of the war.<eos> They wanted to give up as fast as they could with minimum problem.<eos> They were begging us for food.<eos> Most every one of us gave our food, whatever we had.<eos> They had absolutely nothing.
Of that, I'm very proud.<eos> What is the greatest generation?<eos> The greatest generation was everybody who worked hard to provide the means by which we were able to win this war.<eos> The greatness encompassed the country as well, the whole country.<eos> It's all of us, not just the military.<eos> The spirit of man has awakened. The soul of man has gone forth.<eos> Grant us the wisdom and the vision to comprehend the greatness of man's spirit that suffers and endures so hugely for a goal beyond his own brief span.<eos> We are all of us children of earth. Grant us that simple knowledge.<eos> If our brothers are oppressed, then we are oppressed.<eos> If they hunger, we hunger.
I'm coming down out of the clouds.<eos> There are mountains in front of me.<eos> I'm on the east side of the black alps over German-occupied Yugoslavia.<eos> We have two aircraft down, but that's the least of our problems.<eos> Now we have to find a way to get out of here with our lives.<eos> We're looking to find out where we are.<eos> When we see guys in German uniforms, with rifles at the ready.<eos> So we stopped.<eos> And we both had sidearms of .45 automatics.<eos> But, hey, they already had theirs aimed at you.
I make it to the raft, and I glimpse back at the ship.<eos> And there she goes, the Samuel B. Roberts.<eos> We're all crying like babies.<eos> We can only see a few yards because of the waves.<eos> Makes us feel like we're all alone.<eos> I feel something brush against my leg.<eos> A man nearby screams: "Sharks!"<eos> I look at the German prisoners we have with us.<eos> Our only option is to surrender.<eos> Now we're the prisoners and they are our captors.
Maybe I should've said yes, but there's just no spark.<eos> Spark is overrated.<eos> You and richard had spark.<eos> It turned into a wildfire that consumed<eos> Four lives and blackened 12 years of marriage.<eos> Why don't you start acting like an adult?<eos> Why?<eos> What do adults do?<eos> They're practical.<eos> They-they value things like companionship
They're limiting the amount of beer each fan can take to 24 cans a day.<eos> That's a serious restriction.<eos> LAUGHTER<eos> That's practically tee-totalling, isn't it?<eos> This rivalry between Ford and GM, it's ingrained from birth, isn't it, in all Australians?<eos> It's pretty deep seated.<eos> They were the two main manufacturers, if you're my age, when you were growing up.<eos> It was, you know, the General Motors product which was Holden, Commodores and Toranas and for me it was Falcons.<eos> I said to the two guys, the two Aussies who are here in the audience somewhere,<eos> I said "Eric Bana's coming on," they went "Ah, Ford bloke."
Ha! Ha!<eos> That's the most amazing road I've ever seen.<eos> Built in the Seventies, this is the Transfagarasan Highway.<eos> 6,000 tonnes of dynamite were used to make it.<eos> And 40 lives lost.<eos> But from above, it looks like every great corner from every great racetrack in the world has been knitted together to create one unbroken grey ribbon of automotive perfection.<eos> ENGINES ROAR<eos> This is what we came here for!<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Our cars had done motorways and city centres and gypsy villages, they'd been slept in and written on, but now they had a chance to let their hair down.
Ohh!<eos> Mom, are you okay?<eos> No, it hurts like hell!<eos> So looks like my plan to bring the kids closer hadn't worked the way I wanted.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Stop laughing.<eos> That was awesome, Mom.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry, Mom, but that was hilarious.<eos> And when you fell down, you rolled through dog poo.<eos> But I had given them a story they were gonna share and enjoy long after I was gone.
If you hadn't helped me that day, I would've been...<eos> Sanim!<eos> Dogshit!<eos> Pigshit!<eos> Sanim!<eos> Sanim!<eos> Our goal is to find the Jaguar Gang, destroy them , and rescue Pie .<eos> When we met you, we knew immediately that you were the type of girl the Jaguar Gang wants.<eos> You were supposed to get kidnapped and sold to them.<eos> All we had to do was follow your kidnappers and they would take us to the Jaguar's lair.
You look very nice.<eos> What else?<eos> - Uh...<eos> - What about my shoe?<eos> They're nice, too.<eos> How you think my house smell?<eos> Not oniony?<eos> You good man.<eos> I pat you on the head and feed you from the hand.<eos> And then he made me clean out the fridge in the employee lounge, and the employees were mad at me Because I... I threw out food that they still wanted.
Because I reckon you're quite cute when you're drunk.<eos> Who's that?<eos> I went to school with him.<eos> A friend?<eos> He lives next door to me.<eos> He stopped speaking to me when we started secondary school.<eos> Did he give you a hard time?<eos> Every morning when I woke up, I felt sick just thinking about it.<eos> I told my parents and the teachers.<eos> They knew it was happening.
Why are you all dressed like retards?<eos> There's a meeting in the community centre tonight.<eos> You should come along and find out.<eos> All of you.<eos> Right. Cool.<eos> See you there, buddy.<eos> He used to be a right headcase.<eos> Bring your friends.<eos> This is weird.<eos> They need our help.
"Go ahead, say it, say it."<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The only problem I have with my girl sometimes are her friends.<eos> I don't like her friends, 'cause they're haters.<eos> [scattered cheering] They are.<eos> Look, the guy's clapping.<eos> Yeah, I know, man.<eos> It sucks.<eos> Every time I leave the house, and I go out of town for the weekend, they show up, and they start throwing little monkey wrenches in there, you know.
- Yeah, it's a learning curve... You don't have to get your way to feel enfranchised.<eos> What actually comes of... giving people responsibility for decision making is that they really care about the decisions of the minorities within a group and that people are very willing to compromise and that compromise is easily achievable once everybody's cards are on the table<eos> and people can really understand the viewpoints at work.<eos> Democracy is a lot more than majority rule on a nightly basis.<eos> The technology is becoming possible for millions of people to have a conversation.<eos> The assumption... that people will be included is spreading so widely and so deeply. That, I think is going to be a big driver of governmental change.<eos> It's not just when it becomes an option for people in elected office but also an expectation of their constituents.<eos> It's just that now we have a mass consumer technology that supports this, so... we're only now beginning to discover what we can do with it.<eos> In a country where voter turnouts are pretty low lots of people believe that politicians don't really work for them.<eos> Lots of people feel that nothing they can do matters or in any way has any impact at all... it would give citizens a lot more power if they knew a lot of stuff that was currently hidden or effectively secret.

- Are you crazy?<eos> - It'll be an adventure.<eos> Some things are more exciting on the spur of the moment, don't you think?<eos> No...<eos> Not when they involve meeting your parents.<eos> Jack, I would have to get myself together, and...<eos> Alice, you're perfect as you are, and we could be back by... Monday morning. I know nothing about them.<eos> I'm...<eos> What if they don't approve of me?<eos> They'll, uh... They'll approve of you... when they see you with this.
Bankers rule, and the bankers set up these institutions.<eos> They set up things modeled on the Royal Institute for International Affairs,<eos> Chatham House, and the Milner Roundtable of the period right after the Boer War.<eos> So even before World War I, you had the British setting up these roundtables, institutes, with publications and conferences.<eos> And this is how they make policy.<eos> Upon Obama's inauguration, members of the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission and CFR flooded into every position of power in the Executive Branch replacing Trilateral Commission and CFR members who previously filled the positions during the Bush administration.<eos> When you look at the US ruling class, you'd have to say that they're a really pathetic bunch of failures and bunglers.<eos> They are a miserable excuse for a ruling class.<eos> And that's one of the big problems we have, is you go from Clinton to Bush to Obama.<eos> What stays the same is the ruling elite that gives these puppets the orders that they act on, and these orders are wrong-headed, let's say, to say the least.

They're the ones who have cut off the liquidity in the market.<eos> They told us to have a debt-based economy, then they cut it off once they get us under their thumb and implode the economy so they can consolidate it.<eos> That's what they're doing right now.<eos> I mean, it's in their own documents.<eos> It's in their own statements.<eos> They claim, "Give us unlimited power.<eos> Give us trillions of dollars of the banker bailout bill," that's already five trillion dollars, not $850 billion as they say. And, and, "We'll get the economy going."<eos> But they're hoarding the money and buying up other banks that aren't part of the Federal Reserve, buying up insurance companies, buying up roads, infrastructures, media empires, defense contractors.<eos> What the banks do is they implode an economy by cutting off credit and then once things really fall to a low<eos> (and they know the low because then they buy everything up) and start then putting more money back into the economy, and then they build it back up.
So, Obama is meant to be the savior during the depression and he'll save us with a million person<eos> (he said as big or bigger than our military) domestic spy force.<eos> A three million person environmental spy force.<eos> So giving people these jobs to be government bureaucrats and spies to go out and manage the other, you know, 290 something million Americans.<eos> And so this is classical fascism. The communists also do it.<eos> Any vertically-integrated command-and-control authoritarian system does this.<eos> So, they're openly following what the same group of banks did in Germany, Russia.<eos> You know, it's in the Communist Manifesto to have a private central bank, because the private central bankers actually wrote the ideas that they had Marx and Engels put out.<eos> People go, "Well, why would the banks want communism?" It doesn't exist.<eos> They rape us. They consolidate us.
The globalists are outside all the nations.<eos> That gives them safety, and they play countries off against each other.<eos> And so that's what we're facing and dealing with.<eos> And so they're bringing in classical hardcore tyranny into the US.<eos> But we have the Internet.<eos> We've grown our numbers.<eos> The alternative media's exploded.<eos> That's why they're trying to move in to shut down and regulate and tax the web.<eos> But it's too late for them.<eos> They're, they're playing in the 19th century, 20th century rules.
Their third world puppets would sign agreements stating that when the country defaulted, the banks would be given all the natural resources and infrastructure of the once sovereign lands.<eos> But worst of all, the countries would pledge future taxes, paid by the people in perpetuity as profit to the private banks.<eos> By the year 2000, there were few nations that had not fallen to the designs of the money power.<eos> The globalists were now ready to start their final phase of world government takeover, the destruction of the Western nation's economies.<eos> To carry out their final takeover, they first removed banking regulations, like the Glass-Steagall Act, in the late 1990s.<eos> This allowed their front companies to issue unlimited credit to the world and to set up colossal Ponzi schemes, the likes of which the world had never seen.<eos> The scams were advertised by the controlled corporate media as completely legitimate.<eos> Because of the fantastic returns, private investors, corporations, state and local governments, invested heavily.<eos> They had taken the bait: hook, line and sinker.<eos> To destroy confidence, in late 2007, the bankers themselves began to badmouth the scams they had created.
This is critical to the globalist master plan, because in 4 to 8 years Obama must take the blame as Bush did for the New World Order's horrific agenda.<eos> At that point the elite will put a new puppet in the ceremonial seat of power and build him up as the savior, only to tear them down again.<eos> And so the process is repeated, over and over.<eos> For their program to work, it is essential that the people not learn that the presidency is now nothing more than theater.<eos> Because if they did, the people would stop looking at the pawns and start looking for the king.<eos> Through this system of deceit, the elites' criminal agenda can continue forever because the people waste all of their political energy debating the media spectacle instead of investigating the globalist agenda.<eos> Number ten.<eos> It's Obama's job to sell the public on globalist policies that aren't in the people's best interest.<eos> But the overlords have many salesmen.<eos> His most important function is to protect the criminal oligarchs from prosecution while they loot the economy worldwide, start new wars, and engage in torture.
Yeah.<eos> I know what you're saying.<eos> I don't want to end up in the hospital. Please, just tell Christine that it's over and that I accept her apology, okay?<eos> Okay, you mean that?<eos> Because I don't want to have to come back here. You don't have to come back here. Just please forget where I live.<eos> Hey, what's that I hear?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Oh, you got kids?<eos> Oh, please, just go.<eos> They've done nothing.
These events only occur for a few days each year.<eos> Snapper are normally solitary, but they've travelled here from hundreds of miles away to gather off the coast of Belize.<eos> Along this one reef, cubera, dog and mutton snapper form huge shoals.<eos> 60 metres down, there is an eerie coolness to the scene.<eos> But things are about to hot up.<eos> It's the evening of the full moon, the tides are just right.<eos> A great column of fish leaves the bottom.<eos> As they rise through the water, small groups break free of the shoal.<eos> Each burst is led by a female, with the males racing behind.<eos> As she sheds her eggs, they add their sperm to the mix.
I guarantee you,<eos> I will let you, and them see my love for you.<eos> Can I invite you home for dinner?<eos> Why?<eos> I want to introduce you to my parents.<eos> Why?<eos> I want to give you a job at our restaurant.<eos> But I can't hear.<eos> Will your parents agree?<eos> They... will see will see my...
Yeah, we both got punked, Frank.<eos> We both got punked!<eos> That's right. These kids these days, I'll tell you what. They're nothing like we used to be back when we were in fraternities.<eos> They have no respect for anybody, okay?<eos> They're like stupid little goddamn savages. They're bitches!<eos> They're bitches!<eos> They're little bitches. I came in there, right?<eos> And I was polite, and I was nice to them.<eos> I was cordial.<eos> And they completely goddamn disrespected me!
I'll tell you what, dude.<eos> Maybe you should step down from the fraternity thing.<eos> Look, we haven't gotten Art Sloan to sign up yet. He has not signed up.<eos> Why don't you focus some of that weird rage on him?<eos> - Charlie and I'll handle the frat kids from here, okay? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'll totally pull a Good Will Hunting on those kids... and that'll put 'em in their place.<eos> How are you gonna do that?<eos> Well, you've seen the movie, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So all I gotta do is I'll ask them some like big shot, like, math or science, history-type college question... and then I'll totally stump them by knowing a lot more about the answer than they do.
-Why did you intercept him?<eos> -The boat was full of Pro Methoxy.<eos> It's been going on for many years.<eos> It's brought in by foreign boats, mostly Asian.<eos> They dump it in the sea, then it's picked up and stored on the island.
I think you'd be crazy not to.<eos> These chances don't come along every day.<eos> And the firm?<eos> We survived losing Stern.<eos> We'll... survive losing you.<eos> And my people?<eos> Your people?<eos> The lawyers who came over with me.<eos> That's funny,<eos> I thought they were our people.
But maybe I wanted you to see<eos> Just how ridiculous you truly are, Constantly chasing their approval.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, dr. Dorian. I just wanted to make sure<eos> You were still gonna be my blood buddy.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> What?<eos> You can't even help yourself, can ya?<eos> Dorian, in oer for these kids to really learn, Sooner or later you gotta let go of their hands.<eos> So I'm supposed to be like you and just rule by fear?<eos> Perry, they hate you.
To film the very best primate behaviour, the "Life" team had to use all their primate ingenuity and adaptability.<eos> And in doing so, they discovered an extraordinary affinity ... with our extended family.<eos> Especially with the great ape ... with whom we share almost 99% of our genes, the chimpanzee.<eos> He was completely asleep just then, he was just rocking to the side as if he might just fall off the branch. You could see his lips were twitching like he was in a deep dream. It was really beautiful.<eos> Chimpanzees are our closest relatives.<eos> Justine Evans spent almost a month with them ... in the forests of Guinea to film their use of tools.<eos> The chimps have disappeared off down there, they're going to cross over into another area of forest ... and hopefully start using some tools.<eos> Go and use tools, that's what we're here for.<eos> Chimpanzees have to accept you.<eos> If they don't want to be filmed, they'll simply disappear.
Three, three, three.<eos> No problem, brother or sister?<eos> Two brothers.<eos> They wanted a girl.<eos> That's why they got three.<eos> Otherwise no.<eos> You will rarely see a couple with now three children, very rarely. At the root of it all is education.<eos> Thanks to a long tradition of compulsory schooling for boys and girls, Kerala has one of the highest literacy rates in the world.<eos> Even too-young children are coming to school.<eos> See, they are carrying bags bigger than them.
One person 's life on one single paper.<eos> you guys w.ere so proud to export me 30years ago and now. I'm a disgrace in this society?<eos> I'm supposed to be a secret?<eos> Is that w.hat you're saying?<eos> Please calm dow.n, Mr Fedora.<eos> We are only w.orking for w.omen and their children in need of support.<eos> hey, w.hat about their future?<eos> I mean those children...<eos> Have you ever thought about them?<eos> They're like trees that roots been torn apart!
Excuse me?<eos> I'm assuming she did actually try to teach.<eos> Flora was very fond of Miss Jessel.<eos> And yet she has never mentioned her to me.<eos> Not once.<eos> And Miles has never mentioned Peter Quint.<eos> Don't you think that's odd?<eos> If they liked them so much?<eos> Unless they were trying to conceal them.<eos> The children were very lonely before they came.
No kiss or miss, no fights over it...<eos> It's snapped!<eos> Who is it?<eos> - Forget it, sister.<eos> Why are you blaming him for it?<eos> Throw away this old guitar and buy a new one, sister.<eos> Where's the money?<eos> AII of you come on time to the class, but nobody pays the fee correctly.<eos> Look teacher, this is not our mistake, it's our parents mistake.<eos> they pay Iakhs for school but for guitar classes,
The pilots on board the U.S. aircraft carriers are no older. They are barely out of college. They pose for John Ford's cameramen and then take off to attack the Japanese fleet.<eos> Torpedo Squadron 8 will strike first. One of its pilots, 25 year old Lieutenant George Gay, nose dives over the Japanese fleet.<eos> The anti-aircraft guns on the Japanese aircraft carriers shoot down the American planes one after the other.<eos> George Gay flies low over the waves. He is shot down. He surfaces in the water, miraculously unhurt.<eos> A few hundred yards away he can see the feverish activity on board the Japanese aircraft carriers. Planes are being fueled and bombs are being loaded in preparation for their second wave of attack.<eos> At that very moment, another squadron of U.S. bombers flies over the Japanese ships. An incredible stroke of luck! They sink 4 Japanese aircraft carriers.<eos> George Gay, still in the water, recalls:<eos> I found myself in the middle the Japanese wrecks and the sharks.<eos> I saw the Japanese planes coming back from the first attack on Midway.<eos> They were looking for their aircraft carriers, the ones we had just sunk.
But his remaining soldiers, overwhelmed by the Russian rocket launchers surrender one after the other.<eos> Beneath the ruins of the chancellory in his underground bunker,<eos> Hitler rants and raves and manoeveurs his imaginary armies.<eos> The last of his faithful followers take advantage of a lull Garden of the Chancellery April 20, 1945 to come out and celebrate his birthday on April the 20th.<eos> Hitler is 56 years old.<eos> He consoles these Hitler Youth, who have been chosen because their parents have just been killed in the bombing of Dresden.<eos> As the Americans advance westward, they capture thousands of these Hitler youths sent to the front to replace the soldiers who have been killed.<eos> The Americans can hardly believe their eyes.<eos> These boys-soldiers are afraid of nothing.<eos> They have undergone years of brainwashing.
To boast the moral, Reynaud names another World War I hero as Vice Premier.<eos> 84 years old Maréchal Petain. who will soon turn his back on Reynaud's policies.<eos> Weygand has no choice.<eos> He too is forced to order a full retreat towards Dunkirk.<eos> Hitler lets them go.<eos> A gesture of clemency towards Great Britain?<eos> Is he still hoping for a separated peace?<eos> Or has Goering assured him that his air force is capable of preventing any evacuations?<eos> 400,000 men cramped the beach, helpless and in disarray.<eos> They have one last chance of escape, over the sea.
Burning the bodies is one way eliminating them.<eos> On the central line, General Guderian, German tank strategist and the proponent of the blitzkrieg is held up by the Stalin line.<eos> A series of fortifications that the panzer grenadier have to take by a sword.<eos> Guderian continues to advance.<eos> But an unforeseen factor soon slows down his fine motorized unit, as described by von Kageneck:<eos> We advance in our armored cars and the dust envelopes us.<eos> We're in Russia, where road and asphalts don't exist.<eos> The sticky yellow or red dust gets into everything into your eyes, your nose, your mouth.<eos> Under such condition, these men moves 50 km a day.<eos> They've marched all the way through Warsaw, to Oslo, to Bayonne.
This is when the rightwing extremists in the occupied countries start signing up to serve in the German Army.<eos> Belgians, Danes, Dutchmen, and the young men in the LVF (Legion French Volunteers), decide to don the German uniform and fight on the Eastern Front.<eos> They will suffer.<eos> An early cold front sweeps through begin in November 1941.<eos> Temperatures will plummet to almost -40 degrees Celsius.<eos> The Wehrmacht was designed to conduct a blitzkrieg, a lightning war.<eos> It was supposed to bring Russia to its knees in 4 months. It is not equipped for winter.<eos> Guderian writes in his memoirs:<eos> It was a sight to see those half starved, insufficiently clothed men fight over a poor shelter.<eos> They fight to control even the tiniest village.
It's near here!<eos> Film it, film it!<eos> It's here!<eos> We are in the buffer zone, near the border.<eos> The Israeli army began bombing.<eos> The children are now in terror and fear.<eos> We live in the buffer zone and here the situation is very difficult.<eos> The war has been resurrected, and the situation is critical.<eos> There is no food or drink, no flour or even milk for the children.<eos> They are terrified, what can we say more than this?
They observed.<eos> They spoke to one another, saying,<eos> "We have to descend to the Earth to bring an assault upon the builders of the tower."<eos> What kind of an assault?<eos> The biblical text is very clear.<eos> They touched the minds of the people and corrupted their spirit of unity.<eos> The Tower of Babel story really relates to a decision that the so-called gods had made:<eos> human beings were not only supposed to speak different languages, they were also supposed to fight with each other.<eos> They were supposed to come into conflict with each other.<eos> And as long as they're squabbling with each other, they're not gonna unite and fight against you.
Now it seems that we stand on the threshold of the final jump.<eos> There do seem to be cyclical patterns in history.<eos> Each generation has to make the same mistakes.<eos> We personally have to make similar mistakes at each life stage.<eos> Some argue it is a spiral pattern, that the cycles have a kind of forward motion, that it's actually traveling in a direction, even as it seems to be going around in circles.<eos> It is human destiny, from every legend, from every religion, to know we, as a race of human beings, will evolve.<eos> We will overcome.<eos> We will achieve the fulfillment of the messianic destiny to knowing the truth of our universe, the truth of our existence.<eos> It's inevitable.<eos> Could well be that what we are seeing here is the fulfillment of this long-standing plan or agenda of these extraterrestrial beings, who have been waiting for us to arrive at this level of consciousness or technology through which they will feel comfortable now to reveal themselves.
It's a barrel-vaulted chamber.<eos> Nice workmanship.<eos> It's beautifully made, isn't it?<eos> Lovely masonry.<eos> It's just held together by its own weight.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Just describe what the scene was like.<eos> I was very excited and I crawled through this small entrance and then came in and I saw the bones.<eos> Right.<eos> The long bones from the legs, and they nearly were partly in the one niche and partly in the other niche.
(Ordgar) Vikingr, move!<eos> That we shall find out from this one.<eos> GROANING<eos> Speak.<eos> MAN REPLIES QUIETLY<eos> There are greater of them than there were of the Vikingr. He says they are building.<eos> He says they mean to stay.<eos> Two weeks after landing in England, the Norman orcs had pulled back from their village-burning and were now fortifying a peninsula of our beloved Sussex.<eos> Duke William had sent out orders to destroy the rest of their ships so they could not return to their homeland.<eos> They meant to stay, indeed.

So many brave Englishmen met their doom below the hill, none more beloved than the cowardly farmer who became a huscarl and saved my life.<eos> A Norman trick had taken too many from us, leaving few weaponed-men to stand alone against the treacherous tide.<eos> SOLDIERS CHANTING So, finally, the tale of the little people at the fateful Battle of Hastings brings us to the plight of the King himself.<eos> Harold now knew that his army was weakened, and that every fighting man would be required to hold the hill.<eos> That would include two of his brothers, his son, and perhaps even his lover, Edith Swan-Neck.<eos> The Norman orcs kept coming, little waves bent on probing the wall for weakness.<eos> Stay behind this shield.<eos> Stay behind this shield.<eos> Hour upon hour, the Normans threw themselves upon the shield wall in what now became a battle of endurance.<eos> But they kept on coming.
I'm giving you alien executive order.<eos> How the hell would I find them?<eos> Well, you're a private eye.<eos> So you can do what you do.<eos> But this...<eos> This is a very cool doohickey you can't buy in any stores<eos> You'll be fed intel as I have it and off you go to do that which needs to be done.<eos> How do I know you're even who you say you are?<eos> Well, ask your avengers pals.<eos> They know me. I'm offering you a chance to take all that anger and all that pain.. and bring it on those who actually deserve it.
Don't we have the same role model?<eos> You don't go to school, but goof around.<eos> What will you become?<eos> You do have a career, but you don't have friends.<eos> I have many friends.<eos> I'm just too busy now.<eos> As soon as I have some free time, my friends will come to me.<eos> People in this world look up to money.<eos> No money, no friends.<eos> Even if they're around you now, they'll leave you sooner or later.
Sorry!<eos> Hey, watch it!<eos> Yo, Tommy, can I get some service!<eos> Maybe a latte?<eos> - Hold on.<eos> - What are you watching?<eos> These...<eos> Come here.<eos> These guys, OK?<eos> They're some of our regulars.
He loathed the old suit.<eos> He felt it was too, uh, theatrical.<eos> Ballistic vest and Cal helmet, reinforced with contoured carbon-Armour plates and wired for cellular and radio communication.<eos> What is this?<eos> - Ah, a layered micro-weave of Kevlar, Twaron and Heracron fibres skinned in a titanium-ceramic alloy neuro-symbiotic mesh, resistant to heat and small-arms fire.<eos> Wait, neuro what?<eos> You know, kind of like modern bio-electronic prosthetics.<eos> In English.<eos> OK.<eos> When you tense, say in anticipation of being struck, well, your brain sends signals to your muscles and they, you know, they contract.
Guran, how's Renny?<eos> She's fine.<eos> Kim's in custody.<eos> How's Ben-David?<eos> Looks like he's gonna be fine.<eos> I'll go with him to the hospital.<eos> OK, good.<eos> I'll tell Vandermaark to meet you there.<eos> You were right about the enhanced receivers having unique serial numbers.<eos> We collated them with the list, and they all checked out except for the last 5.
I think he's here.<eos> -Go and look.<eos> You?<eos> -Child Riya.<eos> I was. .<eos> -Forget it.<eos> Child Riya, what did you give to Chintu. . . .in tiffin that his friends are his fan.<eos> Fan.<eos> -Yes, aunt.<eos> They liked it.
Why is it that so many of your stories end with "and then he hung himself"?<eos> - Bad luck, I guess.<eos> - Don't help me.<eos> And keep this to yourself.<eos> It'll be our secret.<eos> This is your new patient, John. What's your secret?<eos> I can't tell.<eos> And besides, you are terrible at keeping secrets.<eos> You know, my brothers are great at keeping secrets.<eos> They never once told anybody about the time they got into a fight in the bathroom and accidentally bumped wieners.
It's too bad we can't just call John's brothers and tell them that he needs them.<eos> I know.<eos> Stupid doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> It's like wearing a muzzle.<eos> Like last month,<eos> One of my patients asks out nurse Rollins, and I couldn't even warn her that I'm treating the guy for a horrible case of mono.<eos> Now she has it, and her grandfather has it.<eos> I don't know, she wouldn't say.<eos> Men are always doing this to themselves.<eos> If they say they don't want your help, you can bet your ass they really need it.
- No, my mom's not gonna let me go.<eos> - Listen up, kiddies.<eos> You don't ask your parents for permission to rock.<eos> You think The Beatles went to their mums and dads:<eos> "Hello, Mum.<eos> Hello, Dad.<eos> May I have permission to go with my mates to a little pub called Shea Stadium and rock the world for the rest of eternity?" No!<eos> They were adults!<eos> You're an ad...<eos> They were adults.
Keith... would have been my best man.<eos> But he's not gonna be there, just like he didn't seemy state championship or see my first novelpublished.<eos> Dan took all that.<eos> And he did itwith malice and premeditation.<eos> Dan is an educated man, and if he is nothing... he's very persuasive.<eos> Do not let him fool you.<eos> He has a very darkand ugly heart.<eos> And he should neverbe allowed to walk the streetsa free man.<eos> So as you deliberate his fate, I ask you only one question.<eos> How can a fatherhope to influence his sons when they never even cameto see him?
It's not his fault.<eos> What was that?<eos> It's not his fault the feed's off.<eos> If you'd let people here do their jobs right in the first place, maybe things would run better.<eos> In my office.<eos> Never talk back to me in front of the crew again.<eos> But that was kind of hot.<eos> If it ain't my biggest fan.<eos> You need to start listening to your coaches, Quentin.<eos> They need me more than I need them, man.
- hi<eos> - Hi.<eos> So, uh, this is marketing and distribution?<eos> so, I might ve pimped up my job description just a little.<eos> Basically, I work in the mail room.<eos> Well, that's hollywood, right?<eos> It's always abouthe spin.<eos> I'll bet you know more about music than most of these tools.<eos> Shh, you're gonna get me in trouble.<eos> And they are not all tools, okay?
Yes, Colonel?<eos> Fast and strong.<eos> Nothing can bazaar.<eos> So do we work, is not you?<eos> You're probably asking yourself what a nice girl like me doing in a place like this.<eos> Actually, he was asking me how you handle those wacky gangsters.<eos> Who?<eos> Those types of before?<eos> They arm themselves in strong, but ... are not.<eos> Cook for them and they protect me.
I agree it doesn't seem the right time of year to be acquiring a coat with such thermal efficiency.<eos> It is the middle of fucking summer.<eos> However, Christmas is always around the corner.<eos> Where did you get these junkies, eh?<eos> What's this, a fucking double act?<eos> Get on with it, give us the price and then leave.<eos> All in good time, gentlemen, all in good time.<eos> Next up, we have a very much sought-after affair seen in very, very glossy magazines.<eos> Junkies, as any junkie will tell you, are not to be trusted.<eos> They take what doesn't belong to them, not because they're thinking but because they're junkies.
"Missing, assumed dead," they say.<eos> Our Johnny?<eos> How many rock stars by the name Johnny Quid do you think there are in the universe?<eos> Only thing he fell off is his junkie spoon.<eos> He's no deader than them shoes you got on.<eos> He'll be gearing himself up, happy as a clam in a fisherman's net.<eos> June, how dead is Johnny?<eos> If he's dead, that's the third time this year.<eos> Rockers like that never die.<eos> They just wither and give me pain.
She's remarkable.<eos> She's okay here?<eos> Marvelous.<eos> She doesn't ever, you know, do things she shouldn't?<eos> What shouldn't she do?<eos> I don't know, inappropriate things.<eos> Never.<eos> She's very happy here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Normally I tend to stay away from, you know ... in the classroom, because I think that, you know, the teachers can solve things better than I can, and ... and well, frankly, they're better at it than I am,
Oh, no, I feel hope there.<eos> At least, I did.<eos> Where?<eos> But not here.<eos> I can see myself wrecking and ruining.<eos> But I can't stop myself.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Ah. Was this here before?<eos> No, but I've always found children go where they want.<eos> They won't be stopped, not if they don't want to.
- Who cares?<eos> - Who car... are you insane?<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Yesterday, I was nothing.<eos> My wife left me.<eos> My friends thought I was a failure.<eos> But today, I'm a rock star, man.<eos> You got it?<eos> I'm a rock star!<eos> They were wrong.
- Maybe they're hibernating.<eos> Seems like an odd thing to do after being attacked.<eos> You know, plus, they usually land the ship.<eos> All right. Well, we didn't come all this way to turn back, so I'm going in.<eos> Lorne, you got anything?<eos> Nothing so far.<eos> Well, we got bodies.<eos> Acknowledged.<eos> We'll keep looking.<eos> Looks like they were fed on.
UhI don't know.<eos> Whatever has a shorter heel?<eos> Well,they're both 3 inches,but I think the black,right?<eos> Right.<eos> Oh,there's clayton.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hey.<eos> So this should be fun,huh?<eos> Running up to boston to convince a couple of kids that $300 million for their facebook clone isn't a bad deal?<eos> I know,but for us to be happy,they have to bhappy.
This is Ajay Mehra speaking. Doctor.<eos> I want play the game of doctor and patient with you..<eos> ..you will play with me?<eos> Who is this?<eos> I am your patient doctor, will you have coffee with me?<eos> I love you doctor! You!<eos> You have fallen to such bad times.<eos> Natasha has left you or what, that you are going around saying..<eos> ..I love you to men?<eos> If you don't meet your friends then they have to.. ..become patients to meet you. Where are you, man?
Sorry, it was an accident.<eos> There was a report of a cleanup on aisle 5.<eos> Sorry about the spill.<eos> They accidentally threw it at me.<eos> You call this a spill?<eos> Back in '94, a fat kid fell off the monkey bars, hit his head.<eos> Blood was squirting out of him like a fountain.<eos> And then, if that wasn't bad enough, he crapped hisself.<eos> By the time I got over there, The smell of puke and poop overwhelmed seven other kids.<eos> They started blowing chunks.
- We got no money.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> Where are the kids in the village?<eos> - No kids here.<eos> - You sure?<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> - And the government soldiers?<eos> - None here.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They just pass through.
We want two horses.<eos> I can pay, I have money.<eos> Two good horses.<eos> We'll sleep here tonight.<eos> The steppes are vast, no?<eos> They belong to everyone.<eos> What's gotten into you?<eos> My parents never denied me anything.<eos> But last winter was very hard, all their livestock died.<eos> They gave you life.
How do you know?<eos> The way to lead is unique, is how the way you...<eos> Do Cojo?<eos> I was going to say, work.<eos> I saw Wolf, make some how shaky yesterday.<eos> You are trying to save the workshop, and beat all runners.<eos> If I arrest Wolf, VIR might against their heads might help me in my career.<eos> What would you stop?<eos> I can not arrest Wolf, without an order from my superiors.<eos> And they refuse to dármela.
Maybe I should shoot face against yours.<eos> Thank God llegaste with those pizzas.<eos> Start.<eos> Please.<eos> You're fast!<eos> What if they'd done had been slow?<eos> I would have smoked a Cuban cigar and enjoyed a drink of good white wine.<eos> Waiting for gourmet food.<eos> I do not want to be interfered, but but you should not do This whole week.<eos> My wife had an unexpected, and left me with the kids and they wanted to invite his friends.
- You couldn't get them up off the carpet.<eos> - When they got up, they were wheezing.<eos> - That's pollution for you.<eos> - We always used to go to the park.<eos> - A lot of them don't have parks to go to.<eos> - Yeah, exactly.<eos> But you don't need a park to go for a walk.<eos> If Mum and Dad don't go out, the kids don't.<eos> Parents are too frightened to let their kids play out.<eos> Even a bit of green by the estate, they don't let them play there.
But if you think for yourself, if you think outside of the box, then you will be unhappy and you will fail. "<eos> That's how the education system works.<eos> Left turn.<eos> Enrahah.<eos> Signal.<eos> Enrahah.<eos> Were you bullied at school, Scott?<eos> We're going to do the next left turn.<eos> Enrahah.<eos> Kids, they can be cruel, can't they, eh?
I mean, it's not like it's a lost cat we're looking for here, major.<eos> I ran your name through the fbi database.<eos> There's no record of an Agent Robert Hawkins.<eos> No, there wouldn't be.<eos> Well, not in Cheyenne's fbi database.<eos> Why not?<eos> I haven't registered with Cheyenne.<eos> And I don't think that I will.<eos> You see, my bosses still work in Columbus.<eos> They're the ones who sent me to find Sarah Mason.

We just went in and we started shooting.<eos> After it was done, there were six gunmen dead, along with four bystanders.<eos> One of them was a 1 2-year-old girl.<eos> The only reason I tell you this is because there were no repercussions, none.<eos> The Army had no authority over us, the police didn't.<eos> Most of the guys, they just went back to their jobs.<eos> The company? The company wanted it quiet, so it was.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Do you understand who we're dealing with?<eos> These guys, they don't answer to anybody.
What are you doing here?<eos> We're switching posts?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Jimmy, open the door.<eos> Mr. Hawkins?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I come bearing gifts.<eos> We've got 12 men.<eos> From the looks of it, they've got about the same.

Gimme the basketball, I'm gonna show you... whoa!<eos> - That's nice, Uncle Brown.<eos> - You done scratched my suit.<eos> Harry's a high-school coach here now and college recruiter and does camps and develops talent over the summer, right?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Oh, the coach of Hillbilly High, huh?<eos> Oooh, you're so "disrespected."<eos> And arrogant.<eos> We've got some talented kids like you.<eos> But they listen, so that would make 'em better than you.
And what did you see?<eos> I was walking in the woods behind the Jasper house.<eos> I saw inside.<eos> Mr. Jasper hit Tommy with his fists.<eos> LIZ: Thank you.<eos> When did you lie, Mr. Foster, then or now?<eos> Well, the police report...<eos> The police report said that you were in the woods that night.<eos> You, on the other hand, said that you were in bed asleep, and your parents swore to that fact.<eos> Were they lying, too?
She sends you a kiss.<eos> She'll come to see you when I can't<eos> You never came to see me.<eos> It's not you who are there<eos> -It's not me?<eos> -You are not there.<eos> Who's not there?<eos> The big ugly duckling, he's not there.<eos> All around are little ducklings,<eos> -Tire you out, don't they?
I never...<eos> Maybe I'm unboyfriendable.<eos> I'm just in a shitty mood.<eos> 'Cause of me?<eos> I don't want that.<eos> No, it's not you.<eos> It's just...<eos> This trailer's fallin' down around me.<eos> Well, at least you're not living with your mother.<eos> Do your folks ever ask you for money for some stupid ass shit they dreamed up that you think is crazy?
People who talk that way don't want anyone to know<eos> - they got their teeth knocked out.<eos> - Where are your CD's?<eos> - They're over there.<eos> - Where's the V at?<eos> I love your place, man.<eos> It's very unselfconscious.<eos> - So off the grid.<eos> - It was my parents house.<eos> Haven't really done much with the place since they passed.
Then nothing would have happened.<eos> What are you hinting at?<eos> It doesn't matter what I think.<eos> It does to me.<eos> We both know that Kiehlert was into more than building and construction.<eos> You have represented him in a murder case before.<eos> I think his partners would lose a lot, if he was put in jail.<eos> They expected an acquittal, and afterwards they punished my dad.<eos> I think his car was pushed off the road by Böttker and Lessner- who worked for Kiehlert.<eos> But they are gone now, and there's no evidence- so it really doesn't matter what I think.
I mean, they got it locked down tight.<eos> But I did find some pros who will rip it off for us.<eos> But they want 10 grand.<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> You have the money.<eos> No, had.<eos> I already spent almost the whole wad.<eos> I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.<eos> I told you, all this crap was expensive.<eos> So these thieves, did they- did they say where they would be stealing it from?
Thank you.<eos> Mr. Huygens, his parents gave us some names of some of his friends.<eos> We'd like to speak with them.<eos> Unfortunately, I can't allow that.<eos> You understand.<eos> In loco parentis.<eos> Which is latin for you calling your lawyer.<eos> We have to protect our kids.<eos> Perhaps you could come back later?<eos> Look, we're here, they're here.
How?<eos> It's all about protecting the golden goose.<eos> You are way out of line here.<eos> Special agent derek lawson.<eos> What a happy coincidence.<eos> I've just gotten off the phone with your sac.<eos> Apparently, you failed to disclose some vital information about your investigation.<eos> Why are you talking to my superiors?<eos> I woke up feeling like today was a good day to violate the chain of command.<eos> Or did they call me?
Yes, I would.<eos> Is that why women were so attracted to him?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Is brute strength so compelling?<eos> To some women.<eos> Mr. Darwin calls it sexual selection.<eos> Large males able to defeat other males have more reproductive success.<eos> Therefore women find them appealing.<eos> And what of peaceable types who live in their mind?<eos> How do they fare in this great Darwinian struggle?
Are these pop-tarts sugar-free?<eos> The regular pop-tarts aren'T.<eos> I don't think they make sugar-free pop-tarts.<eos> I'm not allowed to have these, then.<eos> My mom doesn't let me have these.<eos> Then this is a really big day for you.<eos> So, neither of your parents has a problem with your sleeping at some boy's house they've never met?<eos> They're totally cool with it.<eos> How bohemian.<eos> No, they're american.
Always leaving shit slicks everywhere.<eos> In the underwear, on the toilet seat, the sheets.<eos> I don't know how she live with him.<eos> - You wanna sell drugs?<eos> - I have to leave my guesthouse?<eos> I like living in Beverly Hills.<eos> - He's an agent.<eos> - Sell to his agent friends.<eos> They like to party with all the money they made off other people's work, right?<eos> Yes, they love to party.

It is true that matter.<eos> Is there some kind of joke with a happy ending here?<eos> I can not imagine that.<eos> I am sure you will eventually get there.<eos> You know, my mother would say that you are a bad influence.<eos> I can give you a massage too.<eos> This is wrong in so many ways...<eos> I bet you're closer to your father, is not Mac?<eos> I know it's not cool to say, but my parents are fantastic.<eos> They know?

- No, it's not!<eos> A phobia is not being able to board a plane.<eos> - Yours is vanity.<eos> - Next time... why don't you just go alone?<eos> You answer everything and everyone, always interrupting, of course.<eos> Why do you take me?<eos> It's your graduating class.<eos> No, just from the university.<eos> I didn't even graduate.<eos> Of course! They're all qualified sociologists...
I put it in the hallway.<eos> And they moved there, too, to play on the rug.<eos> Amazing, like a magic carpet. A magnet. They didn't need anything else.<eos> Leonardo, the kids always played barefoot at home.<eos> We had floor heating!<eos> Remember?<eos> We've heard it a million times.<eos> The rug came later.<eos> We brought it back from Salta,<eos> - but they were older then.
- Eli? I'm Oskar.<eos> - How old are you?<eos> - 12... more or less.<eos> What about you?<eos> 12 years, 8 months and 9 days.<eos> What do you mean, "more or less"?<eos> When's your birthday?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Don't you celebrate your birthday?<eos> Your parents... they've got to know.
Yes.<eos> - We'd better not stay.<eos> - I told you so.<eos> Bertrand !<eos> You came !<eos> It's cool !<eos> Hi !<eos> I'll introduce you to my parents.<eos> They will be proud.<eos> They redecorated.
Dreams are nothing after all.<eos> They are useless.<eos> Even if you have dreams, there's nothing but despair!<eos> That's not true.<eos> Dreams aren't good for nothing.<eos> Sure, reality might be cruel and not every dream may come true.<eos> But you still have the freedom to dream on.<eos> Dreams are important!<eos> Just thinking about them will give you courage to move on.<eos> And in times of despair or darkness... they'll bring at least a some light in your heart.
One day, I'll be thrown out of the village!<eos> - Grandpa!<eos> What's the damage?<eos> We haven't decided the punishment for the offender yet.<eos> This fool broke into our house and destroyed our T. V furniture etc.<eos> He broke our bones too!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Some thieves broke into their house last night.<eos> Scared, they hid themselves under the bed.<eos> How would I know that they're ...not thieves?
Mother, that idiot has come!<eos> Today's a day of celebration!<eos> The time is auspicious, too.<eos> He who was in rags until yesterday...<eos> - Oh great!<eos> He who was in rags until yesterday is now a groom wearing a suit!<eos> Don't talk about the family.<eos> - Oh great!<eos> Don't talk about the family, it'll scare the kids away!<eos> They'll moan in dismay.

So much hatred, that his own blood wants to kill him!<eos> He who fights for the poor is the real King!<eos> Brave is he who strives for the poor.<eos> Who suffers greatly but never abandons the cause.<eos> Go ahead and become King.<eos> But how will you answer the real King?<eos> How will you answer God?<eos> You fool, try and become a true Sikh.<eos> Remember God's words.<eos> Think about it, if your parents came to know that their one son killed the other what will they go through?
- And he flew you over, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, is it as good as the photographs?<eos> The hotel or my client?<eos> [ Laughs ] No, it was good.<eos> I'd never been to Dubai before.<eos> It was great.<eos> We had a lot of fun.<eos> Mmm. So the rich guys aren't all that much hard work, are they?<eos> Well, they know how to buy their fun.
What does it remind you of?<eos> A bathing cap my mother once had.<eos> A brand-new doll.<eos> A mat some kids once rolled me up in.<eos> We were playing a game.<eos> I still remember it.<eos> [ Laughs Softly ] Of course you do.<eos> Precious moment.<eos> Yes.<eos> And those moments, they they never leave us.
The good news is, Isaac is still performing well beyond the expectations.<eos> They were men, Simon.<eos> Not nameless stats on some report.<eos> They were real men.<eos> Men with families. You show me the war that ever excluded men with families from the battlefield.<eos> This is not your personal crusade.<eos> People are in danger.<eos> You need to inform the proper authorities of what happened here.<eos> What do you think your employers will think of that?<eos> They funded the project.
But the weather, needless to say, in Newfoundland.<eos> The weather here is terrible.<eos> To make that journey was awful.<eos> Only Kate and David would have done it, really, I think.<eos> Nobody else would have done it.<eos> The one guard, the one day, said to Kate and David, speaking to Zachary,<eos> "Zachary, I hope some day you will realize how brave and courageous your grandparents are."<eos> Like, I think if I could be a quarter of the grandma that Kate is, I'd be such a success.<eos> You know, seeing them with Zachary.<eos> Just to see the looks on their faces, Kurt, when they'd have him, you know.
We have one bottle remaining.<eos> We're gonna crack Andrew's last Fuller's ESB right now, and Kurt and I are gonna sip it together.<eos> A little toast to our friend.<eos> To Andrew, my good friend, I can't wait to see you again.<eos> And then, of course, the unthinkable happened again.<eos> They let her out of jail again.<eos> And we had to give him back on January 10, 2003.<eos> Shirley was out of money and out of a lawyer, so she wrote directly to Judge Derek Green, who responded through his secretary with instructions on how to write her own appeal of his decision to incarcerate her while awaiting an order from the minister of justice<eos> to surrender her to the States.<eos> I have a few friends who are judges, and there's no way they would ever have responded in the way that judge responded to Shirley.
Oh, no.<eos> I remember now!<eos> "lt was the beginning."<eos> "The countdown to the end of the world."<eos> The terrorist attack on the Diet Building resulted in 32 deaths with 91 injured.<eos> Only FDP members escaped injury as they were out of the building.<eos> We've come to this page now.<eos> It's today.<eos> "9 heroes emerged to stop the evil."<eos> "Would they have a chance against the villains?"
She likes my taste. Do you have a problem with that?<eos> Is there anything to eat?<eos> No, Paul, you can order in.<eos> You're really losing it.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Because there's nothing for you to eat?<eos> No, because you haven't been home a single night this week. - What about your kids?<eos> - I don't know. Maybe they'll suddenly discover they have a father. Oh!<eos> You're doing this for them?<eos> You're having an affair so that they can rediscover their father.
And I wasn't uptight, I was disgusted.<eos> The way you were... hanging on to Eric like... I don't know.<eos> You should've seen her. She was walking around, giving toasts like she was Marilyn Monroe or something.<eos> It used to turn you on... that I could drink, like one of the guys.<eos> You used to brag that I could drink any guy under the table - when we were out with your friends.<eos> - You mean, my friends you used to think were such great guys?<eos> Those friends?<eos> That's what you said, right?<eos> You said, it was refreshing that they weren't these pretentious windbags.<eos> And they fucking worshipped you.
And I said, I couldn't, I couldn't.<eos> I told her I had somewhere to be... that we would do it another time.<eos> Now, I really did have something else to do that night.<eos> I was supposed to go with Daniel and his, uh... his partner Sean to a party.<eos> You understand, this amazing woman wants to fuck the shit out of me in a five-star hotel, and instead I'm going to Georgetown with these two fags.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> And, and why do you think you'd rather spend time with, uh... with them?<eos> Everything's a joke with them.<eos> I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with their world, but their humor... is in seeing everything from the outside, like they're not a part of it, like...<eos> like... they're above it.
My name is Grace Wong.<eos> I've been kidnapped<eos> I don't know where I am<eos> It was very difficult to make this connection<eos> I beg you not to hang up<eos> Miss. maybe you should call the police instead?<eos> Your kidnappers seem nice enough<eos> They even grant you access to a phone<eos> I'm telling the truth.<eos> They smashed the phone.
Tinker Fong!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey help! Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> I've called the cops already.<eos> Didn't you see two foreigners just kidnapped that little girl? Stop it!<eos> Security. over here!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> They've got your little girl
Cut and run!<eos> Terrorists win! Terrorists win!<eos> Stop all this pandering!<eos> If you haven't sprung from her or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!<eos> You too, Fred Thompson.<eos> But I was in Die Hard.<eos> Die Hard Two!<eos> Is everyone here as sick of those stupid politicians as I am?<eos> What about the media?<eos> They're not covering the issues.
Look, the Wiggum boy's better than anyone else we've got.<eos> Well, if you put it that way...<eos> This meeting of the Democratic Party will come to order, babies.<eos> So if we nominate this Ralph Wiggums, we will be likean unstoppable choo-choo.<eos> I already got my assless, sparkle tux cleaned for the inauguration.<eos> I agree with my ex-husband.<eos> With Ralph on the ticket, I don't know how we will blow it, but we will.<eos> This is Kent Brockman reporting from the Wiggum compound, where both parties have gathered to court the most charismatic child since<eos> Drew Barrymore in Firestarter.<eos> When she got mad, they got burned.
And it's my understanding that there have been foreign reporters and investigators who have attempted to contact her and have interviews... -<eos> (Brenneman) Gunson was the model of rectitude.<eos> He had that same kind of handsome schoolboy, sparkling good looks as Robert Redford.<eos> The rumor in the district attorney's office was that they picked Gunson to handle the case because he was a Mormon and because he was the only member of the DA's office who hadn't had sex with an underage girl.<eos> I heard some jokes about why they gave it to me, but I can't imagine those are accurate.<eos> There were a lot of prosecutors who had an interest in high-publicity cases.<eos> Although I had had one very high publicity case, I was not one that looked for them.<eos> They were the perfect attorneys to handle a case like this, where the evidence and the players were sensational, were dramatic, flamboyant.<eos> So you want two attorneys who kept an even keel.<eos> They were, in that regard, very strikingly different from the judge in the case.
You didn't tell me.<eos> I wasn't on my deathbed, Boris.<eos> Philippe was there to pamper me.<eos> I can't call every time.<eos> What's news at the front?<eos> I'm run off my feet with work.<eos> That's why I never call.<eos> Same old excuse.<eos> We're working with French-speaking African groups.<eos> They struggle to get information.
I was going through some of my father's things, and I found it.<eos> You gave it to me when we were kids.<eos> Well, i guess i thought i could romance you with my abc's.<eos> It's an insignia... From when our parents would get together with the queens and the teagues.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> That "v" was the symbol for their astronomy club.<eos> You must have seen it once and copied it.<eos> They called themselves "veritas."<eos> While we were off playing, they were discussing Secret things behind closed doors.
Previously on Stargate Atlantis.<eos> So someone was monitoring my sister's computer.<eos> I think I've cracked their trojan, and I've got an address.<eos> - Barrett and I are on our way there now.<eos> - You're coming with us.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Two men, they must have followed us.<eos> He's not here, they took him.
Those kids have to eat their parents.<eos> I just don't understand bringing a child into that kind of world.<eos> We don't live in Darfur.<eos> That's... that's not my point.<eos> But I mean, you love kids.<eos> You're a teacher.<eos> You love them.<eos> They're my class.<eos> Of course I love them.<eos> And they love you.
No history of trouble or drugs.<eos> She's a junior at Hilldale High School across town.<eos> She's been missing since yesterday morning.<eos> She caught the bus to go to school but never showed up at school.<eos> This happened yesterday?<eos> Why?<eos> Is something the matter?<eos> I guess I'm just surprised that her parents called you before the police.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> They-They didn't call me.
The polygraph seems to back that up.<eos> The police seem to think she was on her way to his apartment.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Oh, come on, it's not The DaVinci Code.<eos> She told everyone she was going to school that day, and, in fact, she got off the bus, made her way towards his apartment.<eos> At least that's the theory du jour.<eos> I've talked to Melanie's parents.<eos> I've asked them to call the boy, and find out if I can interview him.<eos> It's not a sure thing;<eos> they haven't said yes.
All right, I'm gonna cut you some slack.<eos> Get out.<eos> What I want you to do is go in there and sober up.<eos> And I'm gonna be out here waiting for you when the concert's over.<eos> And if either one of you looks the least bit squirrelly to me, not only will you not be getting behind the wheel of this car tonight, but I will see to it that neither one of you ever gets behind the wheel<eos> You read me?<eos> Yeah. Thank you, Officer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, ladies, one more time, do your parents know that you're here, either of you?<eos> Yeah, they know.
My sister's fiancé is here.<eos> They saved us.<eos> We have been saved thank God!<eos> Attention!<eos> Now, lads.<eos> Head for the front.<eos> Those are our men!<eos> Our men!<eos> Suleyman...<eos> They were in Abadan on the 23rd, and they passed Tadan on the 24th...
Sir, let's have another look.<eos> Oh, that's remarkable.<eos> What's the ruckus, gentlemen?<eos> Ah, sir, you have to see this.<eos> Murdoch.<eos> I might have known.<eos> It's called a Kinetoscope, sir.<eos> And I suppose it can detect guilt or differentiate between strands of hair and whatnot, can it?<eos> No, no, but the interesting thing about hair follicles is they're actually receptacles...
-They're here.<eos> -They came as soon as they heard.<eos> -She's lying.<eos> Come on.Justin, they told me about the grave.<eos> They told me how heartbroken you were when your parents died.<eos> They told me that you went to see them every single day; that you read to them, that you brought them gifts.<eos> They told me how much you had to give up just to be with them!<eos> Those aren't the actions of somebody who belongs here.<eos> You have so much love in your heart.<eos> They don't need what you have here.

But she stops.<eos> The babies call constantly.<eos> She knows exactly where they all are and waits until every single one of them has caught up.<eos> Only when all are with her will she set off again.<eos> At last safety.<eos> The babies are close to exhaustion.<eos> Without such devotion from the female few if any of these baby caiman would have survived.<eos> And remarkably most of them arent even her own.<eos> When parental care was first described in crocodiles the reports were dismissed as too extraordinary to be true.<eos> We may call reptiles cold-blooded but they can show great tenderness.
Cause if it is, she's totally into you.<eos> No, I'm not interested in lisa.<eos> She's so typical, with her perfect hair and her perfect skin and her supple, perky breasts<eos> -what's your point?<eos> -You're not like her at all.<eos> -you're special.<eos> You're real.<eos> -Whatever thameans.<eos> Do you see the way that these kids look at you?<eos> They love you.
Ah, yes. UCOS.<eos> You want to know about the IRU...<eos> Eric Trimble? Yeah, that's right.<eos> It would help to know how long soldiers spent there, what they got up to.<eos> That kind of thing.<eos> Of course.<eos> Er, well, soldiers could be there quite some time.<eos> A month even.<eos> And the four soldiers from the King's Guards...<eos> We understand they were the only ones there at the time?
There's been a change.<eos> Gordon'll take them.<eos> - No!<eos> - That's fucking them!<eos> - The guys we were telling you about!<eos> - I appreciate you calling me, Otis.<eos> These are the two who robbed us.<eos> What?<eos> No, he's lying!<eos> They're the ones that killed Caleb!
G you gentlemenin court.<eos> I've been practicing for ten years,and I haven't been sued once.<eos> And I thought at least when I did get sued,it would be because I screwed up.<eos> Nate,I have to ask.<eos> Is there anything about this case you haven't told me?<eos> No.<eos> Ostrow seems awfully confident for a guy who doesn't have the law on his side.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong,eli.<eos> Doctors get sued all the time.<eos> Doesn't matter if they made a mistake or not.
It can hurt.<eos> but we do what we can for our guests.<eos> We try to be hospitable, giving them whatever they desire.<eos> If I'm gonna sign here, I will require something else.<eos> Okay,well,name it.<eos> I want patrick.<eos> You want patrickto be your assistant?<eos> No.<eos> I want patrickto be my lover.<eos> sometimes all you can do is help them feel better while they wait to return home.
49% bitch, 51 % sweetheart.<eos> See you later.<eos> See ya.<eos> See ya.<eos> See you, kids.<eos> 'Bye, Dad.<eos> 'Bye, Jase.<eos> Mark would be so chuffed he takes them to footy every week.<eos> Ah, he loves it, big bloody kid.<eos> Enjoys it more than they do.
Hey.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's late. - I just thought I'd get you something to eat, bring it in for you.<eos> Oh, thanks, but I think I'll just, um, call it quits, eh? Mmm. One sec.<eos> I'll just drop these off.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Oh... Hit the road, eh?<eos> Babe...<eos> I thought it was just another one of your bloody murders.<eos> But those... I mean, those little kids, they didn't...
Sarah Jane Smith.<eos> Sarah Jane Smith was a freelance investigative journalist, formerly ofMetropolitan Magazine.<eos> Her body was recovered from the hospital late this afternoon.<eos> - What's for tea?<eos> - I've got nothing in.<eos> I'll get chips.<eos> Last of my wages.<eos> Fish and chips, yeah?<eos> ...along with his teenage friends Maria Jackson and Clyde Langer.<eos> It is feared that they also perished.
You're doing it again. - What?<eos> - Looking behind me.<eos> People keep on doing that.<eos> Looking at my back.<eos> What sort of people?<eos> People in the street.<eos> Strangers.<eos> I just catch them sometimes.<eos> Staring at me.<eos> Like they're looking at something.
You'll have quite a bit of this.<eos> Atmospheric disturbance.<eos> Still, it'll pass.<eos> Everything does.<eos> Bye then, Wilfred.<eos> Oh, Doctor.<eos> What about you now?<eos> Who have you got?<eos> I mean, all those friends of yours...<eos> They've all got someone else.
I counted the shadows.<eos> You only have one now.<eos> She's nearly gone.<eos> Be kind.<eos> These are our forests.<eos> We are not kind.<eos> I'm giving you back your forests, but you are giving me them.<eos> You are letting them go.<eos> These are our forests.<eos> They are our meat.
-Let alone clean.<eos> And, I don't know, you're here all alone.<eos> Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.<eos> Yeah, Dad, look. You gotta check it out. We've brought some brochures.<eos> These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.<eos> -They're great. -No, no, beautiful.<eos> They're really nice. They really are. These are top-notch, like, resorts.<eos> -It's like staying in a hotel practically. -They're beautiful.<eos> They really are. -Yeah.<eos> They take care of everything. They'll clean up. They're really nice.
Eh, eh, eh, en pointe!<eos> This is so hard.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> We balerinas are under constant pressure to stay focused, skinny, graceful and skinny.<eos> How do you cope with it?<eos> You find out what works you.<eos> For some people it might be yoga, for others, meditation.<eos> But for every ballerina in the world, it's cigarettes.<eos> Cigarettes?<eos> ! They can kill you.
Backing up three years of case files. The bulk of our lives is in these cables right now, flying back and forth in zeroes and ones.<eos> You do understand that I'm the ones, and you're the zeroes.<eos> Meadowlark Lemon.<eos> - Harlem Globetrotters.<eos> what?<eos> hey.carefull with the links please, i told you, they're sensitive.<eos> so am i, magzero.<eos> - no, no, no... keli nell, that worked.<eos> - am i ...<eos> yeah, how about the phones, they work calling actually, they do not.
His name's number two on your speed dial.<eos> He was an ex-boyfriend, okay?<eos> Can I have my phone back, please?<eos> Drive.<eos> They just turned west.<eos> All right, the car is stopped two blocks ahead.<eos> You're a cop, aren't you?<eos> Why did you kill those women, Andy?<eos> For their husbands.<eos> Save them the humiliation of finding out that their wives were screwing around on them while they were serving their country.
If Hoffman had an accomplice, he could very well be him.<eos> Or he could just be a passerby.<eos> There he goes.<eos> Look, he's heading in the same direction Hoffman took the girl.<eos> Or he could be going to a bar.<eos> Or he was checking to make sure no one was following them, before joining Hoffman and killing the woman.<eos> That's got to be Hoffman's accomplice.<eos> Man without a face.<eos> Spoke to the neighbors.<eos> They barely knew Hoffman.
Nothing.<eos> Pizza.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Ted, you told them, didn't you? Told them what?<eos> You told them that I haven't had sex in five years.<eos> You haven't had sex in five years? !<eos> That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!<eos> Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them.<eos> But they're my best friends.

I shouldn't have told them.<eos> But they're my best friends.<eos> I tell them everything.<eos> I-I didn't even think about it.<eos> Ted, that was so personal.<eos> Plus, now your friends think I'm a freak.<eos> No, they don't.
- Possibly.<eos> I've marked all the footprints in the area as you asked, sir.<eos> Take castings of all of the prints, George, and compare them to anyone who had access to or were in the corral.<eos> One of the sets may belong to our killer.<eos> Sir.<eos> George.<eos> What happened to the horses?<eos> They've been processed by now, sir.<eos> Processed?<eos> They were on their way to the rendering vats when the body was found.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Sir, may I ask you a question?<eos> What?<eos> From the beginning of this investigation, you've been singularly hard on these children.<eos> - No, I haven't.<eos> - Yes, sir, you have.<eos> You've assumed their guilt right from the start.<eos> These children are given every chance in the world and look what they do with it.<eos> They live in abject poverty.<eos> They're torn from their parents, shipped to another country.
Rodney.<eos> Detective Murdoch.<eos> And...<eos> Inspector Brackenreid.<eos> I heard about Flora.<eos> I couldn't believe it.<eos> What about the Dunlap children?<eos> I would have thought their well-being would have been utmost in your mind.<eos> Well, of course, it is, but...<eos> Mr. Baker, do you ever follow up with the children once they're sent to their placements?
- You know what my first professor said about me?<eos> He said my pen must have been touched by the gods.<eos> He said my potential was unlimited.<eos> - What's wrong with you, Daniel?<eos> - He was wrong.<eos> All I had was potential, nothing more.<eos> I have craft and diligence and a PhD, and it's amounted to a thousand pages of mediocrity.<eos> I'm going downstairs to Rachel.<eos> As I toiled in the dark, where were the gods then?<eos> Where were they?
We pulled it down immediately.<eos> Once it's on the Internet, it's out there forever.<eos> Owen knew that.<eos> - Did Owen tell his father about it?<eos> - Not at first. But when Owen quit the wrestling team, his father confronted him.<eos> I mean, he blamed Owen for the whole thing.<eos> He only joined the team to get his father's approval.<eos> How were these boys punished?<eos> Owen identified them, but on film all we had was their voices.<eos> I mean, even if they admitted involvement, all they had to do was say that Owen didn't have to do it.
- Why?<eos> Because that shadow hasn't gone, it's moved.<eos> Reminder.<eos> The library has been breached.<eos> - Hello, sweetie.<eos> - Get out.<eos> Doctor...<eos> All of you, turn around, get back in your rocket and fly away.<eos> Tell your grandchildren you came to the library and lived.<eos> They won't believe you.
Eva?<eos> Just like ollie.<eos> Not quite.<eos> This one's rich, white, and famous.<eos> his driver's license, cut in half.<eos> What's this?<eos> Planning a party?<eos> A list of names.<eos> i never saw nor contacted my parents again.<eos> I heard later they had believed i had died in the indian wars.
Yeah, I think baby and Brooke needs a little explanation.<eos> Okay, so the adoption agency has this program where babies from other countries who need major surgeries and stuff come over to the US and doctors donate their time to fix them up and then they go home.<eos> - Oh, cool. - That's great.<eos> It's kind of a whenever-they-can- squeeze-you-in sort of thing and the agency had a family, that was supposed to host the baby, drop out, so they said this could be a great trial run for me. - When does the baby show up?<eos> - Is it a boy or girl?<eos> - Where are his parents, the poor thing?<eos> - And are his parents coming, too?<eos> She's a girl. And she gets here tomorrow.<eos> Her parents don't come with her. And they didn't tell me what's wrong with her.<eos> They're just sort of gonna hand her over and we go from there.
Scientists are currently placing bets on the winner.<eos> When it comes to the biggest things in the universe... some black holes earn a place in the record books.<eos> A black hole is a region of space... where the pull of gravity is so immense... that nothing can escape it, not even light.<eos> There are billions upon billions ofthese black monsters... prowling the universe.<eos> They come in two size categories.<eos> Most ofthem are the stellar mass black holes... which are about five to 100 times... the mass of our sun.<eos> And then there are supermassive black holes... that are millions to billions of times the mass of the sun.<eos> We have the supermassive black holes... the kind that we seem to be finding... in the centers of every galaxy... where we've had the resources to look.<eos> Havoc is wrought upon your environment... ifyou're a star orbiting... close to one ofthese supermassive black holes... in the centers of these galaxies.<eos> Black holes are not physically large regions... but when measuring their mass... they become top competitors... in the galactic heavyweight division.
We know this from the one man that survived...<eos> - Menander. - (chokes)<eos> Menander?<eos> You could take anything he says with a pinch of salt.<eos> The cyclops is a story told by drunkards and beggars.<eos> Those beasts were exterminated long ago when Augustus himself wiped out the last of them.<eos> And even if one cyclops did still exist, he's hardly a threat to Rome.<eos> That's not your decision to make, is it?<eos> I suggest you muster your men at once.<eos> Apparently they'll have to carry you up the road.

To Rome!<eos> Falco: I have a little problem to tell you about.<eos> Saragosa is complaining that he ordered two lions and two tigers for the games.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - But the cyclops attacked the caravan bringing them from Carthage. Supposedly he tore the animals apart<eos> - and ate them.<eos> - What a beast!<eos> - What's this?<eos> - The price of the animals.<eos> Saragosa expects me to pay for them?<eos> They were killed on a Roman road.
- Maybe later.<eos> Maybe later I'll be busy.<eos> - Why are you so sure I want you?<eos> You have a boyfriend in the U.S., don't you?<eos> Are you a cheat now, too?<eos> Ever since my father was injured I've had to be tough.<eos> I've had to carry everyone through.<eos> You know what's lucky, though?<eos> That my parents love each other.<eos> They don't lie to each other.
It's got the wrong number too.<eos> Keep the jersey.<eos> Kid, look, if you're gonna like somebody, at least get it right. Get it right.<eos> Get it right.<eos> Next stop: Brockman Station.<eos> Man, that was close.<eos> I never thought I'd say this, but thank God for Risky.<eos> Chris and Drew are missing?<eos> No, I haven't seen them, but I think I can help you.<eos> For just 17 cents a day, you can adopt one of these African children, and the best part is they don't live with you.
Yes, of course.<eos> Francis was primarily interested in subjects who were, in one way or another, trapped inside their own minds.<eos> That's Miss Pringle playing the violin.<eos> Miss Pringle possesses an extraordinary brain for a woman.<eos> For a woman?<eos> Men have a brain capacity of up to 19% larger.<eos> Women's brains are not designed for complex thought, their reproductive organs sapping energy from any further development.<eos> And this has been proven?<eos> There are naysayers, of course.<eos> You know, they said the same of Darwin.
- Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Can you...?<eos> Stop the car!<eos> Stop the car!<eos> It's done.<eos> So are either of the kids' fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?<eos> Abi's dad sends money and a card each birthday.<eos> Rob's dad, nothing at all.<eos> I could come if you want. To the dance.<eos> They'd love that.
Everything is cool.<eos> Just sit tight, and I'll be out of here in 30 seconds.<eos> Must've shot his wife after that.<eos> And forced you to go back in to retrieve the phone.<eos> Everybody on the ground.<eos> Except by then the bank had already opened.<eos> Everybody on the ground!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> And you've been in contact with the original bank robbers the whole time.<eos> They're waiting for me to get out of here with... with their phone.

Chasing people is so much different when you're a vampire.<eos> A vampire is always in control. It's easy to forget that it isn't just a game.<eos> And I can't deny the rush... - Please. - ...when I catch the bad guy.<eos> - I didn't wanna kill her. - Then why did you?<eos> I had to pay back the investors.<eos> With Tierney gone, the insurance kicked in force majeure.<eos> It's not an act of god when you kill somebody, Abbott.<eos> You murdered that girl.<eos> She would have done anything for you, but you killed her!<eos> My investors are bad news. They were gonna kill me.
I can't tell you why, but I can tell you where.<eos> Substituting a capture scenario for a kill scenario, my analysis generated probable fields of battle where our two players will likely meet up.<eos> L.A.P.D. got the call.<eos> Eyewitness saw three guys load a duffel bag from the back of a van, tossed it in a dumpster.<eos> The van matched the description of the one at the Porter house the night of the home invasion.<eos> We've got something here.<eos> I commend you on your police work. Though it's not like three guys dumping a body in broad daylight isn't going to draw some attention.<eos> I want to make sure this makes the evening news.<eos> Maybe this will help.<eos> Please, they're gonna kill me.
WOMAN:<eos> It's... coffee, maybe... I...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> Is he going to be okay?<eos> Patmos Church was founded in 1978, hit the NRM list in '93.<eos> NRM?<eos> "New Religious Movement."<eos> They believe the Apocalypse has been going on for 70 years. Started with World War II-- and that the Book of Revelation proves that Hitler released Lucifer and he is here on earth specifically targeting them.<eos> I thought cults believe they were the first to get into Heaven.
You're worried they're not gonna like me?<eos> No.<eos> I think we should just wait till tomorrow night.<eos> Um, what are you gonna wear tomorrow?<eos> She is worried they're not gonna like me.<eos> Charlie, you're gonna make her late.<eos> All right, I'll wait up for you.<eos> Oh, um, no, no, I don't know.<eos> I mean, I think it's kind of weird me staying here while my parents are here.<eos> Well, they'll be at a hotel. I mean, how would they ever know?
They don't give a fuck, boy.<eos> And they in Barack's ass. Whoever Barack know is being investigated.<eos> If you know Barack Obama, they are tapping your phone right now.<eos> They are in your ass. And that's where McCain has the advantage cos all his friends are dead.<eos> Yeah, man, but this whole election is so... is so weird. Just the way they report on it, the way they cover it.<eos> Everything's so racial, racial, racial.<eos> "How many white people are voting?<eos> How many working-class white people? "How many white people over 4'8" are voting for Obama?"<eos> You know?<eos> And the crazy thing is, whenever white people vote for Barack Obama, which is a lot of the time, they go,

What role did a piece of paper play in the exorcising of a changeling?<eos> More to the point, what role did it play in her murder?<eos> So, Maggie Gilpatrick is in the park.<eos> Someone is stalking her.<eos> They catch her and force the piece of paper down her throat.<eos> Perhaps as a punishment of some sort?<eos> Or she ate it to keep anyone else from having it.<eos> It's blank.<eos> Except for these small holes.<eos> Yes, they're not punctures or tears.
No.<eos> Why not?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's not really me, sir.<eos> I insist.<eos> All right.<eos> Very good.<eos> The boys would have a good laugh to see me in such finery.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> They would respect you.
Michelle?<eos> Working some slick jobs in some fine suits.<eos> Now you.<eos> Where do you see yourself in five years?<eos> Haven't thought about it, have you?<eos> No.<eos> I'll be with my friends, having a laugh.<eos> Somewhere.<eos> But don't you get it?<eos> They've got their plans, their futures.
Mac told me, I know.<eos> The thing is that when his parents came in for the conference...<eos> - Lighting hair on fire...<eos> - it was discovered that he never told them that he's playing football.<eos> He forged their signature on the permission slip and they're pulling him off the team.<eos> - Tami, what did you do?<eos> - What do you mean, what did I do?<eos> What did you do?<eos> What do you mean, they're pulling off the team?<eos> Hon, they didn't know he was playing football. He forged their signature...
Sinclair?<eos> Every five minutes, it's someone else.<eos> Half the brass wants me working the cab driver serial.<eos> But you caught a murder at an elite prep school whose alumni contributes half the mayor's campaign funds.<eos> Not to mention Deputy Inspector Gerrard's daughter is a student here.<eos> Until we catch this cab driver, my phone's not going to stop ringing.<eos> Matter of time.<eos> I got uniforms conducting taxi checkpoints throughout the five boroughs, flyers distributed to dispatchers, and foot posts on bridges and overpasses in case he decides to dump another victim.<eos> Maybe we need to use the media.<eos> They already know we're looking for a yellow cab, rigged to allow carbon monoxide to flow into the passenger compartment.
She went home hours ago.<eos> She's the money.<eos> I'm the brains.<eos> She leaves early. I stay late.<eos> America, America.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How about I follow you home?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> And you'll view the suspects from in here.<eos> You'll be able to see them and hear them, but they won't be able to see you.
Do you see wendy?<eos> Are you looking at wendy?<eos> Bye-Bye.<eos> Hey, wendy, can you help me with him?<eos> This is so good.<eos> Very good.<eos> Do you know where she was calling from?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know anything about her parents?<eos> I mean, they're the ones that will get custody,
Four.<eos> That's right, the number 'four.'<eos> As in one, two, three, four.<eos> You've all done your homework well.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No drawing in class!<eos> Not like that.<eos> You're not good.<eos> Look.<eos> I want to draw trains and buses, but they pass too quickly.
No, it's just this stupid list<eos> About everything i want in a girlfriend,<eos> And it's long, and i'm going to cut it down, so i--<eos> This is really great.<eos> Really?<eos> Mm-Hmm.<eos> You know, because the guys think it's unrealistic,<eos> And they think my standards are too high.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, ben, they are wrong.
It'll explain all those times i've been weird Or showed up late to something. It's that part of my life i told you i couldn't talk about.<eos> Sam works for the devil.<eos> What? What?<eos> It's not that big of a deal.<eos> [Sighs] my other job That i was telling you about... i'm a bounty hunter for hell.<eos> Andi, hold on!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Is this your idea of some sick joke?<eos> Before i was born, my parents got into some trouble.<eos> And to get out of it, they... they sold my soul to the devil.
i kind of figured this might happen and i made alternate arrangements.<eos> i had a very candid discussion with our immigration officer. he has agreed to accept a b-r-i-b-e.<eos> a bribe?<eos> if we pay him,he is willing to 'lose' the file.<eos> i don't get kicked out of the country, you don't go to jail.<eos> ok,but wouldn't that be doing something illegal to cover up something illegal?<eos> i mean- mm-hmm. sure.<eos> i mean,if you're willing to pay your little fine and just throw me to the wolves?<eos> there are no wolves.<eos> they'll just be sending you back to where you came from.
Yeah, he was.<eos> What about your friends?<eos> You think they've gone off, just like the cards say?<eos> Yes.<eos> –So you're not worried about them?<eos> –Why should I be?<eos> I'm actually quite pissed off with them.<eos> They took off without telling me just cos I was sick, right?<eos> So then I had to go to my parents in France cos I didn't have any excuse not to.<eos> And then they really pissed me off and I came back to that... horrible house.
Olivia?<eos> Bobby?<eos> Salt line.<eos> Emf olivia was rocking the emf meter.<eos> Spirit activity.<eos> Yeah - - On steroids.<eos> I never seen a ghost do this to a person. Boy,you all right?<eos> I called some hunters nearby...<eos> Good. We can use their help.<eos> ...except they ain't answering their phones either.
I'm guessing that's not a show at seaworld.<eos> Those seals are being broken by lilith.<eos> She did the spell.<eos> She rose the witnesses.<eos> Mm-Hmm.<eos> And not just here.<eos> -20 other hunters are dead.<eos> -Of course.<eos> She picked victims that the hunters couldn't save<eos> So that they would barrel right after us.
[ strained voice ] the wishes turn bad,sam.<eos> the wishes turn very bad.<eos> the sandwich,huh?<eos> the coin was babylonian.<eos> it's cursed.<eos> i found some fragments of a legend.<eos> i'm good.<eos> the,uh... the serpent is tiamat, which is the,uh,babylonian god of primordial chaos.<eos> i guess their,uh,priests were working some serious black magic.<eos> they made the coin?
I sold them all.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Well, I just found out that I'm not going to be in the recital anymore.<eos> Oh, no, what happened?<eos> The teacher said you're one of her best dancers.<eos> You know my partner, Derrick, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, he had a ballet accident, and he broke his ankle.<eos> Well, what happened?<eos> Well, he told some guys that he did ballet, and they broke his ankle.
The elections are pretty serious, OK, we're fighting a war here.<eos> Not me.<eos> Did he touch you? !<eos> You can't tell me what to do!<eos> These men are not just a group of thugs.<eos> They're thugs with a cause.<eos> You got some Jew blood in you somewhere?<eos> What you did was completely unacceptable.<eos> George had a tattoo.<eos> They all had that tattoo, all the crew.

The tying up, the swapping of the shoes were all intended to make the body unserviceable to the evil spirits, the Chindi.<eos> The Chindi are the evil spirits.<eos> So what about the chopping off of the fingertips?<eos> They believe that your fingertips and your hair is where the evil spirits enter the body. Oh.<eos> OK?<eos> So the purpose of the whole burial was to prevent the ghost from entering and haunting the living.<eos> I understand the purpose of the Navajo ritual.<eos> Why did it happen to a white male in England?<eos> Well, maybe the killer was a believer.<eos> Right, these guys, what are they?
Strong winds whipping in from the west blow the sand into ever higher dunes.<eos> Over millennia, mega-dunes build up.<eos> Walls of sand soaring to over 500 metres tall.<eos> Camels are the only beasts of burden that can tackle these monstrous dunes.<eos> Their feet are wide and splay outwards to stop them sinking in loose sand.<eos> The wind that whips the sand into dunes has created other bizarre shapes in China's western deserts.<eos> Mysterious giant structures, known as Yardangs, were sculpted by flying sand.<eos> The wind brought other hazards to travellers in these deserts.<eos> Marco Polo wrote,<eos> "Sometimes the stray travellers will hear the tramp and hum "of a great cavalcade of people away from the real line of march "and taking this to be their own company they will follow the sound.

The most northerly desert in the world.<eos> The Junggar is a place of surprises.<eos> This bizarre landscape is called the Five Coloured Hills.<eos> And though very little lives here now, the ancestors of Tyrannosaurus Rex once roamed these hills, their fossils only discovered in 2006.<eos> But the Junggar is not entirely lifeless.<eos> In the darkness, a little Roborovski's Hamster emerges to search for food.<eos> They're the world's smallest hamsters, the size of a Ping-Pong ball.<eos> And they live in family groups of around 10.<eos> Unlike the Kazakhs, hamsters can't migrate to avoid the severity of winter.<eos> They have to prepare for difficult times by storing up provisions to spend the season underground.
In 2006, the reserve reared 16 cubs, and there are now more captive-bred pandas at Wolong than can be safely released back into the shrinking wild habitat.<eos> In nature, giant pandas learn survival skills from their mother, but have little contact with other pandas.<eos> These youngsters may have exceptional social skills, but they wouldn't have a clue how to survive in the wild.<eos> For the majority, their future lies in zoos.<eos> While the ultimate value of captive breeding projects like this is debatable, there are places in China where animals are being successfully protected in their wild habitat.<eos> Right at the top of the Qinling Mountains lives a rare and mysterious creature that has inspired legends as far away as ancient Greece.<eos> The size of a buffalo and with a temper to match, this is the original owner of the golden fleece, the golden taking.<eos> Golden taking make their way to the top of the mountains for the breeding season.<eos> It's an opportunity for the males to prove their mettle.<eos> They are formidable and aggressive creatures.
- Let me call you back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I have news.<eos> We found your friends.<eos> The doctors.<eos> Where are they?<eos> In jail.<eos> - Why?<eos> - They were found guilty.
I've been trying to find a way<eos> To say thank you.<eos> Good, because I have a task for you.<eos> Good.<eos> This is dr. mendel's.<eos> He thinks he knows who did it.<eos> Those people are ruining this town.<eos> And who would "those people" be, dr. mendel?<eos> Those dog lunatics.<eos> They're the ones that broke into my lab.
Excuse me.<eos> I'm nine and I'm a junior.<eos> I don't play house.<eos> Then what are we doing here?<eos> Take a look.<eos> Kylie, can you remind me what our assignment was?<eos> Build a working model of the solar system.<eos> Took that a bit literally, did you?<eos> How'd you get all the planets to orbit like that?<eos> They are not the problem.
All right. Zane's working on it too.<eos> And in the meantime, Thorne's wiping out any evidence that connects her to these bodies.<eos> - Any idea who they were?<eos> - I'm getting conflicting information.<eos> How so?<eos> From the surveillance photos, their approximate age is somewhere between 35 and 45 when they entered the room in 1939.<eos> - The organic residue that you scanned establishes that they also died in 1939.<eos> With you so far. So they were buried there for 70 years?<eos> Yeah, here's the really puzzling thing.<eos> Common sense says they were around 40 when they died.
We guarantee confidentiality.<eos> Are you refusing to cooperate?<eos> You wouldn't expect a priest to break the secrets of the confessional.<eos> The goods here possess a sanctity that is far from any commercial considerations.<eos> Oh, for crying out loud!<eos> If you want to continue any further with this, I suggest you speak to our solicitor.<eos> I will come back for your customer list and if I don't get it, you will be the one having to speak to your solicitor.<eos> It's a book no-one knows about - a book of power.<eos> I can use that power to banish the demons.<eos> They'll obey me then.
Sleep well.<eos> - Go!<eos> I'm sorry my parents are so embarrassing!<eos> I think they're nice.<eos> And the worst part is that their bedroom is right in there, you can hear everything!<eos> What, they snore?<eos> - Well, that too.<eos> But... You know...<eos> - No!<eos> - When they. Ah! Ah!
Have a good old fucking wallow.<eos> But I've bought a tour jacket especially.<eos> It's leather, and it has lapels, so I can wear it to work.<eos> If you start working for the Gestapo.<eos> Look, man, we're a rock band, yeah?<eos> If people see us hanging out with a donk like you - not being rude...<eos> You are being rude. ...then that takes away our credibility.<eos> - You got a bloody suitcase on wheels.<eos> Real men don't get the Earth to help carry their luggage.<eos> They carry it themselves.
Yes.<eos> Me too.<eos> You know, there used to be a public park here full of flowers.<eos> - Really ?<eos> - And before that, this was an orchard<eos> I did not know that.<eos> So you've lived here all your life ?<eos> Yes, I was born here. And you?<eos> I was born in Germany, and then my parents emigrated.<eos> They didn't want to raise me in Germany
The Inbetweeners 1x5 Caravan Club<eos> Hi, I'm Will, and as a special treat I now get to finish my A-Levels at a State comprehensive.<eos> Posh twat.<eos> Everyone's made me feel very welcome.<eos> Briefcase wanker.<eos> - I have made some friends.<eos> - Oh, friend!<eos> Unfortunately, they're bigger losers than me... Which means, while other people get to play pool and hang out, I spend my free periods tied to a chair with a rubbish bin on my head.
Their website states that their primary objective Is to take down the military industrial complex Of the united states.<eos> Of which we are a part.<eos> If their online following keeps growing At its present rate, They might actually be able to do it.<eos> These guys are becoming a pop phenomenon.<eos> Top hit on all search engines.<eos> What do they call themselves?<eos> Nikki and max for a free america.<eos> You aren't serious.<eos> Unfortunately, I am.<eos> Wow, they're hot.
Of course it is. Great.<eos> That narrows it down.<eos> We got something here. Looks like an oil leak.<eos> That's correct, michael.<eos> Is that leak from the getaway car?<eos> Based on its viscosity, and level of oxidation, There is a 93% chance it is.<eos> Kitt, analyze the roads within 100-mile radius And search for a car with a fluid leak At the same rate per distance.<eos> There are exactly 47 vehicles within those parameters.<eos> Probability is high That one of them Is the vehicle max is driving.<eos> They should be within striking distance of nikki and max.
dude...brighton? the meltdown?<eos> - oh... - wake up.<eos> yeah,yeah,albany. it was,uh... hey,uh...where are you from again,tom?<eos> omaha.<eos> your folks still live there?<eos> no. they died when i was two.<eos> i didn't know that.<eos> sorry.<eos> how about your folks?<eos> they,uh--heh. they died in a car accident.
That's not a good side effect in a seven-year-old.<eos> Christopher Ryan.<eos> What's he on?<eos> Experimental med for ADHD.<eos> Who authorized that?<eos> Not the kid.<eos> Foster mother allowed to put his health at risk just to make a buck off of him?<eos> I think there's some confusion here.<eos> The rules for kids are different from adults.<eos> They have to have the disease or the condition that's being studied.
Get to work!<eos> My people.<eos> PICKLES: Hey, what do you think they plan on doing with us?<eos> Hopefully they will rapes us with thems womens.<eos> What if they kills us?<eos> Doesn't anyone want to know how I'm doing?<eos> Don't kill me!<eos> I-I'm pregnant with parasites!<eos> I have to live!<eos> They depend on me. SKWISGAAR:
No, I didn't.<eos> Well, then, how do you explain that your prints and the victim's blood are all over her flash drive?<eos> Maybe I picked it up.<eos> Yeah, I-I think I picked it up.<eos> The blood is under your prints.<eos> The only way that could have happened is if you killed her.<eos> You may think I'm a monster, but when I got home,and I read the files on Ann Steele's flash drive, I realized who the real monsters in this city are.<eos> They're the people sitting in the board rooms, running the courts, riding in the ticker tape parades.<eos> What are you going to do about them?<eos> They didn't commit murder, Trevor.
I am afraid thats it's all true.<eos> Takes us in to the police officers.<eos> We are guilty as charged.<eos> [ clears throat ] Introduction.<eos> Sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> That's Pickles and Murderface and -- you get the idea.<eos> They all have names and everything.<eos> What are you guys doing over there?<eos> Nothing.<eos> They're playing a game.
Gentlemen, as you know, these bombings are deliberate and not accidental.<eos> We've got to find out who it is.<eos> General Crozier.<eos> This mysterious car was seen leaving the last bombing.<eos> We did a face-recognition scan.<eos> It came up with former Dethklok superfan and webmaster Edgar Jomfru.<eos> And the suspect who planted the bombs?<eos> He appears to be a young boy wearing a dead-skin mask of Eric Jomfru.<eos> The Jomfru brothers have been missing since International Fan Day.<eos> It's been rumored that they were being held prisoner in Mordhaus.
Yeah, fuckers are on the career-maker of the year.<eos> They nail this Freebo guy and they're golden.<eos> The courts already let Freebo go once for those two girls in the Everglades.<eos> That was then. This time he killed a senior ADA's brother.<eos> Caffeine fix.<eos> Except he didn't kill Oscar.<eos> I did.<eos> If it hadn't been for Freebo, Oscar would still be alive, and I wouldn't be in this mess.<eos> Besides, he's seen my face.<eos> I've gotta find Freebo before they do.
As long as I'm locked up in here and diro is out there, everything is at risk.<eos> Diro's probably back in munich playing quarters with co-eds by now.<eos> Diro kesakian has been working for her father's illegal businesses since she was 15, and she's not going to stop now.<eos> I need to find her.<eos> I'm not your Armenian lojack.<eos> I don't know where she is.<eos> Zadofian, that hit man that you shot, he'll know where diro's hiding.<eos> Find him.<eos> Turn him over to my men.<eos> They will extract the truth, and I'll get diro.
Dude, one of those assholes murdered her!<eos> You think this wasn't an accident?<eos> Those goddamned beaners have been hassling us ever since we rented this space.<eos> Um, this is a commercial building?<eos> It's a rehearsal space.<eos> Lana was our lead singer.<eos> Yeah, rent's cheap in this neighborhood.<eos> The tenants next door didn't like the music?<eos> It was one of them, man.<eos> They killed her.
As soon as Detective Mackey gets back to us with the details.<eos> Rios isn't just some beaner.<eos> He's got a face only a cartel could love.<eos> I got Julien looking into him now.<eos> What do I tell Rezian?<eos> Beauty is, tell him the truth.<eos> Pezuela is not sending his boy unless he knows the blackmail box is waiting.<eos> So the meet-and-greet doesn't even happen.<eos> No, we look like we did our job for both sides.<eos> They stay clueless and at war.
Well, Vic may be a lot of things but he cares about his kids.<eos> Yeah, well, when Cassidy came to my house the other day she had a different take on it.<eos> Okay, sorry.<eos> It's not my business, all right.<eos> It's why I called you to come get her but Lee is my business.<eos> Come on, you know this guy better than anybody and with Vic, it's all about him all the time.<eos> What good does it do my kids to drag their father's dirty laundry into a courtroom?<eos> Just tell your side of things to the judge, okay?<eos> The records are gonna be sealed.<eos> They never even have to know.
Why do you want shared custody?<eos> Because I have shared responsibility.<eos> That's bullshit, Vic.<eos> You've had 14 years to be the most important part of Cassidy's life.<eos> Never once has she been your top priority.<eos> Given where she is in her life right now I'd do things differently.<eos> I don't want to make the same mistake with Lee.<eos> This baby gives you a do-over?<eos> How can I be an example to our three kids look them in the eye if I just walk away from this other child?<eos> I mean, they know about him, for Christ's sake.
- Yes, sir!<eos> We got the statue, so our mission is accomplished.<eos> I'd like to see the statue with the list of people who have been bothering us.<eos> Well, I just happen to..<eos> have it right here.<eos> Oriental Express from Switzerland to Shanghai<eos> How can you laugh at a time like this?<eos> Our agents' lives are in danger.<eos> I can't believe you!<eos> How would they know our agents?
KRANZ: Seconds later, I happened to see sort of a flicker over on the TV.<eos> MAN: flight GC, we've had negative contact.<eos> Okay, all operators watch your data carefully.<eos> KRANZ: And I looked over, and I saw this picture of this expanding fireball with pieces moving in all directions.<eos> NARRATOR: The crippled rocket boosters careen out of control.<eos> Specially declassified footage shows them being remotely destroyed.<eos> We have a report from the flight dynamics officer that the vehicle has exploded.<eos> -flight director confirms that.<eos> -Okay. We are looking at checking with the recovery forces to see what can be done at this point.<eos> I knew instantly that none of them could possibly survive because we didn't have parachutes, we didn't have pressure suits, and at the altitude that they broke up at, there was no way they were gonna maintain consciousness.
"Don't give those guys an opportunity to land, 'cause they might. "<eos> So the ascent module -- the part we lifted off the lunar surface with, was short-fueIed.<eos> The fuel tanks weren't full.<eos> So had we literally tried to land on the moon, we never could have gotten off. MAN #1 :<eos> Hey, Joe, we're about ready to dock. MAN #2 :<eos> Roger that.<eos> CERNAN : So we did everything except --<eos> You know, I tell neil I painted a white line in the sky so he wouldn't get lost.<eos> [ Laughs ] And that's about what we did.<eos> And they were able to concentrate pretty much on the descent itself, which, you know, turned out to be, obviously, a pretty big challenge for them.
Test pilots are trained to operate and analyze experimental flying machines.<eos> 110 of the military's best pilots qualify.<eos> NASA selects the top seven.<eos> These, ladies and gentlemen, are the nation's Mercury astronauts.<eos> The Mercury Seven astronauts become instant celebrities.<eos> The press follows their every move.<eos> BARBREE: You knew these guys.<eos> You lived with these guys.<eos> You socialized with them.<eos> They were the story.
What is your role in the family?<eos> What do you do?<eos> Do?<eos> Uh, I go to school. I hang out.<eos> I'm a kid.<eos> Are you?<eos> You think I'm lying?<eos> Why don't you check my passport or something?<eos> I simply meant that some children who've lost a parent feel pressure to take the place of the absent parent.<eos> They... Well, they grow up quickly.
Absolutely nothing seems to be happening.<eos> It appears to be completely dead, completely static.<eos> But ifwe speed up the clock, then we see the activity.<eos> The plant grows... the plant moves its leaves in response to where the Sun is... the plant is continuously in motion, it's continuously doing things... but that whole scale of existence is on a time frame that's longer... than what our experience is used to dealing with.<eos> The real action in the Black Hole Era occurs... when two black holes meet.<eos> Although invisible to human eyes, a collision between these two beasts... sends a shudder through space-time.<eos> This event can be imagined in a sheet of perfectly still, calm water.<eos> It's a bit like suddenly dropping a gigantic rock into that calm water... sending out a huge series of ripples... and you have a lot of action for a little bit oftime... but then that dissipates, the ripples die away... and you're back to that smooth, glass-like sheet ofwater.<eos> But even for these kings of the Black Hole Era... time is running out.<eos> And you might think, "Oh, they'll last forever"... but even they don't last forever... because they evaporate very, very slowly with time.
...Tet Offensive bullshit!<eos> Jesus, Mary and Joseph!<eos> I got some good men dying in there!<eos> Hold your sectors, men!<eos> Break break. Hitman Two, Hitman Two,<eos> - we need to back these Humvees back-- - Give me your radio. If there's one thing I learned in Ranger School...<eos> - Hand it to me, Captain.<eos> - ...it's that we must seize the initiative.<eos> Keep your eyes on those reeds.<eos> They could be massing a suicide R.P.G. team as we speak.
Merry almost Christmas, everybody.<eos> I have some great news.<eos> We are all getting-- - Frozen steaks. - Ipod nothings?<eos> - Colorful sweaters?<eos> - Nope, better.<eos> We are getting to participate in a charity program called "Letters to Santa."<eos> No, this is great.<eos> The post office collects letters that poor kids write to Santa, and then we go and buy them what they ask for.
* Yuletide carols being sung by the choir *<eos> * And folks dressed up like eskimos *<eos> * Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe *<eos> Liz Lemon, I know you're gonna be all alone on Christmas day.<eos> So if you like, you can spend it with the Jordans.<eos> I'd love to, Tracey.<eos> Good, we'll be over at 2:00.<eos> My kids have a peanut allergy, but dogs only eat steak.<eos> Okay.<eos> * They know that Santa's on his way... *
Oh.<eos> Cam's right.<eos> I tell all of my grad students not to be distracted by the standards set by Zack.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> You and me, Wendell, we need to talk.<eos> BRENNAN: If your back doesn't hurt, then why are you letting me drive?<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> Don't get used to it, okay?<eos> I heal really, really fast.<eos> My guys, they didn't find the victim's head in the pool, all right?
No, no, you don't know that.<eos> People have no idea if they're capable of ending a life until they're put in that situation.<eos> (sighs) In all of our sessions,<eos> I've had questions marks, because you, at heart, are not a killer.<eos> I got to...<eos> I got to tell Dr. Brenner and Booth.<eos> You can't tell them-- because I'm your patient, and you're not allowed, ethically.<eos> Zack, don't you want your friends to know that you didn't kill anyone?<eos> I'm still an accessory to murder.<eos> If you tell them, they'll take me out of here and put me in prison.
Anything like that? No. No more than usual.<eos> Have you noticed any signs of him not wanting to be touched?<eos> Okay, you are scaring me.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Please just answer my questions, if you would.<eos> Is Cory enrolled in school?<eos> Yes. Kindergarten.<eos> Have you heard anything from the teachers?<eos> Any problems there? Is that what this is about?<eos> All right, they completely overreacted when Cory played doctor with a little girl on the playground.
I can't change who I am. I was born this way.<eos> No one's born a deviant.<eos> Homosexuals were called deviants.<eos> And now, it's widely accepted that their orientation was hardwired at birth. Just like mine.<eos> I wasn't abused as a child.<eos> I mean, I don't choose to love little girls any more than they choose to love the same gender or you choose to love women.<eos> Gay people don't have sex with children.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> I admit I like delicious little angels ages three to nine.<eos> There's nothing I can do except keep my distance, since they can't legally consent. Your website is like a kiddie treasure map.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm not going to change my mind just because the kid has AIDS.<eos> I don't have AIDS.<eos> I have brain cancer.<eos> I told my parents I didn't feel well.<eos> But we're Christian Scientists, so we don't believe in doctors or medicine.<eos> What did they tell you to do?<eos> They said that they'd pray for me, too, and I knew I'd be okay.<eos> Because I believed like they did.
Jury calls that guilty.<eos> Money, you know how to play Getting the Dice? No.<eos> Here's how it goes.<eos> Your cellie rolls the dice.<eos> That's how many days you get to play his girlfriend.<eos> But I tell you what. You introduce me to Natalie's friends in the smuggling world, and I'll give you a break.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> These guys are psycho.<eos> The guy in charge most of all. Like, I changed the locks after they left. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Who's they?
dad deserves to know what?<eos> "oh,carl,wait until you hear this.apparently,your wife..."<eos> what the hell is going on?<eos> what was the puppet talking about?<eos> mom?<eos> carl,do you rember 1985?<eos> my wife's a whore!<eos> all neighbors are welcome!<eos> line forms at the garage!<eos> when you're little,and your parents split up, they decide who gets you.

We have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.<eos> Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five?<eos> Your mommy and daddy give you $10 to open up a lemonade stand.<eos> So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar.<eos> And now you find out that it only cost you $9.<eos> So you have an extra dollar.<eos> So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what?<eos> Next summer...<eos> I'll be six.<eos> And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you $9, 'cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand.
The international bands then.<eos> It would be a bad impact on the Indonesian youth. It was a mass demonstration as we had in 1998. The Evolution Meir, when Suharto aftrad by the student movement.<eos> After Suharto aftrad, there was was a type of energy Friday During the Suharto era was You do not express.<eos> Suddenly we were liberated from oppression.<eos> 52 years is not short term. It felt almost as if we all could do.<eos> Shortly after Suharto aftrad were a serious political underground.<eos> Most metal band singing in Jakarta political and social things. What I find more something for punk than metal feel.<eos> But the most popular Indonesian metalband Tengkorak, more controversial ideas.<eos> What are you trying to express by Tengkorak's music?<eos> We sing about our dissatisfaction of capitalist countries, third world countries because they always in verdomhoekje places.
I locked the door.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Bring up the main control systems<eos> And disable them one by one?<eos> That's one way to go.<eos> Well, you'd have to lock them out of the mainframe, though.<eos> Otherwise they could just turn them back on again.<eos> Do you have some sort of a passcode<eos> To make sure they're locked out
Provided you cooperate, you have my word we will leave peacefully.<eos> And if we don't?<eos> That would be a very unwise decision.<eos> Our hive will be here before the night is through.<eos> If you have not complied by then, I will give the word, and your entire village will be destroyed.<eos> Turn over these outsiders, and your lives will be spared.<eos> Resist, and you will all die together.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> They've already destroyed our homeworld.
Give me one reason why I shouldn't blow your head off.<eos> What for?<eos> How did the Wraith know to grab Beckett?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Doctor's been captured?<eos> I swear I had nothing to do with that.<eos> - What about your men?<eos> - No. No, there's no way.<eos> The doctor has been nothing but good to us.<eos> Well, they didn't just stumble across the clinic.
I don't know yet.<eos> I just need more time to think.<eos> Well, think faster.<eos> Because, sooner or later, those villagers are going to find this cave, and I don't want to be here when they do.<eos> Right.<eos> Good point.<eos> This way.<eos> That's the third patrol in the last 10 minutes.<eos> It seems as if the entire village is out looking for her.<eos> Let's hope we find her before they do.
- I am your queen.<eos> I command you-- - you are not my queen.<eos> How dare you speak to me like this.<eos> Remove yourself from my sight immediately.<eos> I saw you talking with the prisoners from atlantis.<eos> And?<eos> I may not interrogate prisoners on my own ship?<eos> Oh, you may, though it is odd that you refer to them as prisoners.<eos> I overheard what you said to them.<eos> You knew them, and they knew you, and I asked myself "how is such a thing possible?"
When she was born, her father didn't want her,<eos> Because he wanted to kill the little one.<eos> Many times, the mother find...<eos> The mother, when she comes home, She found her nearly dead, tied down.<eos> We have volunteers here now,<eos> This is their third time with us.<eos> They keep coming back.<eos> It's a life-changing event.<eos> They see children. They come in quite ill. They may even see one of our children die.<eos> It's not what we gave them; it's what they gave us, Because they gave us the reason to live.

Just a little...just every day, There's the same routine that we do,<eos> He's just like a little buddy. Victor was abandoned by his parents, Because when he was born, he didn't have any arms,<eos> And he only had one good leg and half a leg. And it was the nuns that brought him down here.<eos> I think they found him.<eos> You know, he was really badly nourished And just abandoned like that.<eos> And the joy of living, this is what the kids here have, The joy of living, Because they want to live,
Let's call Szabo and ask him.<eos> - He doesn't know I'm back.<eos> Why?<eos> Have you been away?<eos> The cops were watching me.<eos> I split.<eos> I don't think my cousins were too happy about that.<eos> Indeed, not happy at all.<eos> What did they say?<eos> They said... that you fucked up.
Cigarettes ?<eos> Cigarettes ?<eos> Martini ?<eos> I feel like I'm running a marathon.<eos> Well, at least you won't have to worry about your weight.<eos> Think Gloria could pitch in a little ?<eos> ...the Prince and the Princess lived happily ever after,"<eos> "for this is how such things ought to be."<eos> She says the books calm the kids down.<eos> I think she likes the story more than they do.
I don't know if she even got the chance.<eos> I think she did, Mr. McKinney.<eos> It was one of her students who brought these in.<eos> Remembered her all this time.<eos> The teachers she worked with...<eos> She ever mention any of them?<eos> I don't think they went out of their way to welcome her.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Laura did the same job for less money.<eos> Guess they perceived the program as a threat.
Friends?<eos> Not really.<eos> No,Danny was kind of a...kind of an odd duck.<eos> On the night of the moon landing,did you see him around?<eos> No,I was at home watching it on TV.<eos> Pinnacle of human achievement.<eos> You with anyone?<eos> Yeah,I was,I was with,uh,Seth Rundgren and Bobby Kent.<eos> Haven't seen those guys in years.<eos> - They lived on my block.
No dog, no alarm and definitely no lights.<eos> Tells us the unsub's patient enough to find a house that's vulnerable.<eos> There's the neighbor.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> Nail polish remover?<eos> I think so.<eos> He get under the sink?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I've seen this kind of thing before with burglaries when the criminal is a substance abuser.<eos> Oftentimes they huff household cleaners, just so they can get high.
Reid, are you in front of a map?<eos> Yeah, I am now.<eos> I think I know how the unsub's getting around.<eos> Do you see tracks linking Bakersfield to Sacramento?<eos> He's hopping trains.<eos> The guy we're looking for is using freight trains to get around.<eos> He targets homes within a mile of the tracks.<eos> Bulls and 'bos don't usually cross paths.<eos> Bulls and 'bos?<eos> They call rail cops bulls.
So, we got something.<eos> Jewelry stolen from the home in Sacramento turned up at a pawn shop in Modesto.<eos> Garcia just sent you a picture from the security cam.<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> Employee said he was about 5'8", slight, late thirties, dark skin.<eos> With a red rash around his mouth.<eos> Circulate the picture, JJ.<eos> I'm already on it.<eos> As it turns out, all the big farms set up housing camps for the workers during harvest.<eos> But these camps are partly subsidized by the state, thus they require ID and a strict sign-in policy, giving us a way to track migrants.

All right.
In fact, it was close enough To be seen from the road.<eos> That tells us he's trying To separate his actions From himself.<eos> Yet, he wanted to be able To drive out and visit The body.<eos> This is about remorse.<eos> Which is why we believe There's a good chance He'll be there today.<eos> Ok.<eos> If you sense someone looking At you, you need to tell us.<eos> We're conditioned To feel fear.<eos> The little hairs On the back of your neck?<eos> They tell us the truth.
That's not the rules.<eos> You're right.<eos> Your rules.<eos> It was good of you to go To the funeral today.<eos> You must have really Cared about ethan.<eos> I loved him.<eos> His parents didn't deserve him.<eos> I took good care of him.<eos> Is that why you bought Him the new clothes?<eos> They put him in those Silly blue sneakers And lime-green oxford.
Bye.<eos> You do know we want them to actually join the bureau?<eos> What?<eos> We want these kids to think it's a cool place to work.<eos> I understand that,yeah.<eos> Existentialism?<eos> Existentialism is- - Yes?<eos> That was a funny joke. What do you mean?<eos> Yeah,to sigmund freud.<eos> I tell them i shouldn't-- they keep on sending me here. I don't know why.
It's over.<eos> No.<eos> It's not.<eos> Not until you see this.<eos> Hello?<eos> Kevin?<eos> Sergeant Pierce isn't coming,Dr. Nesic.<eos> But he was,um... kind enough to let me have the missing video.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> When he broke in,he just wanted to destroy the lab and free the chimps,but they attacked him.
She is so cute!<eos> Oh, do you want to hold her?<eos> Or the baby shower Lily threw for her friend Erika?<eos> Are you leing that baby sniff you?<eos> I don't want to get bitten.<eos> And don't forget about...<eos> - Talking baby commercial?<eos> - Talking baby commercial.<eos> But you're not like that, Lily.<eos> You love kids and they love you.
Izzie's awesome.<eos> We love Izzie.<eos> This is dr.Grey.<eos> She's gonna prep you for surgery and answer any more questions you have.<eos> Izzie's not staying?<eos> This is a surgical program.<eos> Psychiatry is on the fifth floor.<eos> Let's not confuse the two.<eos> In addition, residents, your interns reflect on you.<eos> If they fail, you fail.
I just want to knock one of 'em out of the park for you.<eos> There we go.<eos> Anyway, now you remember that the, uh, grandparents of the boy in France filed a petition for custody?<eos> Getman told me not to worry about it.<eos> Well, that was when we were all under the impression that you were actually the father.<eos> Feel free to worry about it now. Wait.<eos> They know?<eos> How the hell did they find out?<eos> I thought we were gonna keep this within the family.<eos> Well, they subpoenaed our evidence, which included your paternity test.
I was so stupid to think that he would like me!<eos> Of course he likes Amanda.<eos> Amanda?<eos> They were kissing.<eos> I should've known that when he said I was beautiful, he meant on the inside.<eos> - You are. - You don't have to say that, Daniel.<eos> I'm fine with who I am.<eos> But I'm not beautiful.<eos> Betty, men are stupid.<eos> They go for the obvious.
Heroin or opiates or those types of the OxyContins can be reversed.<eos> Overdoses can be reversed with drugs that paramedics keep.<eos> They can be virtually brought back to life by using Narcan and different things that paramedics have.<eos> Heroin is a central nervous system depressant.<eos> It basically shuts down various functions of the brain.<eos> It is not going to be that spectacular. I mean... And it's easy to miss it.<eos> You know, this person may just sort of nod off and...<eos> You know, unless you're paying attention to see if they're breathing, they may just look like they're happily passed out on the couch.<eos> We're dealing with good kids. Normal kids. Kids that you never would imagine getting into a drug environment.<eos> And they're starting out experimenting with small things that usually leads them into a direction they never would have seen themselves.
- Look,like I said - - you're fine.<eos> You can handle it.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Look,I hope that's true,and maybe it is,but... the thing is,the two of us have been down very similar roads.<eos> I mean,we were in the same cliques first.<eos> We both felt the same pressures,same expectations.<eos> Our parents were like children, and we both grew into kind of bad versions of ourselves way too fast.<eos> So I think you know I get it.<eos> They never really gave us a chance,did they -- our parents?<eos> They didn't know how.
What did I say?<eos> Think the cops are on holidays?<eos> Sorry, Mus.<eos> Is all this yours?<eos> Like it?<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Collect all the mobiles.<eos> Give me your mobiles.<eos> Do we park?<eos> - We split before they spot us.
Look...<eos> The Blues Brothers...<eos> - Will you show them to Wagner?<eos> - You bet.<eos> Forced entry, intimidating a witness...<eos> What do I do?<eos> Wait to be taken to the slaughterhouse?<eos> Let your lawyer handle it.<eos> If you had balls, you'd have smashed their faces and shut the fuckers up.<eos> Instead, when you need friends they're sadly missing.
I finished this lane.<eos> I beat you, bitches.<eos> Hey, shreep rat.<eos> - Don't move! - Hey, hey, hey!<eos> I'm not here to kill you.<eos> I'm here to help you turn the tables on Mac and Dennis.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I wanna show those bastards today, it ain't ok to hunt humans.<eos> Yeah?<eos> They drew first blood, not you.

Some of the artists who... with a song or tune from a particular producer, and that tune never even got released in Jamaica but that tune got released over here.<eos> So that artist will be really a name over here but in Jamaica he's not really known for that particular tune.<eos> I'm known as the DJ that turned the punk onto reggae, as a DJ in a club called The Roxy, back in the late 70s, and this all happened really by accident, because what happened was: I got a gig to DJ in this punk-rock club.<eos> And it was so soon in the scene that there were no punk records to play.<eos> So what was I going to do?<eos> I played something I liked, I played reggae.<eos> And we're talking about hardcore dub reggae.<eos> And it turns out that the punks kind of liked it.<eos> The reason that rock and reggae blend together is their heaviness.<eos> if you listen to the rock guys, they pride themselves on being loud and heavy.
!<eos> Here it comes,<eos> Shoot the guns!<eos> I do not expect it and you?<eos> Would you fire the guns Emperor?<eos> No, let's see what they have.<eos> !<eos> They will close all hands on deck, ready ..<eos> .. for battle!<eos> Think we lucky and they will continue pasándonos.
We're just having a little fun.<eos> This your proof.<eos> She fooled you.<eos> She doesn't appear so brutal.<eos> It's her gift.<eos> That sweet, gentle Sue.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> She fooled me too.<eos> I never saw it coming.<eos> And my parents, they loved her so much.
Like the first time you watch Bill O'Reilly.<eos> Why is it so hard to believe I have a date with a perfectly nice, normal girl?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, stop.<eos> You finished?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> But you have to admit, that was pretty funny.<eos> Oh, Drew and Tonya, y'all go get ready for bed.<eos> Anyway, all she said was that I had to meet her parents, and if they say it's okay, then we can go.

Her parents are a lawyer and a doctor.<eos> Last time I saw a lawyer and a doctor together was when my uncle went to the hospital for a routine checkup and came out dead.<eos> So if you don't get your harmonica-playing, hole-in-the-sock-wearing, woe-is-me, I-should-have- everything-easy behind up,<eos> I'm gonna smack the cracker out of you.<eos> Oh, man, the dance.<eos> You missed your date with Jenise to come and find me?<eos> Don't sweat it.<eos> You would have done the same thing for me.<eos> When the situation came up years later, he didn't.<eos> The next day, I went to deliver the Huckstables an apology, but they had come to get it themselves.
He could only get his hands on enough money To get himself set up.<eos> He should have found a job, reinvented himself. But instead, he lid the way he'd always lived.<eos> Now he's got nothing left.<eos> Yeah, well, if my father's poor,<eos> What's the point of us going to live with him?<eos> I mean, we don't have any money.<eos> But the vanderbilts do.<eos> Yeah, look, why would my grandparents pay us To go live with him when they can't even help us out here?<eos> I mean, they hate my dad.<eos> Maybe that's why they would give him money--
This place is amazing. people might actually come here.<eos> That was the idea. I know, but when I talked about converting our storage space into a cafe, I was thinking of a folding table and a coffeemaker.<eos> Vanessa, thank you. this is a great homecoming present.<eos> It's exactly what I needed.<eos> What you needed for what?<eos> aren't you happy to be home?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I can't wait till the kids get back from the hamptons.<eos> I miss 'em like crazy.<eos> And they miss you, too, but...
This is...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You know, I-I've been really nervous about seeing you all week. - In fact, I still am.<eos> - You were? - Yeah. - You are?<eos> Uh, lo-look, why don't we just fast-forward past all this--<eos> This weirdness and be friends?<eos> - That sounds so good. - Yeah. You know what?<eos> What are you doing for lunch today?<eos> Friends eat lunch together, right? They--You're right.<eos> They do.
Just.<eos> I gave Jenny my word about something this morning,<eos> But I'm not sure if I can keep it.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Fashion is a young person's career,<eos> And this is Jenny's moment.<eos> She's only 15 years old.<eos> The opportunity can wait till she's ready.<eos> Do you remember the dreams you had When you were 15, mr. Humphrey?<eos> What if they all started to come true?
As insane as that guy was, he made a great point.<eos> If we're gonna make it, we can't have any secrets from each other.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's that we don't have much left to hide.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There is.<eos> I'm not who you think I am.<eos> The sudden knot in my stomach tells me This isn't you embracing your inner nietzsche.<eos> My parents aren't coming to the wedding.<eos> They...
I told you.<eos> When you pay me back.<eos> I'll get you your money.<eos> I can get you whatever you want if you let me make the call.<eos> I need to let people know that I'm okay.<eos> Why don't you send them message by carrier pigeon?<eos> You try that again, I'll be not so nice.<eos> What's the news from your elves at the North Pole?<eos> Satellites picked up an encoded communication signal from the group that attacked us.<eos> Well, they're not the only ones that are good at concealing information.
- I'm taking the kids to my mother's.<eos> - You're doing what?<eos> - If you want to have a normal conversation like two normal adult people, I'd be happy to do that but I am not doing this.<eos> Our kids are not normal.<eos> We can't move into the middle of nowhere, raise them in this Norman Rockwell world, expect everything...<eos> - nothing's changed.<eos> It didn't work!<eos> - What's your point?<eos> My point is that there's something bad in this house - and it isn't me.<eos> - Our children are behaving badly because they themselves have been treated badly.
Marmite.<eos> -Then that settles it.<eos> -Indeed.<eos> What other nation?<eos> Doctor Magwilde, may I have a word, please?<eos> As is customary, the German War Graves Authority will be sending their own archaeologist to attend the dig.<eos> There's no need.<eos> These men are British.<eos> That remains to be seen.<eos> They insist.
Your sister.<eos> What will they say?<eos> I'll tell you what any mother should say.<eos> "Thank you.<eos> Thank you from the bottom of my heart<eos> "that no more sons will die in this pointless bloody conflict!"<eos> These men are your friends.<eos> But is Germany?<eos> Of course not, man!<eos> They'll annex Britain.
"that no more sons will die in this pointless bloody conflict!"<eos> These men are your friends.<eos> But is Germany?<eos> Of course not, man!<eos> They'll annex Britain.<eos> We'll be isolated. They'll bleed us to death another way. You have sold your nation for some bloody historical glory.<eos> That's all this is about, Banks.<eos> Glory.<eos> Look at them.<eos> They'll be the victors.
Because you don't want... What are you doing?<eos> Get your... get off the...<eos> There's a cop!<eos> Nicole, lie still.<eos> This'll only take a few seconds.<eos> One millimeter cut through upper abdomen.<eos> She was adopted when the parents thought they couldn't have kids.<eos> Then they had three more.<eos> She took the message as "thanks for playing, but we have our real children now."<eos> And the real children probably think they're accidents while she was hand-picked.
Atrial myxoma is more likely.<eos> MRI for a better view.<eos> Call me back and tell me you're embarrassed because my eyesight is better 500 miles away.<eos> I need a phone number.<eos> I'm a doctor in New Jersey, treating one of your clients.<eos> A young woman looking for her biological parents.<eos> You know, you could just wait for the MRI to have your curiosity satisfied.<eos> What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?<eos> Did the parents look tan?<eos> The disease she has is genetic, which means they should have it too.
You know, you could just wait for the MRI to have your curiosity satisfied.<eos> What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?<eos> Did the parents look tan?<eos> The disease she has is genetic, which means they should have it too.<eos> They don't look more tan than anyone else.<eos> - Discolored teeth?<eos> - They're farmers... The village doesn't even have a dentist.<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But if it matters, I'm not convinced they were her parents.
She's lucky.<eos> We're all screwed up by our parents.<eos> She's got documentation.<eos> The pins will be removed surgically, and she'll be fine.<eos> We'll wake her from the coma after the operation.<eos> Is there any way you could not tell her?<eos> Please.<eos> She's fragile.<eos> She desperately wanted to know her biological parents.<eos> For her to find out that they wanted her dead...
So, in conclusion, shut up, check her home and work for toxins or drugs.<eos> Kutner and Foreman, do an echo, find the extent of the heart damage.<eos> Kutner can do the echo on his own.<eos> Yes, but he'll be very lonely, so I have to ask why.<eos> I've been asked to help run a clinical trial.<eos> That okay with you?<eos> Good for your career, great for your street cred.<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> You have four doctors and never more than one case.<eos> Means I have time to work on other things, and they all have more chances to step up, stand on their own.
- What?<eos> - It's Mick, the guitarist.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> What's he like?<eos> He's a mess.<eos> I mean, it's cool that he's a musician but he's just really not what I expected him to be.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, Peyton.<eos> I know how it feels.<eos> If only we could pick our parents.<eos> Yeah, but then you look at Larry, and it's pretty cool when they pick you.
Is that somebody's shoe?<eos> Someone's shoe.<eos> I wonder if they can walk without it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just thinking that nobody takes a walk without there being a technique of walking.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nobody goes for a walk... without there being something that supports that walk, uh, outside of ourselves.<eos> Mm-hmm. Um, and that maybe we have a false idea, um, that the able-bodied person is somehow radically self-sufficient.<eos> [Sunaura Taylor] Yeah.<eos> It wasn't until I was in my early 20s, about 20 or 21, that I became aware of disability... as a political issue. Um, and that happened largely through discovering the social model of disability... which is basically- In disability studies, they have a distinction... between disability and impairment.
Here, he began to wonder why God would have created distinctive kinds of tortoise, finch or iguana on more or less identical small islands.<eos> Were iguanas like these related rather than separately created?<eos> Were they cousins of the similar but different iguanas on nearby islands?<eos> This pattern of relationships became even more intriguing when Darwin encountered fossils.<eos> The evidence of fossils would help Darwin develop a theory of life on Earth far more wonderful and more moving than any religious story of creation.<eos> This team of American scientists has uncovered the remains of two-million-year-old ground sloths.<eos> Today, I'm joining the dig because it was fossils like these that made a huge impression on the young Charles Darwin during his voyage on HMS Beagle.<eos> To Darwin, they looked like ancient, giant versions of animals he saw around him.<eos> (MAN) The ground sloths flourished for millions of years, and were quite successful.<eos> - They were huge, weren't they?
There might be a bit of a problem.<eos> What?<eos> How are we gonna fit your head through the door?<eos> The Yorkshire Dales?<eos> It's where Hannah grew up.<eos> She was an astronomer?<eos> She was a big geek, Charlie.<eos> You could have married her.<eos> You know what Jesus said?<eos> "Blessed are the geeks, for they shall inherit the earth."
Hey, new guy...<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> Want to hang out?<eos> Now?<eos> I'm asking you out. Are you going to say no?<eos> You're asking me out?<eos> !<eos> It's dinner with some friends. Be at your best.<eos> Yes, ma'am!<eos> They're her friends?
I don't know where she is.<eos> She's got needle marks in both arms.<eos> No scar tissue.<eos> This has to be recent.<eos> Drug users don't usually start off shooting it.<eos> Snort it or smoke it first.<eos> White powder in the nose,most likely cocaine.<eos> Hives.<eos> Histamine reaction, maybe from the drugs?<eos> Wonder if she told her parents she was just going dancing and they believed her.
Rancho Linen Service.<eos> Hey give me some light over here, will you?<eos> That's the only table without a tablecloth.<eos> We've got blood.<eos> Better call P.D., track down the owner of the building.<eos> It's time to reopen Le Chteau Rouge.<eos> - Whose car is that, man? - Building owner.<eos> Chteau Rouge, man.<eos> My parents came here.<eos> They still talk about it.
Just throwing that out there.<eos> You were great!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> it's so good to see you!<eos> You going on tour anytime soon?<eos> Oh, no, no tour for me, not since I had my baby boy.<eos> Must have been a tough decision for you.<eos> No, not really.<eos> It's exciting, the cheers from the crowd,<eos> But they can't take the place of my family.
Ibrahim bhai, looking at their scared faces I feel we are going to get freed.<eos> And I also think...<eos> Fire!<eos> It reminds me of my youth.<eos> I was also like you.<eos> Too stubborn to be afraid of death.<eos> I was six years old when my father got into an enmity with a few men.<eos> These men kidnapped me from the school.<eos> They asked for a ransom in exchange of my life.<eos> My father paid the ransom. But they were still greedy.
I think we are pretty far forward.<eos> We choose not to u-turn.<eos> Come by taxi<eos> Teams must make their way to find their next clue.<eos> Taxi,taxi.<eos> That was bumpy, as advertised.<eos> Dan, I see it right down there.<eos> I see it.<eos> Come on,Sarah<eos> They are going to u-turn us.
Let him shoot you without a padded bra, Linda, then I'll let him shoot my right side.<eos> - I really don't see the issue.<eos> - No?<eos> You don't see this right here?<eos> Maybe we should call the producers.<eos> Maybe we should.<eos> Okay, people, let's take a break.<eos> Go ahead, call the producers.<eos> What, is this guy threatening me?<eos> They know.
This is a moment of great pride and joy for us all.<eos> Our engineers who have made this important event possible are getting out of their cars.<eos> Come in.<eos> Good morning sir.<eos> Good morning Sami.<eos> I wanted to inform you that the cars have arrived.<eos> I was just looking at them.<eos> Shall we go?<eos> We still have time, sir.<eos> They are getting ready outside.
One came to baptise by water.<eos> The other by fire.<eos> Are you afraid to speak plainly?<eos> Our army is gathering.<eos> One will prepare the way.<eos> The other will lead us in to battle.<eos> And you were counting on the fact that I would not exorcise these demons because they're unborn.<eos> Ah, you are beginning to see the injustice of your god.<eos> You are beginning to see with our eyes.<eos> Well, since they are destined to lead an army of Satan, I suppose I'd better choose the lesser of two evils.
You don't need to.<eos> Just talk to God and ask him to help your father.<eos> Out loud?<eos> However you like.<eos> He can hear you.<eos> Why do you have to confess?<eos> The demon will use any ammunition to defend itself.<eos> Especially the sins of the exorcist.<eos> So demons can read minds?<eos> Oh, they know what's hidden.
I know.<eos> But where else can we find out what he's planning?<eos> We have to find a way in there without him seeing.<eos> Like that.<eos> The first law of the battlefield...<eos> think like your enemy.<eos> You didn't escape me.<eos> You saved me the trouble of your escort.<eos> What about my two friends?<eos> They escaped.
What if it's aliens?<eos> They've been abducted.<eos> They could be being probed right now.<eos> There are no signs of alien activity.<eos> In fact...<eos> In fact what?<eos> Spit it out.<eos> It is not my function to venture opinion.<eos> Or to prognosticate the behaviour of humans.<eos> But I have a theory about where they've gone, or rather, when.
Rani!<eos> Over here!<eos> Sarah Jane!<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Long story.<eos> Why did you call her that?<eos> I did it again.<eos> Who are you, and why did you call her Sarah Jane?<eos> You stopped your parents.<eos> They never got in the car, right?
It's not too late.<eos> There's only one way to stop him, Mum.<eos> We've both known it all along.<eos> No!<eos> I can't!<eos> Use the sonic.<eos> Repair the car. ..and send your parents to their deaths!<eos> Will you be the agent of their destruction?<eos> That Indian girl, she said something to Victoria.<eos> She said "You stopped them driving off, they never left in the car."
And it was the idea of this world deliberately hidden from us.<eos> I think that's one of the reasons why<eos> I became an investigative reporter, was to take the veil... lift the veil away from important subjects that are being hidden.<eos> (film projector clicking)<eos> The whole industrial food system really began with fast food.<eos> In the 1930s, a new form of restaurant arose and it was called the drive-in.<eos> The McDonald brothers had a very successful drive-in, but they decided to cut costs and simplify.<eos> So they fired all their carhops, they got rid of most of the things on the menu and they created a revolutionary idea to how to run a restaurant.<eos> They basically brought the factory system to the back of the restaurant kitchen.<eos> They trained each worker to just do one thing again and again and again.
That's normal.<eos> There's antibiotics that's put into the feed and of course that passes through the chicken.<eos> The bacteria builds up a resistance, so antibiotics aren't working anymore.<eos> I have become allergic to all antibiotics and can't take 'em.<eos> (clucking)<eos> When it's dark inside the houses, the chickens lay down.<eos> It's less resistance when they're being caught.<eos> Traditionally, it's been African-American men.<eos> Now we're seeing more and more Latino catchers... undocumented workers.<eos> From their point of view, they don't have any rights and they're just not gonna complain.
Our dream is down the toilet.<eos> I told him, "This right here is all about you, me, and my mom and my dad. "<eos> L helped me realize it was more than just me playing football, you know?<eos> It was my ticket to go to college.<eos> So now we're missing one of our key guys.<eos> Willie is put into a position where he has to play and start.<eos> Mater Dei is basically the same team that we had lost to in eighth grade.<eos> Remember these Mater Dei players played against James at an AAU tournament a few years ago, when they were eighth-graders...<eos> And they beat LeBron back in Orlando in the 14-and-under AAU championship.<eos> I don't know if they remember, but I know everybody on my team definitely did, like, "We ain't forgetting not one of those faces."
She's gone.<eos> Son of a...<eos> That's 20 pounds of crazy in a five-pound bag.<eos> Vibration detectors are on.<eos> No cutting, Parker. Use the binary.<eos> You know, Parker, any time you want to...<eos> Boys are on their way.<eos> What are you getting with security?<eos> You see security?<eos> They don't see a thing.
I find bad guys.<eos> Well, go find some bad guys.<eos> Bad guys have money.<eos> Black king, white knight.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No. No, no.<eos> Please, take your time.<eos> She was 17.<eos> I know.<eos> They killed her.
For what it's worth,sir,it,um... it means a lot knowing that the decision didn't come from you.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> Go back to work.<eos> Three bodies,all killed on the same night at virtually the same time.<eos> And COD on all three is a complete mystery.<eos> You serious?<eos> Well,they all seem to have this strange hole in their face that, prior to their being dead,didn't exist.<eos> Sid.<eos> The bullets did them in,but they weren't concerned about living too long anyhow.
Go ahead. We did a calendar of hot army wives.<eos> It's not exactly a pin-up, more like glamour shots.<eos> The guys loved it, and we made lots of money.<eos> From looking around, I can tell we have a few viable candidates.<eos> (ALL LAUGHING) CLAUDIA JOY:<eos> Not a bad idea. Maybe we could make it a little more relevant.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm sure the men who are deployed would love a visual reminder of their lives here on post.<eos> Maybe a "slice of life" kind of thing? Group shots and candids of men and women, various locations around the post.<eos> Snapshots of how life goes on while they're away.
-Yes, 5 times.<eos> Every time you call me, I could show them patient who was sent home to die.<eos> Izleèen it! Another patient. Send you have him home to die.<eos> Next patient.<eos> Sent you him home to die.<eos> Including people with mišiænom dystrophy such as this young girl.<eos> Public lectures Dr. Gerson on its therapy were unpopular among his disciples.<eos> For example, Gerson publicly opposed to tobacco since 1920.<eos> -Rest for the majority of medical workers generally means that the time to enjoy a cigarette.<eos> Because they know how mild smoking pleasure delicious cigarette, carefully selected who will use the brand.

Cute.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just... you, lunch.<eos> This is great.<eos> We see each other every night.<eos> No, I see you.<eos> You see piles of work.<eos> I'm sorry, but you know how it is... starting a new firm, going to court, making sure your sleazy new firm doesn't steal all our clients.<eos> We're not stealing anyone.<eos> These guys are C.E.O.S. They make up their own minds.
I'm not just a messenger.<eos> Be careful, Eli.<eos> Going against the visions... It's risky.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, if God wanted a puppet for a prophet, He should've chosen an accountant.<eos> Mr. Smalls, who is usually granted access to NIH cannabis stores?<eos> Universities, health agencies, scientific institutions...<eos> Very controlled environments.<eos> What about the private individuals?<eos> Do they ever receive NIH sanctioned pot?
You know what? I like to use the term "pre-actives."<eos> OK, everybody take a deep breath,<eos> - count to ten.<eos> - 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10.<eos> The power's probably out because somebody didn't pay the bill.<eos> The power company's against us too, man?<eos> Man, they're out there with the actives, man.<eos> And they got money and electricity, man.<eos> Arrowhead, calm down.<eos> Even if it is the actives, they can't do anything to us from out there.
To say good-bye<eos> To yesterday...<eos> I ran out.<eos> I ran out of breath.<eos> Check it out.<eos> What you got there, Ernie?<eos> Oh, it's a new review by Corman.<eos> "I woke up in my neighbor's bed with a head wound, yesterday's paper, and an empty bottle of sleeping pills, and my nightmare in that putrid, shithole of a bar, Paddy's Pub, finally, mercifully came to an end.<eos> The owners all deserve to rot in jail, though having to spend every day with each other in that violent establishment is a decidedly great punishment.<eos> That is why I decided to not press charges leaving 'em to live in the hell on earth that they've created for themselves for the rest of their pathetic and miserable lives.
Edwin.<eos> Berbay odothay arisan yeldo.<eos> Very good.<eos> Sfeffin...<eos> You have magic.<eos> It wasn't me, I didn't do anything.<eos> Then how else did you bring them to life?<eos> Only magic can do such a thing.<eos> These little angels are how I cured Lady Morgana.<eos> They repaired the damage to her brain.
My lord!<eos> My lord.<eos> It seems the drugs I gave you have take hold.<eos> Your body is now paralysed.<eos> Now, open your eyes, my lord.<eos> I want my face to be the last face you ever see.<eos> You took my childhood from me.<eos> And now finally, I take my parents' revenge.<eos> Within a few hours, the beetle will eat into your brain.<eos> And you will suffer... as they suffered.

And I miss you.<eos> I miss hanging out at your house.<eos> I feel like you and Madison are still close, but -<eos> I just don't get that your parents won't let you be friends with me anymore.<eos> I guess they think I'll get pregnant by association.<eos> Or that I'll get the idea that having sex at 15 is OK.<eos> I'd think you'd get the idea that it's at 15.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe they knew from the beginning that the guy that got you pregnant has issues because he was sexually abused as a child.
Twenty-five schools so far.<eos> And, uh, here's, here's my resume. Oh. Here.<eos> Oh. We can look at that in a minute, Brad.<eos> Just come on in, tell us why you want to be a teacher.<eos> OK.<eos> Well, it's, uh, oh, it's, it's all I ever wanted to be.<eos> Ever since I was in school.<eos> You must have had some pretty inspiring teachers.<eos> Ah, well.<eos> I had an inspiring principal Mr. Myer but my teachers, they really only inspired me to be the kind of teachers they never were.
- Ahsoka. Suicide is not the Jedi way, Master.<eos> You should listen to your Padawan.<eos> As you listened to yours, my old Master?<eos> No, we are going to stay and fight.<eos> And I think I know how to beat Grievous at his own game.<eos> Our spies were right, General.<eos> The Jedi have positioned a fleet beyond the planetary rings.<eos> Move our ships through the asteroid field to engage them.<eos> Through the field, sir?<eos> If we attack from above, they will have the advantage.
- You came unprepared.<eos> - (Laughs) Yes, I did, I...<eos> If we buy a new telly, we can all benefit from it.<eos> What do we get out of you going skiing?<eos> I'd let you wear my Jump suit, if I got one.<eos> You better face facts.<eos> It ain't gonna happen.<eos> This is abuse!<eos> I'm phoning social services.<eos> They'll know who you are, after where you sent me to nursery.
It's a concrete answer to a question.<eos> Somebody asks for something and you just give it to them.<eos> Didn't you yell at me about that yesterday?<eos> Rocket Ray? Giving him what he wants?<eos> You actually listened?<eos> Here.<eos> I didn't sleep last night thinking about Ray and the race.<eos> Why are they being monitored like that?<eos> It's telemetry to help the coaches during the race.<eos> It clocks the use of energy. They'll know when to push, when to pull back.
We had a chance of... something.<eos> Those are appropriate sentiments but is that what you feel obliged to say?<eos> What?<eos> Mel, when somebody dies we tend to glamorise our relationship with them.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> That's rubbish, Rueben.<eos> Your dreams about Nick are not consistent with what you're saying.<eos> They're dreams, Rueben.<eos> They're just dreams.<eos> They reveal your greatest fears - of a normal, domesticated life.
Here we have a stone building, at the very least an imitation stone building.<eos> It's easier to build arches in stone rather than in brick.<eos> There is a strong local precedent, and none sharper and brighter in the Amsterdam memory than a very recent triumphal visit four years before in 1638, a very memorable event when Amsterdam was full of triumphal ceremonial arches,<eos> flags, flying bunting, and companies of marching Amsterdam Militia.<eos> The victory arches were erected for the occasion and therefore were temporary constructions, designed and built of wood and painted to imitate stone.<eos> Is Rembrandt making a special point here that Amsterdam and the Amsterdam Militia are involved in a piece of municipal fakery?<eos> I insist you wear these.<eos> I'm paying, for God's sake!<eos> This... wrong color, too dull, and no shine.<eos> If they're good enough for the Queen of France, they're good enough for me and should be good enough for you.
Might we suggest that Rembrandt was being prophetic and making an apocryphal reference to the savage assassinations of the brothers De Witt in the Hague in 1672 and even perhaps the murder of Pim Fortuyn in 2002 in the Mediapark in Hilversum,<eos> and much closer to home... the assassination of Theo van Gogh in 2004 in the streets of Amsterdam?<eos> Rembrandt may have received the commission in late 1640 in association with Captain Hasselburg and his lieutenant, Egremont, brokered, most certainly, by Rembrandt's dealer,<eos> Hendrik Uylenburgh. U YLENBURGH:<eos> If I benefit... and it's for me to say how, we need to find out... you could benefit, too.<eos> Push up your price!<eos> Inclusive or exclusive of your fee?<eos> Oh, well, obviously I don't expect extras from you.<eos> Those days are over, I think, I feel, I know, I'm sure... Then the situation of the commission completely changed when Hasselburg was murdered and his lieutenant, Egremont, went into hiding, accused of being responsible for his death by permitting a military accident to occur due to his irresponsibility.<eos> The new commissioners, lead by the Banning Cocq family, were keen to create a seamless continuity to help conceal their conspiracy, and after some show of hesitation, they renewed their contract with Rembrandt.
GREENAWAY:<eos> Was this deserved?<eos> Was there ulterior motive in making such a spectacle out of him?<eos> Van Ruytenburch was arrogant, a new man, his father's money had made him and spoiled him.<eos> It sounds as though you, too, disliked him.<eos> I have to confess, I did, but my feelings in the matter must surely be irrelevant.<eos> Here is a great curiosity.<eos> The painting is dominated by the two figures of Banning Cocq and Ruytenburch, friends, companions in arms, captain and lieutenant, both titled.<eos> These two men are not so very far from being equals in military command.<eos> They were certainly not so very far from being equals in Amsterdam social life.
Many said later that I was there just as a mascot.<eos> But what sort of mascot was that?<eos> There is absolutely no precedent in over 50 previous Dutch Militia paintings of there ever being a mascot present.<eos> No young females, no goats, monkeys, rabbits, no mascot that might remotely be familiar, for example, from any football team.<eos> These two females boldly, even accusingly painted incongruously in a body of tall men and walking, if not running, in the contrary direction to everyone else, are part of Rembrandt's accusation.<eos> Their names are Marieke and Marita, both the illegitimate daughters of Rombout Kemp. ROMBOUT KEMP:<eos> We are neighbors in the Breestraat.<eos> How about making a contribution to the orphanage?<eos> We have many new children, orphaned by the Spanish Wars.<eos> Then I think they must all be touching 30. GREENAWAY:
We have many new children, orphaned by the Spanish Wars.<eos> Then I think they must all be touching 30. GREENAWAY:<eos> Marieke and Marita are commonly used as names for country girls and for cows, certainly not names chosen by the well-born and hardly by the bourgeoisie.<eos> Both are derived from Maria, Mary... strongly Roman Catholic... so Roman Catholic, underprivileged, and probably illiterate country waifs. Orphans?<eos> Bastards.<eos> Rembrandt put this underprivileged country-girl orphan in a splendid dress from his property box.<eos> To show who and to signify what?<eos> Certainly to demonstrate the calumnies of the orphanage.<eos> Seen in later years as an element of Dutch life that appears sympathetic to the plight of the orphan, orphanages were not necessarily the places of charitable welfare they might have a reputation of being.<eos> They certainly were a source for cheap labor... for females, cheap domestic work as servants and, it seems in some cases, for worse... in prostitution, even child prostitution.
- mask?<eos> yeah, we're spreading manure for the lawn today.<eos> don't want to get that stuff in your lungs.<eos> if i knew it was manure day, i would have set the alarm for earlier.<eos> owen!<eos> hey, what is it?<eos> what's wrong? i just threw up.<eos> oh, that came on fast.<eos> You all right? no. I'm sorry.<eos> i should go home. - i'll come with you. no, you can' just... you--you have to go finish the park for those kids, so that they... they have a place to exercise and be healthy, so that...
But before I play again, I... want to welcome any questions that you may have for me.<eos> I'm used to dealing with bullies, although I thought I left them all back in high school.<eos> My question is very personal.<eos> How do you do it? How do you... How do you stay so upbeat and wonderful?<eos> It's not easy.<eos> But I have help. I have all of you.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> You missed a real Kumbaya moment.<eos> Apparently, when her parents got divorced all she had to console her was that stupid clarinet.<eos> They divorced when she was three, and that sounds suspiciously like a Lifetime movie she and I watched last year.
No way!<eos> We're penniless now.<eos> What are we going to do now?<eos> I'm thinking!<eos> What?<eos> It was really good!<eos> I don't know!<eos> The eels were good!<eos> No!<eos> You didn't need to pound those kids just because they were talking when you couldn't think of anything.
I am called Yves Delisle.<eos> I am an agronomist by profession.<eos> I studied Development Studies in Geneva.<eos> I have been working directly with farmers for about 20 years.<eos> 20 years is quite a long time.<eos> But up to now, I have the impression that the situation has not improved.<eos> These people earn not even 50 euros a year.<eos> We are anxious!<eos> We are fed up.<eos> Our children cultivate cotton, but they don't get anything for it.
This is absolutely artificial.<eos> We are creating a green space in the midst of the desert.<eos> To do so, we need a huge quantity of water.<eos> A golf course of this type consumes the same quantity of water as a town of 20000 inabitants.<eos> 7 of the 11 most important construction companies in the world are Spanish.<eos> Some of them are linked to big soccer clubs.<eos> The biggest Spanish construction company ACS is directed by the former president of Real Madrid.<eos> The extent of construction has reached its limits.<eos> Of the first kilometre of the whole Spanish coastline 80% is covered with buildings.<eos> They are beginning to occupy the last natural spaces.
Please explain to them about the situation.<eos> And we need to get the president's security card kept in the bank.<eos> We need the card to access the security room with the president's fingerprint.<eos> We need them to drive Gang Minsik out.<eos> The safe is in a secret place, not inside of Cheongsol Finance.<eos> Only a few people including myself know about it.<eos> Will you help us?<eos> I doubt the bank executives will believe the story.<eos> The president is alive.<eos> They must recognize him from the numerous transactions.
I decided to follow you guys and now I'm in land of giants lost world.<eos> Craig, it isn't our fault.<eos> You make it sound like we was wanna be in situation like this, we don't have any choice.<eos> Yeah, stuff just happens.<eos> Stuff just happens.<eos> That's right.<eos> You just winded up being set by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up at land of giants lost world.<eos> That's right.<eos> You know what stuff happens to most kids?<eos> They fall off their bikes.

- Really?<eos> Fused together since birth and somehow you struggle through.<eos> This was just an accident.<eos> God doesn't make accidents.<eos> You're like that for a reason.<eos> And I know what it is.<eos> I work for the SCPA...<eos> We are not adopting a cat, I'm sorry.<eos> I know they're put to death and yes its very sad, but lets all admit it, cats are annoying.<eos> They are, they're annoying. What?
What's that, is that a window, or do you sort of unzip it, climb in, and put your head through it?<eos> Look, I've come as a Citroen!<eos> It's like one of those things at Pontin's - go on, kids, stick your face through the Citroen.<eos> At £19,000. For a Citroen costume!<eos> And it only has one bed.<eos> Well, he's not gonna have a friend, is he?<eos> No.<eos> You won't need two!<eos> Lorry drivers - they're always telling us they have got a very hard job.<eos> As far as we can work out, they go to work, sit down and then go home again.
My dear Fanny, I am entirely in your hands.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Mr Clennam!<eos> Mr Clennam, come quick before they get here!<eos> Come along, Mr Clennam!<eos> Si, si, presto, signore, presto!<eos> Quick, sir, quick, sir, out the back.<eos> Time to get away before they come in.<eos> Who? Creditors, sir.<eos> They want their money...
We're making shit happen.<eos> Let's go, runkle.<eos> You got to be on that sales floor at all times.<eos> A.B.C., baby...<eos> "always be closing."<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> "A.B.C., baby...<eos> 'always be closing'".<eos> These fucking guys...<eos> They all think they're the only one Who ever saw "glengarry glen ross."
That's the general.<eos> What's your current position ?<eos> Big green army's looking for us.<eos> Then let's get off the grid.<eos> Get out.<eos> They're watching us.<eos> - I don't want you here.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> There are men outside this apartment.<eos> They're in the parking lot, and they're in the back of the building, and they're not gonna let you leave.

And the other is, I'm only going to eat salad today.<eos> Once a while you tell the truth.<eos> Þenol. Take a salad to Table Three. To Kerem Bey.<eos> Do something funky with the garnish.<eos> OK. I've got you.<eos> This is what you say. Gentlemen, here's wishing you convince the ladies at the table. Eat it with faith and conviction.<eos> It's on the house.<eos> Sorry... I don't think I understood.<eos> You're doing your English trip again...<eos> Off you go now. They'll understand.
No, no, we don't have enough, Canton.<eos> These are just ideas and theories.<eos> - We have to check them first.<eos> - But how?<eos> I'm going to talk to my whore.<eos> Your...?<eos> Every decent cop has one, right?<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Is one of my men trying to dupe you?<eos> No, they're doing a good job.
How, taken?<eos> Surrendered, sire.<eos> To Colonels Cromwell and Rainsborough.<eos> Sire, we could not have resisted them.<eos> Surrendered?<eos> Without...a fight?<eos> Well...<eos> You, sir, will never command men hereafter.<eos> It seems now my enemies need only look upon my power and it takes to its heels.<eos> I must tell you all, while they have more stomach than we have for the fight, none of us will see London ever again.
Let every man have a share of it and there'll be no starving.<eos> Men will feed themselves.<eos> Where's that land to come from?<eos> It must be taken from those who have too much.<eos> You would have us turn to robbery then?<eos> Farewell, Colonel.<eos> Farewell, General.<eos> Why did these members of parliament induce us to fight in the name of freedom only that we might now endure their greed or suffer their prisons?<eos> I tell ya, this is no freedom except for them!<eos> And where sat they while we fought for their profits?
I think you do not know it.<eos> And I pity you for it.<eos> Did love help the Diggers when the army trampled their fields?<eos> No.<eos> What did love do for any man, except make him run like a fool to his destruction?<eos> The Diggers had not too much love, sir, but too little.<eos> But there are those who believe that love can save us all.<eos> Ranters?<eos> Only their enemies call them that.<eos> They call themselves the High Attainers, and I have made friends amongst them.
Bring her out!<eos> Away with her!<eos> Take her away.<eos> Bring her.<eos> What shall I call you now, madam?<eos> Your prisoner, my Lord?<eos> No.<eos> Mistress Sexby, then.<eos> Your friends, the Ranters, the High Attainers...<eos> They find holiness in tobacco and alcohol and fornication.
Too late.<eos> They were working on a vaccine.<eos> They thought they could do it.<eos> They said they needed months.<eos> We said, "No, weeks."<eos> But it was days.<eos> What was it like?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Having it.<eos> My children, they...
We're on the Estate now.<eos> My family was in London.<eos> They used to come and stay every summer.<eos> God, it was so sudden, wasn't it?<eos> London was bad, so I came out here.<eos> They were all dead... my cousins, my aunt and uncle.<eos> And the house was... occupied.<eos> By the kids who attacked us?<eos> I did ask them to leave.<eos> They declined.
What difference does it make whether he is permitted or not?<eos> My sons are young enough to take their own decisions.<eos> They should just inform us!<eos> We will come!<eos> We don't have to present a budget to the Parliament. Do we?<eos> Aaliyah, your parents are here too?<eos> Mom, Alley's parents live in the US.<eos> Have they arrived for the wedding?<eos> No, mother.<eos> They are not coming. - Why?

This is the weaver's workshop and the brass smith forge<eos> This is my version of your "Cultivation"<eos> It's natural for a pupil to follow the style of his teacher but a flower... cannot come in full bloom without revealing its inside<eos> I'll remember that, sir<eos> Find your own style and techniques<eos> "Heavenly tiger"<eos> No one can match you for details<eos> It's a masterpiece<eos> I heard your grandson saw your "Tiger" and bursted out crying in fear<eos> Now that there are two tigers I fear they might fight each other
This of course is a bendy bus, and that means it'll probably spend the day causing crashes and bursting into flames for no obvious reason.<eos> Which is why we've got two of them.<eos> Finally, representing the compact hopper bus, we have a 1997 MetroRider.<eos> Now, because there is so much at stake here, we can't leave the driving to any old bus driver.<eos> So we brought in our old friends, the touring car drivers.<eos> Their precise and delicate touch certainly got motorhome racing off to a great start last year.<eos> So, please welcome touring car legend, Anthony Reid.<eos> Touring car legend, Matt Neal.<eos> And, for the second time tonight, hairdressing legend, Tom Chilton.<eos> To be honest, they're not that good on passenger usage per mile, but if you want to sort out the other important bus stuff - understeer, lift off, oversteer, then these are your men.
One takes a snapshot, another one takes a film... and the third type is a digital camera... which takes 16 frames at 200 million frames per second.<eos> The technicians retreat behind a blast shield... and prepare to fire.<eos> The chamber is cleared of oxygen and other gases... to simulate the vacuum of outer space.<eos> Now the moment of truth.<eos> How much damage did this simulated micrometeoroid cause?<eos> Even though it is a small impact... there's enough of a lip with enough structure... so that an astronaut could catch their glove on such a lip... and cause a tear in their glove.<eos> And if a projectile only 1/32 of an inch wide... can cause this type of damage... you won't believe what a larger object can do.<eos> At the NASA White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico... researchers load small projectiles into huge guns.<eos> The projectiles simulate micrometeoroids and space junk.<eos> They slam into spacecraft parts at up to 19,000 miles an hour... creating disasters on Earth... to better understand disasters in space.
Where are these membranes that we're stuck to?<eos> And why can't we see these extra dimensions that connect us?<eos> I'm floating around here on this kayak on the surface of the ocean... and you can think of this as a two-dimensional surface.<eos> But below me, there's a whole 'nother dimension.<eos> There's the down dimension where all the fish live.<eos> You can think of that as the bulk.<eos> I'm on a membrane, floating around... and the bulk is the other dimension.<eos> The fish down below the surface of the water... are in a different dimension than I am.<eos> They don't even know that I'm here... unless I happen to splash around and hit one on the head... or something like that.<eos> So they might be completely oblivious to my existence... and I could be oblivious to their existence... because we're in different dimensions.
Nowhere.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> The ramifications of this are staggering, for the amount of money owed back to the banks will always exceed the amount of money that is available in circulation.<eos> This is why inflation is a constant in the economy, for new money is always needed to help cover the perpetual deficit build into the system, caused by the need to pay the interest.<eos> What this also means, is that mathematically defaults and bankruptcy are literally built into the system.<eos> And there will always be poor pockets of society that get the short end of the stick.<eos> An analogy would be a game of musical chairs, for the once music stops, somebody is left out to dry.<eos> And that is the point.<eos> It invariably transfers true wealth for the individual to the banks.<eos> For, if you are unable to pay for your mortgage, they will take your property.
And what the people do when they are in debt?<eos> They submit to employment to pay it off.<eos> But if money only can only be created out of loans, how can society ever be debt free?<eos> It can't and that's the point.<eos> And it is the fear of loosing assets, coupled with the struggle to keep up with the perpetual debt and inflation inherent in the system, compounded by the inescapable scarcity within in the money supply itself, created by the interest that can never be re-payed,<eos> that keeps the wage-slave in line, running on a hamster wheel, with millions of others, in effect powering an empire that truly benefits only the elite at the top of the pyramid.<eos> For, at the end of the day, who are you really working for?<eos> The banks.<eos> Money is created in the bank and invariably ends up in a bank.<eos> They are the true masters, along with the corporations and governments they support.
It is an interesting observation to note how seemingly unknown personalities magically appear on the scene as presidential candidates.<eos> Then before you know it, somehow you are left to choose from a small group of extremely wealthy people who suspiciously have the same broad social view.<eos> Obviously it's a joke.<eos> The people placed on the ballot are done so because they have been pre-decided to be acceptable by the established financial powers who actually run the show.<eos> Yet many who understand this illusion of democracy, often think<eos> "If only we could just get our honest, ethical politicians in power", then we would be okay.<eos> Well, while this idea of course seems reasonable in our established oriented world view, it is unfortunately another fallacy.<eos> For when it really comes down to what is actually important, the institution of politics and thus politicians themselves, have absolutely no true relevance as to what makes our world and society function.<eos> It's not politicians that can solve problems.<eos> They have no technical capabilities.

- Funny?<eos> - It's like a funny misunderstanding.<eos> - Are you joking?<eos> - It's not like it was just your sister.<eos> I had a list of people.<eos> I wasn't targeting your family.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Free pass... when you give someone a free pass, things... it messes with you, you know?<eos> Do you know how pissed my parents are?<eos> - They... they know?
Accounts by British survivors of Viking attacks are unequivocal.<eos> These guys were after treasure and slaves.<eos> "The pagans came with a naval force to Britain<eos> "and, spread on all sides like direwolves, robbed, tore and slaughtered<eos> "not only beasts of burden, sheep and oxen,<eos> "but even priests and deacons,<eos> "and companies of monks and nuns."<eos> That description was a contemporary account of a Viking attack on a monastery in England.<eos> But the Vikings weren't choosy.<eos> They went wherever the treasure was.
To reinforce his political takeover, he rewarded his Gaelic followers with Pictish land.<eos> But Giric's position was far from secure.<eos> Although he'd eliminated Aed, the two legitimate heirs, Aed's six-year-old son Constantine and his teenage cousin Donald, still lived.<eos> Giric knew his kingship was unsafe while the two young boys remained potential rivals.<eos> But Constantine and Donald were far beyond the reach of Giric.<eos> Their protectors had escorted them safely to Fort Ailech in the north of Ireland.<eos> It might seem strange to send two Pictish princes to a Gaelic country like Ireland, especially given Giric's Gaelic connections, but they met a warm welcome at Ailech from their aunt.<eos> She was married to a powerful Irish king, and for her, this was a matter not of politics, but of kin.<eos> They grew up in the royal household.<eos> It was a Gaelic court and they became steeped in its culture and language.
She was married to a powerful Irish king, and for her, this was a matter not of politics, but of kin.<eos> They grew up in the royal household.<eos> It was a Gaelic court and they became steeped in its culture and language.<eos> They were educated at a nearby monastery and attended the Gaelic church.<eos> Too young to challenge Giric, too young to be King of the Picts, the changes taking place in their homeland must have felt like a world away to the cousins.<eos> But as each year passed and adulthood approached, the moment to avenge the murder of Constantine's father edged ever closer.<eos> In the year 889, after a decade in exile, the two cousins were finally old enough to challenge Giric.<eos> Donald and Constantine sailed homeward.<eos> Revenge was in their hearts.<eos> To win back their kingdom, they knew they'd have to depose the usurper.
You should go tell your dad to buy you one as well.<eos> Hey, he doesn't have a dad.<eos> His dad hit his mum, so they got divorced and moved out here.<eos> Then you should go to your dad without your mum knowing, and ask him to buy it for you.<eos> Hyung In, dad's here.<eos> I brought some snacks with me.<eos> Are they your friends?<eos> Hey, come eat this together.<eos> Hey, bastard!<eos> They won't eat it cos you're not touching it.
You must have gotten a bad grade at school or something. That it?<eos> I never get bad grades.<eos> Then what the hell are you doing here?<eos> This floor is cold, you'll get a chill.<eos> I did nothing bad.<eos> Are the police looking for you?<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Your parents must be worried,<eos> - they don't know where you are, do they?

Friday, May 23rd. 1 day before the special class<eos> Friday, May 23rd.<eos> 1 day before the special class Why?<eos> He's so cute.<eos> Friday, May 23rd.<eos> 1 day before the special class<eos> I'm 10th place!<eos> Shit!<eos> I hate the rankings.<eos> They're all the PTA kids.
Have you ever looked around at this world?<eos> Before, I mean.<eos> Lying, cheating, murder, terrorism, fast food- we don't want it to end.<eos> Then who?<eos> No, he wouldn't do that.<eos> Wouldn't he?<eos> Ever hear of the Great Flood?<eos> A dude named Noah?<eos> I hate to break it to you, princess, he has.<eos> Why don't you ask your robed friends outside? ( snarling ) They're here to make sure their Lord's plan comes to fruition.
Once you start asking questions, you can't stop.<eos> You see, good health makes a lot of sense, but it doesn't make a lot of dollars.<eos> And not considering nutrition seriously, we've done a terrible disservice to all these people.<eos> Every single person in the world, every culture, every language, every country, every person in the world knows it, you are what you eat.<eos> Food does matter.<eos> The Supermarket:<eos> symbol of the high standard of living in this country today.<eos> These products come from farms and ranches despite distance and season.<eos> They are the result of a miraculous agriculture, maintaining farm fresh quality all the way to your dinner table.
And I got a chance to see and observe the failure of medicine.<eos> You would see people like the one woman I remember with Leukemia and they would give her Jell-O and white bread to eat.<eos> Now I am not saying that Jell-O and white bread caused cancer but they sure aren't the cure.<eos> Twenty six percent of patients who are discharged from hospitals are more malnourished then when they went in.<eos> And the reason they go in, in eighty to ninety percent of cases is related to their poor state of nutrition.<eos> I started reading papers by William J. McCormack and Frederick Robert Klenner;<eos> the pioneers of using high doses of Vitamin C and these gentlemen were curing viral disease with high doses of Vitamin C in the 1940's!<eos> And then I had a poser.<eos> Now just a minute here, hold on a second.<eos> These are medical doctors and they're using vitamins and they're using high doses of vitamins and they're getting success.
The idea that all drugs are firmly based in the evidence and all of the non-drug treatments are just a mixture of hope and delusion and placebo effect and charlatans just doesn't really stand up to examination.<eos> For example, in order for a drug to be licensed it has to show that it is more effective than a placebo in two trials.<eos> This doesn't mean to say that the drug company can't do lots of other trials in which it doesn't prove to be more effective, it just doesn't need to publish those.<eos> What it needs to do is go along to the regulator and say we have these two trials, which show the drug is more effective than a placebo.<eos> Can we have a license to market it please?<eos> Now these are samples taken from manufacturers batches of insulin and antibiotic drugs.<eos> We test them for purity and potency before they are sold.<eos> Of course new drugs are always coming along and we make sure that they have been tested and found to be safe before they are put on the market.<eos> The doctors will tell you that the drugs have been trialled and tested but what you have to realize when you take a new drug is that you are essentially embarking on an uncontrolled experiment.<eos> The drugs will only have been tested, for the purposes of getting their license, on maybe a few hundred, at the most a few thousand people and they are then going to be given to literally millions.

We put it on in big vacuum chambers, and we sucked the honeycomb down onto the metal, pulled it tight, and let the adhesive set.<eos> But all through the early stages, we had problems with the honeycomb insulation popping off the vessell.<eos> NARRATOR: The engineers realized they were doing something wrong.<eos> To fix it, they would need specialist help.<eos> We were manufacturing the vehicle at Seal Beach in Southem Califomia.<eos> And Seal Beach is a big surfing town.<eos> And we Found that the surfers had been using honeycomb insulation to make their surfboards, and they were very sklled at using it.<eos> And we finally started hiring the surfers, and they did a great job with it.<eos> The only downside of those guys was that when the surfwas up, there was a big absentee problem.<eos> They were out there doing theirtrip.
Later I'll be in trouble,too.<eos> Tell him, if so I won't do my business here.<eos> Come on Joe!<eos> You can't... you can't do like that<eos> We have many customers there.<eos> Ok,I'll pay you back I promise<eos> Hey, relax, if you can't relax<eos> Me too, it's easy.<eos> We push to our followers.<eos> Hey, they are difference.

Why don't you try the other hand?<eos> It's hard for the wounded arm to pull the bowstring<eos> Take it!<eos> It's not that easy<eos> That's why you have to train the strength of your arm first.<eos> The only way to do it is your willpower.<eos> Young master has been there for three full days<eos> I'm afraid that he will collapse<eos> Fishes should take a bite by now!<eos> Could it be that they sense something already?

In Grímsnes.<eos> Great.<eos> That's just how it is Stefán. regarding the National Security Unit.<eos> Then everything seems to be authorized.<eos> We can't cause any waves.<eos> They're untouchable those bastards.<eos> Basically, protected.<eos> By the mister of justice, yes.<eos> I control nothing.<eos> They can come and go as they please.
Early medieval marriage had little to do with the Church and could be entered into quite casually.<eos> This description of a peasant marriage was given by a witness in a court case held in York.<eos> About the third hour past the ninth, John Beke, saddler, sitting down on a bench, called Marjory to him and said to her,<eos> "Marjory, do you wish to be my wife?"<eos> And she replied, "I will, if you wish."<eos> And taking at once the said Marjory's right hand, John said,<eos> "Marjory, here I take you as my wife, "for better or worse, to have and to hold until the end of my life."<eos> This casual approach horrified the Church authorities.<eos> In 1218, the statutes of the Diocese of Salisbury make this clear.<eos> They ruled that marriages should be celebrated
Nine Saracens come in, light a fire and strip off.<eos> The woman sees their virilla, their virile members, and becomes so excited that she insists her husband make love to her.<eos> After he's done so three times, he can't manage a fourth and falls asleep.<eos> And the woman then offers herself to the Saracens.<eos> All nine of them.<eos> 'Priests were supposed to be celibate, 'at least in the later Middle Ages, 'when the Church decided they could no longer marry.<eos> 'But some lived with mistresses or had affairs with other men's wives.'<eos> 'They were the target of the occasional satirical poem.'<eos> "What do priests do with no woman of their own?<eos> "They force themselves on others.

Something interesting happened:<eos> us in class and Army choppers... training their machine guns.<eos> And at that time... I had my first encounter with teargas... and that smell printed itself in my memory, never left my nose... so that, for me, ABC is teargas flavoured.<eos> There waw this thing about ABC being an industrial area... and people's ways were different there... then things got amplified... for the fact that they felt excluded... all the interviews were with the Sao Paolo crews... everything was happening there, and they felt close and removed at the same time... beacause of the fights, they could not really come to São Paulo... and could not enjoy it when they did.<eos> In São Paulo, they were more in tune... with what was going down in Europe and US.<eos> and they joked:<eos> ABC is punk.<eos> They only liked The Sex Pistols, The Clash and Ramones".<eos> But overthere, them, they had a zillion bands.<eos> The guys from ABC jested with us in São Paulo... they said we were no punks... because we went to town by bus and they by train.
The Palestinians have to do some soul-searching too.<eos> Why did it become a catastrophe?<eos> They could have accept most of the land, a state of their own.<eos> THEY refused, not us.<eos> In 1947.<eos> We cannot apologise for their mistake.<eos> In 1897, the Zionist movement in Europe met and declared that it wanted to found a state for Jews in Palestine.<eos> Two years later, the Arab Mayor of Jerusalem begged them to leave Palestine alone, and warned there'd be an Arab uprising if they didn't.<eos> After the meeting in 1897, two rabbis were sent to Palestine to see what the country was like.<eos> They reported back, "The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man. "
- When what?<eos> When will we have to start worrying about that?<eos> - Still here. Sleep in the waiting room?<eos> - Look, I like him.<eos> All right, I do. But he doesn't need to know that.<eos> - Nobody needs to know that.<eos> - He needs you,<eos> - and you're worried about your friends?<eos> - What do you know?<eos> Do you know what it'd be like for me, for him, if they knew?
That way!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Dig up under the stone pillar next to Gwan Bong pavilion.<eos> I said it wans't it already!<eos> Silence!<eos> Not too bad<eos> But why hasn't anyone come out yet?<eos> Those bastards, never let you come out anymore.<eos> C'mon, they need to breath.
But you must be willing to learn.<eos> The Pool of Etoch.<eos> Look deep.<eos> Leave no survivors!<eos> You're on your own, kid.<eos> We cannot change the past.<eos> But we can choose what we learn from it.<eos> Where one learns vengeance, another learns mercy.<eos> I don't force the stones. I allow them freedom.<eos> Our hearts need that same freedom or they too become heavy, unyielding.
You look stoned.<eos> No.<eos> - Are you feeling it?<eos> - You make me...<eos> Turns out that the only one who's phon... who's phony is, you know, fucking what's-his-name.<eos> Uh, the... the... the kid who... who... who tells the story.<eos> Fucking Caulfield.<eos> So?<eos> So?<eos> Anyways, as I was saying, older boys... they can take a hint.
They're gaining power.<eos> They're the ones guiding her.<eos> Her capacity for survival is greater than anything we could ever have imagined.<eos> Survival of the fittest.<eos> We're a pathetic race, really.<eos> We stopped evolving at a critical point.<eos> Machines have evolved infinitely further in the past 200 years.<eos> And that's what I tried to correct with Aurora.<eos> Her babies are our future.<eos> They are the real miracle.
- I must go.<eos> If we find that watch, we can stop them.<eos> Those boys are going to fight.<eos> I might not be a doctor, but I'm still their nurse.<eos> They need me.<eos> Son of mine, Wife of mine.<eos> Father of mine, what have you found?<eos> His Tardis.<eos> The Doctor can't escape.<eos> You're with Armitage and Thwaites, they know the drill.
You find them?<eos> What?<eos> Anywhere in the world?<eos> Yeah, I just think about them, and then I know where they are.<eos> But it doesn't work right now.<eos> Well, that is a very special ability, Molly.<eos> Because the boogeyman, he likes to hide.<eos> But if you can tell us where he is, we can make sure he never comes back again.<eos> You're different from the other doctors.<eos> They're much better at this.
Bring out the equipment.<eos> Please, they're children, they meant no harm! Please, don't take their hands!<eos> Please! Shut up!<eos> Come along - chop, chop.<eos> I, Vaizey, Sheriff of Nottingham, hereby pronounce sentence on little tiny Billy and tiny little Jane blah-di-blah-di-blah - chop off their hands.<eos> Somebody save my children!<eos> There's an arrow here for you, Sheriff.<eos> Do it.<eos> Rose, children, run!<eos> They can't! Help!
Why does a potential freedom fighter waste his life gambling?<eos> I am a count.<eos> My life has been managed... since the day that I was born.<eos> Tradition, etiquette.<eos> It's all so safe.<eos> I crave danger.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Don't be so sure.<eos> Are you sure you know how to find these friends of yours?<eos> I'm hoping they're gonna find us.
The next day.And I joined Shirley as she did her after school run Where are we going?<eos> To pick up the children.<eos> 'By now I had sensed how impregnable the church members' beliefs are.<eos> 'I wanted to understand how that faith is instilled in the children.'<eos> They go to normal schools?<eos> I'm surprised they're not home-schooled.<eos> There's two reasons for that.<eos> The first one is I couldn't do the job justice.<eos> Secondly, these children need to be in the faces of this community. That is part of our testimony.<eos> Do they preach at school at all?
They see these kids and think, "God hates fags" or "America is doomed".<eos> Do they have friends at school?<eos> Well, they have friendly acquaintances I don't know if you'd call them friends.<eos> They can bring them home?<eos> You think these kids want to come to our house?<eos> It's very nice.<eos> Where would that go?<eos> Pretty quick you'll get into the discussions.<eos> But that's how I met my husband. He hung out with my brother.<eos> I'm saying that when they come round, they're welcome.
It's too quiet.<eos> I don't know if it's Munich or Columbine in there.<eos> Had june bugs bigger than this back home.<eos> They have hi-res cameras upside their asses, too?<eos> Perimeter's covered.<eos> Aerial camera's up.<eos> But I'm not getting a good image here.<eos> Bad guys say what they want?<eos> Say again, sir?<eos> Have they said what the hell they want?
It's the '90s!<eos> Did an "F" train just go by your window?<eos> I know that look.<eos> Don't even think about jumping for that train.<eos> I think I should... I should go home before it gets dark.<eos> You can't abandon me, Liz.<eos> You are me!<eos> No, I'm not you.<eos> Really?<eos> You pick up guys that are smart and funny, and they leave you for someone less complicated.
Starting with some new uniforms. Compliments of the Sheinhardt Wig Company.<eos> You want to be a bunch of winners?<eos> You've got to dress for success.<eos> That's why I sponsor a charity that gives away tuxedoes to homeless people.<eos> It was a beautiful ceremony.<eos> Mazel tov.<eos> That's right.<eos> Put them on.<eos> You don't get these kids, Jack.<eos> They don't care about winning.
I made Frank set that up as a punishment after he farted in my chair.<eos> And when you did that morning radio show the other week, every caller was me.<eos> I am loving all of your characters.<eos> Thanks for calling, Sanjay.<eos> I really believe in Karma.<eos> And this award you just got?<eos> It's a cookie.<eos> Ooh, crunch!<eos> I don't want to do this stuff. But I have to because you're so insecure you get jealous of babies for their soft skin.<eos> And how much attention they get.
Usually they're way deep down.<eos> So somehow, the ones in Utah got stirred up to the surface.<eos> Now you've got your power source, right?<eos> Like a match ready to strike.<eos> Somehow someone came in contact with them and unknowingly brought them into the lab.<eos> So the lab is contaminated with Geobacter.<eos> The scientists would've never realized they were even carrying them.<eos> And then along the way while they were working with 1123-4... they somehow came in contact with it as well, accidentally ingested it.<eos> See they're working with a controlled bacteria.<eos> They know that it can't survive without sunlight or an energy source so they relax, they fuck any biohazard worries - and they basically fuck themselves.
I heard there's a house that way.<eos> We need to get out of the snow first.<eos> How'd you know that there's a house?<eos> He told me.<eos> He said his house is over there.<eos> Go back the way you came.<eos> Don't go, Uncle!<eos> What's the matter with him?<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> They went far away for a little while.
So when did you start living here?<eos> Long, long time ago.<eos> That long ago?<eos> How long?<eos> As long as your age?<eos> By the way, your parents seem to be very good people.<eos> To think about building this big pretty house deep in the forest.<eos> This is very special.<eos> So what I mean is that your parents built this nice house. So they must've left a lot of valuable things for you, right?<eos> Since they've been gone for a while, you have to buy a lot of food, toys, and give offerings to the church, right?
Nobody benefits from this situation, not students, not families, not teachers.<eos> We're working against ourselves here.<eos> Children are thrown into school and we are expected to fix everything, but you can't work with children that are hungry or don't respect rules.<eos> We have nowhere to send children who are very violent or are psychologically troubled.<eos> The families can't deal with them and, in most cases, they don't even have a hospital to go to.<eos> They might be able to get an appointment for the children to see a doctor but several months later.<eos> People can't even afford bus fares.<eos> This is the situation in which children do evaluations and tests, those results are supposed to show how good our public education is.<eos> By the way, the school doesn't even receive a hundred pesos per month, not even a hundred...<eos> They grow up lacking everything, watching the world developing around them. When these children reach eleven or twelve years old, they get to the conclusion that their lives are miserable and not worth living.
It was created as a training tool for nuclear engineers, but we have been using it in the environmental and medicine fields as well.<eos> The reactor is working right now, if you look over the handrail you will see a slightly blue radiation, which is the only visible indication of whether the reactor is working or not.<eos> The Jose Balseiro physics institute is located in the Bariloche Center. Generations of nuclear physicists and engineers were trained who dominated the complete atomic energy cycle.<eos> One of its first graduates is Edgardo Bisogni.<eos> We are in the classrooms of the Balseiro Institute. Grants are awarded every year to about 30 students of physics and nuclear engineering.<eos> Students join the research team after two years.<eos> We have more teachers than students here.<eos> How is your relationship with the students?<eos> I really believe it's a two-way street.<eos> They propose ideas to me as well.
Mom said that the whole family knew.<eos> Okay, gotta go.<eos> Love you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, I found Raphael wandering in the street.<eos> I went to take him back, but Bob and Lee aren't home so I'm just gonna give him a little treat and put him back in their yard.<eos> Wait a second!<eos> Leave him with me.<eos> I need to score some points with those guys and being a dog-rescuing hero could be just the ticket.<eos> So what, you're just gonna keep him here until they come back?
Yes, but that was before your best friend threw her scarf in the ring.<eos> Okay, if I vote for you, do you promise to get rid of that fountain?<eos> See, that's awkward for me.<eos> This is about personal freedom, you know?<eos> I'm running as a libertarian.<eos> Well, I'm voting as a light sleeper.<eos> It's right outside our bedroom window.<eos> Seriously, Lynette, it's like living next to - Splash Mountain.<eos> - But it's my kids' tree house.<eos> - They really need it.
Um, i know a guy who's got millions In a offshore bank account.<eos> Who would i talk to about that?<eos> That Carlos should face his.<eos> Yes, it was that time of year.<eos> Halloween had come once again to Wisteria Lane, And no one was more determined to celebrate its arrival Than the gay couple who had just moved in.<eos> So which of the neighbors should we invite first?<eos> What does it Matter?<eos> They all hate us?<eos> Oh, Lee, that's not true.<eos> They hate you.
Yeah, I really better walk away.<eos> So george has clark in line for his C.T.<eos> - Grey.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Grey.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay, I need you to work in the clinic, grey.<eos> - Well-- - no, no.<eos> Before you open your mouth and tell me all the reasons why you can't, just--just let me say this-- i need this, because I have idiots-- you understand me, grey?<eos> Idiot interns are down there in my clinic, a clinic dripping with my blood, sweat and tears, grey, and I am not convinced-- not at all convinced-- that they will not burn it down with their ineptitude.
Okay, trauma room two.<eos> It's still bleeding. My face is still bleeding.<eos> All right. We'll get to that in a minute, okay?<eos> We?<eos> No, try the head of plastic surgery.<eos> No one is touching my face until I've spoken to the head of plastic surgery. no one.<eos> 34-year-old passenger Marcus King, no complaints except deep cuts on his left arm.<eos> Stable on route.<eos> listen, I'm fine. Please help the kids first.<eos> They're being taken care of, sir. What happened?
(Amanda) Cover Me!<eos> (Daniel) Find Your Cover!<eos> Come On.<eos> Oh,I Was Hit.<eos> I'm Out.<eos> Oh,I'm Out,Too.<eos> (Woman) Now It's Just Daniel And Amanda.<eos> Oh,Hello. What's With All The Stalkerazzi?<eos> Ah,The World In Which We Live In.<eos> Guess They Found Out About The News About "Slater."
What kind of car Do you drive? Hybrid.<eos> 44 miles to the gallon.<eos> Well, see?<eos> We did that, We could stop the war.<eos> We could stop The blood-for-oil campaign.<eos> People don't get it, Do they?<eos> That our guys Are getting blown up And killed every day For oil profits?<eos> No.<eos> Hell no.<eos> I mean, they might as well Just be filling up their s.u.v.s With blood.
Without any muscles.<eos> Look at the drink, Ricky.<eos> It's one of those old mustard glasses, with the diamond and clubs on it.<eos> Julian: Bubbs, lay off Jacob alright.<eos> [Jacob talking]<eos> Ricky:<eos> Holy fuck, look who he's talking too.<eos> Isn't that meat store dicks.<eos> Fuck, remember how stupid those guys were?<eos> They'd be perfect jail cover.
OK. What's the one market we are still not have been into yet?<eos> Anyone? Sigle... young... man.<eos> Well,we are a fashion magzine.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Guys don't give a damn about our clothes. What are they really care about? Huh?<eos> Beer?<eos> Girls?<eos> Right?<eos> Guys want girls.<eos> Girls that are accessible,girls they think they can get.
I've had two guys sat outside my place all day - blacked-out windows, black shirts.<eos> One of them wanted to use my mobile phone as well.<eos> Anyway, I thought I should let you know.<eos> See ya.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> That's Jake and--<eos> The Prince.<eos> They were an item.<eos> Actually, they were very much in love with each other.
Is it a Thursday ?<eos> I decided to show them what my life became after making the same decisions they were making.<eos> Well, this is where I live.<eos> You guys continue to screw off, and let high school pass you by without learning anything, this is where you're going to live.<eos> Sweet.<eos> That hot maid clean for you everyday ?<eos> It's not sweet.<eos> It's pathetic.<eos> I can't even qualify for an apartment.<eos> Catalina, tell these guys why they don't want to be like me.
How'd I even get out ?<eos> I'm going to kill 'em.<eos> I swear to God, I am really going to kill 'em.<eos> Now you're sounding like a real teacher.<eos> In two weeks, you'll have gained 20 pounds<eos> - and stopped shaving anything.<eos> - They're total bastards.<eos> Those kids didn't listen to a single thing I said, when all I was trying to do was help them.<eos> And how do they thank me ?<eos> They flip my car on its side.
We're not allowed to hurt the kids.<eos> At least not physically.<eos> I don't have the energy to hurt them emotionally.<eos> I'm not talking about hurting them.<eos> I'm just talking about giving them a little anonymous taste of their own medicine, or their own saliva, in the case of what they did to your soup, Mrs. McCullum.<eos> They spit in my soup ?<eos> When ?<eos> Well, Mrs. Harding says they do it every day.<eos> I didn't tell you 'cause I know you like your soup, and I didn't want to make you upset.<eos> They gave me mono.
- Hey.<eos> My dad served in Vietnam.<eos> He put his life on the line.<eos> But instead of coming home to a hero's welcome, he found a country that was either ashamed of the war or just wanted to deny it, deny him.<eos> And I fear that our soldiers in Iraq could face the same thing.<eos> And we seem to be in such a hurry for this thing to be over with, so we can go back to pretending... see, in Vietnam, soldiers didn't survive.<eos> But today they do.<eos> And they come home missing legs and arms and eyes... you know, and not much to cling to.<eos> They need us to be proud of them.<eos> You know, they need us to show it. Every chance we get.
No,it's not true! Don't do it.<eos> Don't.<eos> You-you can take me.<eos> You can take me, but just let my kids out,okay?<eos> Just let them go out the back,all right?<eos> I don't want you.<eos> No!<eos> I love you.<eos> Do you feel better?<eos> 'Cause they're gone.
I mean, thanks to you, things are...<eos> Actually looking up.<eos> Some people at work have been after me. I think I have 'em under control.<eos> So, why the grouchiness?<eos> Is it because your sister thinks I'm a trollop?<eos> It's not just Deb.<eos> It's the suddenness of all of this.<eos> Losing Rita, the kids.<eos> They've been the only thing keeping me... human... for a long time.<eos> Were they keeping you human, though, or were they the ones making you feel like the monster that you were talking about?
Something about a mexican in a tinted truck, driving up and pop, pop, pop, right in marvin's ass.<eos> That's one big ass.<eos> Maybe if that mexican had better aim, he wouldn't have needed three shots.<eos> Maybe if he hadn't used his auntie's snubnose piece of shit, you'd be right.<eos> Still, war is on.<eos> War is on.<eos> More males?<eos> I think that's the last of them.<eos> Now, why are you doing that?<eos> Got to separate the males from the females, or they'll fuck up the whole crop.
Your porn might help the otters at the zoo find their spark again.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> So you kind of do for animals what i do for people.<eos> What, you film people having sex?<eos> I mean that you're a relationship coach now.<eos> Yeah, well, i think it's easier with animals.<eos> And will you stop calling it porn?<eos> Look who's an artist now.<eos> Mr. Hammond, do you have any remaining witnesses to call?<eos> Your honor, the men i had subpoenaed to testify... well, they... have chosen not to appear today. You understand, mr.
Pick up the goddamn phone.<eos> Wayne,it's me.<eos> Pick up the phone.<eos> No,I understand you got a hiring freeze,craig.<eos> "Extreme euphoria,anxiety,aggressiveness,hostility,paranoia, mania,excessive talkativeness."<eos> It doesn't say what to do,but-- oh,check out the symptoms of a overdose.<eos> "Nerve damage,kidney failure,convulsions,hallucinations, stroke,heart attack."<eos> That ought to scare the kids,huh?<eos> You better go in there.<eos> They're gonna have questions.
Haroun Abbas was killed in New York.<eos> Not according to your brief.<eos> The prosecution claims Haroun Abbas was killed as a direct result of Dr. Sutton's criminal negligence in Iraq.<eos> If my client's action were legal where the alleged negligence occurred. The prosecution does not have jurisdiction.<eos> You're arguing that torture's legal in Iraq?<eos> It's not torture.<eos> Dr. Sutton's benign method of interrogation was implemented in Iraq, where it is indeed legal.<eos> Not according to the Geneva conventions.<eos> In Hamden Versus Rumsfeld. The Supreme court said that violating the conventions is a federal crime.<eos> Yes, but according to a 2002 executive order. Counter-resistance methods are not criminal unless they brought about the pain the equivalent of severe impairment of bodily functions or prolonged mental illness.
- Yeah.<eos> She's got five or six resting places on the big island.<eos> Dig her up and ask.<eos> The other night, I heard you talking in your sleep, right?<eos> "Is two days off a crime?<eos> Do I never get to fuckin' relax?"<eos> When are you gonna take the pictures of your wrist?<eos> You know, I'm hesitant.<eos> You know?<eos> Physicians, they... They toss it off.
- What?<eos> I don't know if I can do this to you.<eos> Do what?<eos> Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> 'Cause there are no kids there.<eos> On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black "X" over Argentina.<eos> - You know what I mean. - No, I don't.<eos> Okay, say we had kids.<eos> They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere.
What do you want me to do ?<eos> Pull him aside when he gets back.<eos> Detain him.<eos> You've done it before.<eos> When it was about us, you knew what to do.<eos> It's too much.<eos> You want me to go through official channels, I will.<eos> Then we're done here.<eos> And hell, while I'm at it, I might as well let all the facts out.<eos> Then they'll know everything.
In 1893 the British astronomer Edward Maunder observed... that during the Little Ice Age there were barely any spots visible on the Sun.<eos> A period of solar inactivity which became known as the Maunder Minimum.<eos> But how reliable are sunspots as an indicator of the weather?<eos> I decided to test it by gambling on the weather through William Hill, against what the Met Office said was, you know, a normal expectation.<eos> And I won money month after month after month after month.<eos> Last winter the Met Office said it could be or would be an exceptionally cold winter;<eos> We said: "no, that is nonsense, it's gonna be close to normal"<eos> and we specifically said when it would be cold, after Christmas and February:<eos> we were right, they were wrong. In 1991, senior scientists of the Danish Meteorological Institute decided to compile a record of sunspots in the 20th century... and compare it with the temperature record.<eos> What they found, was an incredibly close correlation... between what the Sun was doing... and changes in temperature on Earth.

Ted Heath's conservative government Mrs. Thatcher was determined the same would not happen to her she set out to break their power.<eos> "What we have seen in this country... is the emergence of an organized revolutionary minority who are prepared to exploit industrial disputes but whose real aim is... the breakdown of law and order and the distraction of democratic parlamentary government."<eos> The politization of this subject... started with Margaret Thatcher.<eos> She was very concerned, always (I remember when I was Secretary of State for Energy), to promote nuclear power, long before the issue of climate change came up, because she was concerned about energy security and she didn't trust the Middle East<eos> and she didn't trust the National Union of Mineworkers so she didn't trust oil and she didn't trust coal, so therefore she thought we really had to push ahead with nuclear power.<eos> And then, when the climate change global warming thing came up, she thought this is great, this is another argument because it doesn't have any CO2 emissions this is another argument why we should go for nuclear<eos> and that is what she was really largely saying it's been misrepresented since then.<eos> And so she said to the scientists, she went to the Royal Society and she said:<eos> "there's money on the table for you to prove this stuff"<eos> so of course they went and did that.
If I wanted to do research on, shall we say, the squirrels of Sussex, what I would do, and this is anytime from 1990 onwards, I would write my grant application saying:<eos> "I want to investigate... the not-gathering behaviour of squirrels, with special reference to the effects of global warming",<eos> and that way I get my money... if I forget to mention global warming...<eos> I might not get the money. There's a question in my mind... that the large amounts of money that have been fed into this particular, rather small area of science have distorted the overall scientific effort.<eos> We're all competing for funds and if your field is the focus of concern, then you have done much less work rationalizing why your field should be funded.<eos> By the 1990's tenths of billions of dollars of government funding in the US, UK and elsewhere were being diverted into research relating to global warming.<eos> A large portion of those funds went into building computer models to forecast what the climate will be in the future.<eos> But how accurate are those models?<eos> Doctor Roy Spencer is a senior scientist for climate studies at NASA's Marshall space flights Center; he has been awarded medals for exceptional scientific achievement in both NASA and the American Meteorological Society.<eos> Climate models are only as good as the assumptions that go into them, and they have hundreds of assumptions.
Fire in the hut is too smoky and consumes too much wood to be used as heating.<eos> There is no hot water.<eos> We in the West cannot begin to imagine how hard life is without electricity.<eos> The life expectancy of people... who live like this in terrifyingly short.<eos> Their existance impoverished in every way.<eos> A few miles away the UN is hosting its conference on global warming in its plush gated headquarters.<eos> Gift shop is selling souvenirs of peasant travel life while delegates discuss... how to promote what are described as:<eos> "sustainable forms of electrical generation".<eos> Africa has coal, and Africa has oil, but environmental groups are campaigning... against the use of these sources of energy.<eos> Instead, they say Africa... and the rest of the developing world should use solar and wind power.
- Oh, dear.<eos> - Is something wrong?<eos> I have a client who lost a lot of money gambling.<eos> I took the case, though I seem utterly without cause of action, and I'm just a little fraught.<eos> We have no defense other than to put the boys up there and let them proclaim their innocence.<eos> - And you can put me up there.<eos> - Yes, but you're their mother.<eos> Mrs. Scanlon, if you really wanna help your sons here... our suggestion is that you convince them to go with temporary insanity.<eos> - I go with it all the time.<eos> - But they didn't do it.
Mostly in Latin America though, right?<eos> They've had a field office in Islamabad since the war started.<eos> What's their take?<eos> Well, they're not gonna say much without Tom on the phone.<eos> I'm not putting anything into Tom's ear till I hear a lot more, because right now this is sounding like a TV movie.<eos> Ms. Tate...<eos> Mary.<eos> What are the guys at Trask saying?<eos> They have teams in Kandahar working private security.<eos> They know about the abduction and they've worked a couple this year.
Victims of something, but not this fire.<eos> Look at the chest;<eos> there are staples here.<eos> These people have already been through an autopsy.<eos> These bodies were probably moved here.<eos> This fire is starting to look more like a cover-up.<eos> I think it's time we ask our lone survivor a few more questions.<eos> Two more bodies at my house?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> They didn't die in the fire, Claire.
- But nothing.<eos> Now, I know you got your G.E.D., and you think the world's going to be your little oyster, but those guys out there, they went to junior college.<eos> South Nathanville Junior College.<eos> That's the Harvard of Camden area junior colleges.<eos> Overeducated bastards.<eos> You know what they call us?<eos> Dockers.<eos> Because we work on the loading dock.<eos> You know what the ironical part is?<eos> They actually wear Dockers.
But you know what?<eos> Maybe I was wrong.<eos> Because, in over 30 years, it sure hasn't gotten me anyplace.<eos> Give it up, son.<eos> You'll never be one of them.<eos> And ce you try, you'll never be one of us.<eos> I got sweeping to do.<eos> Don't be mad.<eos> I just want to fit in with the guys.<eos> While my hard work wasn't impressing my coworkers... they weren't the ones I was trying to impress.
Hello, Douglas.<eos> We need to have another word.<eos> When Fred Tulley died, he was in possession of banknotes.<eos> Banknotes that had been withdrawn from circulation and should have been incinerated.<eos> You worked on the retort stoker furnaces, you were telling us.<eos> Oh, yes, that is... correct.<eos> Which is where the Bank of England came to dispose of their banknotes.<eos> Oh, well, it... It was all a long time ago.<eos> Well, I'm sure that will be taken into consideration when deciding on further action, along with whether you've been co-operative or not.<eos> The geezers from the Bank of England turn up, and we have to stand well back while they get on with it.

How are they?<eos> She's fine.<eos> They're fine.<eos> No, they're...<eos> Catherine and I aren't together anymore.<eos> And Maria doesn't...<eos> She... She doesn't speak to me.<eos> She's ashamed of me.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> Sometimes, children want you to hurt the way they do.
This here's my brother Rance.<eos> We just made it to the next round too.<eos> Rance... nice.<eos> Nigel just called us a curious cocktail of inbreeding and type 2 diabetes.<eos> But then he passed us through anyway.<eos> That's hitting below the belt.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Australian people are mean.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I was wrong, they did it.
I won't have to go into detail.<eos> There's "The Big Wave".<eos> Carina Masson and Jean-Luc Ermio.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know, but that'd work.<eos> Just finished.<eos> You're almost early!<eos> OK, what's it about?<eos> "Two drunk soldiers end up in a strip club, instead of being back at barracks.<eos> They meet a girl called "Big Wave", because she's big and has wavy hair.
"Manicure from hell."<eos> But Poul just wasn't funny.<eos> Frank often wondered which was the scarier:<eos> Poul or the crimes.<eos> He beat her unconscious and then he pushed the skewer in.<eos> And then he kicked it.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Upstairs with the children.<eos> The children?<eos> They didn't mention any children.
If I'm wrong, no hard feelings.<eos> I'm still free for lunch.<eos> I will listen to your client just to determine if I'll even accept this case on jurisdictional grounds.<eos> - You're not serious.<eos> - 2 o'clock. Adjourned.<eos> Don't you be taking your pants off for her.<eos> - You read my mind.<eos> - I'm serious, Alan.<eos> She's famous for telling lawyers to drop "trou" in her chambers.<eos> And more times than not, they do it.
For the good of the troops. - Mr Shore.<eos> - Yes, your honor.<eos> Chambers?<eos> Discipline?<eos> You think you're funny?<eos> It's just all this talk of corporal punishment excites me.<eos> Does it not you?<eos> What you reading?<eos> Do you know what Cheney said about the Guantanamo prisoners?<eos> He said, "they're living in the tropics, so they're all well fed. "They've got everything they could possibly want."
All right. Let's get the guy in here, all right?<eos> - Hey, Shannon.<eos> - Agent Eppes.<eos> You're hiring goons tailing my agents?<eos> I have a perfect right to recover my property.<eos> My employees have done nothing wrong.<eos> I would like them released.<eos> - Yeah, well, they helped the suspects escape.<eos> - You have no proof of that.<eos> Maybe they found the truck the same way you guys did.
I thought you were gonna get rid of him.<eos> Or did you go crazy there for a second?<eos> I don't know,i just...<eos> I just couldn't.<eos> Yeah,i think it's his eyes.<eos> It's like they're looking right into my soul.<eos> That's what mom said.<eos> Women used to say that about my eyes.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause now they're kind of milky and bloodshot.
What has happened?<eos> Jonas has been murdered.<eos> We believe that voodoo is involved.<eos> Parts of his body were cut out.<eos> Wicked...<eos> God forgive them.<eos> Little Jonas?<eos> That is terrible.<eos> Do you know anyone that could have done this?<eos> Demons, they walk amongst us in human form every day.
The great marine reptiles disappeared long ago... and time has buried their world.<eos> But any of us might still encounter a sea monster.<eos> Buddy!<eos> As if from nowhere, the distant past returns.<eos> The scientists hope to find not just the fossil of an ancient creature... but a story recorded in its bones.<eos> Grab your tools.<eos> Rain washed some of the chalk away and exposed it.<eos> This is great.<eos> Okay-<eos> They recognize it as something special... a rare Dolichorhynchops- a dolly, for short.
Their fossils have been found around the world over decades.<eos> It could have been over 30 feet long.<eos> The matrix materials we've got in the lab seem to indicate-<eos> These finds will help the team piece together the story of the dolly... and picture the moment in time when it swam in the sea.<eos> In many ways, the dolly's world was far different from ours.<eos> The climate was warmer.<eos> Sea levels were higher, and more of Earth was submerged.<eos> This dolly would have lived in a vast inland sea... that cut North America in two.<eos> Marine reptiles were also found in the waters around Europe... which was a scattering of islands... and throughout the world's oceans.<eos> In time they died out... and sea levels retreated... exposing vast areas of seabed.
Big eater, this guy.<eos> For several weeks, the travelers push on.<eos> The female's flipper is slowly healing... the embedded tooth now surrounded my scar tissue.<eos> The young female is drawn away by a potential meal of squid.<eos> One escapes among a colony of crinoids- prehistoric relatives of sea stars- perhaps swept up from the bottom by currents.<eos> The female has put herself directly in the sights of a giant.<eos> Taking the exposed parts of the skeleton together- skull to tail - I make the specimen about a 29-footer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's something in the stomach.<eos> They had found the monster's last meal... entombed within its ribs.
I thought-I was... well,ahem,sometimes,you know... you know,I don't drink,so when I come to a place like this-ahem-<eos> I look at,like,the vodka bottles-<eos> I used to drink vodka,so it's always- that's what I look at,but all the crazy bottles they have now, like some of these-like,designer- like that trump vodka.<eos> That's like gold plated,that bottle that's up there.<eos> Oh,yeah.<eos> So... of course,it always makes me think-<eos> You know,I'm on medication right now.<eos> I'm,um,I'm what you call bi-polar.<eos> And sometimes I have to take mood stabilizers or brain-drainers for it.<eos> I mean I go off it sometimes,but my parents always want me to go back on it,'cause they just, you know,are afraid that if I go off it, then I'm just gonna snap and try to,you know,
so we are all... good?<eos> we're fine, just...<eos> - okay.<eos> - I'm fine, alright?<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> you're xxxx now?<eos> yeah I've got enough tour.<eos> **** these guys?<eos> Cunningham just turned 35, and er... whif's leaving. these boys are trying to cheer hime up.<eos> they ****** ****** shit like that. ***** *****.
Well,the Well,the mystery's over.<eos> She's a whore,ok?<eos> I want to know what really happened that night,ok?<eos> All of it.<eos> You know the truth,tommy.<eos> You're an uncontrollable alcoholic with a heavy case of survivor's guilt.<eos> A couple of big swigs,your guilt goes right out the window,bing,bang,zoom-- you're whipping off my panties and whipping out your dick.<eos> I saw something about it on "oprah"--the whole grieving process?<eos> That's how men deal with death-- they want to have a lot of sex.<eos> They think it kills off all the emotions inside.
He sent in the army to crush dissent.<eos> Scores were shot dead.<eos> Many were brought to Juan Delfín's church.<eos> Tens of thousands of people poured down into La Paz.<eos> Like the people of Venezuela's barrios, demanding the return of their president, they demanded their country back.<eos> If the rich and powerful of Latin America had a nightmare, this was it.<eos> Goni fled to the United States and is today living in a smart suburb of Washington.<eos> In October 2004, the Bolivian Congress ordered his arrest on charges of bloody massacre.<eos> George Bush has said, "Governments that harbour terrorists,<eos> "are as guilty as they are."
-has anything to do with Luke and the Slitheen?<eos> -It must have. But how?<eos> Could Mr Smith have some connection with the Slitheen?<eos> Where did he come from?<eos> The biggest volcanic eruption civilisation has ever seen.<eos> Eighteen months ago, when I was researching volcanic activity, a geologist friend sent me a crystal from the site of Krakatoa.<eos> The crystal had become a curiosity among geologists.<eos> They'd never seen anything like it.<eos> Neither had I.<eos> But they didn't see what I did.
Almost Consumptive.<eos> Something Is Seriously Amiss.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> You Cataldo Men Clean Up Nicely.<eos> Well, These Are For You.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The Boys Have Something For Sam.<eos> Oh, You Didn't Have To Do That.<eos> Well, I Wanted To, And They Nted To.
Maybe I stay here, meet your folks...<eos> Maybe we get snowed in.<eos> Oh, how cool would it be to have a legit reason not to leave the house?<eos> Yeah... but, uh, it sounded like your aunt and uncle really wanted to see you.<eos> It's true.<eos> You should probably hit the road before the storm starts.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I gotta say, Phil, your parents must be pretty great.<eos> I mean, most of the time it's the kids who fly home.<eos> - It's nice that they get you.
Okay, here's what you need to do.<eos> Mom, I understand.<eos> No, I don't want you and dad driving in the storm, either.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Thank you for protecting me tonight.<eos> Thank you for defending me tonight.<eos> I am merely the wind beneath your hooves.<eos> It's always meant a lot to have them be proud of me.<eos> But tonight something shifted, and I saw myself through your eyes, and I didn't care what they thought anymore.
Severe.<eos> But I wanted the baby anyway.<eos> They didn't consult you?<eos> No, the bastard just killed my boy.<eos> I've got three daughters.<eos> He was gonna be my son.<eos> Where were you Monday night?<eos> In the park training my dogs.<eos> Anybody see you?<eos> They're not always the most social animals in the world.
The swipe guy saw a lady and then two teens.<eos> Two teens getting dental work on a Friday night?<eos> We got a hit on Goldman's credit card.<eos> Kids.<eos> Most of my customers are kids.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Any chance two of them came in when you opened the gate this morning?<eos> Oh, buying 20 pairs of $200 sneakers, various sizes.<eos> Oh, them.<eos> They were kind of scrawny.
Look at the logo.<eos> Five mountains, not six.<eos> You can wait up front.<eos> I'm checking every box.<eos> Lots of goody bags for the kids.<eos> Doc hustled local stores for donations.<eos> We'll need a list of that.<eos> Why did all these moms cancel their sons' appointments, like these on Friday?<eos> You know kids when a bug goes around.<eos> They go to the same school?
Happy birthday, dad.<eos> Jim's divorced.<eos> I guess his books keep him company.<eos> You know, he has these arranged by the Dewey decimal system.<eos> I guess he finds peace here in this chair.<eos> I got another inhaler.<eos> It's a different brand.<eos> Status asthmaticus.<eos> An unstoppable asthma attack.<eos> The facial cuts were ugly, but they didn't kill him.
All right. Open it up.<eos> Sure enough, after a month together, they hated each other more than ever. The gang violence continued.<eos> You get these two gangs to stop fighting, I'm gonna give you another certificate.<eos> This time for one month off your sentence. A<eos> - A month?<eos> I'm in.<eos> All right, just a little word of advice.<eos> These fellas can smell fear.<eos> You gotta let 'em know who's boss from jump street.<eos> You gotta stand taller than they do, you gotta speak louder than they do. You gotta be tougher than they are. You gotta-
Sometimes she just seems to hate guys, you know?<eos> Women.<eos> - You married?<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> - Lucky you.<eos> - She passed away.<eos> Sweet.<eos> No alimony.<eos> I'm droppin' these guys off at the fair.<eos> I probably should arrest them, but, uh, it's the Fourth ofJuly... and, uh, they seem like pretty nice guys. Guys, guys.
It's me.<eos> Hello, Ry.<eos> What?<eos> Okay, calm down.<eos> I just have a small problem.<eos> I told you not to call about small problems.<eos> Yeah. Well, when I call about big problems, you don't like that either, so make up your mind, kiddo.<eos> Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box and sort of ignoring my ideas.<eos> That's good.<eos> They're creative. You're not.
Well...<eos> Delivery's all wrong.<eos> She's butchering it.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired?<eos> She thought it had to do with the twins.<eos> - That's what I call them.<eos> - Can you be more specific?<eos> Who are the twins?<eos> To be delicate, they hang off milady's chest.

Should there be widows?<eos> Should the dead be shamed?<eos> They said, "No"<eos> War began in Kinigi, in the heat<eos> Everyone was involved, so understand, my children, lt wasn't about guns or weapons lt was about a fight for truth I will thank them wherever I am<eos> Their heroics will be known worldwide<eos> From Darfur in Sudan<eos> To the Comoro Islands, they will be admired<eos> And I'll see them the way the Pope sees his church<eos> But now that they have conquered, I ask of them
College?<eos> W-Why?<eos> To learn?<eos> Learn?<eos> You can learn anywhere, Chris.<eos> You can learn by reading a fortune cookie.<eos> If you get hit by a truck, you learn not to walk out into traic.<eos> If you smack Mike Tyson, you learn that you are going to get your ass whooped.<eos> But your parents are way too broke for yoto go to college to just learn.<eos> They need you to go to college and learn how to get a job.
Jimmy, I know you spent a small fortune these tickets tonight, but... Ow.<eos> Why is the word "but" never followed by something good?<eos> Would I be the worst girlfriend in the world if I asked for a rain check... on our night out on the town tonight?<eos> I-I'll make it up to you.<eos> It's just I'm chasing down a hot lead on the meteor challenged.<eos> This can't wait till tomorrow?<eos> Look, please don't take this personally.<eos> I thought I could deal with this, but it's just everything's about meteor freaks lately.<eos> I thought we agreed we weren't gonna use that word anymore.<eos> Well, that's what they are, and if those freaks were locked up in Belle Reve, then... maybe I'd get to see you once in a while.
you want to know what i did -- what i really did?<eos> i had lunch.<eos> -lunch? -me and trotter.<eos> he had a cheeseburger,i had a salad, and i just pointed out the money that could be made with a few businesses that cater to harmless vice.<eos> so trotter built it,and,man,did they come.<eos> supposedly god-fearing folk, waist-deep in booze,sex,gambling.<eos> i barely lifted a finger.<eos> -that's it? -you don't get it.<eos> all you got to do is nudge humans in the right direction.<eos> some whiskey here,a hooker there, and they'll walk right into hell with big,fat smiles on their faces.
i mean,both brothers are duke university grads.<eos> no criminal record.<eos> i mean,a few speeding tickets.<eos> they inherited their father's real estate fortune six years ago.<eos> -how much?<eos> -$112 million.<eos> nice life.<eos> yeah. i mean,nice,clean,aboveboard. so,why did they see the ship?<eos> why sheila,too?<eos> what do they all have in common?
You neverworked together?<eos> No.<eos> I was Oroissant's bodyguard.<eos> So I was with him day and night, I saw everything that happened there.<eos> Oroissant's office was used to recruit new members for the Baader-Meinhof gang.<eos> The story of Oroissant's office, all the young people who came to it<eos> later became hardliners.<eos> They all came via Oroissant.<eos> All the jailbreak plans were hatched in the cells on the 7th floor of Stannheim Prison.<eos> To get the ideas out, you needed lawyers, and they did it.
You seem to know him well?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> No letters or phone calls from him?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> You're not acting on instructions from Mr Oarlos?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I'm here to defend the two prisoners, and I won't hide the sympathy and esteem I feel for them.<eos> That's all.<eos> "The truth is, Magdalena Kopp and Bruno Bréguet will be freed.<eos> "You know that, and so do they.
We say "Oh, man, I was whacked off...<eos> - Cool.<eos> ...last night."<eos> Hello. I'm Murray Hewitt.<eos> I manage the guys.<eos> Well, it was really great to talk to you guys!<eos> - Whoa. - A fan of ours.<eos> Hey, do you want to join the fan list?<eos> Here we are. Here's a card with our website on.<eos> And you can get online and e-mail the guys and they'll reply to you.
But if you stop at the first hurdle, you'll agree to those who believe in us as good inferior only to give birth<eos> When you're a doctor, what you could not do for this woman today what you can do for your children.<eos> What you can do for your grandchildren<eos> I do not know if I'll ever be doctor, mom<eos> I hate blood.<eos> I hate the smell of death<eos> But!<eos> We all hate!<eos> Also men.<eos> Only they They have learned not to let you see
In the houses of the commons, we are opening a school Children of the age of your child I wanted to just ask you to also send him<eos> Giovanni's like me, he was not born to study, knows sit still<eos> Do not worry, it is important to try to have it clean like other children<eos> But have you seen where I live?<eos> Can be clean when there is no water?<eos> You send your child to school, otherwise we will us<eos> Thank You<eos> These children seem so different from those in which it is spoken in the books of pedagogy<eos> That is why I have accepted<eos> They are like a blank book on which we will be the first to write
I am the best in the class<eos> Promise me something<eos> If something is wrong, write me and tell me, okay?<eos> But how do you learn so much memory?<eos> Enough ... you there is a very beautiful garden, you know?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Yes, and full of bugs<eos> here it is<eos> Very well<eos> We ... we are here to thank you for everything you do for our children, really you are the only one who believed that they could do some good.
Maybe she has nothing to do with all that.<eos> - It's in the genes.<eos> - Drink some tea.<eos> Only the genes can lead to that.<eos> Want some tea?<eos> Genes, genes...<eos> I know them very well.The answer...<eos> Their answer, if there is one, will be very pretty.<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> They should be kept in pits.
I know you're angry, Michael.<eos> But I know that an exploding car can throw a man off-balance.<eos> You'll thank me.<eos> He won't even talk to me.<eos> He won't even answer my calls.<eos> Well, you'll have to be extra charming.<eos> Whether you're in Moscow, Tehran or Miami club girls are a good source of information.<eos> Men say things to a beautiful woman.<eos> They give out phone numbers, hotel keys.<eos> They let down their guard.
Very, very little.<eos> Apparently the bottom has dropped out of the alpaca market.<eos> Waiting for the good news here.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> They're undervalued.<eos> Now is the time to jump in with both feet.<eos> Honey, we have an opportunity to own over 400 alpacas.<eos> This may never happen again.<eos> And it's not happening now.<eos> Gar, look, I-I think it's great that you're teaching the kids that they can be whatever they put their mind to in this life...
Oh, come on.<eos> I'm just giving the kid a thrill.<eos> I mean, this place is like... if a yawn could yawn.<eos> How do you stand it?<eos> I'm good here.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Who's up for a hot slice?<eos> Huh?<eos> Penguins are generally ?<eos> They continue to nest in the same location. Often with the same penguin partner from the previous year.
Chuck, listen you can't tell your handlers you ever saw me.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> They can help you, lazslo.<eos> They're the good guys.<eos> There's no such thing in this business.<eos> I mean, you don't believe me?<eos> Go home and search your room.<eos> See what kind of bugs your good guy handlers planted on you.<eos> From now on, you should trust your handlers precisely as much as they trust you.
What do you think this is?<eos> Was it a band tour?<eos> A rugby tour...<eos> I've organized.<eos> Same thing.<eos> - Not really.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Players play the game, you guys play the guitar.<eos> Don't they?<eos> They kick the ball, you kick the... jams.
Charlie.<eos> Do you hear those coyotes?<eos> I hate to bother you, but it sounds like we have a wholpack of them out there now.<eos> That's where they belong.<eos> Well, I can'sleep.<eos> They're taunting me, charlie.<eos> Do you know that native americans considered coyotes to be trickste, scavengers, thieves, shape-shifter they're survivors.<eos> And you know what's amazing?<eos> Coyotes are the only indigenous north american animals to have proliferated since the europeans settled here.<eos> They're used to being subordinate to bears and wolves, but since we've eliminated those top predators, they've actually excelled.
Well, you don't sound very knowledgeable.<eos> Actually, circumstances lead me to believe that the Catorces might have been trying to settle some sort of internal dispute and are just letting the One-Fives take credit for Jesse and Angel's death.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> We didn't kill no Angel or Jesse!<eos> It was these two fools, right here.<eos> Punk number one and punk number two.<eos> - I'm sorry, I didn't get your name?<eos> - Spider.<eos> Well I've got news for you, Spider.<eos> If you boys didn't kill Angel and Jesse, and the One-Fives here have figured out some way to stroll down your streets and knock off anyone they want, and then disappear into thin air. Well, you're probably better off just shooting yourselves in the head right now and getting it over with.
Well I've got news for you, Spider.<eos> If you boys didn't kill Angel and Jesse, and the One-Fives here have figured out some way to stroll down your streets and knock off anyone they want, and then disappear into thin air. Well, you're probably better off just shooting yourselves in the head right now and getting it over with.<eos> It makes me wonder. Who's the bitch now?<eos> "Who's the bitch now?"<eos> Well, you wanted them talking, Will.<eos> Now they are.<eos> And I'm one step closer to proving that this is not a rival gang shooting.<eos> Yeah, and LA is one step closer to civil war.<eos> If we can find out who killed Angel and Jesse, then we can prove to these boys that we want to protect them...<eos> They're not interested in proof!
Do you know where your boy is right now?<eos> - Uh,should I?<eos> - Yeah,you should.<eos> He's about to make a fatal rookie mistake.<eos> I just heard from a source of mine on "money beat."<eos> James is going on alex mason's show today.<eos> Ed,james can handle himself.<eos> Alex mason has turned captains of industry into punching bags on that show.<eos> She sweet-talks them into an interview.<eos> They think they're sitting down with a friend,and then the knives come out.
It's fine.<eos> Scrub sinks are over there.<eos> We contract with the lab downstairs.<eos> Yeah,nai,I don't think it's fine to them.<eos> To them,I am the interloper.<eos> I don't lope.<eos> I own 55% of the practice.<eos> I made a decision.<eos> Yeah,they have to live with that decision.<eos> I have to live with-they will get over it.
Why did you play this game?<eos> At first it was curiosity.<eos> Then it became fun.<eos> Chinese believe in 18 levels of hell.<eos> A specific level for each sin.<eos> The home wrecker will go to hell of metal Trees.<eos> The unfiIiaI will go to hell of blood pool.<eos> Different levels for different sinners.<eos> Human beings think that they are pure.<eos> They don't even know when they've erred.
- free at last from rebirth, free at last from suffering and death.<eos> A council was assembled to record for posterity the Buddha's teachings.<eos> These were learnt by heart and handed down the centuries by generations of monks.<eos> The Buddha's body was cremated. And his remains were preserved.<eos> They were enshrined two hundred years later by India's first Emperor King Ashoka who converted to Buddhism.<eos> He built vast monuments or stuppas and erected pillars to mark the key sites of the Buddha's life.<eos> Asoka then becomes an absolutely key figure, both in terms of the actual spread of Buddhism but then as a model for future Buddhist leaders throughout Asia they look back to Ashoka as the kind of ideal king and supporter of Buddhism.<eos> So far as we know the Emperor Asoka who ruled over two thirds of modern India in the middle of the 3rd century BC, helped monks to send out missions to countries bordering India,<eos> missionaries were sent up into Kashmir to Nepal and certainly Sri Lanka.<eos> They converted the king, the king give his patronize to Buddhism and Sri Lanka has therefore been a Buddhist country from that day to this.
The macalino family computer wares covered from the stolen car.<eos> Archie...found the chat logs.<eos> A lot of traffic between amy and the wolfman.<eos> Keep reading.<eos> It looks like amy's luring the wolfman.<eos> What would you do if you found this on lindsey's computer?<eos> Ground her for life.<eos> Take the laptop.<eos> Lock her in the attic,maybe?<eos> Well,you push kids,they push back.
No, I'm the hostage!<eos> Yet few of us realize the debt we owe to those responsible for this.<eos> To those who dwell among us, anonymous, seemingly ordinary, whom destiny brought together to repair, to heal, to save us from ourselves.<eos> If evolution can do this for even the smallest of creatures, then why not these human beings?<eos> If someone here... found out about me, what would happen?<eos> When will they stop?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's a shiny new toy, and she's all mine.<eos> And they're still out there, among us, in the shadows, in the light.

That they are bound together by a common purpose, a glaring reality, to be extraordinary?
It is better to eat you! '<eos> He fell upon Little Red Riding Hood ... yum!<eos> Okay.<eos> You know the moral of the story?<eos> What is morality?<eos> A moral is a board in stories for children.<eos> Let's see.<eos> What we learn from this story?<eos> Yes. But the wolves are always hungry.<eos> We must be wary because they can deceive you better to eat you.
Baden-Powell was assisted in his defence of the town by an unlikely force, a group of boys, gathered together before the siege started.<eos> They became a sort of unofficial cadet corps.<eos> They performed a vital role, taking messages between the various defenders. Often on bicycles and under fire.<eos> In later life Baden-Powell would recount the stirring story of the cadets at Mafeking to inspire English boys. I said to one of these boys on one occasion,<eos> "You will get hit one of these days riding about like that when shells are flying."<eos> And he replied, "I pedal so quick, sir, they'd never catch me." Could any of you do that?<eos> Much of Baden-Powell's subsequent reputation was based not on his complex military strategies, but on his use of tricks and ruses, to try and fool the Boers into thinking the British were better equipped than they were.<eos> They didn't have any mines, but Baden-Powell got these men to walk out beyond the perimeter carrying big black boxes.<eos> Then to bury them deep in the sand at intervals. Then, later on, he let off a stick of dynamite in the same area, and the Boers were convinced they were laying a minefield.<eos> Another of his tricks was to stake out all these posts along the front, and then to have men moving between them as if they were laying barbed wire.
Come on, baby, be a team player.<eos> If Night pulls another half-billion-dollar grosser out of his hat, I'll get you some diamonds.<eos> - The briefcase isn't here.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Just what I said. Are you sure you didn't leave it in the office?<eos> What, you don't believe me?<eos> Jesus Christ, the valet probably stole it.<eos> - Don't be racist.<eos> - Valets steal shit, all right?<eos> Just because they're mostly Hispanic doesn't make me a racist.
The truth is...<eos> Are you listening Billy?<eos> The truth is, if I'm being honest, if I'm not winding you up,<eos> I don't get a lot of pleasure out of killing children.<eos> But I get enough.<eos> - OK.<eos> Do you know anything about lions? - Lions?<eos> What happens when the head lion gets killed by a young one?<eos> Do you know what the lionesses do?<eos> They go straight into heat for the new head of the family.
He was drugged, that's how he changed.<eos> I never took anything.<eos> Well, maybe you just inherited it. Like it's in your blood now.<eos> Runs in the family.<eos> Well, that would make sense. Just one problem. They aren't related.<eos> - But look at them. They must be.<eos> - But they can't be.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's interesting that you have twins.<eos> Do they have similar personalities? Or are they opposites?
I mean, come home.<eos> I am home, Dad.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.<eos> Shawn, I thought you were smarter than this.<eos> I mean, are you really that surprised?<eos> - I saved your mother's life.<eos> - And I will always be grateful for that.<eos> My mother was sick for three years.<eos> My parents went through their entire life savings.<eos> They gave me money to get my parents out of debt
Come on. Let's go shape the leaders of tomorrow.<eos> Ah,man,I lost my straw in my juice box.<eos> Oh,got it.<eos> Wha - lost it.<eos> Wait. Got-<eos> Ahh.<eos> Lost.<eos> The circle represents the power of the people.<eos> This is what students in the sixties did to protest the vietnam war.<eos> They called it a "sit-in,"
That doesn't happen by accident.<eos> See,the truth is eddie and I agree on most things, but he's so good at being the bad guy that I never have to take the fall.<eos> So like when eddie called the fire marshal to complain about our christmas lights and you said you loved them,you-<eos> That blinking frosty had to die.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I just watched you tell your daughter how you're on her side and how you respect her as an adult and as a woman.<eos> I know,and she bought it.<eos> I'm that good.<eos> You're gonna understand when you have kids.<eos> They're gonna hate one of you.
"uncle doug's corn beer"?<eos> I'm still working on the name, but the recipe's locked down.<eos> You may want to unlock it.<eos> Yeah,your tongue'll fight it,****<eos> you know,doug,I used to be a lot like you.<eos> Then I got married,got a job,had a kid, all these responsibilities, and all of a sudden,I become the bad guy.<eos> Why?<eos> Because if no one's enforcing the rules, the train'll come off the track.<eos> Hmm. Guess I've never been a big fan of trains.<eos> They take you where they want to go, not where you want to go.
- I'll be back at the station in 1-hour.<eos> - What is so urgent?<eos> - May I?<eos> It's about your daughter.<eos> Kelly... I have to know.<eos> Am I the father?<eos> I should've known I couldn't keep it a secret.<eos> I did fall in love with you that night.<eos> And so did my eggs.<eos> Yes, they sensed your greatness and came charging out of my ovaries like groupies.
- It's out the door and to the left.<eos> Be careful,there's a step.<eos> You were incredible.<eos> By God,it was like a lioness protecting her cub.<eos> I was a lioness,wasn't I?<eos> Oh,my God,that feel so good.<eos> I mean,it's one thing to talk it out,but sometimes you just got to...<eos> Okay,champ,got a little adrenaline flowing there.<eos> We are like animals,aren't we?<eos> I mean animals don't talk.They just...
I don't know if it's the cameras or what, but sometimes when I'm with you, I have never felt more alone.<eos> Look, I just... can we...<eos> Not here. Please.<eos> OK, OK.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> The show's over.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> This is the cut they wanna air?<eos> The producers love it.<eos> They won't change a frame and won't consider any edits.
- I've come too close.<eos> - Ok.<eos> Ok, daddy,<eos> - it's time to go now, all right?<eos> - Get your hand off me.<eos> I won't go with her.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> These men are from the care facility.<eos> They're gonna take real good care of you.
We're all proud members of the screen actors guild, on honorary withdrawal.<eos> Deck the Halls keeps us in bread pudding year round so that we can give the gift of live music for free.<eos> That's what we were trying to do before our trip to Venice.<eos> - Oh, your group performed in Italy?<eos> - California.<eos> There we were in our red hats and scarves... Singing a winter wonderland watching the sunset on the beach when a tattooed man in blue approached and advised us that we were in Crip territory.<eos> Well, I happen to speak Crip, so I told him, "Chill. We were friendlies."<eos> But then 5 men in blue approached and asked if the red scarves meant that we were sent by the bloods to diss them.<eos> I said fo-shizzle, we were just spreading the word and please not get up in our grills.<eos> Then I reached for my pitch-pipe-- - They beat the crap out of you. - Maybe they weren't music lovers.
The relative sizes of the two bodies are close enough that some astronomers goes so far as to refer to the "Earth-moon system"<eos> The mean distance from the Earth to the Moon is 234,000 miles.<eos> A three-day flight through space.<eos> Luna's diameter is roughly one quarter the size of Earth's, measuring 2,160 miles.<eos> A single day on the Moon is the equivalent of 27.3 Earth days.<eos> This is because one side of the Moon permanently faces us.<eos> Luna is face-locked with our planet.<eos> So the Moon must fully orbit the Earth, in order to make one complete rotation on its axis.<eos> Sort of like children in a game of "Ring around the Rosie".<eos> They always face inward, as they hold hands and move in a circle.
Keep it moving.<eos> I'm here to tell you, you guys are kind of in your wood-fired pizza mode and, a lot of you are,<eos> "Yeah, I work at the place where we make hit after hit."<eos> (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But, you know, I'm telling you, I've been out in that real world as some of you also have been, and you who have been out there know what I'm talking about.<eos> This is an anomaly, this place is, A, really freakishly alone in this hit-after-hit aspect, and, two,<eos> you know, these kind of projects don't happen that often.<eos> Grab this opportunity and run with it.<eos> You know, film is forever, you know, pain is temporary.<eos> LASSETER: Once we brought Brad into Pixar, we all were learning again.<eos> And he has brought in his clese colleborators on lron Giant, and they are amazing.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - Henry said that the bacteria mutated and consumed a corpse in the morgue.<eos> We was afraid that it had become airborne.<eos> Looks like he was right.<eos> Dr. Stark, we've had to quarantine section four and the people in it.<eos> We need everyone else into decontamination.<eos> No, we have three adults and a child...<eos> He's right.<eos> We can't help if you and I are on the menu.<eos> They're in the safest place in this building, sealed a mile underneath.
- Don't push me.<eos> There's no reason it would affect one person, much less half the town.<eos> How many people show elevated levels?<eos> 50 total.<eos> 50 even?<eos> Yeah. So?<eos> Jo, you were taking the dream statements?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had around 50 different dreams that were shared by everyone else.<eos> Well, they're the sources of the dreams.
Are you crying?<eos> You're not crying?<eos> Looks like you're crying.<eos> Don't, okay?<eos> All right, don't cry.<eos> All right, stop, all right?<eos> You have to lose some fights so you can learn to win.<eos> I mean, look at this.<eos> I got the crap beat out of me.<eos> I have two black belts, and they kicked my ass.
I kept Locke safely locked up until you came along.<eos> Free. At last.<eos> Gurney.<eos> we had a deal.<eos> No deals.<eos> Creatures like Gurney are beyond redemption.<eos> Their rehabilitation is pointless.<eos> Warder.<eos> All the prisoners in Volagnok are beyond rehabilitation.<eos> They must die.
All right.<eos> You, uh... are you familiar with celebrity buzz magazine?<eos> Yeah, more than I'd like to be.<eos> Seems like I'm their favorite subject lately.<eos> Phone records show calls were made from your house to the editor's office.<eos> Yeah, it's possible one of your palsay be selling you out, cashing in on some of your finer moments.<eos> No, there's no way.<eos> Phone records don't lie.<eos> Listen, my boys would take a bullet for me, all right?<eos> They wouldn't do something like that.
Mm, she left an hour ago.<eos> Said she was going to your place.<eos> I was just there.<eos> Hey.<eos> What happened?<eos> I got into it with some guys at the bar.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Not really.<eos> I got into a huge fight with my folks.<eos> And then they, and they cut me off.
This is crazy.<eos> I give you all this money and I don't even see you.<eos> As far as they're concerned, I'm a criminal terrorizing their neighborhood.<eos> How's it gonna look if we're seen together?<eos> They came back, you know?<eos> More of them this time.<eos> They hit a couple of places down the block.<eos> -Of course they did. They're not gonna leave your neighborhood alone because a couple of guys got beat up.<eos> It's a business, Ernie.<eos> They're making money.
Priest, your betterment lies in staying quiet.<eos> We've taken advice from the superior for our safety.<eos> Who are the superiors?<eos> You surely would've asked the one who is popular these days.<eos> Preacher?<eos> What kind of superior are they?<eos> These are excuses of the people who go on the wrong path.<eos> It is worthless and useless.<eos> Muslim community is going through a rough phase.. .. they are trying to resolve this by praying.<eos> The Muslim kids who should carry guns.. .. they've been taking care of the people whom they should kill.
- You spit on me too.<eos> Mauled.<eos> Gnarled and mauled.<eos> - Look at this.<eos> This is a mess.<eos> - Dad.<eos> - Really a mess.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Freakin' vandals.<eos> Maybe they killed the dog.
I was made a mockery through elementary school, middle school and high school.<eos> My nose was broken läpsäistyäni sons, who made a mockery of me.<eos> I called in advance, but for me, was defeated in the handset's ear.<eos> Hello?<eos> It is very humiliating.<eos> My right hand is always a very painful tension.<eos> I spent all my childhood pains, because I could not move the muscles.<eos> I am a widowed young mother who has four children.<eos> Justin is 9, 6 Jade, 4, and Fiona Lizzy 2 years.<eos> They are awesome and I want them to know how much I love them.
I'm sara hollins.<eos> I teach kindergarten at st. Mark's elementary.<eos> This is evan, and this is molly.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> The kids just adore you.<eos> You're all they talk about.<eos> We've been waiting downstairs all day.<eos> They wanted to give you this.
When the Earth cooled, volcanic steam condensed into rain and thereby supplied the planet with water.<eos> But where did the steamy water emitted from volcanoes come from?<eos> Volcanoes basically recycle material from melted rock in the mantle of the Earth.<eos> Including water.<eos> But that's not really new water in the sense that it was there before in the oceans and is coming out again for a second time.<eos> NASA's senior scientist, Michael Mumma, says our planet's water came from space.<eos> Comets, which are made up of frozen gases, could have showered Earth with water during the relentless impacts of its infancy.<eos> The deliver of water from an icy body depends very critically on how large the particle is.<eos> The smaller bodies that came in would break up high in the atmosphere.<eos> The other bodies delivered their material to the surface of the Earth, and they can actually vaporize that material that becomes the water on Earth.
I shall be travelling using traditional methods - husky dogs, sledge, and skis.<eos> Yes, and I'm gonna try and beat him in a car.<eos> Now, that's never been done before.<eos> No one has ever tried to drive to the North Pole.<eos> (Richard) And here's why.<eos> On the way, he would encounter ice boulders as big as cathedrals, polar bears the size of hatchbacks temperatures that would freeze the fuel in his tank, and, if Al Gore is to be believed, open water into which he would sink.<eos> Victory, then, would be mine.<eos> Right, time to meet my team.<eos> The engines powering me to the Pole would be ten husky dogs.<eos> Where the car would get stuck or crash through the thin ice, they'd be fine.
Why else would they bother putting the handset back?<eos> Well, if that were true... then that would have bought them at least an hour.<eos> We have to assume the crash happened before 1:<eos> OO... which means the convicts could have a two-hour head start.<eos> I want roadblocks.<eos> Ten-mile perimeter east and west of here.<eos> Yeah, right away.<eos> Listen up, everybody!<eos> We're dealing with six convicts.<eos> They're armed, and they've already killed in cold blood... and they were smart enough to buy themselves some time.
The atmosphere of Titan is very, very thick and massive.<eos> It has a mass that's 10 times the mass of the Earth's atmosphere.<eos> So you have a very thick layer of gases, thicker than the air as we know it.<eos> The particles in the air are also very small, so I would characterize them more as a haze than as a fog or clouds.<eos> The haze is 200 miles thick resembling something else on Earth.<eos> From the outside, it appears essentially opaque, like a big, orange ball.<eos> But as the Huygens probe descended through the atmosphere, it's transparent enough to be able to see the surface features as it fell through.<eos> But it's not unlike a hazy day here in Los Angeles.<eos> It's not the colour of the atmosphere that most intrigues scientists, it's the composition.<eos> Nitrogen and methane, the same gases they believe made up much of Earth's early atmosphere.
Kind of reminded me of high school.<eos> Sounds like he wants a girlfriend, not a hooker.<eos> Does anyone know where greenies is?<eos> I've never heard of it.<eos> I'll poke around.<eos> Meanwhile, call was traced to a landline.<eos> 1730 los feliz.<eos> If the plan is for today, you might wanna hurry.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - So your friends-- are they, um... - what?
We don't have much time.<eos> Come on, we don't want to miss anything.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Wow. Someone's sure getting into the spirit.<eos> I still don't know how you heard them talking about this.<eos> You must have ears like a bat.<eos> Uh, not like a bat, exactly.<eos> You know what?<eos> Be grateful.<eos> I used to date a lot of musicians, and after a few years on stage, They're just, like, deaf as doornails.
The needle is spinning faster and faster.<eos> It means there IS a fox with 9 tails nearby.<eos> Is there really a fox with 9 tails?<eos> Sure, since the prehistoric age.<eos> Are there lots of them?<eos> Yes, there were.<eos> but it is pretty difficult to find them now.<eos> Then shouldn't we protect them?<eos> My teacher said animals in danger of elimination must be preserved.<eos> They are different.
I must have missed you.<eos> I had a conversation with the police about a suspicious man matching my description.<eos> You're not the first field op I've dealt with, Mr. Westen.<eos> Believe me, I've been vetted every which way.<eos> Maybe we can set up a new time.<eos> I have had enough of new times and places and tests.<eos> I hope I don't have to remind you that my recommendation carries weight when it comes to removing you from this blacklist...<eos> Bureaucrats live for respect.<eos> East of the Balkans, that means a bribe.<eos> In the west, it's more about showing you know they're in charge.
We have a possible 10-33 explosive device at these locations.<eos> Salvaging the shipwreck was a ruse.<eos> They needed a reason to be in the water for an extended period of time without anyone asking questiS.<eos> On doug holden's body was found here in the harbor.<eos> Matt campbell was found here.<eos> The shipwreck was located here.<eos> Killers must have chosen this particular shipwreck because of its proximity to the targets.<eos> They used the scuba instructors to help them navigate the currents, find their way around.<eos> And they lured them to the wreck with stories of buried treasure.<eos> Which they put there.
Of course, they're not called spies.<eos> They're called security consultants.<eos> They're basically mercenaries with nice suits.<eos> Your offices just keep getting better and better.<eos> It's good to see you, Michael.<eos> What have you been up to?<eos> Little of this, little of that.<eos> Haven't you been getting your reports from your F.B.I. buddies?<eos> I didn't tell them anything they couldn't find out for themselves.<eos> If you tell them, they don't have to find out for themselves, do they?
The fairy mean the world to me.<eos> Wow, my kitchen is spotless.<eos> Well, did nothing I started to clean it.<eos> You speak German again.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I said, now that I am not doing anything, I prefer to clean it.<eos> Do not you think it will be uncomfortable with your friends?<eos> Uncomfortable "why?<eos> For me.<eos> My friends are very intelligent, and they know a lot about you.
Girls,let's go.<eos> It's time for school.<eos> Mom,I need to talk to you.<eos> Uh,well,honey,look at what time it is.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's talk in the car.<eos> It's about Hannah's sleepover this Friday night.<eos> I need to let her know if I can make it.<eos> And it's all fine with her parents,right?<eos> They know.
Well,it's a television show.<eos> Okay,if you say so.<eos> It went off the air about six months ago.<eos> Remember when we were at the Burkes' cabin, I told you I had a dream about them and another couple?<eos> At the time,I thought the things I saw in the dream took place the night before-- that they had something to do with them being killed.<eos> But now I'm thinking the things that I saw in my dream took place at least six months ago.<eos> Okay,two couples get together to watch some television.<eos> Six months ago,six days ago-- what's the difference?<eos> The difference is,on that night there was a home invasion.<eos> Two men wearing masks, they were looking for something-- a satchel.

All right.<eos> When you said you were going to make a drink... I thought you meant a cup of cocoa!<eos> Oh, be a sport.<eos> Look, I've even got a jar of maraschino cherries.<eos> I absolutely promise not to get you tight!<eos> This is the way they used to mix them at the Ritz... when I was in Miss Rosebud's Bouncing Babes.<eos> You drank cocktails when you were a Bouncing Babe?<eos> Oh, I was practically 19.<eos> Miss Rosebud had to bind my bosoms flat.<eos> Otherwise they bounced rather more than was approved of.
Over billions of years these stars have come together to form galaxies.<eos> A galaxy is a collection of a hundred billions or so stars.<eos> And these stars are by no means touching each other or actually anywhere near each other.<eos> Compared to their sizes they are very, very far apart from one another.<eos> The thing that blows my mind about galaxies is what monsters they are.<eos> They are incredibly huge.<eos> If the Sun was the size of a period on the page, the dot of an i, our galaxy would be the size continental United States.<eos> So, they are gigantic.<eos> Astronomers have always known there was something special about the band of stars and dust that seemed encircle night sky above them.<eos> It is our galaxy, a white smudge they called:
Very much.<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you want from us?<eos> Wellsanctuary,asylum,call it what you will.<eos> In return for my extensive knowledge of the arms market,I want protection. for my daughter.<eos> Protection from whom?<eos> Whoever tried to kill his daughter this morning.<eos> Agent gibbs,I believe.<eos> Well,it's true.<eos> My enemies come for my daughter,they will see me suffer.
At the parking lot!<eos> Come on!<eos> We're flying to Norway... We'll need reinforcement group for agent 28.<eos> We're leaving to Oslo in 70 minutes.<eos> Please warn our Norwegian colleagues.<eos> BERGEN.<eos> NORWAY<eos> BJORNE PETERSEN'S APARTMENT<eos> Can you trace the Norwegian guys?<eos> - They turned that way.
- I'm a man, you're a woman.<eos> - We'll think up something.<eos> How could ever Jaffad trust this kind of woman?<eos> How could a French banker adopt a terrorist's son?<eos> I was provided with a clean legend. An orphan, a warvictim... Also, I was such a darling child, my new mom adored me.<eos> Because she didn't know what you will become.<eos> Oh yes.<eos> I was growing, and I was like a time bomb.<eos> Then I got orphaned once more, and my Arab friends found me.<eos> I was just the person they needed - someone rich and strong, and dedicated to the idea.
We are in the maintenance REZO.<eos> - What's that?<eos> The plant's maintenace is taken care of by the REZO technicians.<eos> Each floor handles a specific job.<eos> I don't get anything!<eos> I'm just the REZO's botanist.<eos> I don't understand everything either.<eos> What I need is to get out of here.<eos> The workers.<eos> They came of that way.
I don't understand everything either.<eos> What I need is to get out of here.<eos> The workers.<eos> They came of that way.<eos> Drawn by the plant I guess.<eos> The plant fed them. But there was no control. And the dose was too strong.<eos> That make them rot. I told myself my only chance was to wait till hunger drove them start killing each other and I hoped I'd still be alive to see it.<eos> In the end we grew accustomed to each other. I've got no illusions.<eos> If it weren't for these piece of plastic between us I wouldn't be able to hold on...<eos> They still manage to surprise me after all this time.
We could have consequences Which would nonetheless be dangerous.<eos> First of all, we could have<eos> A lot of star formations as a consequence of the merger. Currently, both the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy Have plenty of interstellar gas<eos> The raw material from which stars are born. Now, that would mean A lot more evolved stars, supernova going off in our vicinity<eos> And that could create shockwaves, blast waves Or bursts of cosmic rays<eos> After the merger The fate of our solar system is uncertain As the supermassive black holes of Andromeda and the Milky Way<eos> When they merge, they're gonna form a new galaxy And these two supermassive black holes Will gradually spiral into the middle of the new galaxy.<eos> They will be a binary black hole for a short time.<eos> And these black holes will start to swallow gas As the collision stirs things up Gas will fall into those black holes.<eos> They're gonna start emitting radiation. But the potential for fireworks, possibly for fueling the black holes At the centers of the galaxies
And the bastards still moves on me.<eos> Who, boss?<eos> The boss of that Chink gang called "Uncle Buu"<eos> I've eaten with the bastard before.<eos> It's the same guy that Yuan works for, everyday!<eos> He gave the Bar to Soydee, Uncle Buu's No. 2, and only nephew.<eos> Soydees' guys will do anything for him.<eos> Bastard has a bunch of trained killers with him.<eos> Especially those two fuckers last night.<eos> They are the most dispicable of all.
Hurry get in!<eos> Timuk!<eos> Are you home?<eos> What do you want?<eos> How's it going?<eos> Sorry Timuk<eos> After that Bae learned the true power of Uncle Buu.<eos> He got the paint sniffers to do it.<eos> The ones that Bae chased away with his shoe.<eos> They did it for a pair of levis each!
Bastard trying to mess with me, huh?<eos> Take care of all these fuckers for me.<eos> Thank you we are here every Thursday!<eos> And this Thursday is teachers night.<eos> You shouldn' dwell on it, just look at me.<eos> I keep my gym open and mouth shut...<eos> Isn' that because im trying to keep Muay Thai alive?<eos> I haven' ever liked teachers.<eos> Why don' you like teachers.<eos> They teach us things.
Time and again so called psychics criticize science and evidence.<eos> "I have personal proof it's true to me!"<eos> But as with religion, if it hangs on private feelings that can't be proved or disproved by science, then in what way can it be valid or meaningful to the rest of us?<eos> Next I want to find out what happens when those who claim mysterious powers do allow themselves to be tested? Now, I think it's four.<eos> I want to show how scientific reason is always the best way to look at the world.. and explain the dangers of superstition.<eos> I'm often asked how I know that there isn't a spirit world or psychic clairvoyance.<eos> Well, I don't. It seems improbable but unlike the fixed world views of mystical faith, science is always open to new possibilities.<eos> Scientists test and retest evidence, refreshing our understanding of reality.<eos> Until quite recently, scientists didn't know how bats fly around in total darkness.<eos> Could they have paranormal extra-sensory perception?

Everything about it added up to a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence that this really was a fact.
The sea has often been thought to be a malevolent force actively out to get you.<eos> In 480 BC, King Xerxes of the Persians built a pontoon bridge across the Hellespont and the rough sea came and wrecked it.<eos> And King Xerxes was so furious that he sentenced the sea to 300 lashes!<eos> I wonder whether there's something of King Xerxes and all of us to this day.<eos> We don't want to believe that things just happen.<eos> we want to believe that there're some kind of deliberate intention behind everything, even where inanimate objects are concerned.<eos> And perhaps that is the key to humanity's belief in the supernatural.<eos> Even in the 21st century, despite all that science has revealed about the indifferent vastness of the universe, the human mind remains a wanton storyteller creating intention in the randomness of reality.<eos> The delivery of rewards by a one-armed bandit is determined at random.<eos> But many gamblers want to think that what they do can increase their chances of winning the jackpot.

Skinner investigated the behavior of pigeons..<eos> rewarding them with food when they learned to peck a key in the feeding apparatus.<eos> But then Skinner set the apparatus to reward the birds at random.<eos> Now the pigeons just have to sit back and wait, but that isn't what they did.
Everything will be fine.<eos> Why did he have to come now?<eos> Everything was fine.<eos> It is too late.<eos> Nothing can happen now.<eos> It is too late.<eos> You know Geet my parents didn't love each other.<eos> Both of them used to love other people.<eos> And because of that I was pained my entire life.<eos> They were very good with each other at work but at home..
What are you scared of? Why the hell were you on that mission?<eos> Go!<eos> This way.<eos> - You've been hit.<eos> Sergeant Grey?<eos> Hey, where the hell were you?<eos> - See those guys?<eos> - What guys?<eos> CIA, NSA, I don't care.<eos> They were waiting.
The neutrino is...<eos> It's the most ridiculous particle you could imagine.<eos> A billion neutrinos went through my nose as we were talking.<eos> A trillion, a trillion of them went through my nose just now, and they did nothing to me.<eos> They pass through all of the matter around us continuously, in a huge, huge blast of particles that does nothing at all.<eos> They're like... They almost exist in a separate universe, but we know, as physicists, we can measure them, we can make precision predictions and measurements.<eos> They exist, but we can't get our hands on them, because they seem to just exist in another place, and yet without neutrinos, the beginning of the universe would not have worked.<eos> We would not have the matter that we have today, because you couldn't create the elements without the neutrinos.<eos> In the very, very earliest few seconds of the big bang, the neutrinos were the dominant particle, and they actually determined much of the kinetics of the production of the elements we know.<eos> So, the universe can't exist the way it is without the neutrinos, but they seem to be in their own separate universe, and we're trying to actually make contact with that otherworldly universe of neutrinos.
Well, this is interesting.<eos> Her fingernail beds are already discolored.<eos> They have a bluish tint.<eos> Normally they're colorless after death.<eos> I'll get into this and let you know.<eos> Please do.<eos> Mr. Wolfe. Hey.<eos> The techs have printed and swabbed all the guests.<eos> They've been cooperative.<eos> Okay, well, the guests at the party were outside, weren't they?
Makes it official.<eos> Gunrunners.<eos> Looks like somebody wanted to end their career.<eos> And I think I can tell you who.<eos> DNA on the cigarette belongs to Gabriel Soto?<eos> And look what Gabriel has in common with our victims.<eos> Yeah. Gunrunning.<eos> Triple murder,Mr. Soto.<eos> I didn't kill nobody.<eos> Those guys, they work for me.
Yeah?<eos> Well, they called me. This is about the smuggling operation at the docks, right?<eos> Okay, so, uh... this is a customs operation.<eos> Yes,it was.<eos> Those weapons were headed to the middle east, where they'd end up being used on our own troops.<eos> Well, you forgot to collect the guns.<eos> Well, this mission was just to shut 'em down. We planned to send in a cleanup crew, but you beat us to it.<eos> Well, don't you think you guys went a little bit overboard with the, uh, with the firepower?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What I'm talking about is your operation gunned down three men in cold blood, and they didn't even get a single shot off.
Look,i had nothing to do with luke's murder.<eos> But you did stalk candace.<eos> There are a million people worldwide "stalking" her.<eos> Recording her without her knowledge is a crime punishable by a five-year prison term.<eos> Five years?<eos> Where's the video?<eos> It's,uh,it's back in my truck.<eos> Thank you for going with me to see luke's parents.<eos> "See candace's cop." i'm sorry.<eos> Yeah,they do that.
And he's facing 25 to life.<eos> He's gonna tell me anything I want.<eos> Pete was my heroin connect.<eos> So, he brought it to you, and you mixed it.<eos> Yeah, it was all the different flavors that got the kids to like the heroin.<eos> You were distributing to children.<eos> I didn't distribute.<eos> - That's what the kids were for.<eos> - Enticed them with sneakers.<eos> Yeah, they'd sell the heroin, then I'd pay them off with shoes.
But..."Gregory"!<eos> What a name!<eos> His mother insisted.<eos> "It was fashionable!"<eos> Fashionable?<eos> He isn't a pair of jeans!<eos> I don't know...<eos> I don't know anymore.<eos> I don't know which bridges are down.<eos> I've got friends here, they'll know.
They've bombed everything, the bastards.<eos> Even the Christian villages.<eos> To them we're all Arabs.<eos> The same shit.<eos> Keep your voice down, the walls have ears.<eos> There's no danger, don't worry.<eos> You can say what you like.<eos> Elie did join his brothers in Israel.<eos> Whatever the reason, we mustn't go there.<eos> They have to return. It's their land!
They're prosperous.<eos> Over the years, they've developed new tastes.<eos> They're like your daughter:<eos> Educated, sophisticated.<eos> They know full well what they deserve, and they're willing to pay for it.<eos> Why would I want to own a store that I wouldn't want to shop in?<eos> Mr. Menken, I don't know if that's true.<eos> You had no problem abandoning that second-floor hosiery store on 7th Avenue for your present location.<eos> And that's a story you'll be proud to tell your grandchildren.<eos> The only problem is they won't care.

There's no way that's a picture of me.<eos> That woman has on hoop earrings.<eos> I don't even own hoop earrings.<eos> I have one pair and they're gold.<eos> Those are fruit loops.<eos> You are so in denial right now And you're doing what you always do in relationships:<eos> The second you get close to a guy, you want to bail.<eos> Okay, granted, he's six, But the point stands.<eos> Well, we'll ask the guys.<eos> They'll tell you that's not me.
Wow, that sure was a long drive, but we made great time.<eos> I can't even feel my legs anymore.<eos> Are you sure this is the right place, Freddie?<eos> I think so, but I'm not sure.<eos> - My cell phone can't find a signal up here.<eos> - Hey, wait.<eos> You can't just leave us here.<eos> No.<eos> This mountain is cursed.<eos> The yaks are unhappy, for they feel the yeti's power.
Fred was very brilliant and innovating person. I just did point out him.<eos> "Someone were good, someone were bad, you just didn't know which was which."<eos> By the 1960's Hubble's inaccurate estimate for the age of the Universe had been corrected to reflect more accurate data.<eos> Resolving one challenges to the Big Bang theory.<eos> Still it seemed the battle between the Steady state and Big Bang would ended draw.<eos> But then, all of suddenly, scientists found the somking gun, a nearly old as universe as itself.<eos> This discovery condemn one of the theories to the dust bin of the history.<eos> For 500 years, science has been on quest discover where we belong.<eos> Now astronomers stuggle to solve the riddle of how it all began.<eos> Little did they know the cosmos was whispering the answer back.
Ours.<eos> Dr.Mallard is a medical examiner,agent gibbs is a federal officer.<eos> That's myhip!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> What kind ofame you think you're playing,gibbs?<eos> Any word from the missing crew?<eos> We have every possible resource looking for those men.<eos> Look,given what we know,this is high precedence.<eos> Those men may well have been exposed to the virus,too.<eos> They may also need to be quarantined.
Naval Academy graduate.<eos> Intelligence officer in the Pentagon.<eos> He is the perfect deep cover mole.<eos> Sort of an Arab version of Kevin Costner in No Way Out.<eos> A movie buff.<eos> One more thing you two have in common.<eos> Arnett's juggling two lives.<eos> Things are closing in on him.<eos> He's stressed to the max. On antidepressants, a liability to his Al-Qaeda handlers.<eos> When he doesn't jump, they terminate him before he can expose their cell.
If you have a good ear, you can...<eos> You didn't have a lot of friends, because you chose not to...<eos> You can hear while you're talking?<eos> You can detect not only structural details, but small, deep masses.<eos> Game's over.<eos> You either have lung cancer or tuberous sclerosis.<eos> We need to cut you open and biopsy.<eos> That'll leave a scar.<eos> NASA doctors will see it.<eos> They'll know.
They have a lot of rain, that they don´t catch, so they have in that climate of that island everything they need.<eos> The roof was designed to collect the water and take it to gutters.<eos> Trying to get a slope at the bottom of the gutter.<eos> They have over a 100 inches of rainfall a year so there is no reason why they would even need wells in the future.<eos> All right, it catches water.<eos> They had 10 000 liters of water stored.<eos> No need for wells, absolutely.<eos> It´s like two ambrellas. Stops the sun from heating the second roof.<eos> Here it doesn´t take two or three sentences to these enginiers, to say look, we can build out of plastic bottles, glass bottles, tyres,...<eos> They get very excited.
There's no personal data, but I did find an API he had written to interface his home automation system to his car's onboard navigation computer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pretend you're talking to someone who actually has sex with other humans.<eos> All I have to do is hack the API, and I can use it to get the GPS coordinates on his car.<eos> Yeah, do it, do it.<eos> TONY: This is great... it means I can stop calling Heidi's marks.<eos> I mean, of course, Iwilllook for those other guys, but...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> They haven't moved in the last 20 minutes.
And if by somes trange stroke of luck, you manage to get me hand cuffed, I'll escape, because I've done it before.<eos> Dude, that's what we forgot.<eos> Cuffs.<eos> There's a way out, though.<eos> I'll walk out the front door with you, just the three of us.<eos> If... if you use your psychic ability to help me find Delbecchio.<eos> Prove my innocence.<eos> So, you got a decision to make.<eos> Are you going to accept my generous offer, or am I gonna turn you over to my friends?<eos> They don't play nice.
- All right, guys.<eos> Guys, there'll be time to elect him pope over the weekend, ok, but come to the party, if you can.<eos> Let's get out of here.Let's take him home.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Bye.Take it easy.<eos> Man, I'm sorry to tear you away from your friends.<eos> Were you worrying them, too?<eos> Hey, come on. Give me a break.<eos> Hey, let's go and get a beer, ok?<eos> They want to go home.
I appreciate it.<eos> I really do.<eos> This isn't about who I am.<eos> It's about what I am.<eos> Matt, what are you doing here?<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know what I want, jim?<eos> I want to know why I left my men behind.<eos> I want to know why I can't remember what I did and why I keep doing this.<eos> Most of all, I want to know why they're dead and I'm not.
Well, you're running out of time.<eos> Could you sit in with us tomorrow night?<eos> I mean, it was your idea in the first place.<eos> Okay. Fine. Fine.<eos> Hey, were you praying?<eos> Of course I wasn't praying.<eos> I was just thinking.<eos> All right, Joe, so, just whenever you're ready.<eos> Where are the angels?<eos> You said we were supposed to wait till they said their lines.
You can all go home, you know.<eos> You've been absolved.<eos> We've been talking about things out here, Father.<eos> And we took a vote.<eos> - And everyone decided that... - Not everyone, thespian.<eos> - Almost everyone.<eos> - We decided that we just don't have the heart to continue with this thing anymore, Father, with Simeon leaving and all.<eos> We thought he'd be proud seeing all of us out there.<eos> Only he won't see us now.<eos> Like putting on a play for your parents when you were a kid, only they don't show up.
Local police believed a"non-living entity"<eos> caused the mysterious deaths of the three men who killed Janelle exactly one year after her death.<eos> Four other people who came to the defense of the men were also killed.<eos> Now, a witness to this event, a university professor, no less, theorized, quote,<eos> "It was a spirit wraith, needing neither food, nor sleep, using telekinetic powers caused by extreme rage to enact revenge.<eos> She was able to manipulate the physical plane, including... her physical appearance."<eos> What do you mean by physical appearance?<eos> Spirit wraiths are shape-shifters.<eos> This girl was able to change how she looked.<eos> She walked among them, blending in so they didn't recognize her.
Phone lines are cut.<eos> Ligature marks show the parents were bound and gagged.<eos> Looks like these guys had some robbery experience.<eos> And then found their true calling.<eos> No sign of forced entry.<eos> - Same as the other two houses, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, it's late and the doorbell rings, I come over and I flip the switch.<eos> They made it dark.<eos> No one sees anything if they're walking by.
- It's possible. And then, there's the kids. Tucked in, quiet, orderly, controlled.<eos> Speaks to an introvert with some capacity for remorse.<eos> - Two profiles.<eos> - Two UnSubs.<eos> - Have these chairs been moved?<eos> - No, it's all how we found it.<eos> So, they've been positioned to face the area where the parents were killed.<eos> Everything's been cleared out, like a stage.<eos> It's entertainment.<eos> They sit and watch the parents die.
We tried with him, but he tested us.<eos> - Have you kept in touch with him?<eos> - Oh, God, no.<eos> Gary left the day he turned 18, never looked back.<eos> Ervin was a mess when he got here.<eos> He'd been separated from a younger sister.<eos> - Where did she go?<eos> - Nobody told me.<eos> Siblings get separated all the time.<eos> But they find new ones here.
Jen, Jen, when are you coming back down?<eos> - Let me speak to her!<eos> - No!<eos> I'm talking to her!<eos> I don't know.<eos> Listen, Douglas's laptop is having some difficulties.<eos> So, can you come up and have a look?<eos> Oh, no, not these idiots.<eos> Mr Reynholm, the men in the IT department are my friends.<eos> They're not idiots.
Don't click the cart or you've bought it!<eos> Aw, you clicked the cart.<eos> If you're so smart, you do it.<eos> CLINGY BABY? We Can Help<eos> C.R.I.E?<eos> What does that stand for?<eos> "Creative Responses for Infant Edu-loving!"<eos> Ooh, "edu-loving!"<eos> They come to your home to help you raise "independent, "self-actualized children.<eos> "The counselors can come day and night because they have no families themselves."
One of the most successful places we ever went with Wildboyz was India.<eos> Jeff wanted to go back to India because,<eos> I don't know, that's where he found his spirit animal or something.<eos> I don't know.<eos> India was awesome.<eos> It is a beautiful country filled with rich culture and a wonderful heritage.<eos> No, I hated it, and I'm pretty sure I'm the fattest person, ever, in the history of India.<eos> The production company got about 20 other little people together.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> They probably didn't know what they were gonna be doing.
They really are a handful. Like, they'll try to bite you, and suck your blood, and throw their pee on you, and all this terrible stuff.<eos> Nobody went into it with a good attitude.<eos> Actually, nobody even went into it, except for me and Pontius and Dave England.<eos> We saw these fucked-up dudes on TV and we decided we had to meet them.<eos> Again.<eos> So the next thing I know, I'm in a Wildboyz sandwich.<eos> I fucking had this dumbass shirt.<eos> I looked like a fucking tourist, and I got flip-flops on, and I'm like, "What the fuck?"<eos> They were all these fucking creepy, shitty, spastic, skinny Aghoris.<eos> They were out of control when we filmed with them on Wildboyz.
Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Only my sister would wait till I was this close to having the best sex ever to have a baby.<eos> The selfish bitch.<eos> - This bloke, Ben...<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing, it was just quite a works do, you'd have loved it.<eos> Can't believe my parents called you before they called me.<eos> They called me looking for you.<eos> And they do like me a bit more.
I'm staying with Rosa.<eos> No!<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Or else, no matter how urgent it is, I'll give up the journey.<eos> It's not my intention to give you the girl as the price of the trip.<eos> Giddy up!<eos> Doctor, let me die.<eos> Yes...<eos> In such cases the gods do help.<eos> They send the missing horse, even add a second one because it's urgent, and even throw in a groom as a bonus.
It does not.<eos> Then it got left out by mistake.<eos> We are all hard-wired differently. If someone needs to shout "giddyup" to heighten arousal, what's wrong with that?<eos> Maybe if Ed lived like a man, he wouldn't have died like a horse.<eos> That's all.<eos> You knew your husband wasn't in Florida.<eos> Yes, I lied.<eos> Why?<eos> I was married to Ed for nine years. We have kids.<eos> My first concern was to make sure that they didn't find out their father was a pervert.
This is Old Trafford.<eos> The Mecca of football.<eos> The Manchester United Stadium.<eos> On the other side of this tunnel is the Manchester United ground.<eos> People call this `The theater of dreams.`<eos> Look at the ground carefully, here where real champions play.. ..but their journey to success was not so easy.<eos> This clock was stopped on 6 February 1958.. at the time when the Manchester United team was returning..<eos> ..from a match in Munich and their plane crashed.<eos> Eight players lost their lives.<eos> They were all under 25.
Bring up our John Doe from the morgue.<eos> Anybody see what I see?<eos> Black males.<eos> All in their mid to late 40s.<eos> All local cabdrivers.<eos> None of them work for the same company,though.<eos> Vitals.<eos> Similar age,similar height,similar weight... they all have shaved heads and facial hair.<eos> Bad guys don't know exactly what their target looks like now.<eos> They only have a general description.
Time of death of the first driver?<eos> 2:30 in the morning.<eos> Which was 90 minutes after he clocked out.<eos> Second driver?<eos> 9:45 in the evening.<eos> Two hours after he logged off.<eos> None of them were officially working when they were attacked.<eos> Boss,in two of the attacks,the cabs had passengers.<eos> In each case,including the admiral's,the passengers called for a cab.<eos> Meaning,they didn't just hail it on the street.

The next word is gonna be an excuse.<eos> You fixing to give me an excuse? No, sir.<eos> Get out of here and leave it off the field.<eos> Fired?<eos> We've been warning you about the rollback.<eos> There are three other teachers with less experience.<eos> Seven with ratings lower than mine.<eos> - How would you know that?<eos> - I do, Jerry.<eos> - Are they being dismissed too?
Do you want to continue or shall I?<eos> What happened?<eos> Oh, it was nothing, really.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> Well, I assumed you knew.<eos> You and Karen have been so chilly that... What happened?<eos> I would love to hear what you think you know.<eos> Your father was my mother's lover.<eos> Now, that was the rumor and my father couldn't live with those rumors, true or false. So he dismissed his parents and they fled to the Soviet Union with the belief that communism spoke more clearly to the plight of African Americans.
She set out across Bodega bay, determined to look the killers of her parents in their beady-eyed, feathered faces.<eos> Then, just as she was about to reach the other side, her worst nightmare.<eos> Dilly Balsam survived the attack, to be rescued by a local merchant, who offered her a very sweet treat.<eos> She realized that her love of taffy and fear of nothing would serve her well in business.<eos> And Balsam's Bittersweets Taffy Sweets Emporium was born.<eos> What?<eos> You think I should do something.<eos> We're just saying.<eos> No.<eos> You let your anger win and you engage the crazy person, then you're no different than they are.
Yeah, Linda mentioned you were in the music business.<eos> Well, that's flattering, but I already have a very lucrative career writing jingles.<eos> I don't see myself walking away from that to record children's songs.<eos> How much?<eos> I'm in.<eos> How about that?<eos> Something turned up.<eos> Send the papers over.<eos> Great, great.<eos> No, no, I love kids. And more important, they love me.
I don't know.<eos> But now that the eclipse is over, I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute.<eos> The Mechanist: My own invention.<eos> Oh this is terrible!<eos> They're back!<eos> It was all a trap.<eos> Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move.<eos> We just got to get to the beach as fast as we can.<eos> If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.<eos> They've got air power, but so do I!
let's keep this between you and me, okay?<eos> I wouldn't want your parents to find out I left you heralone.<eos> No problem.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be at school or something?<eos> Yeah, I don't have to leave till, like, 7:30.<eos> What time is it?<eos> 8:45.<eos> 8:45 was a quarter past late as hell.<eos> "four score and seven years ago, "our forefathers brought forth on this continent "a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition at all men are created equal.<eos> even if they're on cp time.
World War I for instance, - there was absolutely no reason to have World War I, - except that it was an ideal opportunity for the banking cartel - to make a pile of money by funding both sides of that particular war.<eos> On June 28th 1914, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne -<eos> Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated while traveling in a motorcade.<eos> The Black Hand, a Serbian Secret Society with connections to French - and British Intelligence, took credit.<eos> World war I had begun.<eos> Armaments Companies financed by Rothschild controlled banks - in Germany, France, England and Austria bankrolled all the factions.<eos> At least 20 million were killed in the war.<eos> It was a conflict so terrible, the people vowed to never fight again.<eos> They'd dubbed it "The War To End All Wars".<eos> The question is, "Why did they want war?".

One of the first items on their agenda was to stress how important - it was that their plan quote "be carried out by stealth".<eos> The controllers also talked about exploiting the public's fears of - climate change to push a continent-wide tax to fund the new government.<eos> Globalist tool, Robert Pastor, is incessantly paraded on the world stage - as the man behind the North American merger. When he testified before congress, - he pushed the idea of a continental security perimeter that - erases national boundaries and merges the security apparatus.<eos> The best way to secure the United States today is not at our 2 borders - with Mexico and Canada, but at the borders of North America as a whole.<eos> In fact, the North American Command based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, - was clearly running the meeting in Canada.<eos> For the past decade the Pentagon - has been training with Mexican and Canadian forces, and has openly discussed - them inside the United States for disasters and to quell domestic unrest.<eos> There are already over 100,000 non-U.S. citizens serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.<eos> The Pentagon is now expanding it's recruiting centers in -<eos> Mexico, the Philippines and Eastern Europe.<eos> Big city police departments nation-wide are lobbying to change laws - so they can recruit non-citizens to join the police force.
The monied classes of the planet, and - particularly the Royal families of the world [who] were already obsessed - with breeding and filled with a predatory disdain for the underclass, - seized on the new science and began aggressively enforcing it's aims world-wide.<eos> Biometrics appears to be a new science, but it was actually developed by -<eos> Galton back in the 1870s as a way to track racial traits and - genetic histories, and as a way to decide who would be licensed to breed.<eos> In 1904 the Cold Spring's Harbor Research facility was started - in the United States by eugenicist Charles Davenport, with the - funding of prominent robber barons, Carnegie, Rockefeller and Harriman.<eos> In 1907 the 1st sterilization laws were passed in the United States.<eos> Citizens with mild deformities or low test scores on their - report cards were arrested and forcibly sterilized.<eos> You're 17, aren't you, Alice?<eos> Yes, but what have you done with my folks.<eos> Well we're trying to help them, Alice, and you too.<eos> They were taken to the hospital this afternoon.
Well we're trying to help them, Alice, and you too.<eos> They were taken to the hospital this afternoon.<eos> Hospital!<eos> Wasn't none of them sick this morning.<eos> We thought it necessary to present your family's case to the State Medical Commission, and after an examination they decided that there was but one important action to take to have your entire family sterilized.<eos> Well what's that?<eos> I don't know what you're taking about!<eos> Well, in this State we have a law which provides for such people to have an operation so there wont be any more children.<eos> I see.<eos> Now then, we'll take your brothers to institutions where they'll be properly cared for. And you can go back to your job too.
and went on to laud the virtues of Ebola because it would kill - 90% of the world population quickly.<eos> When his statements erupted into a national controversy - his graduate students defended him stating that Pianka was too conservative, - and that all humans should be killed.<eos> But most frightening was the fact - in a crowd of over 1000 prominent scientists, local newspapers reported that - 95% of those in attendance gave Pianka sustained standing ovations every - time he extolled the virtues of mass culling microbes and man's destruction.<eos> "China was able to turn the corner and become the - leading world super power because they have a police state - and they are able to force people to stop reproducing."<eos> ~Dr. Eric R. Pianka<eos> The eugenics movement has now shaken off much of its Nazi baggage, - and is using peoples legitimate concern about the environment as a cloak - to conceal their real agenda.<eos> Everyone wants to breath clean air and have good water, - but the controllers of the environmental movement have done nothing - but co-op people's concerns and parole it into support - for global policies that further destabilize the 3rd World -<eos> and create untold misery.<eos> Phony environmental and conservation groups - are now the biggest private land owners in the world.<eos> They lobby government to take property away from local populations - only to develop it themselves later.

I am in favor of both.<eos> The architects of the New World Order are in a race - to complete the structure of world government - so they can suppress the independent development - of technologies that threaten their monopoly of power, - while at the same time steering new developments -<eos> in the direction the architects chart for humanity.<eos> The technocrats call their governing system the final revolution - because in the past empires were enforced militarily.<eos> Now enforcement is primarily psychological and economic.<eos> And society itself is a construct of the elite - who operate outside the controlled paradigm - and control the civilization within.<eos> Just as a child maintains the environment of a fishtank, - we are like lab-rats living out our entire existence, - never questioning the confines of the cage or the scientists who experiment on us.<eos> New World Order engineers have hijacked human destiny.<eos> It's controllers have closely studied human behavior for more than a hundred years, - and are now steering us with expert control - using our primitive drives and desires as levers.<eos> They have developed their mind control systems to the point - of being able to control the average unconscious person like a car.
Decades ago transhumanists said that if you do not accept augmentation - or enhancements you would no longer be able to get jobs - and now it's happening today.<eos> US group implants electronic tags in workers<eos> "The elite who occupy the commanding heights of digital reality - are suicidal nihilists.<eos> Suicidal nihilists know - that there is no longer any substantive purpose to their willing.<eos> But they would always prefer to go on willing than not to act at all.<eos> They can very happily ally themselves - with a notion of nuclear holocaust or perfect exterminism." ~Arthur Kroker<eos> Technology has become so powerful in it's capacity for destruction - that free humanity cannot afford to let psychopathic technocrats, - with delusions of grandeur, repeat the mistakes of their forebearers, - because it is highly probable that this time they may destroy -<eos> everything including themselves in their mad rush for Godhood.<eos> In this film we have chronicled the overlord's bloody orgy - of experimentation which already claimed the lives - of over 150 million people in the 20th century.<eos> And now they are promising to deliver an - invincible tyranny that will dwarf their past exploits.
You used to know everything about that wife of yours, even wrote a song about her.<eos> A song?<eos> Wait, it's coming back to me.<eos> The girl I love's got beautiful hair<eos> A blue bouffant From here to there<eos> Snow white teeth and lips so red<eos> She's the Wilma to my Fred<eos> Oh, the girl I love's got beautiful...<eos> Eyes<eos> When happy, they sparkle, when sad, they cries
Big, big deer.<eos> Whatever you think is best, Director.<eos> City slickers saw something.<eos> A deer.<eos> It was a big one.<eos> Director Shepard wants us to hold our position while McGee attempts to locate Taylor's signal.<eos> If he doesn't?<eos> A search team is on its way to assist us.<eos> What about our courageous frontiersmen?<eos> They will be escorted out when the search team arrives.
Look, I had my grandmother, ok?<eos> Becca has no one but parents who don't understand.<eos> I have to teach her how to cross them over.<eos> I'm not going to let her turn out like Gabriel, overmedicated and institutionalized.<eos> Becca!<eos> Look, I'm sorry, ok?<eos> I know that this is hard.<eos> You don't have to apologize.<eos> I should be used to seeing them.<eos> You have to stop running away from them, or else they're going to keep finding you.
I wouldn't hurt Tom.<eos> Why would I want to?<eos> Oh... I don't know.<eos> Having an illegitimate child pop up in the middle of your life could be pretty inconvenient.<eos> I wasn't planning on Tom showing up, but he's still my son.<eos> And if something happens to him because we're sitting here arguing, then that's going to be your fault!<eos> I'll take my chances with that.<eos> Now what time did these supposed kidnappers say they'd call back?<eos> They didn't give me a time.<eos> They just said they'd kill Tom if I didn't do what they said.
Oh I'm thinking teach.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> So we're going to learn it.<eos> What do you think we're better at?<eos> Let's learn.<eos> Which one you want?<eos> Teach it.<eos> A kid right now would be a lot smarter than either one of us on no sleep.<eos> These kids have got more sleep.<eos> They got R.E.M. I didn't get any R.E.M.
I'm guessing I was the nearest specialist in the area, so...<eos> MEGAN: Specialist in what?<eos> You guys do, what, ten, 15 kidnappings a year?<eos> Mexico City, I do 15 a month.<eos> Work kidnappings Europe, Asia, Afghanistan.<eos> It's always different, always the same.<eos> So, what's different about this one?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> But the big money snatches tend to put you in contact with a higher class of lowlife.<eos> If they know their business, and I'm certainly guessing they do, we're looking at simultaneous movement, expected payouts, bargaining strategies.
And you never saw to it that she got any security?<eos> She turned down bodyguards.<eos> Said any kidnapper would pay to give her back after two days.<eos> And with the joke, you let the issue drop?<eos> That's not at all what I meant.<eos> Anything Ella ever asked for, ever needed, I've always given her gladly.<eos> What you need to understand, Mr. Pierce, is that ransom is enough business to make a fellow like yourself confused.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Kidnappers will position.<eos> They will establish bargaining power.
I still don't know what your problem is with BET.<eos> Shake it girl Yeah? Ain't you hungry yet? Well, I was thinking that tomorrow we could reach the people by marching to the BET headquarters...<eos> Now, now, we ain't gonna do no shit like that. Uh, now, Huey, black people have style.<eos> And we are attracted to things of class. Especially you young people. Ahem.<eos> Now, see, but that's what makes BET so dangerous now.<eos> Excuse me. It sells you young people a lifestyle that you're attracted to.<eos> Mm, that's good<eos> - But, uh- But you can't afford it.<eos> And in order to save them kids, I gotta reach them kids. Mm.<eos> Now, see, when I shine, they walk toward me for the light of them diamonds.
Yeah.<eos> - hang the garland.<eos> - right. I'm sorry about all that drama last night.<eos> Tough situation, I understand.<eos> How's riley doing with all this?<eos> He's sad, wishes he could spend more time with his mother, but he still seems like a happy kid.<eos> He told me that his mom's coming back and you guys are going to move to florida.<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes that kid is just in his own little world.<eos> I know I don't need to tell you this, but kids are really sensitive.<eos> Sometimes they can see things that we don't, they feel things that we don't.
he is not bruce spencer, and he's not the man that william's wife is having an affair with.<eos> I haven't been able to find anything about deaths in her family.<eos> Well, here's a novel idea-- maybe santa is santa.<eos> Yeah, except for the fact that he's a myth.<eos> He's a myth, but maybe also... Maybe he's a ghost.<eos> All right, hear me out.<eos> maybe santa's a ghost.<eos> Think about it. only kids can see him, he can travel the world in a night, he can whisper to parents what little timmy and sally want for christmas.<eos> You said it yourself at all the kids said that they saw santa.<eos> Yeah, but that's probably because he believes it, and they can feel his energy.
I'll ell you wha you can do, you can ake your official channels, file hem, in riplicae for all I care!<eos> Righ is righ and wrong is wrong, Mr Referee, and in his case, I am righ and you are wrong!<eos> Presenaion o he B Givision champions!<eos> -Well done, sir.<eos> -Well played.<eos> B Givision champions!<eos> We had fans, we had banners, we had logos, we had everyhing.<eos> Spectators were fanatics, you know, they were...<eos> They loved soccer.<eos> They tended now to own the sport itself.
There's a real father, he just doesn't know about it yet.<eos> Given my situation, my higher intelligence is telling me to terminate.<eos> Take it from me - having kids doesn't take much intelligence.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm starting to notice that.<eos> How does Ally feel?<eos> She thinks it's a disaster.<eos> [Sighs] She's the one who wanted the baby in the first place.<eos> I gave up a pregnancy once.<eos> Don't give up a child for someone else - partners, lovers, whatever sex - they come and go.
Do you know what happened?<eos> When I had been working, and I had saved some money,<eos> I went back home and discovered that my parents weren't there anymore.<eos> They had passed away shortly after I came to Bangkok.<eos> What happened?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I don't even know what kind of accident.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> I just know that they're gone.<eos> I did everything I could just to make them happy without knowing that they were already dead.
I won't come around anymore.<eos> I am so sorry, Carlton. Don't be.<eos> I mean it's.<eos> It's totally natural for you to be jealous if your nephews like me more than you.<eos> - Come again?<eos> - I get it.<eos> You're used to being the cool aunt that everyone wants to hang out with.<eos> But when I'm around, you just can't compete with that.<eos> Sometimes I just. I forget to dial down my coolness when I'm around kids.<eos> They're just so impressionable.
You think he killed Mrs. Rodriguez?<eos> It took me over a year to get him inside that dog fighting ring.<eos> I'm reserving judgment.<eos> I did the best that I could.<eos> I'm sure you did, Tommy.<eos> And I told you what they were doing to those dogs and I gave you all the tapes.<eos> It wasn't enough.<eos> We needed to see the dogs fighting; that's the felony.<eos> But they had the fights in different places.<eos> I mean, she never told me where they were,s-So...
But they had the fights in different places.<eos> I mean, she never told me where they were,s-So...<eos> Tommy, did you kill Elizabeth Rodriguez?<eos> I,I could understand if you did.<eos> A whole lot of people that would say she had it coming.<eos> You know, I've been on the streets... in juvie.<eos> I've seen people do some bad things to each other, but those dogs, like...<eos> You can beat their brains in and,<eos> Like, a minute later they come up to you just wagging their tails.<eos> I know, man. That's how they are.
There's smoke —real bad— 105.<eos> Two tower.<eos> It's real bad, it's black, it's arid.<eos> My wife thinks I'm all right.<eos> I called and said I was leaving the building.<eos> I was fine, and then BANG!<eos> Three of us—two broken windows.<eos> Oh God!<eos> "When hostilities commenced in Europe in 1939 it was realized that the American people had no intention of entering the war but they believed that this country could be enticed into the war in very much the same way that it was enticed into the last one<eos> They planned, first, to prepare the United States for foreign war, under the guise of American defense
This is termed a margin call, and the typical result of a margin call is the selling of the stock purchased with the loan.<eos> So, a few months before October of 1929, J. D Rockefeller, Bernard Baruck, and other insiders quietly exited the market, and on October 24th, 1929, the New York financiers who furnished the margin loans started calling them in, in mass.<eos> This sparked an instantaneous massive sell-off in the market, for everyone had to cover their margin loans.<eos> It then triggered mass bank runs for the same reason, in turn collapsing over 16,000 banks, enabling the conspiring international bankers to not only buy up rival banks at a discount, but to also buy up whole corporations at pennies on the dollar.<eos> It was the greatest robbery in American history.<eos> But that didn't stop there.<eos> Rather than expand the money supply to recover from this economic collapse, the Fed actually contracted it, fueling one of the largest depressions in history.<eos> Once again outraged, Congressman Louis McFadden, a long-time opponent of the banking cartels, began bringing impeachment proceedings against the Federal Reserve Board, saying of the crash and depression:<eos> "It was a carefully contrived occurrence.<eos> International bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair, so that they might emerge the rulers of us all."
- Thank you.<eos> Grazie.<eos> - Enjoy Bologna!<eos> There's a reason why we're playing five shows here.<eos> It's because we've had...<eos> We're from Israel, From Tel Aviv... all of us.<eos> Pearl Jam, come to Israel!<eos> Pearl Jam don't play in Finland, so we have to come to Italy.<eos> In Italy, there's a passion that's there after, I guess, you've maybe proven yourself to the people here.<eos> That they're... they're just amazing.
Are you into men?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The tragic incident happened today in front of the state assembly in DŸsseldorf.<eos> The Mandatory Marriage Act got passed today.<eos> It takes effect immediately.<eos> The Federal Ministry for Family Affai...<eos> You dumbed me and now you get to die!<eos> The preliminary hearing for the wife of our reporter is scheduled for tomorrow.<eos> Experts say the increasing tendency to violence in partnerships is to blame for such atrocious crimes as this one.<eos> They expect a downright wave of similar incidents.
Why are you telling me this?<eos> You can talk to my husband.<eos> One person is dead already, and one more could die.<eos> Are insurance agents always this compassionate?<eos> I'm not here as an employee.<eos> Then?<eos> I once lost a family member.<eos> My brother... was always lying in the bed. Cause he was always sick.<eos> My parents took good care of him.<eos> They loved him so much.
Attention everyone!<eos> We, Active Volcano, have our own concert hall now!<eos> Next Saturday will be our opening performance!<eos> - Please come out to Incheon!<eos> - These are free tickets!<eos> You'll be able to come to Active Volcano and Transfiction's performance.<eos> You should've called and told me you were coming.<eos> The kids look awful.<eos> They look as if they don't have a mom.<eos> But they don't have a mom right now.

So, here, having already lifted the hated tax on Hindus,<eos> Akbar begins to embrace all India's religions.<eos> The Sikhs were one of the radical religious groups who'd sprung up out of the interaction of Hinduism and Islam in the 16th century.<eos> Their first guru, Nanak, who died in 1539, asserted,<eos> "There is no Hindu or Muslim, "<eos> and laid stress on the worship of one god and works of charity.<eos> His legacy today is a world faith, singled out by the turban that all men must wear to enter their holy shrines.<eos> And it was Akbar who gifted them land here in Amritsar to built the Golden Temple,<eos> the most famous landmark of Sikhism today.<eos> It would be under the later Moghuls that the Sikhs became a military sect, bearing the symbol still carried by all Sikh men today, what they call the five K's.
the East as the other.<eos> The heroic leader as superman.<eos> The man whose giant ego literally overwhelms the Persian divine king Darius and subdues history itself to his will.<eos> Alexander was a globalist.<eos> Alexander would thoroughly understand the world today.<eos> The thing that unifies all armies is the will of the commander.<eos> Even in a battlefield like this which comprised at that stage maybe 150,000 to 200,000 individuals on this plain at that time, this all came down to a contest of wills between two individuals.<eos> And they both understood that, did they?<eos> Oh, I think they entirely...<eos> And they can see each other, they actually see each other...
This isn't a classical Greek army;<eos> it's close to a science fiction army, an ancient Greek version of "Mad Max".<eos> and in the middle of them, Alexander the Great in his parade uniform with his ram's horn helmet with its great white plumes and on his armor the head of a gorgon, which was supposed to turn to stone anybody<eos> who gazed into its eyes. Well, there was one person here who wasn't turned into stone.<eos> A young Indian had come to Alexander's camp.<eos> He was deeply impressed by this spectacle of imperialism, by the glamour of Alexander's violence.<eos> And he would become one of the greatest figures in Indian history, who would create the greatest Indian empire before modern times.<eos> His name: Chandragupta Maurya.<eos> In time, Chandragupta seized power, drove Alexander's successors out of India and ruled from the Khyber to Bengal, and his state is the first forerunner of today's India.<eos> In 300 B.C., the Greeks sent their ambassadors to him bearing gifts and they give the first ever account of India from the outside.
If he wants to do something, he does it.<eos> It sounds disgusting, but I want to keep my calluses.<eos> It really hurts when they rip off because the skin is so thin.<eos> This is what I do all day long, every time we have a show.<eos> I tape my fingers.<eos> Today, I say... And... And...<eos> Were you sleeping?<eos> Nope.<eos> What matters is...<eos> They're in there for 1 .5 hours.
Heisenberg and Bohr found the boost of confidence to be even more bold.<eos> They realised uncertainty forced them to put paradox right at the very heart of the atom.<eos> Atoms are not just unimaginable.<eos> They're self-contradictory.<eos> They behave both like particles and waves.<eos> And it gets weirder.<eos> When you're not looking at an atom, it behaves like a spread-out wave.<eos> But when you look to see where it is, it behaves like a particle.<eos> This is insane!<eos> First, atoms couldn't be visualised at all, now they change completely in character depending on whether or not you're looking at them.
It looks like both of our subbordinates are quite troublesome.<eos> Don't you agree, you swine?<eos> Still angry are we?<eos> Fine! Call me what you will!<eos> Let's go somewhere else to talk.<eos> Ok, lets.<eos> Really nice save!<eos> Thank you very much!<eos> We already know about the attack on your headquarters, and that it was almost destroyed when the ghouls attacked.<eos> And all your hope lies in a message they left that you have been trying to decipher, but you're unable to.
Go back to your home.<eos> Sun-young always complains to me that I drink every day.<eos> Watch your way back home.<eos> Ba... Bad guys,<eos> They always... ma... make fun of my stuttering.<eos> Do... wha... whatever you guys want to do.<eos> So, tell me about it we were talking about.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you see a ghost, your eyes will meet those of hers.<eos> - That's right. - At that time, Just pretend you haven't seen anything, then they won't be able to see us.
- ( beeps ) - Leanne's voice: Hi, this is Leanne.<eos> Sorry we can't take your call at the moment, but please leave a message - and we'll call you back. - ( hangs up )<eos> Matt, I'd like you to meet Detective Superintendent Barclay, our senior investigating officer.<eos> Busy man.<eos> Good to meet you.<eos> How's Rosie?<eos> The doctors think he gave her something to keep her quiet.<eos> That's why she's so sleepy.<eos> Doing loads of blood tests.<eos> They... they can't be sure whether he... whether he touched her.
God, I hope so, sport.<eos> No, nowadays people have short memories. They?<eos> You and me, kid-- we put our warm bodies On the firing line, And we turned 'em back.<eos> You truly believe that?<eos> You bet i believe it.<eos> Something?<eos> Otherwise what was it all about?<eos> It was about the good guys beating the bad guys...<eos> But we sure screwed up along the way.<eos> Yeah, but we screwed up a lot less than they did,

Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, are at their highest levels in more than 200,000 years.<eos> If the trend does not change, scientists expect the seas to rise two feet or more over the next century.<eos> Island chain, such as the Maldives, will disappear from the map, unless re-reversed to predictions.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> And as of June 2007, 172 nations and other government entities have ratified the treaty.<eos> And if you were wondering how this ties in to putting the Earth's priority above human survival and according to with Pagan beliefs?<eos> Every country's deadline for the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Kyoto Treaty, is in 2012.<eos> And if this wasn't enough, when the Pentagon was damaged in 9/11, they set a goal to have a completely new and improved Pentagon in December of 2012.<eos> So Codex Alimentarius goes into effect at the end of 2009, which gives it three years for the Codex regulations on food to create billions of preventable diseases and deaths.<eos> When citizens of every nation are dying of starvation and diseases and fear for their lives because of global warming and major catastrophes, they will do what the public has been proven to do in times of great peril.
Delicious?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's been a long time since I cooked.<eos> I didn't know it's such a happy thing to cook for someone.<eos> Next time when you feel like having rice cooked by a man, tell me.<eos> The streets we once walked, kisses that used to be so sweet, Eyes which were filled with love, Breaths filled with fragrance,<eos> Whispers of "I love you", I want to forget them all.<eos> The union I was chasing after and anxious nights too,<eos> Turned into cold stares and dry voices, My lost love, my heart which was in pain.<eos> The once heavy memories, they all disappear.
# I don't wanna walk around with you<eos> # I don't wanna walk around with you<eos> # I don't wanna walk around with you<eos> # I don't wanna walk around with you<eos> It was so funny but smart, so mad with determination, and so serious and intense, you know, it was really just... they were great.<eos> Always have been, I mean, I loved them from the first.<eos> Those insanely revved up tempos, the look, the sound, the attitude, without the Ramones, this program probably wouldn't exist.<eos> We're the Ramones, and 'you're a loudmouth baby, you better shut it up'.<eos> The Ramones were proud to be rough and ready.<eos> And that's what I had always hoped, that when kids see the Ramones that they feel that they can go out there and do this too.
Deliver papers?<eos> You feel like not only are you in a minority but you feel like you're in a minority nobody gives a shit about.<eos> # Well a person can work up a mean mean thirst<eos> # After a hard day of nothin' much at all<eos> In the depressed logging town of Aberdeen in Washington St.,<eos> Kurt Cobain was part of that minority.<eos> A high-school dropout from a broken home, Kurt entered a downsize world of dead end jobs in 1985.<eos> He ended up getting a job back at the high school that he had dropped out of.<eos> He was the janitor.<eos> So you can imagine the shame that he must have felt of coming in the halls and seeing kids that were his classmates just months before, and they're going off to college and what he's doing is mopping the floor.
What do they know about partying?<eos> Or anything else?<eos> He runs this place.<eos> You'd set up to play in some town and then here comes the mayor, and a news team, and a reverend.<eos> And here comes the Christians protesting and lighting candles, going like, "Oh my God!<eos> No!<eos> Help our children!"<eos> # I don't care what's inside<eos> # We're not gonna kill you!<eos> We're like four starving vegetarians in a van, so they're ready for this fire-breathing beast, and we're like, "Hi, we're Black Flag.
These are my books, not Scott's.<eos> I'm packing the wrong books.<eos> Honey, take a break.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I can't believe I'm getting divorced.<eos> I never thought this would happen.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> Next year, I won't even have my kids.<eos> You think you should stay with them?<eos> Or is it better they move on?
If you've made the progress you say you have, Your students should be ready to move on.<eos> They might even gain something from more experienced teachers.<eos> You can't teach them.<eos> You don't even like them.<eos> What does that have to do with teaching?<eos> I've been an educator for over 30 years.<eos> I have students that still remain in touch with me.<eos> I know what it is to be loved by a classroom!<eos> You have no idea how many battles I've had Fighting to be a better teacher, And now, what, suddenly I'm incapable of educating your students?<eos> You know, if they move on to our classes and they fail, It'll be because they weren't prepared!
Trying to show me up on your first day?<eos> No.<eos> I fucking hate this job, but it's my job.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I killed a man once.<eos> Smashed his skull on a pier.<eos> Just so you know.<eos> You take the rest.<eos> I'm off for a smoke.<eos> Don't make friends with the chefs, otherwise they'll want favours.
You're being ridiculous.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What were you saying?<eos> If there's any old clothing you could donate,<eos> Some items you may not fit you anymore.<eos> No, I--<eos> I really don't think so.<eos> Then if you care to make a monetary donation, we also accept checks.<eos> All the money we receive goes towards purchasing items for the children.<eos> They have nothing, ma'am.
Now, goodbye forever.<eos> Nice attack, doo-doo heads.<eos> Too bad we have one last trick up our sleeve.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> Remember this, Farnsworth?<eos> Farnsworth?<eos> That's me!<eos> My doomsday device!<eos> So it was the scammers!<eos> They sawed off my hand and stole the doomsday device.
- You know what I saw?<eos> - What did you see?<eos> I saw a bunch of Negroes who thought because they were black that they were better than the other people.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> I thought I was the only one that felt that way, you know.<eos> - No, but you know also what I saw?<eos> - What did you see?<eos> - Some white kids was there, too.<eos> - Talk to me.<eos> And they thought the same thing.
I know I was.<eos> Some of the old-time sheriffs never even wore a gun.<eos> A lot of folks find that hard to believe.<eos> Jim Scarborough never carried one.<eos> That's the younger Jim.<eos> Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one up in Comanche County.<eos> I always liked to hear about the old-timers.<eos> Never missed a chance to do so.<eos> You can't help but compare yourself against the old-timers.<eos> Can't help but wonder how they'd have operated these times.
Yeah, you're sneaking out of my birthday.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> But if it's your birthday party, why don't you hang out with all your buddies?<eos> I mean, everybody seems so excited to see you--<eos> Those people are excited to see me because... I make them money.<eos> Oh. I get 'ya.<eos> All the friends that I had - before Tyler - they're not here.<eos> They don't exist anymore.
- It may imply that...<eos> Absolutely astonishing.<eos> As I was saying...<eos> I'm very disappointed, senator.<eos> Well, as you know, you do owe me a favor or two.<eos> Well, talk to somebody else on your staff.<eos> Maybe they can help you out on this.<eos> Jane?<eos> Are you there?<eos> I saw the lawyers who represent the estate today and they...
- How big do they grow?<eos> - That one was a little one.<eos> But they can grow from 20 to 25 feet long, weigh up to two tons.<eos> There have been stories of bigger ones, but the crocs we're looking at today are just as dangerous.<eos> - Are there many attacks on people?<eos> - Tourists, occasionally.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - That's in poor taste.<eos> Don't worry, ma'am. We're perfectly safe on this boat.<eos> They won't attack anything bigger than they are.
I'm calling from across the street. Who am I speaking with?<eos> It's Sam.<eos> Sam? All right.<eos> Are you in charge?<eos> I guess you could say that.<eos> We heard gunfire.<eos> Are the hostages okay?<eos> Yeah. For the moment.<eos> Sam, can your partners hear me?<eos> Yeah, they can hear you.
Oh, but this is crazy.<eos> I mean, we're trained for hostage negotiations.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Why did they request an agent come up here?<eos> What are you not telling us?<eos> One of the robbers is an undercover agent.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Why aren't they calling?<eos> They're planning.<eos> Just give 'em a few minutes, they'll call back.
Yeah. My brother, Robert, fell in love with her, too.<eos> Then he goes and he gets her pregnant. And he was so happy.<eos> He's a - or he was a - photographer.<eos> He got this really nice shot of Marica once. That's the whore. In front of a bombed out market with some little kids.<eos> In fact it made it into our magazine, and I wrote the accompanying story.<eos> We used to do that sometimes.<eos> Just pretend I'm not here.<eos> Well, long story short... Marica was captured by some soldiers led by Olek Maholevec.<eos> And Olek raped her.<eos> Then he gives her to his men. And they rape her.
He... What if he comes again?<eos> Babu, you are here, aren't you?<eos> Can you Whistle?<eos> Whistle!<eos> Ok. Whistle.<eos> When the lord above gives, He gives by the armful...<eos> Amar-Prem!<eos> What sort of surprise is this?<eos> Babu, What am I supposed to do With these men?<eos> They are... not With me.
You had company.<eos> I saw a man and a woman walking beside you.<eos> That wasn't me, sir.<eos> I'm alone here.<eos> It was you.<eos> Man was lame.<eos> Woman was awfully pretty.<eos> Petite little lady.<eos> Sounds like you describing my folks.<eos> They died.
I got something for you.<eos> How about a hook and bobber?<eos> Thanks for your help today, partner.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Well, you're welcome.<eos> - Night.<eos> We should have dragged that poor boy home for supper too.<eos> Everybody needs somebody, Matthew.<eos> Who are the prophets?<eos> Are they royal born?

Cause she yells at her.<eos> I don't yell.<eos> It's not her fault.<eos> It's the diaper companies.<eos> The new diapers absorb a whole quart.<eos> Kids get used to it.<eos> They don't get it.<eos> Even wet, they feel dry.<eos> See what I mean?<eos> They're shock absorbers.
I wondered who it could be, not someone we knew.<eos> That was the first contact.<eos> You had just arrived.<eos> I remember coming out of the kitchen and staying behind the gate.<eos> You came up and you said nothing.<eos> He just stood there!<eos> I was waiting for him to say what he was doing here.<eos> That was the first contact, the first memory I have.<eos> After that...<eos> René came to meet my parents so they could sign the contract.

It was a pleasure to be together, to do things together.<eos> And it was a pleasure to work with strangers too, people I got to meet through this film.<eos> My sister and I had gone for a walk.<eos> You were waiting at home and you told us,<eos> "The Géhan sisters are going to be Aimée and Victoire Rivière."<eos> That was a real -<eos> We probably didn't let you see it, but... we were over the moon.<eos> It was fantastic!<eos> Plus our parents agreed to let us do it.<eos> They didn't give us much freedom.
Yet both of them would die young, single and without children.<eos> However, a genealogist has revealed that nine years later,<eos> Pierre Marguerin Rivière, the killer's father, in his 50s, would marry a young woman of 23.<eos> And since she soon died too after giving him two children, he made her young sister his third wife.<eos> Four children would be born of this union.<eos> Let's talk about your family.<eos> Old Rivière had three wives.<eos> You live with four men.<eos> Four kind men.<eos> They're very kind to me.

It's a public building.<eos> It's central.<eos> The late officer stayed because it had been military housing but he had no right to stay there.<eos> But the military didn't have any other apartment for him.<eos> And the stubborn old party worker, wouldn't leave because he demanded an equally good apartment, and also central.<eos> In cases like that the job is done on a personal level.<eos> They send lawyers, building agents.<eos> They call themselves anything they like, but really they're just crooks.<eos> And these thugs go after the military man who fought against them in the war.<eos> And after the old communist who has no idea what kind of people they are.

I can say one thing for sure.<eos> He'll live longer in prison, than he will on the street.<eos> Very interesting.<eos> If he gets out now, he won't go to a bar or home, or to relatives.<eos> He has nothing, nobody, understand?<eos> He'll look for the killers.<eos> Also, if we acquit him now, it will automatically trigger an investigation into the unsolved murder.<eos> The men who killed his father will be on guard, and they'll look for the kid.<eos> He'll look for them.<eos> And they'll look for him, but he doesn't know where they are.

The wealth Caesar's Rome!<eos> I do not refuse all the wealth Egypt has to offer.<eos> Remember, Caesar... that Cleopatra's treasure is guarded in resin-sealed cedar coffers... so as to be easily burnt in the event of an emergency.<eos> Venus will triumph over Isis, Caesar!<eos> We are committed to the Ptolemaic dynasty... a dynasty established by Alexander.<eos> Brother and sister in battle?<eos> So, they shall be married.<eos> Then, we shall see the outcome.<eos> Isis is canny, although young.<eos> I think we should be most careful with these eunuchs... counselors and magicians... for they are constantly in the company of Isis... as if they were her crocodiles.
I can't find Ghungroo!<eos> I searched his shop, house and hospital.<eos> And when I call him he doesn't take my call.<eos> I am getting nervous.<eos> Come back immediately!<eos> What are you saying, brother Uday?<eos> Who will look after Sanjana?<eos> Don't worry about Sanjana!<eos> Her friends are with her.<eos> They will look after her.
- Security?<eos> Yes, security.<eos> If someone tries to harm you then they will..<eos> - Lay down their lives!<eos> They used to be in the navy.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because brother, there was a guy.. Actually there are two guys.<eos> They are giving me a lot of trouble.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> They are very big people.
What have you done to me, O darling?<eos> Sanjana weds Rajiv.<eos> Sanjana, I still can't believe the impossible has happened.<eos> But I had full faith in you. That in order to acquire your love you will surely win this battle.<eos> Get up! - Lucky.<eos> Lucky.<eos> - What do you think of yourself!<eos> Lucky, listen..<eos> How dare you straighten up our men, Majnu and Uday!<eos> They were lost a bit..
I mean, they're gonna kill 'em!<eos> Don't you care?<eos> Flash, of course I care.<eos> After all I've done for you... you can't do this one small thing for me?<eos> This one small felony.<eos> Yeah, I know a dog park in Boyle Heights.<eos> Yeah, at least dumping dogs in a dog park... is only a misdemeanor.<eos> Who goes to dog parks?<eos> Dog owners, dog lovers, people who give a shit.<eos> Yeah, but they already have dogs.
Nothing more.<eos> How come you trust me now?<eos> Because the police don't.<eos> You must know more.<eos> Otherwise, you wouldn't be so scared.<eos> Were you a part of it?<eos> - No.<eos> But Mirjani's killers could've thought I was a part of it.<eos> Who were they blackmailing?<eos> I don't know if they started.
... ourextraordinaryability to communicate.<eos> To have very detailed discussions with each other.<eos> So we are fundamentally groups of animals...<eos> ... randomlyscattered throughout the planet...<eos> ... slowlycoalescingin groups...<eos> ... thataremorepowerful,larger.<eos> And very much conditioned by two essential characters:<eos> One is opportunism and the other one is greed.<eos> All the animals and vegetables are opportunistic creatures.<eos> They do what's necessary for them to do in order to survive.
And all of these are simple to understand...<eos> ... canariesinthecoalmine...<eos> ... ofmuchmoresubtleandscary disasters on the horizon.<eos> Seventy countries in the world no longer have any intact or original forests.<eos> Here in the United States, 95 percent of our old growth forests...<eos> ... arealreadygone.<eos> In many cases, the forest will not grow back.<eos> That land is converted to grassland.<eos> But in the case of rain forests, we have seen firsthand...<eos> ... thatwhenthosetreesareremoved, no, they do not come back.
Kidnap<eos> Ransom<eos> Catch - What!<eos> One man will come on Jumera for betting.<eos> You have to set fielding properly.<eos> Oh we have to play Cricket But you said just now that we have to do kidnapping then from where this fielding, balling and batting came One minute... with season or rubber.<eos> Hey. There is a betting counter at Jumera.<eos> Lakhs of dirham are betted. At 6'o clock a man will come there to bet. You have to kidnap him<eos> That... - Just wait let me explain<eos> Moscow will tell our facial characters to those two men and when they will scream and quickly we will identify him.
The one I saw in the forest.<eos> - The one who attacked you?<eos> No, the boy who was convicted of killing Camilla.<eos> It said "C + M" in the cement.<eos> Camilla and Michael!<eos> They were lovers!<eos> He wasn't some stray boy.<eos> - Cecilie, stop all that now.<eos> We ought to talk a little about how you're doing.<eos> The doctors ... they've decided - to move you to a closed ward and ...

He's a cartoonist.<eos> And he's very good at accents and impressions.<eos> My brother's dead.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> My parents are dead too.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> My mum's dead as well.<eos> How did your parents die?<eos> Heart attacks.<eos> Were they too fat?
The new New Testament is sacrilege.<eos> There are a dozen new New Testaments, From Hebrew to Greek to Latin to Tyndale, all the way to King James, all revisionist, and all called revealed truth.<eos> I mean a new New Testament in 100 words.<eos> I can give you the ten commandments in ten words:<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't, don't, don't, Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.<eos> Don't.<eos> The commandments are just modern updates of more ancient laws.<eos> Hammurabi's code.<eos> That's right, they weren't the first, right?
That's the medal they pinned on Jesus to fulfill prophecy.<eos> The crucifixion.<eos> He blocked the pain as he had learned to do in Tibet and India.<eos> He also learned to slow his body processes down to the point where they were undetectable.<eos> They thought he was dead.<eos> So his followers pulled him from the cross, placed him in a cave...<eos> His body normalized as he had trained it to.<eos> He attempted to go away undetected, but some devotees were standing watch.<eos> Tried to explain.<eos> They were ecstatic.
To live or die.<eos> You're early.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Must be a long time since you counted off minutes on watch.<eos> It went quickly.<eos> You play well.<eos> Where did you learn it?<eos> My parents forced me to take piano lessons from age six.<eos> Good investment.<eos> Shitty, as far as they're concerned.
He/she makes people to be cautious.<eos> We go Alex, it is always necessary to be cautious, the books won't be good you for everything.<eos> Not you will be able to stay with the help of bay.<eos> Not I know if I want to depend of more than that.<eos> Where your parents are?<eos> Living their lives in some part.<eos> Your parents love you, you exactly.<eos> That it is exactly?<eos> You taste like what I refer.<eos> They feel love for the money, the fame, the good things...
He/she discovered that the history of love and marriage of our parents, it was calculated to hide a terrible truth.<eos> When they met each other, dad it was already married.<eos> And before Chris was born dad already had another son, of their first Marcia handcuffs.<eos> And they were still legally married.<eos> These facts redefined us as bastard children.<eos> My father's arrogance didn't allow him/her to accept the whole pain that had caused.<eos> And my mother in their shameful situation of lover their accomplice was made.<eos> The fragility of the glass is not a weakness but a resource.<eos> My parents understood that they should manage the glass carefully or it would break.<eos> It passed this way my brother, they didn't seem to know or to care him/her the damage that you/they had caused with their secret actions.
- Rum Frend.<eos> - Alex.<eos> - Alex, of where you are?<eos> - Virginia of the east.<eos> OK Alex from Virginia of the east.<eos> You dilute thermal Oh MY GOD Desert of Anza Lamb.<eos> January 12 of 1992<eos> Good, this is something crazy here.<eos> You don't worry about those marihuaneros nudists of there below.<eos> No, they don't bother anybody.
I suppose that old Bradley here it lasted 20 minutes.<eos> There, I saw police's buzzings to grab all the bodies.<eos> They should not have in when he was seen here.<eos> Their eyes are damaged.<eos> The battle here was biblical.<eos> An Apocalypse in the the devil's same cavern.<eos> Wave after wave I broke up them with the miniarma.<eos> When they finished, we fire rockets, grenades, wave after wave, as a fight in Tyberland.<eos> The on buzzings EDT and party this road.<eos> And they finished everything.
Many units without contact.<eos> We will attempt another I contact in some time.<eos> Grade 5...<eos> We have our orders.<eos> That it is the point main, there are some meters.<eos> If we remove this position, the buzzings are already.<eos> The coordinates are positive.<eos> The pilots of the helicopters they should be had crusader.<eos> The buzzings are besides DMV.<eos> They are in great number.
The blue areas represent population's excess, crime and unemployment.<eos> The red areas are communities desirous to God of low crime rate.<eos> Now, observe in this form, as the belt enlarged demographic sample what spent in the past 20 years.<eos> America in crisis.<eos> Our laws and politics doesn't work.<eos> Our parents, érase once the best, it is the bank of the self-destruction.<eos> That is bad, unthinkable, I know that you agree.<eos> This is the soldier buzzing.<eos> He forms the dorsal thorn of the one army of police of the buzzings.<eos> They are "cacetetes", scale of the justice.
Their friend.<eos> And he/she should help here.<eos> Thank You, Laura.<eos> Hello, people, my name is Friar Dully.<eos> I am generally in the section of news in the afternoon, but today...<eos> Police propaganda of the buzzings.<eos> He/she finds that the key to finish with is this to see these old sections of news?<eos> Every day we stay more old men slowly, while they are more intelligent.<eos> The buzzings need of human.<eos> They were never self-sufficient.
It is bigger than us two.<eos> It is the development of the artificial intelligence.<eos> The understanding of the justice.<eos> She warns to the buzzings, Tallis.<eos> Who are you?<eos> She didn't have to die this way.<eos> Disable the buzzings.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Not we command the buzzings.<eos> They command us.

Well, I thought it was, you know, horrible.<eos> I mean, it simultaneously destroyed two musical cultures in under a minute.<eos> We have to tell her.<eos> No, no. I don't think we do.<eos> Honestly, if she wants to dance, let her dance.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Wait. I'm sorry. I don't understand.<eos> Your heroes, the Beatles, Smokey, they would never let this happen.<eos> That's a completely different thing.<eos> They were geniuses.

Or if you need somewhere to read in the afternoons.<eos> I just want you to know that there is a place that you can come without having to explain yourself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is an honor.<eos> Well here's to the completion of many months of hard work.<eos> Oh, I should remind you it's just a draft and I plan on doing a lot more work on it.<eos> Don't worry so much.<eos> If you really want to continue with literary criticism I could lend you some books by the great critics of my era.<eos> I'd appreciate that.<eos> I doubt that they're taught in academies anymore but that's really all to their credit, because they weren't theorists. They were readers.
(Malevoice) Oh, right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh..huh.<eos> The timing again.<eos> Hey, buddy, I think I've heard that one before.<eos> yöu should be happy I didn't do it today.<eos> 'Cause if I did, who'd be here to feed yöu, huh?<eos> Hey, who cares about food, as long as those goddamn bastards die, right?<eos> Huh?<eos> They die.
I feel a little bit lost without her.<eos> Well, if yöu... need any help filling in the gaps, I can try.<eos> yöu wouldn't mind?<eos> It might help with my thinking.<eos> All right, then.<eos> I guess yöu could take this over, hah.<eos> It's my wife's latest attempt to get published.<eos> We need 50 copies of that by tomorrow to send out.<eos> Oh, and um, when yöu finish with that, could yöu pick up these suits at Armine's?<eos> They, um... close at three.
You had no intention of letting these guys out of here!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> "If it ain't broke, don't fix it. " Right?<eos> In fact, that reminds me of something a friend once said.<eos> "Breaking" into a bank is what screws you... because "breaking in" takes time and time is what gets you caught.<eos> So how do you rob a bank without "breaking in?" Unlock everything at once? Fast and efficient?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you knew enough to get these codes... and what to do with... then you knew this vault door would seal up as soon as an alarm was tripped.<eos> You're trapped.<eos> So, while the codes seem like a good idea, they're nothing more than bait... just means to some other end for you.
Sinners and fornicators!<eos> We are not here in anger!<eos> We are here to save you from eternal damnation!<eos> Hey, buddy!<eos> Wait, come on already!<eos> This is a private event.<eos> Now, give it a rest.<eos> Aren't you worried about where you'll spend eternity?<eos> This is what these guys do on a Saturday night?<eos> They just want everyone to be as miserable as they are.
My back is giving out.<eos> Don't focus on the pain.<eos> Look at the love that Janine's giving you right now.<eos> And if that doesn't work, think about potato skins.<eos> God, I love potato skins.<eos> A husband will do anything for appetizers.<eos> Yes.<eos> Everybody, I want to introduce you to two new members.<eos> This is Ben and Sadie.<eos> They're getting married in three weeks.
Gotta be controlled by who?<eos> I set a price that I think is fair.<eos> -I don't think it's fair.<eos> -You don't?<eos> -I don't think it's fair. -I think it's fair.<eos> I mean, I know your customers are happy, Frank, bunch of fucking junkies that they are.<eos> But we fellow dairy farmers out here, Frank, are you thinking of us?<eos> You thinking of them?<eos> -The dairy farmers? -Yeah.<eos> I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about as much as they've ever thought about me.
That was the last house.<eos> -This is foolishness.<eos> I can understand why you do this, but an old man like me...<eos> Let's go home.<eos> -There's one more place.<eos> Hold on. Show me that.<eos> I made a horse like this when the boys were young.<eos> What boys?<eos> I had two boys, Hermanni and Henrik. And a wife, Marget. She died when the boys were about your age.<eos> Then they went to sea and left me all alone - because I had become like this.
Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> You already know our mayor.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Krzeminski.<eos> We're ready then.<eos> We can start.<eos> The prisoners feared the selections the most.<eos> Right here, where you're standing,<eos> On this roll call area The SS medics used to decide In a matter of seconds On life and death.<eos> I saw the bored faces of the doctors Quite often. They felt uncomfortable,
Great, we have skydiving after lunch!<eos> Aw, I thought we were going bungee jumping!<eos> And, apparently, love is blind.<eos> Wow, does he have to wear the Speedo?<eos> Oh my God, I think I just threw up in my mouth.<eos> After Sarge won his lawsuit against the city, he reconnected with Lai Mei's mama-san, Phat Ho. I just love saying that.<eos> Anyhow, they started a very successful dry-cleaning business.<eos> I get all my shirts done there.<eos> Oh, that's sweet. And that's kinky.<eos> And my BFFs Neil and Bob? Well, they're enjoying some quality time at Bayside's very own country club.
- Some thugs tried to break in here.<eos> I fought them out.<eos> Before that happened one of them cut me.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.<eos> Did you catch them?<eos> No, it was just some crackhead trying to get some stuff.<eos> Yeah, I'm getting too old for this, man.<eos> I'm tired of it.<eos> They win!
This temple...<eos> Was their feeding ground.<eos> Feeding ground?<eos> His wife is the demon.<eos> It is fortunate this demon gets along with humans.<eos> However, they need feed their children.<eos> My guess is that wife took on the form of a priest, and... Just wait for parents who abandon their child and food will come by itself.<eos> Then...<eos> The abandoned kids are...<eos> They were all taken inside this hole...
Who will clear their honor after they died to keep me alive? !<eos> Tell me, old man!<eos> I will slay...<eos> Every single last one of you!<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Does the blood and flesh you regained hurt?<eos> Pitiful child...<eos> Abandoned by parents, loathed by the world.<eos> Yet you still continue to live with one hope:<eos> Even if your parents abandoned you, once you get back your body, you thought they would embrace you.
What do you want from me?<eos> - I want my family out of the camps to live with me, then we can discuss it.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Heil Hitler.<eos> Good day.<eos> That isn't what we had in mind with the Final Solution.<eos> What will Reichsminister Himmler say about this?<eos> Please let us in on your secret plan, Reichsminister.<eos> Don't we have the world's best actors and directors?<eos> And they're Aryan:
-There is an attendant, but we go at night.<eos> And also, I heard that for 400 shekels, the attendant might take a small nap.<eos> I'll bring the tea.<eos> Your mother, did she ever take you to a mikveh?<eos> Once. When I was 8 years old.<eos> Because I insisted on it.<eos> I have to comb you, to remove any tangles.<eos> Do you have a brush?<eos> My children,... ..they don't want to see me.<eos> They hate me.
"By sending their children to learn in the synagogue,... ..and their husbands to study in the schools of the rabbis."<eos> What does this mean, exactly?<eos> How does a woman earn a place in the next world?<eos> We know how a man earns his place through studies of the Torah,... ..and observance of the mitzvahs.<eos> Why are women exempt from this?<eos> It may be that women...<eos> I am very sorry,...<eos> This morning I spoke with my father. He had told my aunt and uncle that I was here.<eos> And they were hurt that I hadn't come to visit them.<eos> So we agreed that they will pick me up here,... ..and I'll stay with them for the rest of the holiday. I am sorry for leaving so abrubtly.
And in the ground, peace is found.<eos> You get it now!<eos> You're with me!<eos> Loyalty...<eos> That's fucking loyalty!<eos> Loyalty.<eos> Fake...<eos> Loyalty.<eos> I betrayed my brothers...<eos> They held me to the ground...
I once had Hepatitis B. Can I donate?<eos> No!<eos> Your blood's not clean.<eos> They said it was fine...<eos> Those guys?<eos> They take any blood.<eos> They don't care what kind of disease you have.<eos> So why do you keep coming back?<eos> My blood is clean. Why shouldn't I come?<eos> Besides, they give money.
What?<eos> I can't!<eos> I'll teach you.<eos> For our next act...<eos> Ventriloquists, let's have a warm welcome.<eos> Everyone have a nice shower, get nice and clean.<eos> We'll be in touch with the authorities in your hometowns.<eos> We'll give you a free bus ticket home.<eos> Those of you who bring your children with you.<eos> They are so young and they shouldn't linger on the street aimlessly, they should be in school.
And I smile and say, Oh, yes he was.<eos> He left Congress twenty times wealthier than when he entered.<eos> What does that tell you?<eos> He was a crook.<eos> A fraud.<eos> He was deeply shame to me.<eos> But he's dead now.<eos> Don't judge the dead.<eos> Why not?<eos> They judge us each and every day.
... Butwhatdo theysay ,inharmony.<eos> Another dream vacation with Rishabh is about to end.<eos> At least your dreams are fulfilled.<eos> And what about your dreams, what about your dream man.<eos> Whenever my friends would ask me, I would say...<eos> ... Iwantaman who has a sense of humour...<eos> ... whowouldhaveapure heart,soft.<eos> Who would care for me and for others too.<eos> A pure heart, a good man.<eos> And they would laugh.
- Sissie, I...<eos> Hey. Hello, Pluto.<eos> Our guest, Mr. Fordham, has been wondering where you've been.<eos> Oh, sir...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sir. - I was detained... by...<eos> I-<eos> I was detained by admirers.<eos> Lovers of literature.<eos> They insisted on a toast--
In this room, writing.<eos> We were here yesterday, Mr. Poe, when the complaint was first made.<eos> You didn't answer your door, nor did you appear to be home.<eos> Oh. Of course.<eos> Uh, sergeant, I felt the need to... imbibe some inspiration.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Thirsty work.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I wonder why my neighbors did not ask me about the disturbance themselves.<eos> They're quite afraid of you, Mr. Poe.
#Leave your worries on the doorstep.#<eos> # Just direct your feet on the sunny side of the street. #<eos> # I used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade. #<eos> # Now I'm not afraid. #<eos> #This rover crossed over.#<eos> # If I never had a cent, I'd be rich as Rockefeller. #<eos> #Gold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street.#<eos> He's only gonna get worse.<eos> At the hospital, I would gather a room full of ailing memories and the loved ones whom they'd forgotten, and I would sing.<eos> And for a few hours or sometimes only a few moments, they'd remember.
No, I had a meeting that went kind of late.<eos> Oh, these meetings, boy, you can really work up an appetite with those meetings, huh?<eos> Oh! How is your family?<eos> Oh, that lovely wife of yours, what's her name?<eos> Jen.<eos> Those adorable kids, what are their names again?<eos> Patrick and Anna.<eos> Whatever. Do they know the kind of pressure that you are under?<eos> Yeah, of course, yeah, they do, thanks, Monica.<eos> Yeah. Well, it's good to know that they know.
No, I don't do that.<eos> That's a no.<eos> - It's like singing in the shower.<eos> - I don't do that.<eos> Come on, virgins first.<eos> Why would you tell him that?<eos> Think I'm missing something.<eos> - Where are you going? - To let the dog out.<eos> Who let the dogs out?<eos> They're still going.
Who let the dogs out?<eos> They're still going.<eos> Take your time.<eos> Go again if you want.<eos> Mars?<eos> Mars?<eos> Oh, come on, where are you?<eos> Oh, there you are!<eos> What're you doing, lad?<eos> They're still singing.
Have you lost your mind?<eos> That's against the rules!<eos> How can I dodge a side attack?<eos> I'm not here to play a duel.<eos> I will not suffer Mr. Tartuffe in my home.<eos> Please leave us alone.<eos> You think it's for my pleasure that I shelter and feed this man?<eos> Who's forcing you?<eos> Need I explain that these holy men form a powerful secret party?<eos> Their influence extends far beyond the Church and for anyone involved in certain affairs it's best they owe you favors.
Here's the problem with the well.<eos> It's dry.<eos> That's right, boys!<eos> Can't hate number 8!<eos> They love it!<eos> Hey, where'd you get all those extra nails?<eos> I just pulled them out of that old shed.<eos> Everett!<eos> You know, we're doing a lot of good.<eos> They could really use these medical supplies.
- Harry?<eos> - It's all right, Esther.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> There is a story about the Greek gods.<eos> They were bored, so they invented human beings, but they were still bored, so they invented love.<eos> Then they weren't bored any longer, so they decided to try love for themselves.
Yes Mister, already rescribed the contract with the new stipulations.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - You the control for fax.<eos> Did you make the changes that I told you?<eos> If, I included the increase of the 4 % in the 10 extra millions.<eos> No, no, it is not it is this way the one 4% of the 10 millions.<eos> No, that was what you/they told me.<eos> - Who did tell you that?<eos> - The lawyers...<eos> They are some idiots, and not I understand its lack of communication.
Hard to know.<eos> More than the ones you run across, that's for sure.<eos> What are they?<eos> Just like you and me, brother, except uglier, and a lot stronger.<eos> Hey, I hit one of them young'uns once in my pickup.<eos> He popped up and just kept going.<eos> It's the chemicals changed them.<eos> Pulp mill shut down near 30 years ago, and left a mess, and the poison killed off all the game.<eos> Most of the folks around these parts left.<eos> There's one family stayed on in this holier, and pretty soon their babies started gushing out of their mama's womb, just as ugly as them trout I got hanging out there, and then they grow up, have kids of their own, turned out even worse.
A guy brings out the garbage, idiotic neighbour at the fence says:<eos> "Are you bringing out the garbage?"<eos> Yes, I'm bringing out the garbage.<eos> I have another question, Yella.<eos> Another deal where I need someone to accompany me.<eos> Phillip, this is Klaus.<eos> I have your documents right here.<eos> Honestly, 27% is a bit thin.<eos> We were planning on more...<eos> Klaus, they'll be in the black by the 3rd quarter, for sure.
Nae ifs, nae buts.<eos> Tits on the top, I'll tell you, ladies.<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> I don't know.<eos> And let's take cloning.<eos> See, with cloning now, right?<eos> Men are gonna be completely useless.<eos> Nobody'll need men.<eos> Won't need us.<eos> I keep telling my mates. And they don't even see it coming.
E15.<eos> All right, see you soon.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> What the fuck was that about?<eos> What the fuck do you think you're doing, Anj?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I'm gonna get our workers in.<eos> Are you completely fucking mad?<eos> They're gonna get out.
Listen.<eos> I want you to get him to get in touch with me. Will you do that?<eos> Listen to me very carefully.<eos> Can you pack your bags and get out?<eos> Straight away. Are you understanding?<eos> Can you go now?<eos> Go on.<eos> Go now, all right?<eos> (Angie ) Guys, come on.<eos> - They don't understand you.
Well. you shouldn't cry over spilt milk. right?<eos> You're really nice.<eos> You do what you can.<eos> I really am sorry.<eos> I'm very clumsy. you know?<eos> I think I have two left hands.<eos> - Then you're the man for carrying eggs.<eos> - Yes. you could say that.<eos> So. what are we going to do now?<eos> Well. we have a lot of steak. but we might be expecting guests and they definitely eat eggs for breakfast.
So his friends came over to accompany me in case I was bored.<eos> But in fact he's getting them to keep watch on me.<eos> I had an excuse to escape because you called.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't mind going out alone when I'm free.<eos> My husband isn't interested in the things I like.<eos> What do you like?<eos> Watching movies. He doesn't want to go so I go alone.<eos> He's always talking business with those friends of his.<eos> They're not interested in the movies at all.
Let's go.<eos> Do you really have a driver's license?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I just haven't been driving for a while.<eos> You're certainly giving me new things to fear.<eos> Have you told anyone I'm your teacher?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> - At the university it might.<eos> What did you parents say?<eos> - They were pretty shocked.
Back then, a press kit was done before the collection was finished.<eos> They did a kit for the couture and got it wrong three times.<eos> Chanel's artistic director, Eric Pfrunder, said,<eos> "If you're going to be difficult, do it yourself."<eos> So I hired an assistant, rented a camera, and we did it ourselves.<eos> 6 months later we did the editorial, the catalogue and adverts.<eos> I loved photography but didn't think I could do it.<eos> As it turned out...<eos> I wasn't so bad.<eos> What I like about photographs is that they capture a moment that's gone forever, impossible to reproduce.
You, me, well I will cancel the show.<eos> Cancel it - after one show?<eos> Well, I don't decide that.<eos> The ratings were simply a catastrophe. - l saw the fucking rating, And I know, it could have been better<eos> But it's me! You should know, that with my experience,<eos> I'll get this going yeah?<eos> - Rainer, Please.<eos> You've been in this long enough.<eos> Our viewers are just An opportunistic mob.<eos> They don't want to feel small, Because they don't read good books.

None of this makes any sense to you, does it?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Why are you so heavy-burdened, child?<eos> If you tell me what ails you, perhaps I can help.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If the Sin Eater can't cure me, then no one can.<eos> Sin Eater?<eos> And who might that be?<eos> He's the one chosen from among us who lives all by himself on Dead Man's Mountain.<eos> After a person has passed, he takes our sins upon himself, so that they can rest in peace.
The box.<eos> Let's get out of the fucking box, guys.<eos> This is reality.<eos> Every week these guys pick someone to give them a car.<eos> And they give the cops the plate number and the coordinates.<eos> This guy races around like crazy all around Moscow.<eos> And if they do it for 35 minutes without getting caught, the car's his.
She doesn't have a ton to do in the pilot.<eos> There's so much to set it up.<eos> That's one of the challenges of the premise pilot.<eos> - But the network still likes the show.<eos> - Roger is your biggest cheerleader.<eos> Okay, how about above Roger?<eos> Roger's calling the shots on this.<eos> But we all know that Roger consults with the "higher powers."<eos> - That is true.<eos> - They tell him what to do.

I staggered.<eos> I staggered.<eos> At times I staggered.<eos> And at times I walked straight.<eos> At times I staggered.<eos> And at times I walked straight.<eos> I drank day and night.<eos> Drunkards have drunk it.<eos> It's not their fault.<eos> They drink to their heart's content.
And at times I walked straight.<eos> I think he was hanged upside down for a long time.<eos> He didn't jump.<eos> He has been pushed, sir.<eos> This is not a suicide, sir.<eos> I want to know who has done this!<eos> Tell your informers to become alert!<eos> Sir!<eos> Informers!<eos> They are policemen's third ear.
Look.<eos> Kent and Skip are up.<eos> Come on up there.<eos> I need to see this.<eos> But when he got older, be alert and set up his own ice cream parlor.<eos> Something happened to the daughter of Parsons ... huh?<eos> No.<eos> Instead, you know?<eos> When Buster was put on makeup and fake nose was like If you create a character, and people respected him.<eos> He was friends with the kids and they him.
It was my fault.<eos> It was I who did it.<eos> What about now?<eos> Now żVirgil dresses as a clown and enchanting flute playing?<eos> It may not be Virg<eos> - Oh, wait a second.<eos> - Anyway, I need to find him.<eos> Honey, you're going crazy.<eos> Look, I do not know what is happening.<eos> What we do know is that If you watch children at all times, they wander around.
He accuses me of being the reason their independence was lost.<eos> Does Prince Mahin not understand that none of this is because of you but because of King Chakkraphat's stubbornness and that of the lords who support a war against Hongsa?<eos> They love their elephants more than their kingdom.<eos> Prince Mahin blames me.<eos> That is why he deceived King Chaiyachettha, King of Ian Chang, into sending his army to attack Phitsanulok.<eos> King Chakkraphat has broken his word.<eos> He has become an enemy of Hongsawadee.<eos> We must not forget this.<eos> Our allies will gather seven armies from the north.<eos> They will secure all necessary provisions and in the 12th month, we will attack Ayutthaya.
- D. - Freedom or Death!<eos> - F.<eos> - O.<eos> - D. - Freedom or Death!<eos> Say, how are your mom and her two husbands?<eos> So when the first husband will travel... the other goes to my house.<eos> She is married same with the two?<eos> I know there, each is behaving like my father... even if it is not.<eos> however, are so busy in the room with her... that has no time to fight me.<eos> But they are all the time in the room?
Again?<eos> - Where is the papa?<eos> - In the bathroom... is there for 20 minutes.<eos> God was looking after you.<eos> Here, take off the shoes.<eos> I spread your toys.<eos> Pretend that you are here some time ago.<eos> - Where were you?<eos> - With my friends.<eos> They were here looking for you.
You will be under watch by next month... and will be forbiden from having any contact with this British soldier.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> That closed our session.<eos> You is a terrible traitor.<eos> The worst traitor is that that approaches the enemy.<eos> I do believe that you were telling the truth.<eos> But after what I have seen...<eos> I trust no human being.<eos> On Montag, you have friends... on Freitag, they become our enemies.
Nothing is better anymore.<eos> I hate the school.<eos> Do you like I have the conversation with Mr. Gihon?<eos> My God, no.<eos> It make things worse.<eos> Besides, he hates me as much as the rest.<eos> They do not hate you, Proffy.<eos> They are making the scapegoat.<eos> Sometimes, children need someone to criticize.<eos> They hate me because of Sergeant Dunlop.
Ignore that, you get prostate cancer.<eos> Half of all men in Canada.<eos> I never heard that.<eos> 20 years of marriage is to the prostate what 2 packs a day are to lungs.<eos> Any scientific proof?<eos> Statistically. Japanese and Korean men are the most active sexually.<eos> They have the lowest rate of prostate cancer.<eos> Our genius doctors claim it's because they eat sushi.<eos> It was 5 a.m.<eos> They burst in.
Kill you?<eos> Had enough chances.<eos> I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.<eos> What kind of asshole'd think up a thing like this?<eos> Not bad with a poodle shooter and a makeshift silencer, huh?<eos> Help me toss these boys in the water?<eos> You set me up and you used me as bait!<eos> You think?<eos> Flushed them out, didn't it?<eos> I was kind of hoping to keep one alive, but they were kind of determined to kill you.
Seems I heard about a shot like that being made not too long ago.<eos> Said the guy's name was Bob Lee Swagger.<eos> Never met the man, so I wouldn't know him. Never met the man, so I wouldn't know him.<eos> Yeah, they said that, all right.<eos> They also said that artificial sweeteners were safe, and WMDs were in Iraq, and Anna Nicole married for love!<eos> Would've been a bad job to take, though.<eos> How come?<eos> Whoever took that shot's probably dead now.<eos> That's how a conspiracy works.<eos> Them boys on the grassy knoll, they were dead within three hours.
I'm the weight on your chest.<eos> I'm your cauchemar, your pesadilla your Alptraum, your incubo, yo.<eos> I'm the morbid oppression of the night.<eos> I am the fear behind your left titty.<eos> I am the dark un-fucking-known.<eos> I'm the father of cool, and the king of jazz and the porch-sitting, watermelon-sucking brother who fucks up neighborhoods and breeds gangsters and makes your dick feel small.<eos> I am mud hut-building, spear-chucking darkest Africa.<eos> I am the king of Egypt.<eos> Grandpappy of all the sand niggas.<eos> The lord of they, them and all them that be other.
Ok, Dr. Albert will be here in a minute to set you up.<eos> Set me up?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Thomas... don't let me wake up paralyzed.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> Is these really your hospital?<eos> Yea, pretty much.<eos> Might wanna do something about the pea soup.<eos> By the morning of his surgery, the cancer had spread so far... throughout Edwards body, that the doctors only gave him a 5% chance to survive.<eos> But then, they didn't account for how pissed off, they've made him.
- Why don't you answer your phone?<eos> - It's broken.<eos> Please don't be sad.<eos> My children can't be sad.<eos> Then I get sad.<eos> Oh, well, I don't remember your apartment looking like this.<eos> I remember it as being much bigger.<eos> Oh, honey, he'll be back soon.<eos> Men want to prove that they are independent even though they aren't.<eos> They like to take off for a while so that you get worried.
He's so doped up, I could be anyone.<eos> I'm sure there'll be time.<eos> Yeah, well, you haven't seen him, have you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I suppose not.<eos> The kids are here.<eos> Do you want to talk to them?<eos> No, not just now, eh?<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause they want to talk to you.
I don't know...<eos> Things, your father, the situation.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I just thought it might help.<eos> All right then, let's talk about my father.<eos> You first, off you go.<eos> You know, Blake, I know that you're going through a lot.<eos> That is no excuse for being a complete bastard.<eos> And the balls.<eos> They get trapped.
Are you kiddin' me?<eos> It's men's greatest challenge.<eos> Tish is the scorpion queen.<eos> See ya tonight!<eos> Damn!<eos> Well? Another comrade used and discarded. Huh, Tish?<eos> You know, I gotta be honest with you, Tish...<eos> I've never been really comfortable watching you do that to men.<eos> I mean there should be some sort of... like... warning sign posted.<eos> If men are that easy to manipulate, they deserve to be taken advantage of.
I'm not lndian..<eos> You're Pakistani.. same thing.<eos> If you say one more word against Pakistanis..<eos> Why would I say anything against Pakistanis..?<eos> Even my best friend..<eos> ..my girlfriend is a Pakistani.<eos> Good.. otherwise all the neighbours will come out..<eos> ..and forced you to marry me.<eos> So let them. I'm not scared.<eos> Before they can force me I'll marry you myself.
Flag comes down, daddy comes first and Rusty goes bust.<eos> Do you want to see my scar?<eos> Other people shy away from showing their scars but Champ shows it off proudly. Because papa has told him that this scar is the trophy of our victory.<eos> Papa races regularly now. And Mamma has completed her degree.<eos> Every week we go for mama's concert on one day and papa's race on another.<eos> Champ and I don't have to skip lunch any more and we didn't leave our school either.<eos> But I don't know why Mamma and Papa still say that we're poor.<eos> I don't mind, I've started saving out habit now.<eos> We don't live in Cabbie Alley anymore. But we go there every week-end to meet all our friends.<eos> Sometimes they come over to our house.
Where the hell did you disappear to?<eos> Your girlfriend and her buddies piled into their car and took off.<eos> You didn't come out, so I followed them.<eos> Did you ever think that I could have been in trouble,<eos> - that I could have used your help?<eos> - No.<eos> Yeah, well, I got mugged by a couple of homeless guys!<eos> And they wanted your shoe?<eos> So?<eos> So, they dropped one of the guys off at some little store on Pico, Woodsman Bob's.
He was just a baby when his mother was killed.<eos> In fact, he wasn't even there.<eos> Summer of '86 was hot and dry.<eos> There were a lot of fires.<eos> The lions were all going hungry.<eos> I remember some of them came right into town looking for food.<eos> Crocker killed Zoe and dumped her body in the hills.<eos> He didn't know about the lions.<eos> That just happened.<eos> They ate the evidence and covered his tracks.
Well, are you just popping in on your way home?<eos> Yes. Cup of tea?<eos> My favourite one of her.<eos> Mine, too.<eos> And I like... I like that one, the two of you together.<eos> God, was I ever that young?<eos> (LAUGHS) How are the children?<eos> Well, don't they write to you, phone occasionally?<eos> They're 23 and 25 years old, Jim, of course they don't.<eos> Yes, well, last time I heard, they were fine.
Her whole family does it.<eos> Just my parents.<eos> Well, that's very free thinking of them.<eos> Yeah, old hippies, Summer of Love.<eos> Every time that we have communal sex, it strengthens our love.<eos> It's so refreshing.<eos> They're very open about sex.<eos> Clearly.<eos> I mean, talkative.<eos> They're the ones who suggested your seminar.
We've always been connected.<eos> We've always wanted the same.<eos> Tinle, please don't die.<eos> Let him go.<eos> He's going to join my father in Padmasambhava's paradise.<eos> I've learned so much.<eos> From you, my father Tinle, my brother Lhakpa... From you, my nephew Pasang of you, Pema... and from you, Karma.<eos> This fresco is for you.<eos> It's finished.<eos> It tells a story.
0ut!<eos> Even the clothes we're wearing, lrineu? Everything.<eos> Everything of the slightest value.<eos> Even our wedding rings.<eos> I'll pay everything, everyone, down to the last penny!<eos> Viscount, the men from the auction are already here.<eos> Tell them I'm just coming.<eos> Your wedding ring, May.<eos> My wedding ring won't come off.<eos> I know we must hand over everything, lrineu. But it is already a part of me.
Don't worry, he'll be back.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> He'll come back, I know, he promised.<eos> And he seems to be a man of his word.<eos> The White House just called.<eos> The President wants your final report on Andros.<eos> Final report?<eos> The man's vanished from the face of the earth... that's about the only final report I can make.<eos> The General's right.<eos> How do we know it's a final report if we can't find a trace of Andros?
Oh, it's a pity.<eos> But you were so weak during your pregnancy.<eos> Everybody knew that.<eos> And you would insist... on havin' that baby right here at home.<eos> But I did my best.<eos> You know I did.<eos> Of course, you won't remember it that way, will you?<eos> You'll tell them all sorts of things about me, make up stories.<eos> You know, it's very dangerous to take more than Just a drop of thisl<eos> I want you to know that Jackson and I will raise the baby the way it deserves.
No, but obviously, each generation of Warren witches has added to it over the years and has made it so.<eos> Have you added anything?<eos> Us?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> We're new at this.<eos> We can't just make up our own spell...<eos> Wait, can we?<eos> All things in time, Phoebe.<eos> The book will grow as you grow.<eos> And sometimes you add to it, sometimes it teaches you.
I'm getting a look at what a sadistic ass you'd be if you ever got any real power.<eos> And I'm seeing what a miserable loser you can be.<eos> Seen Kung Lao?<eos> Not since he stomped off.<eos> I wonder what's eating him.<eos> He's been spending a lot of time in Jen's old room lately.<eos> I know.<eos> It's like he can't let go.<eos> Sometimes you never get over that kind of loss.<eos> Or you think it's healing and something brings the pain right back.
Why don't you sit down for a while?<eos> That thing is the Destroyer!<eos> And that means that the girl in the other room is not Gabrielle.<eos> It's Hope!<eos> You're hurt worse than ya know.<eos> Of course that's Gabrielle.<eos> You shut up and you listen to me!<eos> I wanted to believe it too, 'cause she is good But she's not Gabrielle.<eos> How do you know?<eos> The monster... She was directly in its path and it blew by her not once, several times.
Oh, no.<eos> For many years I was a moderately-successful merchant.<eos> Making a decent living.<eos> One day I had a disagreement with a competitor.<eos> I had to... eliminate him as a rival.<eos> -Well, you would.<eos> -Unbeknownst to me my competitor had a younger brother.<eos> Rather than face me like a man, he took his vengeance by stealing from me.<eos> Cleaned me out, but... in so doing, he taught me a lesson.<eos> The world belongs to those who make it their own.
The barn owl detects them by the rustling sounds they make.<eos> To do that, it has extremely acute hearing, the sounds being focused by the hair-like feathers of the discs on either side of its head.<eos> But if it is to hear them it has to fly very quietly indeed, and its wings are fitted with silencers.<eos> Fluffy margins to its wing feathers.<eos> So, in the evenings, a barn owl can waft over the countryside as silent as a moth.<eos> This little dot, suspended in the sky, might seem to be the slowest flyer of all.<eos> It's a kestrel It's not, in fact, truly stationary.<eos> It's facing into a gentle wind, so there is a current of air passing over its wings.<eos> And that gives it all the lift it requires.<eos> Silence is not as important for the kestrel as it is for the barn owl, for it hunts by sight.
There you go, Skipper.<eos> That's it. No more.<eos> You find your own food.<eos> I was now making daily excursions away from the shoreline.<eos> Penetrating further and further into the interior of my domain.<eos> I knew only that we'd been sailing some miles from the coast of Guinea. And I had in mind the possibility that my soil was connected to mainland... where I may happen upon some human civilization.<eos> I'm on an Island.<eos> In order to keep watch daily for the first ship that would pass... I resolved to situate myself as near the coast as possible.<eos> The weeks turned to months, and still no sighting of a ship.<eos> But I truly believed it must come to pass.
I don't understand.<eos> Why'd he do it?<eos> He's been with us for years.<eos> - Well, he may not have had a choice.<eos> - How so?<eos> The skin of this thing is covered with microfibers that dig into the skin... and hook into the neural system.<eos> The whole thing... is built like a series of synaptic relays with a symbiotic...<eos> English, doc.<eos> This entity... can cut into the neural pathways and override them.<eos> Now, some of the microfibers are fresh... so my guess is that its control over a given host... grows as it does.
- We have lift-off.<eos> - Quite an extraordinary sight.<eos> There it goes.<eos> My shuttle launch.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Evening, Superman.<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> If you'll just install my pulse converter on its orbiting platform you can take a little R and R, fly to Mazatlán with your girl get a little sun and leave running the planet to me.<eos> But once that shuttle reaches the platform, all deals are off.<eos> I've instructed my man to do away with Lois Lane and that girl if it gets there before you do.
I was making a simple lane change.<eos> I put on the blinker, and it took off on me.<eos> And the next thing you know, I was submerged.<eos> I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.<eos> You are such an idiot.<eos> Well, we got to get the car cleaned up for my parents.<eos> Do whatever you want. lt's your car.<eos> My car?<eos> You drove it into the swamp.<eos> It drove itself into the swamp.
Could I have a moment, sir?<eos> It's 0100 hours, Ensign.<eos> Don't you have the early shift this morning?<eos> Yes, sir, but this is important.<eos> Very well.<eos> First of all, I want to apologize for my behavior yesterday.<eos> Apology accepted.<eos> I understand that this is a difficult situation for you.<eos> I'd like to suggest a plan.<eos> It's something a lot of people have helped to develop.
There was a delay on the shuttle from Washington.<eos> You had business there?<eos> Yes.<eos> You may have already heard.<eos> We've heard you acted on your own and moved the salvaged UFO to another location.<eos> These new attempts to recover it have increased our need for security.<eos> Who else is looking for it?<eos> In the event, I moved it as a safeguard.<eos> Somebody better damn well find out how the French even knew where to look for it.<eos> I can assure you it'll be inaccessible now.
And yours?<eos> Alex Cardo.<eos> See you later.<eos> She said earlier, Alex.<eos> She can say what you want.<eos> We are here for the money.<eos> This is too big for him.<eos> He will not hold a curl.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Steal it is suicide.
Lothar. And now, my young heroes, listen carefully to me.<eos> From this day forward, you no longer have a mother, a father, or a family.<eos> From now on, you belong to the Führer.<eos> You have been given to him.<eos> We're most proud to add you to our ranks.<eos> Welcome, Lothar.<eos> It's the famous Krupp 88.<eos> It's almost a shame that there are no planes to fire them at.<eos> A tank is deaf and half-blind.<eos> You can hear it, but it can't hear you.
"In my heart, I am a star."<eos> "Bigger than a guitar."<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. Do you have a cigarette?<eos> No I quit.<eos> - Hey, you said you did a video?<eos> - Yup.<eos> What's it about?<eos> It's really not about anything.<eos> Oh. Well, what's it on?
But this couldn't have happened, not in this amount of time.<eos> What year is this?<eos> This is the last year... and the last day and the last hour of your life.<eos> Seventeen years since you began your great crusade.<eos> Seventeen-<eos> I am tired.<eos> Take him back to his cell.<eos> Sheridan, make your peace with whatever gods you worship.<eos> You will meet them next time I send for you.<eos> I cannot recall my world from what it has become... but I can thank you properly for your role in it.
-You have a problem with this?<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Saw Chloe wandering around the halls today.<eos> She was so calm I hardly recognized her.<eos> Thanks, Mark.<eos> Sorry, that was stupid.<eos> They're moving to Texas.<eos> Ronnie will dig for oil, and she'll have his baby.<eos> Assuming it is his baby.

I doubt it, though. I'll let you know.<eos> Of course, take your time.<eos> I'll be here.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Excellent.<eos> How come you eat your peas one at a time?<eos> Well, what's the hurry?<eos> Who is it?
No, I never use them.<eos> Don't trust them.<eos> -What do you do?<eos> -I have a mental alarm.<eos> I set my head for quarter to 7 and... I get up.<eos> -lt always works?<eos> -lt never fails.<eos> See, it's based on your body clock.<eos> Your body has an internal mechanism.<eos> It knows what time it is.
Don't tell me you don't know, you smug son of a...<eos> There are limits to my knowledge.<eos> - I don't have time for convenient ignorance.<eos> - What were you gonna do?<eos> Shoot me?<eos> Just like the men that shot your sister?<eos> - You wanna know what's on that train, who killed your sister?<eos> You find out what they put in your neck.<eos> - The implant.<eos> - It holds more than I could ever tell you.
It's nice to be praised and admired.<eos> I couldn't help but like it.<eos> Of course not!<eos> I only care what you think of yourself.<eos> If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative... I fear that someday you might find yourself... believing that's all that you really are.<eos> Time erodes all such beauty, but what it cannot diminish... is the wonderful workings of your mind.<eos> Your humor, your kindness... and your moral courage.<eos> These are the things I cherish so in you.<eos> I so wish I could give my girls a more just world.<eos> I know you'll make it a better place.
Yes.<eos> Do you know, Mr Greville, the state of monarchy and the state of lunacy share a frontier?<eos> Some of my lunatics fancy themselves kings.<eos> He... is the king.<eos> Where shall his fancy take refuge?<eos> We do not use the word lunatic, sir, in relation to His Majesty.<eos> Well, who's to say what's normal in a king?<eos> Deferred to, agreed with, acquiesced in.<eos> Who can flourish on such a daily diet of compliance?<eos> To be curbed... stood up to... in a word, thwarted exercises the character, elasticates the spirit, makes it more pliant.

Oh, boy, I'm sure glad I didn't have anything to eat.<eos> - Fifty?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - The big Five-O.<eos> - Yeah, well, congratulations, chief.<eos> Well, thanks, son.<eos> One more thing.<eos> I think I like you a lot better without the hairpiece.<eos> Alice says it turns her on.<eos> Says it makes me look like a young Dan Rather.
I forgot to ignite these.<eos> Without them we would have passed it badly to return.<eos> He knows where we go?<eos> Go, I thought that we looked for the sign of its companion.<eos> Hope, seems that there are two pairs of signs here.<eos> Good, it will not think that his companion is here first.<eos> They do not say the Butcher to him by nothing.<eos> Then, her wife said that she creates that the Butcher he is extraterrestrial.<eos> That is ridiculous.<eos> In fact, the Butcher he works for the extraterrestrial ones but it is not one of them.
What is it?<eos> Is it the world?<eos> Or is it God?<eos> Wittgenstein has been taken prisoner.<eos> Oh, how fascinating!<eos> "I am a prisoner of war in Monte Cassino under the Italians.<eos> I hope we shall see each other after the war.<eos> Being shot at many times has altered the way I think about philosophy. So has Tolstoy's Gospel In Brief.<eos> I have written a book called Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.<eos> It combines logical symbolism with religious mysticism.
White, hairless and smooth, hairless being the most important.<eos> Pubic hairshatters all this, so he shaves them.<eos> If you don't slow down, I'll grab the wheel.<eos> There are men who are victims, Fitz, and you're one ofthem.<eos> Right?<eos> Why the hair?<eos> At school he was probably either the first or the last to grow it himself.<eos> I would guess the first.<eos> This is where his neurosis comes from.<eos> He saw it grow in himself and not in others and thought it was God's punishment.
You own this place, right?<eos> That's it.<eos> And Do-jo down there.<eos> I never knew because it helped me, MacLeod. But now I know.<eos> You are one of those rich white, with excess of guilt, which help poor blacks.<eos> What do you want, Carl?<eos> I came to pay the injury I have caused to the car.<eos> I'll bring the rest as soon as possible.<eos> The car is not mine.<eos> Hey, is it. Right here.
I want to discuss just why you insist on languishing in Gotham City... as some lowly secretary.<eos> Lowly assistant.<eos> Selina, about that Christmas getaway we planned... I'll be going alone.<eos> Dr. Shaw says I need to be my own person, not an appendage.<eos> Some appendage!<eos> The party never stops on Selina Kyle's answering machine.<eos> Guess I should've let him win that last racquetball game.<eos> Hello, Selina Kyle.<eos> We're calling to tell you about exciting new Gotham Lady perfume.<eos> It makes women feel like women and the men have no complaints, either.
He'll be here the minute he's off.<eos> In the meantime, she keeps asking for you.<eos> Lesley, I'm sorry.<eos> They did it, Dr Chase.<eos> They did it.<eos> They took my baby.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> They went inside me and took my baby.<eos> It's not fair!<eos> It was mine.
Were you one of these men?<eos> Most of those men would be dead now.<eos> As I said, it was a long time ago.<eos> The problem was that the men in this group couldn't find an answer.<eos> They knew there was something out there, no doubt about that, something quite extraordinary.<eos> But as to the who, why, what, where... well, they struck out.<eos> They struck out good.<eos> Would you like a cigar, Doctor?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> So the President who had formed this group made a decision to hide its existence, to make it an ongoing Black Project.
Please... A hotel...<eos> Margita, look who's back.<eos> Does she still pray?<eos> She can't die until she prays away our sins.<eos> She'll be here. at least a hundred years.<eos> I {Old myself that I'd find my fortune.<eos> And look how I ended up.<eos> Men are only happy when they long for something and don't have it.<eos> We were sick from poverty, fear of life.<eos> We wanted to put the universe in motion and it moved.
People don't want anything near them, even if it's something they believe in, something they think society needs like prisons.<eos> Everybody wants that, right?<eos> Everybody wants more prisons.<eos> That's the new answer to all of our problems, lock a lot of motherfuckers up.<eos> Everybody wants more prisons. They say build more prisons but not here.<eos> Well, why not?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's the problem?<eos> What's wrong with having a prison in your neighborhood?<eos> It would seem to me like it would make it a pretty crime free area, don't you think?
I'll be in my office.<eos> "In dreams begin responsibility."<eos> So wrote the poet.<eos> So it is perhaps.<eos> Could it be that we take our dreams too lightly?<eos> Those... images from places unknown. Could they, in fact, be angels in flight, our souls aloft?<eos> You know, recent experiences have made yours truly... take another pass through the metaphysical thickets, and... as unlikely as it may sound in this rational age, I emerged on the side of those that cannot help but put their faith... in that which cannot be easily explained.<eos> Be open to your dreams, people.<eos> Embrace that distant shore. 'Cause our mortal journey is over all too soon.<eos> "The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, "the solemn temples, the great globe itself, "yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve...
Look, we... We had a little misunderstanding.<eos> And it's all over now.<eos> We got what we wanted.<eos> We are about to collect.<eos> Yes, gentlemen and lady, now we can collect.<eos> Well, that's just what I said.<eos> I got an idea, Kid.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> If it's OK with you, the first thing I ought to do is the car.<eos> Into the yard, I can have it scrapped in one hour.
Adolf Hitler begins the final decisions of his life.<eos> To prevent a last treachery by the duplicitous Hlmmler, he will have the cyanide capsules left for him by the Relchsfuhrer tested on his faithful dog Blondle.<eos> Then, shortly after midnight, he formally marries his mistress Eva Braun.<eos> Later that night, as he retires to his quarters to dictate his last will and testament,<eos> Adolf Hitler will state.<eos> My wife and I choose to die in order to escape the shame of overthrow or capitulation.<eos> Moreover... We do not wish to fall into the hands of an enemy who requires a news spectacle organized by the Jews for the amusement of the hysterical masses.<eos> Therefore... lt is my wish--our wish-- to be...burnt... immediately on the spot where l have performed the greater part of my daily work in the service of my people.<eos> It will be 4 a.m. before the supreme warlord finishes his political statement.<eos> It rambles from one subject to another.
When I... Ducks?<eos> It's ducks and geese, not pigs and dogs.<eos> Ducks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you sure it's...<eos> it's not pigs and dogs? They scurry too.<eos> Hey, you should take your makeup off with cold cream.<eos> And use that stuff there for the sticky stuff for your mustache.<eos> How do you know so much about the theater?<eos> Hey, it got me outta the orphanage.
Now...<eos> "Inked Ravens of Despair "Claw Holes in the Arse of the World's Mind."<eos> I mean, what kind of a title for a poem is that?<eos> –It's my title, sir.<eos> –"Arse of the World's Mind"?<eos> I mean, what does that mean?<eos> Are you unhappy about something?<eos> I think that's what the poem explores.<eos> Explores?<eos> Oh, it explores, does it?
But the hospital discharged him.<eos> Please, Mrs. Henry. Dr. Grasse is Ambassador Abetz' personal physician.<eos> I'm perfectly fine.<eos> There's no reason I can't travel.<eos> Professor, you are a responsibility of my government.<eos> My car is ready.<eos> Professor.<eos> Our papers are in order.<eos> We will not get off this train.<eos> It will not leave until you do.
I want your strength.<eos> Westerburg does not need mushy togetherness, it needs a strong leader.<eos> Heather Chandler was that leader but...<eos> But she couldn't handle it.<eos> I think you can.<eos> Moby Dick is dunked.<eos> The white whale drank some bad plankton and splashed through a coffee table and now it's your turn to take the helm.<eos> What about the photographs?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> I'll ask you to do me a favor and it'll be one you'll enjoy.
- Yes.<eos> Himemberg Golberg and Al Cooper also.<eos> This face is optimum! , Now, free time will be had.<eos> - I can teach to you, I am not difficult.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I am saying, it goes for Brave Company 1, will be in my squad.<eos> - A moment, you not to have this face...<eos> - Why?<eos> .<eos> It is a protestant of the war.
- What it was that happened?<eos> - It led a patrol he is the first time that we come across in them with this.<eos> Of what he is speaking?<eos> They are sending periodic patrols?<eos> Yes we send patrols to give some blows.<eos> It is not easy to command the men who leave to die.<eos> For, this I find that the lieutenant decided to lead the patrol he himself.<eos> You find who this you would be an easy subject.<eos> He is. he sees that face there?<eos> It is the Tran, the exploring "Kit Carson".
The other day I burst into tears at a sign that said,<eos> "Pipers and Mufflers."<eos> I don't know why but it sounded so nostalgic.<eos> "Pipers and Mufflers."<eos> Suddenly the whole thing seems crazy... us breaking up.<eos> I still keep to my side of the bed.<eos> As if you were coming home late.<eos> It's just as if you'd died.<eos> I feel so lonely I nearly bought a dog the other day.<eos> But I didn't. I was scared it wouldn't like me.
Oh, my God!<eos> Amy, can't you tell me a little about...?<eos> Amy?<eos> Amy?<eos> Amy?<eos> Amy, are you there?<eos> Am...<eos> Mac? You okay?<eos> The past is a strange country.<eos> You go back. But it doesn't recognize you.
Greet the monk Theodore Dox.<eos> May God bless you, Father Theodore!<eos> I bring greetings from the brother Naum.<eos> Is safe and sound.<eos> Wore long without coming.<eos> Come and see how our literary work.<eos> Welcome Sit.<eos> This place belongs to a master.<eos> The most honorable for the people.<eos> It does not feel nor Caesar, nor prince or sovereign.
And after tea Fοrtescue left the rοοm first?<eos> Yes.<eos> Lance left first.<eos> I gather he went up tο see Miss Ηendersοn. Ηis Aunt.<eos> I heard Mrs Percival leave almοst immediately.<eos> Sο Mrs Fοrtescue was left alοne?<eos> Presumably.<eos> And the man in the garden?<eos> Well I assumed that must have been Lance Fοrtescue.<eos> Nο, nο it cοuldn't have been.
Looking so fierce...<eos> What are you doing to this poor little boy? !<eos> Are you alright, Shuhei-kun?<eos> Oh, are you his mom?<eos> Mom?<eos> Your son just stole 1000 yen from me.<eos> Sis?<eos> Chihiro-san!<eos> Stay away from him!<eos> It's my little brother!
Elizabeth, we've known each other for too long not to keep it simple.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> Oh, Devon, you know better than that.<eos> When Sigmund Freud lay dying, his students all gathered about him and they asked if there was one question his work had not answered.<eos> And he replied,<eos> "What a woman really wants. "<eos> Well, there's no need to be coy.<eos> Well, there's certainly no need to rush.<eos> The future is still the future.<eos> It will reveal itself when it chooses.
Of course - you're the beggar man, I didn't know you with no wagon.<eos> I'm the coroner, not a policeman.<eos> Now this dead one, Crown, you knew him by sight, didn't you?<eos> You'd know him if you saw him again?<eos> Yes, boss, seems like I remember him, when he used to come 'round' here long time ago.<eos> But I ain' care none' bout seein' him.<eos> Well, you've got to see him anyway.<eos> Come along.<eos> You needn't be afraid.<eos> All you've got to do is to view the body as a witness, and tell us who it is.
Try me first.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - l didn't say anything.<eos> The sound came from over by that statue of Hera. From that shield!<eos> Turn me around!<eos> Perseus!<eos> Perseus, Perseus.<eos> Mark me, Perseus.<eos> These weapons are gifts from the gods.<eos> Guard well this shield for one day it will guard your life.
- The army must be a drag at times.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> But I couldn't do anything else.<eos> And you?<eos> Same for me.<eos> But is doing nothing a real goal in life?<eos> Not always.<eos> Does it excuse us?<eos> Can you excuse a pole for filling a hole?<eos> It may squash some rabbits, but is it the pole's fault if it fits that hole?
They don't say there's no dog... they say they didn't notice it.<eos> It's underlined.<eos> Belmont, come here.<eos> What's all this mess?<eos> They don't say the dog wasn't there... they just say they didn't notice it.<eos> Isn't that the same? No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> They say they didn't notice... That could mean it was there... or it wasn't, right?<eos> Sorry, but... does it matter?<eos> If the dog was there, it should have found the body.
To do what?<eos> The gun.<eos> We still have to prove the gun.<eos> The length of the stock determines his reach, and that in turn suggests an approximate height.<eos> He's probably around six feet tall.<eos> Snipers usually scale heights, so he's probably fit and average weight for his height, say a hundred fifty-five pound.<eos> The curve there could mean he's left handed, but that's all conjecture.<eos> He could turn out to be a short, fat, right-handed orang-utan.<eos> What we do know is the rifle is a one-off, made to measure.<eos> And that means the man who intends using it knows what it's all about.
Second:<eos> Acceptance of delegates elected by the majority.<eos> And third:<eos> No retaliation for what happened. Agreed?<eos> Let's vote by hand. Let's see.<eos> Brother, we need you.<eos> Let's now sing the true school anthem.<eos> Hurray!<eos> The school is indeed beautiful... as seen from an airplane.<eos> How beautiful it would look after dropping a bomb and flatten it all out.
I work as a pathologist.<eos> And over the past 20 years, I've compiled a library of the many faces of death.<eos> My travels have taken me all over the world, searching for the various situations that have dealt with our ultimate end.<eos> I've seen with my own eyes a myriad of experiences that have led me to greater awareness of the living.<eos> We have developed a world that refuses to recognize our own destiny.<eos> Many years ago, I was plagued with a recurring dream.<eos> There were only two faces that I could recognize - a young woman and a priest.<eos> Everything was quiet and the funeral seemed endless.<eos> I had no reason for this dream.<eos> It had resembled nothing I had ever experienced within my lifetime, just the constant images of death, existing within a silence that would not respond to my questions.
